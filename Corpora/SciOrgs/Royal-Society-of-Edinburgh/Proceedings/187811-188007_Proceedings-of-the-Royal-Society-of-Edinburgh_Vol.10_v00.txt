           Kelland, the President,
      Professor                                                read the following                Intro
ductory Address :—
     In   taking my place this evening,                I   might reasonably he expected
to say much about my unworthiness to                          fill   the post, and the             kind
ness of my friends               in placing   mo here.          All   that     I   can trust myself
to say     is,   that  I   feel too deeply everything                that can be imagined of
this kind to venture on giving                    it   words.         To bo the successor             of
such      men     as    the Duke of Argyll, Sir Robert Christison, and Sir
Wm. Thomson,               is   an honour which the most                ambitious man might
covet, and the most                self-conceited      deem himself             scarce worthy of.
To myself that honour               has come neither to gratify ambition                         nor to
administer to self-conceit.                  It   has descended          on me        all unsought
through the kindness of the many friends who have                                  sat with me for
          in this room, and the only emotion                               awakens              that of
                                                                                        it is
years                                                                 it
affection    and gratitude.            Just   a   month has elapsed since                       became
apparent         to me that     I   should bo called upon to address you to-night.
That such woidd be the                case   had not       till then    crossed       my thoughts.
I    had made no preparation for the address.                         The first month of             the
University         session      left me the very smallest               amount of time and
strength for the work                   You will,          therefore,      pardon       an      address
rather feebler in character              than     is   fitted to the occasion.               Happily,
the    kindness of friends has aided me very materially in the pre
paration of the obituary notices.                   Mr Milne Home               has placed at my
disposal documents, both in print and in MS., relative to Sir Richard
Griffith — the latter, unfortunately, arrived                    late on Saturday evening,
when   I    had completed my brief sketch of Sir Richard, but                                I     hope
it    may be allowed me                to avail        myself        of these       documents in
preparing         the sketch for the press.                   Sir Robert Christison                 has
kindly furnished             remembrances           of Hugh Scott of Gala and Sir
James Coxe, of which                I    have availed myself               ;    and   Mr Gordon,
through Professor Balfour, has furnished me with sundry published
obituary notices.          I     have to add        that the notice of Fries            is      entirely
due to Professor Balfour, that of Regnault                            to Professors          Tait and
Crum Brown, that of Claude Bernard to Professor Rutherford, that
of    Mr Cunningham               to Professor         Duns, and that of Harkness                     to
Professor Geikie.               The notice of Martyn Roberts               is   due to his family.

the many contributions         he has made to the knowledge of the struc
ture   of recent and fossil     fishes.
    Among our Foreign Honorary Fellows, Henri Victor Regnault
deservedly held a foremost              place,  especially   as  an experimental
philosopher,      alike in chemistry and in physics.              Bom    at Aix-la-
 Chapelle,    July   21st 1811, he came to Paris in his early youth             with
 the sole object of obtaining a livelihood.           While    engaged as a shop
 man in a bazaar, he made such good use of his scanty leisure                   as to
 qualify himself for admission            to the £cole Poll/technique (1830).
 In 1832 he      became a pupil      in the £cole    des Mines.       Thereafter he
 was    for sometime a Professor in Lyons          ;  but, in 1840, returned to
  Paris, having been elected a Member of the Academy of Sciences
  in consequence of important investigations in Organic Chemistry.
  He     became,   in  1847,   Ingenieur-enrchef of the second           class,   and
  Professor of Chemistry in the £cole Poll/technique, and of Physics
  in the   College de France, and was made Director               of the Imperial
   Porcelain Manufactory at Sevres in 1854.
      Begnault's first published chemical work was on the action of
   potash on the oil of the Dutch chemists (1835). His discovery of the
   bodies now known as chloride, bromide, and iodide of vinyl had a
   very important bearing on the development of the radical theory,
   and his speculations      on the relations of these substances       to aldehyde
   brought about a temporary agreement in opinion               as to the   constitu
   tion of acetic     acid and analogous        substances     between    Borzelius,
   Liebig, and Dumas.
      In   1838   and 1839,       Begnault published        investigations on the
   action of chlorine on the oil of Dutch chemists and on hydrochloric
   ether.    He   stated,   in  a very precise     form, a view as to the per
   sistency of molecular arrangement,            which (along with the views

   the "Substitution Theory," over which Berzelius and the French
   chemists had a long and bitter controversy.             The two investigations

theoretical importance.
    Rcgnault's investigations of specific       heat  of metals     reduced  the
number of apparent exceptions to the law of Dulong and Petit, and
induced him to propose (in 1840-41, and again in 1849) the change
in the atomic weights of silver and of the alkali metals, which "was
afterwards strongly advocated          by Cannizaro, and is now generally
 adopted.
    In physical work Regnault         was distinguished     rather for extreme
 skill in manipulation and patient study of details          (especially  in the
 investigation of necessary corrections) than for brilliance or novelty
 in discovery. Ho was an admirable experimenter, and may bo said
 to have done almost       as  much good to science by training a school
 of skilled    experimenters    as   by his own extended researches.         He
 devoted    himself specially to the accurate determination of physical
 constants,   such as latent and specific heats, to the laws of expansion
 of gases and vapours, to the determination of the densities of gases,
 and specially to the accurate measurement         of  temperature.
    His   greatest   work, forming Volume        XXI.    of the Memoires de
 VAcademie des Sciences, was undertaken for the French                   Govern
 ment, and contains most         elaborate   experimental determinations       of
 the various physical data required for investigations          of the   working
 of steam engines.      Besides numerous other chemical and physical
 papers (a complete     list of which will   be found   in the Royal Society's
 catalogue of scientific papers), Regnault       published, in four volumes,
an "Elementary        Course of Chemistry,"       which has been long and
deservedly successful
    The death, during the siege of Paris, of his only son, who was
rapidly advancing to high distinction           as a painter,   seems to have
 clouded his later years, and he died on January 19, 1878, at the
age of 67.
    Claude Bernard. — By           the  recent  death    of Claude      Bernard,
 France has lost her greatest physiologist, and this Society one of the
most distinguished of its Foreign Associates.
    Bernard was born in 1814, at St Julien in France; he studied
 medicine in Paris, became assistant to Magendie, resolved to devote

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                             7
 his  life to Hie pursuit of physiology, and at the age of 40 he was
 appointed to a chair of physiology, specially created for him hy the
 Faculty of Sciences of Paris.
    The services which he rendered             to physiology and medicine are
go   eminently distinguished, that his name must he ranked with
those of Harvey and Haller, of Bichat and Muller, of Magendie and
Charles       Bell.    Bichat   and Magendie were his countrymen, and it
was    by the brilliant teaching and example of Magendie that                 he was
inspired, and induced to             offer  his genius and his labour to the
cause    of physiological      science.
    The great influence of Magendie's teaching over                the young mind
of Bernard was due to the circumstance, that as                     a teacher  of an
experimental         science   he did not content himself with the delivery
 of mere didactic discourses,          but sought, as far as lay in his power,
 to experimentally         demonstrate     the truth of what he stated, and the
 several       steps  by which that truth had been               ascertained.    The
 truths of physiological science thus received a living power which
 no mere words could give, and the evolution of Bernard as a
 physiologist       was one of its results.
     One of his great discoveries had reference to the liver, an organ
  whose function      — although it is imperfectly comprehended            even now
  — was     greatly elucidated by his researches.            Previous   to his time,
  it was     supposed     that the secretion of bile was the only function of
  this   organ ; Bernard, however, made            the remarkable discovery that
  the liver also      produces glycogen — a starch-like         substance   which is
  converted      into grape-sugar as it passes from the liver into the blood.
  This discovery greatly        advanced     our conceptions of the nature of
  the chemical processes that take place in the animal organism,                  for
  it was previously supposed          that starch and sugar are produced by
  the tissues of plants only.
     With regard to the sugar-forming function of the liver, Bernard
  also discovered that by        injuring   a certain part of the medulla oblon
   gata  of   a rabbit, the sugar-forming function          of the liver is greatly
  exaggerated.        The excess of sugar poured into the blood is excreted
  by the kidneys, and thus the disease known                   as diabetes  is artifi
  cially    induced.        Probably    no discovery       ever  produced a more
  startling effect on the medical world          ;  for this simple experiment on
  a rabbit afforded the first rational         explanation of a disease that is

s                    Proceedings of        the Royal Society
far from being rare in the human subject,                 and which had com
pletely baffled      the   skill of physicians to furnish any reasonable
theory as to its causes.
    Another of his great discoveries          had reference to the influence of
the nervous system          over the bloodvessels.         He showed that the
bloodvessels      are influenced       by two sets of nerves      — one    causing
diminution of their calibre by exciting their muscular fibres to con
traction, the other giving rise to dilation of the vessels.
    This discovery offered for the first time the true explanation of
changes in the calibre of the bloodvessels occurring in the various
bodily organs during their states of rest and activity ; and which
are commonly observed           in  the face   in the conditions of blushing
and pallor.       The whole question of the innervation             of the blood
vessels is one of great difficulty, which in many of its details even
now baffles the investigator         ; yet although Bernard      did not   at  first
fully   grasp the significance      of some of his experiments,       he neverthe
less   gave   the   key    to  all   the   subsequent    observations   ; and the
accuracy     of   not one of       his experiments     has ever been gainsaid.
 His   observations    were   exact, although his interpretations were          not
in every    case   entirely correct.
    Another of his great investigations had reference to the function
 of the pancreas.        By    an elaborate     research,  he   proved that the
fluid which this important organ pours into the alimentary canal
 powerfully affects the fatty elements           of the food, converting them
 into an emulsion, and partly saponifying them, so that they may
 be readily absorbed       by the lacteals.
    Another important research had reference to the effects of carbonic
 oxide and curara.         He   showed    that carbonic oxide produces        suffo
 cation by combining with the blood-pigment, and thus rendering
 that substance unable to discharge its normal function of conveying
 oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.
    With    regard to the     Indian arrow poison — curara,        he proved that
 it produces    a  paralysis of motion by acting on the terminations of
 the  motor nerves        in the    muscles.     The method of physiological
 analysis by which he proved this is a model for all researches of a
 similar nature.
    The importance of Bernard's researches             on these poisonous sub
 stances   lay in the circumstance          that they were conducted from a

                      of Edinburgh ,     Session 1878-79.                       9
physiological      point of view   ; and they may be said to have been
the first    to convince the     leaders   of medical thought, that a true
knowledge       of the actions of poisonous and medicinal           agents   can
only be arrived at by a thorough investigation of their effects on
the   animal organism in a state of health, combined with observations
of their effects in diseased conditions.         A wide stream of research
already flows from this conviction, and practical medicine is con
stantly deriving increasing benefit therefrom.
    In addition       to these —his greatest    works — Bernard also made
important observations        on the functions     of the fifth, seventh, and
eightb    cranial    nerves ; on recurrent sensibility ; on the secretion      of
the salivary, gastric, and intestinal juices        ; on the temperature       of
the blood in the right and left sides of the heart            ; on the gases of
 the blood and their variations as the blood circulates through organs
 in a state of    rest as compared   with  a state of activity ; on the modi
 fications in the secretions of the stomach and intestinal          canal after
 removal of the kidneys       ; and on the production of albuminuria          by
 lesions of the nervous system.
     Bernard was adored       by his pupils, not only because of his great
  ness as an investigator and as a teacher, but also on account          of the
  enthusiasm with which he inspired them, and the unceasing                spirit
  of affection and     encouragement   which he ever manifested towards
  them.     Happily for physiology and for medicine, he gave no coun
  tenance to that sentiment which would             deter  from performing a
  painful experiment on an animal, for the purpose of eventually saving
  pain and saving life both of man and of animals ; while it is silent
   with regard to the vast amount of suffering inflicted         on animals for
  purposes    that are frivolous and unnecessary.
      Those who knew        Bernard   best can aver that he was a man of
  kindly disposition, who lived a blameless life, and devoted himself
   faithfully and only too earnestly to the advancement of medical
  science,  — almost    to the very day of his death, on the 10th day of
   February last.
      He deserved well of his country, for       he had done as much as the
   greatest of his predecessors,   and the most renowned of his contem
   poraries, to keep her in the foremost       rank of science    ; and Franco
   was not slow to recognise the greatness       and the unselfish character
   of the  service he had rendered    to her, as  well  as to science ; for her
      VOL. X.                                                          B

10                Proceedings     of the Royal Society
deputies unanimously awarded to him the pomp and ceremony of               a
State funeral, thus magnifying his name and his example.
   He   was worthy of the exceptional honour which          France paid to
his memory,     and his name      and his work     will last while medical
science endures.
   Happily for France, his mantle has worthily fallen on Brown-
Sequard, Paul Bert, Vulpian, Marey, and Moreau, who have already
amply proved themselves       worthy of so great a master.
   We   have to record the death of another Honorary         Fellow of the
Society — Elias Magnus Fries,        a distinguished Professor of Botany
in the University of Upsala, in Sweden.           He was born at Smaland
in August    1794, and died at Upsala on the 8th of February 1878.
His father  was pastor at Femsjo, and was fond of botanical pursuits.
Even at an early period of life young Fries accompanied           his father
on botanical rambles.       During   one of them he picked a very showy
species  of Hydnum, which seems to have turned his mind to the
study of Agarics and other fungi.
   Fries was one of the great promoters of Scandinavian science.
His works    embraced    all departments of botany, but his attention
was specially directed to Lichens and Fungi.         His early studies were
prosecuted at a school in Wexio.         In   1811  he became a pupil at
the  University of Lund,     where he studied under Schwartz, Agardh,
and Retzius.      In  1814 he was chosen      Docent of Botany.      At this
time he published his first work, entitled      " Novitiae Florae Suecicae."
In 1847 he was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Sweden,
and in 1851 he became Professor of Botany in the University               of
Upsala, vacant by the resignation of Wahlenberg.             This chair he
continued to occupy until within a few years of his death.               He
continued to publish works in the Scandinavian language, specially
 on Mycology     and Lichenology,      up to 1874.      The state of Fries'
health did not permit him to join the great celebration of the 400th
anniversary of the University of Upsala in September 1877.               He
presented   some of his    foreign botanical friends with copies of his
photograph on the occasion.        His  son is now Professor of      Botany
at Upsala.     In  the  Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers
 there  are enumerated      eighty-five separate   publications   by Fries,
 extending from the year 1816 to the year 1874.

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1878-79.                      11
     Axgzlo Secchi was born at Beggio on the 29th June 1818, and
 received his early education in the schools of the Jesuit Fathers.
 He at the outset distinguished himself in mathematics and physics,
and for a time lectured on those subjects in the Collegio Bomano.
In 1844 he     commenced     his theological studies.    Three years later,
on the     Revolution of 1847, he was obliged to take refuge in Eng
land, and was ordained priest at the College of Stoneyhurst.             From
thence he passed to America, and was made Professor of Physics in
Georgetown College, where, however, he remained only a very short
time.      The death,  in 1848,  in London, of Father Francesco di Vico,
Director of the Observatory and Professor of Astronomy in                   the
Collegio Bomano, brought Secchi back from America as his suc
cessor.      Here he laboured for thirty years in accumulating and
publishing observations, astronomical and         meteorological,  for which
the Papal Government, aided by private liberality, furnished him
 with excellent instruments and       an ample personal staff.     His   astro
 nomical observations were published in three vols. 4to, extending
 from    1851 to 1856.     So far  as I know, they came down no further.
     Secchi, though an excellent observer and a man of great power, was
 of  a discursive turn of mind.       He had little power of concentration,
 and appears      early to have tired of the monotony of astronomical
 observations, and to have turned his attention to the more popular
 studies of terrestrial magnetism       and solar physics.     His attention
 to the latter subject had probably been aroused             by his having
  assisted  Professor Henry,     when in America,      in making     the   first
  experiments on the heat radiated by different portions of the sun's
  disc, by means    of the thermo-electric pile. His interest in spectro
  scopy dates   from Janssen's first visit to Bome, and he turned it to
  good   account,  having published, in 1847 and 1848, spectroscopic
  observations on more than three hundred stars.         The same subject
  is treated in a volume entitled " The Stars," published first about
  the time of his death, which will, it is believed, prove to be a work
  of  great  importance, and likely to procure for its author a lasting
  reputation.
     In   1871  there was formed a Society, calling itself the Society
  degli Spettroscopisti    Italiani,   two  of  the principal     workers     in
  which were Secchi at Bome and Tacchini             at Palermo.      Thanks
  to the liberal supply of funds by the Government, the two observa

12                        Proceedings            of the Royal Society
tories of Palermo and Rome were enabled to carry on a daily series
of combined observations,                      principally on the sun.           The results          of
these observations and of the other labours of this Society are                                 pub
lished periodically at Palermo, and have already reached the seventh
volume.         Secchi photographed the eclipse                        of 1860 in Spain, and
observed       that of 1870 in Sicily.
     In   1862 Secchi commenced                     a   monthly series in 4to, entitled the
Bullctino       Meteorologieo,            consisting of daily observations, meteoro-
logic and magnetic, made both at the college and at various places                                    in
the neighbourhood of Pome, as well as of observations made on                                        the
sun's     spots.         This collection, now edited by Father Ferrari, has
reached its sixteenth volume.
     The grand Exposition                 Universelle of 1867 procured a favourable
opportunity of exhibiting his registering meteorograph                             in Paris, for
which he obtained the great French prize of 100,000 francs                                    (?)   and
the Grand Cross of the                      Legion       of Honour,      which    the    Emperor
Napoleon        conferred        on    him with his own hand.                     He took the
opportunity whilst in Paris of delivering some lectures,                           a    portion of
which have been published in French, in                           2   vols. 4to, under the          title
of Le Soldi.
    "When the Collegio            Romano passed from the Papal to the Italian
Government, the Chair of Astronomy in the new Roman University
was offered to Secchi and accepted,                        but the chief of his order would
not allow him to retain it.                      His connection with           the Observatory
did not, however,           cease.
    Secchi's        reputation was undoubtedly very great and wide-spread.
He      was    member       of   a     very large          number of scientific societies.
Amongst the rest, the Royal                     Society of London            elected him one          of
their foreign members                  in      1856,      and our Society followed             their
example in 1865.                 His        great       merit   consisted      in industry and
activity — his error, in want of definiteness of                            aim, in over-produc
tion.     The Royal         Society's Catalogue of Scientific                  Papers contains
a   list, carried down to 1863 only, of no less than 230 contributions
to scientific journals.              At     the time of his death, which took place
on the        26th of February               last, this list must have            been    greatly
extended.            Their value          is    probably        not in proportion        to    their
extent    ;   but   it   cannot be doubted that they contain much that                          will
help on the future progress of science.

     Mb Hcgh Scott of Gala was bom in              1822.    He held    a commis
 sion as captain    in the 92d Highlanders, and         was afterwards major
in the Dumfries, Roxburgh,           and Selkirkshire      Militia. He was a
Justice of the Peace and Deputy-Lieutenant               of the county of Sel
kirk, and an enthusiastic          supporter of the Episcopal         Church   of
Scotland, whose cause he advocated for years in the local and Edin
burgh newspapers.         His   descent, both by his father's side and that
of his mother (who was daughter of Sir Archibald Hope of Craig-
hall), secured him a good position amongst the landed gentry of
Scotland,    and his personal qualities          were  of the highest order.
Spite of a marked stutter, he shone in society, and was always a
general favourite     ; indeed, it may be doubted whether this defect of
speech   is not  an aid rather than a hindrance to its possessor, whether
as a converser      or as a lecturer.       Charles Kingsley was a notable
example amongst those who have passed away               ; and many members
of this Society      will call  to mind   living  examples   illustrative of the
truth of this remark.
     Mr  Scott died at Hyeres, whither he had gone in search of health,
 on the 19th of December last.
     James Cunningham, Esq., W.S., was born at Edinburgh on the
 18th of March 1800.        He died on the 6th of November 1878. His
 father, Alexander      Cunningham,      W.S.,    was a lineal descendant      of
 Alexander Cunningham          the historian, younger son    of the Rev. James
  Cunningham, who was       ordained minister of Ettrick in 1641.          Alex
  ander Cunningham's grandfather married a sister of              Dr Robertson,
  Principal of the University of Edinburgh, and grand-uncle of the
  late Lord Brougham.          In Chambers's edition of Burns, Alexander
  Cunningham      is referred to as the chief Edinburgh friend of the
  poet.   Mr Cunningham was educated at the High School of Edin
  burgh, in Mr Gray's class, along with the late Lord Neaves, Pro
  fessor  Syme, Dr James Begbie, and other afterwards well-known
  citizens.  After serving an apprenticeship in the office of Messrs
  Gibson-Craigs & Wardlaw, W.S., he was admitted a member of
  the Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet in 1823, and shortly
 after he began practice as a Writer to the Signet in partnership
 with the late James Walker, Esq.               He retired from business in
 1852, and    in   the  same    year was   elected  a Fellow of this Society,

 whose   meetings he attended with much regularity, and in whose
 proceedings he took       a great   interest.    The personal friend of the
 leading Scottish naturalists of the generation         now passing away,     Mr
 Cunningham was a most intelligent and earnest amateur                student   of
 natural science.
    Mr Cunningham        was twice married — first,      in 1836,   to Margaret
 Sheaffe Bagot, sister    of the Rev. Daniel Bagot, Dean of Drumore ;
 and secondly, in 1846, to Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Dunlop
 of Keppoch,     and sister of the late Alexander           Murray Dunlop of
 Corsock.     Mrs Cunningham, four         sons, and a daughter survive.
    Dit James Watson        was a native of Glasgow, where he was born
 on the 11th of September 1792.              He was educated       at the High
 School and University of Edinburgh, where               he took the degree     of
 M.D. in   1812, before he had completed his twentieth             year.    Early
in life  he received   the appointment of assistant-surgeon          in the East
 India Company's service, and resided for nearly twenty years in
 India.    On his return from India in 1831 he retired from the
 Company's service, and shortly afterwards settled in Bath, where he
soon   acquired    a  very large practice,      and was unquestionably        the
leading physician in Bath and the adjacent counties.               Amongst his
other patients must be noted Prince               Louis    Napoleon    after hia
escape from Ham.         He  was an enthusiastic member of his profes
sion, devoting himself to hospital work with untiring               zeal, and  in
his Later years of comparative leisure bringing              the  experience   of
his lengthened career to bear on the subjects of hospital administra
tion and hospital finance.         In   private life he was      a pleasant  and
instructive   companion, with a vigorous intellect, which remained
unclouded to the last.         He died on the        27 th of September last,
having just completed his eighty-sixth year.
   Dr Edwabd         James    Shearman       was   a native    of Wington,     in
Somersetshire.       The house in which he was born was next door to
that of Mrs Hannah More.          Very    soon after completing his medical
studies he settled in Rotherham, where he practised his profession
for the space of upwards of fifty years.           His contributions     to medi
cal literature    have   been   numerous and varied.             The particular
department to which he appears           largely to have devoted his atten

                      of Edinburgh,           Session 1878-79.                                 15
tion was the use of the microscope                as a guide to the diagnosis and
the prevention      of   disease.     More than a year before the publication
of the   first edition of Dr Golding Bird's "Urinary Deposits,"                                he
read   before the Sheffield Medico-Chirurgical Society an " Essay                              on
the Changes       in the Urine         affected    by     Disease,      and the Tests to
distinguish them," which was published in the Lancet.                              He   became
medical officer to the Rotherham                Board of Health, but his micro
scopic examination of the town water gave such offence to that
Board that they speedily got rid of him.                     He had, however, done
his work,       and   he     cared    little for the        consequences. He had
thoroughly opened the eyes of the people, and a new era followed.
In his      scientific tastes he was somewhat discursive, and too apt to
wander from subject to subject.                To this     circumstance        we may attri
bute his failure to attain that eminence                  amongst    his contemporaries
which his talents and enthusiastic devotion to his profession,                           and to
every study connected          with    it,   would have secured him, had he con
centrated his attention on some special subject.                         As   it   was, he was
a   useful and thoroughly instructed medical man, loved and respected
by   a    wide circle of patients and friends.              He died in his eighty-first
year.
     Sie James Coxe          was born at Gorgie            in   1811.         His father died
 when he was young, and the bringing up of the family devolved
 on his mother, the sister of George and Andrew Combe.
     In   early life he pursued his studies on the Continent, and acquired
a   competent knowledge of French                 and German.             He    graduated       in
 the University of Edinburgh             in   183,1),   and shortly afterwards joined
 the College of Physicians, on the list of whose                         Fellows        he stood
 fourth at his     death.      From the commencement                 of his professional
 career he gave considerable attention to diseases                        of the mind, in
 which he was no doubt encouraged                  by his uncles         the Combes.  He
 was naturally of        a   shy and reserved           disposition, and thus his good
 points, indomitable industry                and strong common            sense, were       long
 hidden from the public, to his no small injury.                        Indeed, had       it   not
 been for his marriage in 1841, to the sister of Dr William Cumming,
 which resulted in his being brought under the notice of the Duke
 of Argyll,     he might probably have waited long for the opportunity
 of making his powers known to the world.                           As   it   was,   Sir James

 16                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 was appointed       in 1855    Member of a Royal Commission to inquire
 into the management          of the insane in Scotland.          The writing      of
 the Report     fell chiefly to Sir James, and it disclosed such a chaotic
 condition of the arrangements for the care of the insane, and such,
 an amount of neglect         and cruelty,   as shocked and surprised Parlia
 ment and the country.           To  the  ability with which this Report was
 drawn up may be          attributed Sir James's ultimate position in his
 profession.      The Report was presented to Parliament in 1857, and              it
 led in the same year to the passing of Lord MoncreifFs               Lunacy Act.
 Under this Act Sir James            became one of the paid Commissioners,
 which appointment ho held            till his  death, giving   to the discharge
 of his duties the most earnest and conscientious attention.*                   The
first fifteen of the Reports of the Commissioners were entirely written
 by Sir James, and they prove incontestably that he was                 a man   pre
 eminently fitted for the post, not only by his early education and
his acquired tastes, but by his power of concentration, which led him
 to throw     his whole life into the work.            He visited English and
 Continental     establishments for the caro of the insane,              and made
 himself master of their methods of treatment.                 He thus became
strong in his efforts to improve the state of things at home.                     At
his suggestion      amendments were made in the Act of 1857, in 1862,
and again in 1866, and these have given it                a  character so special
as to  attract the attention of Continental and Colonial Governments.
Sir James      was fortunate    in having Dr Arthur Mitchell        as a colleague,
as the    successor    to  Dr Browne, when he           was   unfortunately     laid
aside by blindness.         Dr Mitchell not only       stood  with him in carry
ing out his views during his life, but is in              a  position to keep up
their    efficient working       now    that he    is gone.      Sir James      was
examined before the Parliamentary Committee on Lunacy in 1877,
and his evidence        was reckoned the most          valuable given on that
occasion.
    As  a literary man,      he devoted his time mainly          to assisting his
uncles in their labours,       and during the last two or three years of his
life ho gave much        of his   spare   time to the superintendence of the
   *
     He was ably supported by his co-commissioner Dr W. A. F. Browne, one
of the most eminent of British psychologists, who was instrumental in intro
ducing the modern system of treatment of the insane in the Montrose Asylum
and the Crichton Eoyal Institution, Dumfries.

memoir  of his uncle George Combe, written by Mr Charles Gibbon.
Sir James received the honour of Knighthood in 1843 — an honour
well merited         from the     zeal and devotion    with which       he pursued a
line of   conduct which           has resulted, spite of much opposition,               in
conferring great benefits on his country.                 The personal character
and general          bearing of    Sir James    were   such as in a good cause to
overcome       opposition   ;   determined but quiet, armed at every point,
but cautious in the use of his weapons, himself thoroughly convinced,
but never treating lightly the opposite convictions of others, he was
enabled   to discharge his delicate and difficult duties in a manner to
bear    down opposition so softly and insensibly as to leave no trace
of wounds behind.            He    was seized   with illness in Paris, whither          he
had     gone for relaxation, and died at Folkstone on the 9th of May
last.
   Sir Richard Griffith,             who has been styled " the Father of Irish
Geology," was born in Dublin on the 20th of September 1784.                            He
was descended          from a     Welsh family of distinction,          his ancestors
having come over to          Ireland about      the commencement        of   the seven
teenth century, and acquired considerable property in various parts
of the country.           The bulk of the property having lapsed from the
family through failure of issue, the grandfather of Sir Eichard dis
posed     of   the    remainder, and settled       in Mellicent,     county Kildare,
marrying a kinswoman (Miss Elizabeth Griffith, of Glamorganshire),
by whom he had issue Richard Griffith, the father of the deceased.
The son, also named Richard, was educated          in Dublin, with                a   view
to obtaining a         commission in the Irish Artillery, in which              he suc
 ceeded in 1799 after passing the usual examination.                     He retained
 his appointment only a short time, the Act of Union having broken
 up the separate establishments          of   the two countries.       The offer was,
 indeed, made him of an appointment                in the British     forces, but his
father caused him to decline           it,   conceiving that   a   better opening was
afforded him in the practice of civil engineering.   He accordingly
directed his attention to the study of mines, and at seventeen pro
ceeded to Cornwall, with the view of gaining     practical knowledge
                                                           a
of mining.           Here his assiduity attracted the attention of Sir Hum
phry Davy.           On   Mr Griffith discovering in the Dalcoath mine                 the
rich ores of nickel and cobalt which were raised with the silver ore,

 18                   Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
 but had     till then    been rejected     as  rubbish, Lord de Dunstanville,
 one of the      principal    proprietors of the mines,          offered   him a per
 manent appointment in them, which,                   however, he declined, pre
 ferring to give his studies a wider range, probably with a view to
 devote his powers       to the service of his native country.              He accord
 ingly visited    the mining districts of Derbyshire, Yorkshire,             Durham,
 and Northumberland.            This brought him to Edinburgh,               where he
 formed the acquaintance           of Sir James Hall, Professors Playfair,
 Jamieson, and Hope, by whom he was held in such high estimation,
 that in 1808, when only twenty-three years of                  age,   he was unani
 mously elected       a   Fellow of this Society.            He now returned to
 Dublin,   and, under the influence of the             Royal Dublin Society, at
 once    commenced       "  a geological    and mining        examination of the
 Leinster coal district."       The publication of the results of his labours
in this field    was completed      in  1814.      In   1809 he was selected         by
the    Commission       appointed to inquire          into   the practicability       of
draining     and improving        the bogs of       Ireland    to be one of       their
engineers.       In  1812 his surveys and reports were published by the
authority of Parliament.           At this   date he received       the appointment
of Inspector-General of         the Royal Mines        in Ireland,    as successor   to
the eminent mineralogist Richard               Kirwan.       Three years later he
issued the first instalment of a geological map of his native country,
to which      he regularly      made    additions during the space of forty
years, when it was published in           a completed      form.      The Geological
Society of London in 1855, in recognition of its value, awarded him
the Wollaston       Palladium     Medal.     Professor Edward Forbes, in pre
senting the medal, described the map as "one of the most remarkable
productions which had over been effected by a single geologist."
This     map    ho   had the     honour of presenting personally to                Her
Majesty, who took a lively interest in it.                The result was       that in
 1858 Griffith     was created a Baronet.
    It is a remarkable testimony to the knowledge which                  Sir Richard
had early acquired of the geology           of his native country, that in the
map he had coloured a district as Upper Silurian,                 whilst   the officers
of the Geological Survey who followed him held it to belong to a
formation between         the  Silurian and      the   Old Red Sandstone.           Sir
Richard,    however, adhered         to   his opinion.        To     get  the   matter
settled,   Mr Hall,     the present    director of the Geological Survey of

                     of Edinburgh,     Session 1878-79.                    19
Ireland, went during last autumn with some of his staff to the
district, and became       satisfied of the correctness    of Sir Richard's
view.     He at once communicated the fact to Sir Richard in         a letter,
which, however, reached        him too late to give him the satisfaction
which    it was intended and calculated to      afford.
    The famine in the south of Ireland,           which occurred in 1822,
aroused the then Lord-Lieutenant,           the  Marquis of Wcllesley,       to
energetic action in the improvement of the means of communication
 between different parts of the country.         He accordingly appointed
 Griffith as engineer, to improve and construct roads in the counties
 of Cork, Kerry, and Limerick. Under his direction the starving
 population were employed to construct some 250 miles of road
 through districts hitherto accessible only with great difficulty, and
 not a little danger from the disaffected      population, whom it was not
 easy to render amenable        to British authority.     While   engaged    in
 this    work   he   received the    important     appointment    of  General
 Boundary Surveyor, the magnitude of whose duties may be inferred
 from the fact that 1000 miles of the boundaries of about 69,000
 Crown lands had to        be ascertained   and settled.     In  1827 he was
 appointed     Commissioner of Valuation        under Mr Goulburn's       Act,
  and "Griffith's Valuation"       was   accepted   as the test of value      in
  nearly all the land disputes in Ireland.          In  1846, after the great
  potato famine, he was appointed Deputy-Chairman            of the Board of
  "Works, the onerous       duties of which     appointment he performed
  regardless  of self, working thirteen hours        a day without    food or
  drink, feeling that the lives of thousands depended on his exertions.
  It will  not be necessary to allude to the various appointments which
  he held during his long life, nor to the numerous public works
  which were      executed  under his superintendence.        That which       is
  best known     in his native city was the diversion of the course     of  the
  Liffey, and the conversion of a group of dilapidated houses, the
  nursery of vice and fever, into the esplanade which stands in front
  of the Royal Barracks.
      Sir Richard Griffith   was seventy-four years of age when he was
  created   a Baronet, an age at which         most    men  relax from their
  labours or cease them altogether.         It  was very different   with Sir
  Richard.    He had still twenty     years of good work left in him.      The
  preservation of his physical and mental powers for so long a period

 20                  Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 he attributed to his temperate        habits of living, being an early riser
 and remarkably abstemious.           At eighty, when on       a geological    ex
 cursion with his friend       Mr Milne Home,         he once walked eighteen
 miles in   a day.     He continued to give and receive         hospitalities    as
 late as to his ninety-second year.           In private life   he was     upright
 and honourable, kindly and sociable.             He was    married in 1812 to
 Miss Waldio of Hendorsyde Park, Kelso, with whom he celebrated
 a golden wedding       in  1862.    His long    and   useful life  wTas  brought
 to a close on the 22d September 1878.
    Mr Milne Home, who knew him well,             has  kindly communicated to
 me some of      Sir Bichard's letters     to members    of his family.      They
 breathe   a tone   of simple and unaffected      piety, which gilds the other
 virtues of this excellent man.
    In  the death     of Sir William Stiuling Maxwell, Scotland has
 lost (to use the words of Lord Houghton) her first man of letters.
 Sir William's name is familiar to literary men on both sides of the
 Tweed, not     as the  Baronet, but    as  simply William Stirling of Keir.
 With that      name     he  commenced       his career,  with that      name    he
 obtained his earliest      and brightest laurels, and with that name he
 will  descend to posterity.
    He was born at Kenmure, near Glasgow, on the 8th March 1818.
 On his father's side he was descended from the Stirlings of                 Keir,
 retainers   of  the house    of Stuart, and famous       in history.      On his
 mother's side he traced his pedigree up to the battle of Otterburn,
 where had been shed the blood of a Maxwell of             Pollock.      His after
career was tinged with his ancestral associations,           which operated to
 throw his mind with affection back on the past.
    Mr Stirling    completed    his early education by taking the degree         of
B.A. in Cambridge in         1839.    He   was  Fellow Commoner of Trinity
College during my residence           in   the University,    but, so far as      I
know, did not distinguish         himself as a student.       He  devoted    him
self rather to art and history          than to those early studies which
constitute the framework of the training of a University.                His love
for travel was early developed,       and the ample      means at his disposal
enabled him to indulge iu it in a manner and to an extent not                   in
the power of ordinary students.             It  was during    his residence     at
Cambridge as an undergraduate that he made the tour                in Palestine,

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                      21
 which brought out his first appearance      in print in a small volume,
entitled     "The Songs of the Holy Land." Like most young men,
Stirling's    first essays in -writing were in verse, and like most wiso
men,      his efforts in verse ceased with the first effusion.                    His   good
genius     left him     free ever after to express        himself in prose.             After
leaving Cambridge          he lived much on the Continent                 ;   and having a
facility for the acquisition of languages, he became a tolerable pro
ficient    in French, Italian,        and Spanish.          It   was the last-named
language,     and the literature which it        opened up, that seized on his
youthful      mind and influenced the whole current of his future
thoughts.         Spain    was at that time little visited by the British
traveller, and the literature of the country was                         to the    ordinary
student sealed up in an unknown tongue.                     Prescott and Ford, and
others     with   them, have since given us an insight into the treasures,
artistic and literary,        which    are stored     up in the Peninsula.                 To
Stirling they came with all the freshness of original discovery.
  The early history of the Moor and the Cid, tinctured with
romance, and having its roots in the struggles of the mind after
religion,     was peculiarly     attractive to a young man whose natural
bent was to the sombre             in art and       the    ascetic    in religion.         He
returned again and again to Spain, and familiarised himself with
her literature         and her art — so unlike the            literature and art of
northern Europe.            To the latter branch of study            he at first devoted
 his attention.        Spanish art, unlike Italian,          is characterised           by its
 positive features of religion and decorum,               and is no less marked by
 its negative features        of deficiency in landscape,            in marine,     and     in
 animal painting.          The Church, the supreme               power in Spain, dis
 couraged the study of anatomy           ;   and the result        is,   that tho subjects
 in which the Italians        most delighted were shunned or neglected                     by
 the      Spaniards.      The consequence     was, that to those whose                  educa
 tion was based on the Italian school,                the     Spanish         treatment     of
 sacred subjects seemed dry and unintelligible.
                                             Thus, whilst Raphael
 and Michael Angelo were familiar to the minds of our countrymen
 (as they deserved        to be), the not much inferior, but very different,
 greatness of Morales, of Zurbaran, and of Velazquez was but coldly
 recognised.  Few had seen them in the Madrid gallery, and tho few
 who had seen even Velazquez, the greatest of them, had not yet
 begun to recognise him as the artist who
                                                          " drew     the minds     of men."

22                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
Wilkie, writing half       a century ago, described        the Peninsula as " an
unexplored territory      — the very Timbuctoo of art." " Madrid," says
he,  writing to Sir Robert Peel, " is quite a mine of old pictures of
which in England we know nothing."               Stirling's mind was admirably
adapted to fit him to be the explorer          of this mine.     Accordingly, the
first fruits of his travels and studies in Spain were given to the world
in  1848    in his "Annals of Spanish Painters."              Sir Edmund Head
had   preceded him by a year in the publication of his
                                                                       " Handbook
to the   History of    the Spanish and French Schools of Painting,"               and
Stirling's book came, as it were, to clothe the dry bones of Head's
work with living flesh.          It  scattered    over the dull details of bio
graphy anecdotes        bearing on the manners and customs of the                  dif
ferent epochs which his history brought under his                eye.     It gives in
some sort a glimpse at the history of the Spanish people.                   The book
was received     with enthusiasm, and         placed the author at once         in the
front rank of art critics.         It  was a great success, but          it  must   be
confessed that     it was a success    in  a narrow field; and had the author
rested on his laurels he would have ere now dwindled                    into a com
paratively small figure among           his contemporaries.        Fortunately for
us, his intercourse      with Spain     and   Spanish story, and his accurate
history-loving mind, brought him into contact with a hero congenial
to his tastes,   with   whose career, as a Scotchman and an admirer                 of
the   brilliant  pages of Robertson, he must have been familiar from
his youth — Spain's greatest or second greatest name, Charles V.
    But Mr Stirling       was no hero-worshipper ; and when he follows
Charles into the cloister, it is with no intention               of painting him
with   the halo of a saint, but       with the stern yet noble features of a
man who, having adopted            as his motto
                                                    " Plus ultra," thus striking
the negative     from the limits of his ambition, paused in mid career
that he might look out from the quiet eminence                    of his tower at
Yuste, and witness, undisturbed by its noise, the working of the vast
machine himself had set in motion.
    "The Cloister Life of Charles V.," Mr Stirling's                greatest     work,
originated in this way.           A MS.,     entitled "Memoir of Charles at
Yuste," had been deposited          in  the archives of the Foreign Office at
Paris.      Mr Stirling, anxious        to solve    some question       in Spanish
history, went there in the summer               of 1850,    and   endeavoured       in
vain to get a sight        of it.    ^Nothing daunted, he returned             in the

                        of Edinburgh,             Session 1878-79.                          23
winter,      backed by Lord Normanby,                        and finding favour with the
Presidsnt of the Bepublic, he was, though not without great diffi
culty, at       length permitted         to peruse the precious            MS.      He found it
a real     treasure, based as      it   was on the correspondence                of the Emperor
Charles from his place of retreat, with the courts                            of Valladolid and
Brussels.         The information derived from the                        perusal   of this MS.
(which       he was not allowed to copy) supplied the groundwork                             of
Mr Stirling's volume, on which, from his ample resources in Spanish
literature, he founded the true story of Charles's cloister life, so
different from the fife depicted in the charming pages of Boberteon.
"We see      the Emperor setting out from Flanders in                          a truly imperial
manner,         accompanied by his two sisters,                    queens      of Hungary and
France, with a train of 150 followers and a fleet                              of 60 sail We
see    him. arrived at Burgos amidst the pealing of bells and the shouts
of the populace.            "We follow him threading the mountain passes of
Spain      till   he reaches the castle of the Count of Oropesas, sick and
worn out, not with fasting and prayer, but with                           excessive indulgence
at table.         We hear of the whole country-side aroused at his advent,
and we have not long to wait                    till    we find every pass which leads to
his retirement threaded by strings of sumpter mules                                  laden with
everything         which    nature and art could find out to administer to
Charles's inordinate love of good cheer.                         We     see   him at length in
his cell at Yuste — a cell which had been three years in its construc
tion, built especially for his use — with sixty attendants only, feasting
 right royally       every day, and            in all   respects    (if   Mr Stirling   has not
 somewhat         overstated     his   case,   which      is   more than probable) as much
a     man of the world and an emperor   as he had ever been at Valla
 dolid or in Brussels.   To his countrymen (who had been enamoured
 with Charles's cloister life from reading of   only in the fascinating
                                                                   it
 pages of Bobertson) the effect produced by Mr Stirling's book must
 have been somewhat analogous                     to the deletion of one of the saints
 from their calendar.
   Mr Stirling having completed for the present his historical studies,
returned to his first love— Spanish art, and three years later he pub
lished " Velazquez and his Works,"      singularly able monograph.

      It   is   not necessary in this place to notice the works which were
 privately        printed   at his expense,               mostly illustrative        of Spanish
 history and art.           It    is    to be regretted          that their circulation     was

24                       Proceedings             of the Royal Society
limited         to a few friends               and to the public libraries, so as to be
nearly inaccessible             to the general reader ; nor is                    it my duty more
than to mention the production, in a splendid form, of the history,
by    Mr W. Fraser, of                   the    Starlings of Keir.         Lord Houghton in
forms us that at the time of his death                           Sir William had announced
the speedy completion                 of   the     " Life of Don Juan of Austria."
     Mr Stirling         received         academic     honours from nearly every                     Uni
versity in Britain.                 In    particular, he had been elected Lord Rector
of the University of Edinburgh,                       and at his death he was Chancellor
of the  University of Glasgow.      The rectorial address which he
delivered to the students in Edinburgh is characteristic of the man.
It recommends            caution in forming an opinion, hesitation in choosing
a    party, whether in politics or in religion, and, above all, sober-
mindedness.              I   quote one passage            — " Let
                                                          :                me recommend        to your
notice the rule of Descartes                     — the first of the
                                                code which he com
posed for the guidance of his own mind — -' Never to receive anything
for truth which              I do    not clearly know to be true — that                 is,   carefully
to avoid haste and prejudice, and to include in my judgment nothing
which does not present itself so clearly and distinctly to my mind as
to take away all occasion                  of doubt.'          If   any considerable     number of
men could be induced to walk                          by this rule, how blessed                 a    calm
would descend                upon many places now filled with noise and confu
sion   !    how many of our intellectual battle-fields would be left with
'
    their    lances      unlifted,         their    trumpets          unblown,'     ready      for    the
ploughshare of profitable industry                    !       how much speech, which can be
hardly called even silver, would be hushed in                                a   happy and golden
                "

     Sir William died of fever                   at Venice on the 15th January.
     Sir William Gibson-Craig,                      the eldest son of            Sir James Gibson-
Craig of Riccarton, Bart., was born on the 2d of August 1797.                                         He
traced his descent to               Sir Alexander Gibson, who                was President of         the
Court of Session in the reign of James                         VI.,   and   a   daughter of Thomas
Craig of Reccarton, the celebrated jurist of that time, and author                                     of
the treatise        De   Jure Feudal!.              Having          been    educated   at the    Edin
burgh High School,                  and afterwards at          a    school in Yorkshire,        he was
called to the Scotch bar in 1820; but instead of settling down to a
forensic career, he spent two years                            in foreign travel, and on his

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1878-79.                       25
return to   Edinburgh, turned his attention       to public affairs.    He took
an active   part  in Church      matters, and on the dissolution of Parlia
ment    which followed the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, he
offered  himself for the representation of his native county, Mid-
Lothian, and was         returned by   a majority of 42.    Four     years  later
he retired   from the representation of the county, and offered him
self  for that of the city of Edinburgh.            He  was returned as the
successful candidate       along with   Mr Macaulay, and     retained   his seat
till 1852, having held during six years of the period the post of a
Lord of the    Treasury, in which position      he had endeavoured       to take
a  real charge   of the affairs of Scotland.      To him perhaps more than
to any   other man we are indebted for the erection of the National
Gallery.     In   1862 he was appointed to the office of Lord Clerk
Kegister and    Keeper of     the Signet  in Scotland;  and in the following
year he was     sworn a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council.               For
many years     Sir William performed the duties of thi3         office  of Lord
Clerk Register gratuitously.         Subsequently, on the recommendation
of a select Committee of the House of Commons, which took evidence
on various matters connected         with the Register House, the salary of
 £1 200 a year,     which had formerly been attached to         the office, was
 restored   about 1871.        Sir William exerted himself       to render    the
 working of the Register House efficient, and in particular to carry
 out   the   recommendations       of   the  committee    above    referred    to.
 Amongst other objects which engaged his attention was the publica
 tion of many of the interesting documents          contained in the Register
 House.      One undertaking he thus helped to forward was the index
 volume     to Thomson's Acts of Parliament           prepared    by Professor
 Cosmo     Innes, and the recasting of a portion of that work, with           the
 addition of Acts discovered since Thomson's time.                Another     was
 the collection of      Privy Council Records, edited by Mr Hill Burton,
 of which the       first volume has been published.        For many years
 Sir William       acted   as Chairman of the Board of Visitors           of the
 Royal Observatory, on which Board             I had  the pleasure of sitting
with him.        Here he brought to bear his knowledge of the forms and
usages customary         in approaching the Treasury, and he was a steady
 and efficient supporter of the Astronomer Royal in his endeavours
 to get the Observatory put on a proper footing. To all connected
 with him on that Board his conduct was ever that of a high-minded
     VOL. X.                                                           D

20                    Proceedings    of the  Royal Society

regret to   all his  colleagues.
    Sir William died      on the 12th   of March, in his 81st       year.
    Martyn John Roberts, born August                  2,  1800,    was    the only
child of John       Roberts    and   Caroline,   the     daughter of       William
Yalden, of an old Hampshire family.            His father      resided   at " Bryn
Caoran,    Caerinarthenshire," and did not think it necessary to bring
up his son to any profession or business,          but he soon made himself
acquainted with all the mining and other industrial occupations                  in
the district.     Early in life,   he manifested    a great   distaste    for mero
classical  learning, and an immense avidity for scientific pursuits; and
as science    was   not to be acquired at school or at home, he found
out every thing for himself while discouraged              by all those around
him.      Amongst the Welsh servants and peasantry, he was considered
somewhat     in the light of   a magician,    owing to the extraordinary ex
periments he was always making           ; and in thus teaching himself, ho
often rediscovered      many facts already     known to others        with whoso
works ho could not then become acquainted.                But had      he heard   of
them he could not have been satisfied without proving them.                      He
had a rare combination         of exact scientific research with flashes of
imagination, and thus the study of electricity always possessed a
peculiar charm for him.          There, he saw   a  very imperfectly explored
and wonderful region with plenty of room for experiment and dis
 covery.
     He  was never all his life without a carpenter          and smith working
 out his ideas, so needful was       it for him   to create     a tangible repre
 sentation of them, and so unable was he with his refined, nervous
 fingers to do any rough manual work for himself.                Both his parents
 died before he was of        age.    He   began   his independent career by
 having a yacht built on his own plan, and sailed about to visit
 various places abroad,       making acquaintance with Cuvier, Clement-
 Desormes,     and other scientific men in Paris.             Thus    ho came     in
 contact   with all that had       been already done      in  science, and    knew
 over what field his future investigations must range.               In this way
 also he made himself         thoroughly master       of navigation, and was
 qualified to suggest improvements regarding ships.                Hence, we find
 him,   July    9, 1838,    receiving    thanks   from the United Service

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1878-79.                          27
   Museum for a new form            of anchor   deposited     there; and early in
  1839,   a medal was conferred on him by "the Society of Arts of
  Scotland,"    for his new method of reshipping a rudder at sea, an
  account   of which was published in the Edinburgh Neic Philosophical
 Journal, No. 53.         Some of his contributions on the subject of elec
 tricity may be briefly noticed, but        as  his thoughts were sown broad
cast   by extempore lectures and in newspapers,             it  is impossible to do
more    than allude to them generally.
    He always combated the notion of inherent repulsion, whether
in gravity       or electricity, and as, by independent research, the
phenomena of electricity gradually opened out to him, he became
convinced that gravity was dependent on an electric condition, and
that    there were not two electric fluids, essentially positive and
negative, repellent and attractive, but only one fluid, either               " plus "
     " minus " in
or                     quantity    or  intensity, and always attractive. He
maintained        that apparent repulsion         could bo      explained     by one
attractive fluid, always tending to equilibrium,                and he wrote and
lectured    much to account for the phenomena generally supposed to
be adverse      to his theory.      The papers published in the London and
Dublin Philosophical         Magazine, vol. xix.,     July    1841, and vol.     xxi.,
 1842, show that while studying anatomy at the Edinburgh                  University
 in 1838,     he was    collecting materials to prosecute          his favourite re
 searches    in electricity.    It  was chiefly but not entirely with reference
 to these     papers, that the late      Dr Grant (professor of comparative
 anatomy at the London University)           wrote  as  follows:   —"In    the whole
 range   of my     experience,     no one surpassed      Roberts for deep and
  original views in practical chemistry and physiology."
     He initiated   several forms of galvanic battery.         The first mentioned
 by him, he applied more especially to the assaying of copper ores                  in
 October 1837, also to the blasting of rocks          ;  and in September        1838
 he sent papers      on both subjects to the        Royal Geological Society,
 Cornwall, describing his method of effecting those objects.                   It  was
on that occasion that he was unanimously elected Member of this
 Society.      The following November a letter from him, explaining
 the   process, was read by Mr J. P. Gassiot at the London Electrical
 Society, of which he was one of the earliest members.                       Another
letter, dated March 1839, was read at the same Society, describing a
 new battery in which            the metals    were   circular     discs,  and    wore

arranged     on a horizontal        axis, so that by turning          a   handle     they
might be rotated.         There was an apparatus          for cleansing the plates
as they turned, and         additional     galvanic energy was obtained              after
exposure    to the air.
    That was     the   battery used         in blasting the Skerryvore            rocks-
Other papers of his are to be found in the "Proceedings of the                 London
Electrical    Society," 1837-40 and 1813,             pp.   77,  78,    356-60,      "On
Radiation not     a  property of Electricity," &c., &c.             To conclude the
subject of blasting, it may be           as  well to say that on the 26th March
and 26th April 1838 (at the request of the Highland and Agricul
tural Society of Scotland) he exhibited, not only his process of
blasting rocks, but that of explosion under water,                       at  Craigleitk
Quarry, for the perfect success of which he received                    a  medal from
the Society.      A drawing of        the scene, showing the height to            which
the water rose, was made at the time, and afterwards engraved.
Some     sappers   and miners, then present, being taught the process,
made    it known to Colonel Pasley, and              the result was his        blowing
tip the   "Royal    George."       It   was not, however,       until   1840 that     (by
desire of many) he published               a  pamphlet, giving simple, practical
directions for general        work, and detailing the use he had made of
sand for tamping, and the            introduction of atmospheric air between
the charge     of powder and the sand, so as to increase the energy of
explosion.      He first pointed out that         sand so placed     in   a tube    could
not be blown out.        In  the "Proceedings of the        Highland      and  Agricul
tural Society" may be seen the original paper, of which the pamphlet
was a copy, and       it  was   still further illustrated in the " Proceedings
 of the West Yorkshire Geological Society" for 1842-48, pp. 126-138.
The last act of the kind he personally superintended was in                    a quarry
near Rydal, to please the poet Wordsworth                  and   Dr Davy.        In the
 "Mining Journal"         a controversy was begun 18th January 1841, and
ended by two letters        —  one from Mr Byers, stating that he had made
much practical use of assaying ores by galvanism, the idea of which
originated with and was communicated to him by                           Mr Roberts;
the other was from        Mr Roberts himself, showing that M. Becquerel's
essay
        " On Detecting Metals in their Solutions              "
                                                                 did not bear on the
subject,   as he  did not profess to give any practical method for de
tecting the quantity and variety of "metals contained in the                   ore.
    Mr Roberts     set out on a scientific expedition            to Norway       in the

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                             2'.i
summer of 1839, but          was detained    for some time at Amsterdam by
rheumatic fever, and obliged to return           home from great prostration.
Throughout many years of his life he suffered from frequent attacks
of the same kind, often checking him in the midst of work. How
ever, he was not long after this ready with a paper " On an
Anomalous Condition of Iron."             Experiments were detailed, showing
iron to    be positive    when compared       with  copper, and yet far more
 highly negative than       copper when compared        in their electric relation
 -with zinc.     The result of this newly discovered            fact was, that ho
 recommended to the Admiralty a new method of sheathing ships,
 and made known the use to which it might be applied in the manu
 facture of boilers.
     In  1851 he contrived a battery for obtaining products that might
  be utilised  in  the arts, and thus cheapen the use of electricity,           but
  soon afterwards those products became so           plentiful    as to be of little
  commercial value.
     For the   same purpose,      he recovered   his products and used them
  over and over again without           much waste.      It  is interesting, at the
 present moment, to read the description of an electric lamp, for
 which he then took out           a patent,  but which was not carried into
  general use for want of sufficient funds.              The     distance  between
  the    graphite   or charcoal electrodes        was    regulated      by  a  kind
  of clockwork, and two         sets of electrodes   used to produce equality
  of light, or    else   "the    electrodes   were   placed     in   a  vacuum, or
  space   not containing      any oxygen       or other matter which could
  cause   their destruction when brought into             an incandescent state
  by the action of the current of electricity."                 The specification,
  with full drawings, dated 1852, No. 14, 198, may afford some hints
  for  those at work    in  a similar direction now.       It  may not have been
  known to those who have lately proposed              the same thing, but the
  coincidence is singular.        While visiting   the manufacturing districts
  of Glasgow and Leeds,        he used    his chemical knowledge to improve
  the making of paints and dyeing of woollen cloths, and also helped
  in reducing     the friction   of spindles.    It should here be mentioned
  that, in the   course of his life he took out several patents, but a mind
  so sensitive as his was not fitted for the wear           and    anxiety of com
  mercial speculation, and the fertility of his thoughts would not
  allow him (like the man of one idea) to rest long on anything he

30                        Proceedings                of   the   Royal Society
had done.          He had          scarcely constructed one machine before he shot
right     ahead     of   it,       and thought of something better,                                  which    his
honesty, and candour would not allow him to conceal.                                              His last in
vention was        a   safety-valve most carefully superintended by himself,
and being his last,           it    is   to be hoped that those who have taken out
a   patent for     it    will      be rewarded by                   a   pecuniary profit he did not
derive from anything for himself.
     Wherever he stayed, he was one of the first to found and promote
mechanics'        institutions       ;        and many were his lectures on science,
freely given to working                       men,     by whom ho was, in consequence,
much regarded,            and from many of whom ho afterwards received
letters thanking him for the impetus he had given to their intelligent
industry and prosperity.
     When in       the Highlands,                 he interested           himself much in the con
dition of the crofters,                  and his suggestions                   on that subject               were
published in the newspapers                           of      the       day.   The          people    of Port
William must             remember              his    gathering them of an                        evening for
rational amusement                 and instruction.
     In   185-t his      love        of fine         scenery         induced him to purchase                   a
picturesque property in Breconshire, where                                     ho   built     a   house,     and
settled his family for eighteen                      years.         The land, which he found                 full
of stony hedgorowsand swampy places, he made                                        a   verdant park, and
planted     it   with many fine trees.
    But the work in which he took most interest there was the ad
ministration of justice,                 as   deputy-lieutenant and magistrate for two
counties.        He was not satisfied with                mere
                                                               " dilettante " observance

of his duty, but studied and mastered the laws on the knowledge                                                of
which       he   was     to    make           a   decision.          As    a   visitor of the United
Lunatic      Asylum           at    Abergavenny,                ho      always threw light on the
subjects discussed,           and his ideas were gathered up in pamphlets and
periodicals that might influence the community in which ho lived.
Some of his suggestions

                                         respecting

and classified      schools, was published in 1861.                             He      also made      a   move
against the injustice               done to poor              people       by deficient weights and
measures, and was called upon to give evidence                                          on them before a
Committee of the House of Commons, which led to                                         a    more stringent
regulation.        On that occasion,                      the Astronomer            Royal showed his

asked,    "Did you   as a boy write me a remarkable letter on astronomy V
It   was quite true, and occurred some forty years before.
     It would be impossible and unnecessary           here to enumerate     all his
fugitive writings and the many things to which he turned his atten
tion during his life, or to notice the testimony of those who knew
his usefulness.
     Through    all his activity     there   glowed a very passion for tho
beauties of that extensive prospect at Pendarven and the glories of
light and shade       on the distant hills.       This   was to be expected       in
one ever looking out for perfection, and crying " Excelsior
                                                                             "
                                                                           !    and
often,    while gazing on    those splendid mountain sunsets, he was
                 " Rapt into still communion that transcends
                   The imperfect offices of prayer and praise.
                   Of him it might be said that he was found
                   By his intense conceptions, to receive
                   Deeply, the lesson deep of love."
     He dearly loved his home, and delighted in listening to the music
 of his family.      Yet like most men of imaginative wit, he was not
 only    full of genial humour, but excitable,         and  ready with slashing
 sarcasm     for obstructive stupidity and dishonesty.           His family and
 friends can testify to his affectionate           and attachable     disposition.
  Indeed, his heart was too tender         to  admit of his ever joining in tho
  ordinary country sports.        He took delight in the songs and flight of
  birds, and never could hurt or shoot a living thing for pleasure.
      The last few years of his life were spent in Bath, where he under
  went much suffering, until he died on the 8th September                      1878.
  But his mortal remains        rest beside     those   of his eldest   son in the
  Welsh churchyard of Llangenny, where he had so often listened
  to the rush of the mountain stream, and felt that all was to him a
  revelation of the Divine.
      Robert Habkness        was   born at Ormskirk,        Lancashire, on 28th
  July    1816.    He  was educated     first at Dumfries, and afterwards at
  the   University of Edinburgh ;       so that although     English by birth      he
  was    Scotch by early training and residence,          and even     to the    last
  was often supposed to be a native of the north side of tho Tweed.
   It  was  while attending the lectures of Professor Jameson that                 he

32                   Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
had his attention specially directed to geological pursuits, and the
influence thus communicated moulded all his after life.                     His first
paper,   published when he was twenty-seven                  years   of  age,   was a
speculative one, on the climate of the coal epoch, and contained
ideas   which    have been    adopted by some subsequent writers.                    A
second paper, on changes       in the   temperature     of the earth as a mode
of accounting for the subsidence            of the ocean, and for the con
sequent formation      of  sea-beaches     above   its present     level, was read
by him in the same year before the Geological Society of London.
But in   spite of this early promise of activity          in theoretical geology,
it was as a sedulous worker      in  the field that he distinguished himself.
Though ho made occasional geological            excursions in Lancashire and
Cheshire, he spent most of his early years iu laborious traverses                    of
the south of Scotland, exploring the           old reptiliferous sandstones          of
Nithsdale     and Annandale, the Carboniferous Limestone                 as  it is de
veloped in Dumfriesshire, and more particularly the Lower Silurian
formations which      stretch from the coast of Berwickshire to that of
Wigtown.        To his minute observations        we owe the first outline          of
the general structure of the        Silurian uplands of the south of Scot
land.    He followed      the  graptolite bands from valley to valley, and
from parish to parish, and showed how they could be used                 as horizons
to determine the succession       of deposits in that difficult region.
   In  the year 1853      he was appointed to the           Chair of Geology in.
Queen's College, Cork
                           — an office which he held till his death. His
residence in Ireland enabled him to bring the same diligent zeal to
bear on the investigation of the geology          of that island.        From time
to time ho made valuable contributions            to our knowledge of            Irish
geology,   one of the most important being the             paper which he wrote
in  the year 1860, on the metamorphic rocks of the north of                 Ireland,
wherein he drew a parallel between              the   quartz-rocks,     limestones,
and associated rocks of Donegal and those of the west of Scotland.
But he continued to devote much time to field-work in the north of
England, and in Scotland.          There is hardly      a  district which he did
not explore    ; and though he did not always publish his observations,
the number of his communications to the scientific journals                    of the
day bears witness to his unwearied activity.               He   made himself the
best authority of his time       in the     palaeontology     and stratigraphy of
the Lake District and of Dumfriesshire.

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1878-79.                        33
     The alteration      of the curriculum of         the   Queen's    Colleges    in
Ireland included a very great increase in the duties required of the
professor   of geology at Cork. Professor Ilarkness struggled with
this accession     of toil for two years, but finding it too much for his
strength,    and having some premonitory symptoms of the disease
which ultimately cut him off, he resigned                his chair, after having
occupied     it for   a   quarter of     a  century.    It  was his intention       to
settle at   Penrith, to which       place   he had for many years been used
annually to repair to spend a portion of his holiday with his sister.
It was when on his way to carry out this intention that                      he died
suddenly of heart-disease         at Dublin, on 4th October       1878.
    Important      as was the scientific work        accomplished by Professor
Harkness,      it did not   receive    a wider or heartier recognition among
his brother geologists than his admirable qualities of head and heart
No one who has been privileged with his friendship will fail to
cherish the memory of his earnestness over even the driest details,
his quiet enthusiasm, his generous admiration for the work of others,
and his unfailing         cheerfulness.      His   beaming    ruddy face, always
 full of kindliness, was       seldom     to be missed     from the platform of
 Section     C at    the   British Association        meetings.     It  often rose
 among the speakers, and it never failed to reappear at the festive
 evening gatherings.         There have been men who have graven                 their
 names more deeply on the registers of scientific thought and progress,
 but there have been few whose sunny nature has more                       endeared
 them in the recollection of their friends than Robert Harkness.
      A few words in conclusion. — Just twenty years have elapsed since
  I  had the honour of delivering an address               to this Society on its
  opening day.        On that occasion,       I  took the place of Sir David

  which arise on casting one's thoughts back through twenty years
  are  full of   sadness when they fasten on         individual  members       of this
  Society, whose presence at our meetings was a source of pleasure not
  unmixed with pride, but of sadness, brightened by glimpses of the
  future when we think of them as members                   of a living body,       as
  workers even now in the field which man has been sent into the
  world to cultivate — the field where truth is to be sought and found.

  and work in the impetus they have given to younger men, who hung
 about them when living, and fill their places when dead.                    This feel
  ing is forced on me very powerfully by one fact which                     it was my
  duty to state in my former address.          It  was this.   I said — "The annual
  addition to our Transactions this year (1857-8) contains but one
  paper.    That paper is by Mr Stewart, and is of unquestionable
 merit.     I   have    great  pleasure   in learning that Mr Stewart           is con
 tinuing     his researches      on radiant heat,      a branch of experimental
 science    which owes so much to members                of this Society, and the
 papers on which alone suffico to 6tamp our Transactions                  with lasting
 value."      I  need not say that the papers to which               I referred   were,
 for the most part,        contributed by one member            of the Society, the
 man who had for the previous twenty years of my connection                        with
 it most conspicuously illustrated         in his own    person the position    which
 he himself lays down, that the          vitality of   a  Society like this is kept
 up by    a few ardent workers, whose contributions like the life blood
 trickle through the veins of the Society, and warm and animate its
 remotest members.           Forbes was     a  man pre-eminently constituted to
 be a leader in a Society      like this — cold, yet thoroughly affable ; always
 at work, yet always accessible ; keen and resolute in maintaining his
 own claims, yet ever open to the claims of those about him ; and
above all, straightforward even at the risk of treading on the toes                  of
 men   with whom        he might happen to come           in  contact.    Forbes was
one of two members of the Society whom                 I had   the honour of know
ing before        I  came   to   Edinburgh.        He was introduced to be by
 Dr Whewell,         and was ever my fast friend.                Though    perhaps    a
little out of place in such an address,           I cannot resist the inclination,
 in holding up his ardent, hopeful character to the younger members
of the Society, to read          a portion of a letter which         I received   from
him on his last return from the Continent to lie down and die.                       It
 is written    in   bed and   in pencil.      He says —
    "I   was very glad to hear from you.             You will not       expect a long
reply.      I am,     in fact, very weak, though         I made    out the journey
wonderfully,        by the help of every         luxury and indulgence which
modern railways and hotels afford.               Here on English ground          I  am
content for the present to rest and be thankful             ; to leave the issue to a
merciful Providence, in whose goodness and guidance                   I place  my  full
reliance.     Of course,   I do not look at present     to any further movement.

It   is most gratifying      to me to know that you and other old friends
still thought of       me as a successor       to  Sir David Brewster [in          the
Principalship of         the   University].       That,     of  course,    I at   once
surrendered.        It   was   the last remaining        rag of worldly ambition
which remained         to me, and     I surrendered     it cheerfully."
    I have    selected     Forbes out of the many who are called up to
memory by a reference to what             I said in this place twenty years ago,
both because he is most vividly associated                   in my mind with this
room and this Society, and because he is about the very best type                     I
could     select of   a   man who derives         benefit from the associations
connected with a Society like this, and who in his turn reflects those
benefits     most powerfully        on others.     The solitary paper        which    I
have mentioned           as the sole     product in our Transactions           of the
Session,     was an early product of a mind               lit up by    a  spark from
 Forbes's    anvil.      Balfour Stewart had         been a worker        in Forbes's
 workshop, and had imbibed much of the spirit of his master.                        He
 is now one of our Honorary Members               ; a  fact which sufficiently ex
 presses the opinion of this Society            of  the manner     in which     he has
 been doing his work.           It would not become me to pursue the sub
ject of    the influence     of  one mind     upon another, due to their close
 contact, by singling out some of the fervent workers in this Society                as
 the insensible creations of the good men who have lived before them.
 The fact is patent.         Good men have raised up good men to succeed
  them.     Our Transactions of        the present period contain          papers not
  a  few destined to take their place in the permanent repertories of
  science.    We    have about us workers whose praise is wide                spread,
 but this is not the place to sound it.            The only word      I  can venture
 on as both encouraging for the present and hopeful for the future,
  is the remarkable number of young men who are                   just entering     on
  their work.      In   the fasciculus of the Society's Proceedings just
  issued,  I count    not less than eleven names of young men just enter
  ing on their      career    of investigation.       How many of them have
 caught their inspiration          from contact with those older workers
 who have been long among us              !  How many have          been drawn out
  and cheered on      by the associations of this        room   !

           Professor   KELLAND,          President, in the Chair.
   The following Communications were read                 : —
I. On the Action of Light on the Iris. By William Ackroyd,
      F.I.C., &c. Communicated by Professor M'Kendrick.
   Sect.   I. It is well known    that the movements        of the iris are due
to the    stimulus of light, but   I am not aware      that any experiments
have been hitherto      made to determine       the approximate quantity       of
that agent necessary to bring about this involuntary action.                The
usual way of observation precludes refined           experimenting, it being
customary to watch the iris of another person or animal whilst under
the influence of varying amounts of light, or one's own iris by means
of a mirror.      Three methods will be described here, and            I believe
that one at least may afford     a means    of getting new data on this and
other points.
   Sect.   II. The first and second methods depend upon the following
facts  : — That, if  a divergent   bundle of rays emanate         from a small
surface or hole,    very near to the eye (say about 30 mm. off), this
surface or hole is the apex of a cone      of light whoso base is the pupil     ;
that every movement of the iris affects the area of this base, which
   VOL.   X.                                                           F

38                       Proceedings of tJu Royal Society
appears as a circular luminous            field; and finally, that      I  find these
alterations of area, so easily seen, maybe taken               as indications of the
movements         of the iris.
    The third method is equally simple.               The lachrymal fluid on the
surface of the cornea affects the            image of any light source, such as
a  lamp or star, and by refraction causes the appearance of raj's to
emanate therefrom.
    It  is obvious that the length of these rays must be regulated                    by
the iris, this organ being nearer to the retina, hence when the                    pupil
contracts      the rays ought to shorten,         and when the pupil expands
the rays ought to lengthen out.               Such  I  find to  be the case.
    Sect.   III.   The First or Reflection Method. — The following is the
simplest form of the experiment I have been able to devise.                         Bur
nish the head of an ordinary brass pin, and place the pin up to head
in   a black hat.        Now, with one eye shut and your back to the light,
bring this pin-head near to the other eye so that the light may he
reflected into       it from  the convex surface of the pin-head.
    One sees      a circular    luminous field, with projecting hairs at the
bottom which belong to the top eyelid.*                  Globules of the lachrymal
fluid also appear at each wink.
    Expt.    1.   Shade the light from the observing eye for          a few seconds,
then let the       light fall   on  it again.    Notice the alteration in area        of
the field of view.          The field contracts,      then expands      slightly, and
oscillates    until    the iris is adjusted     for the amount of light falling
into the eye.
    Expt.    2.   Observe the       pin-head    with     the  right   eye   for    some
moments,        the left eye being closed.         Open the left eye.         The iris
of the right eye is         seen  to move      markedly, the pupil contracting.
Here the iris of the right         eye  is moved by the light entering the left
one.
    Expt.    3.   With everything       as  in Expt.     2, have   both eyes closed
and only open the right or observing eye.                   There is contraction of
the pupil, but apparently no more marked                 than in Expt.     2.
   *
       A simple method is here suggested for demonstrating to one's self the in
verting action of the crystalline lens.       With everything as here described, take
a needle and bring it across the field of view close to the eyelids.          If it more
doicnwards, it appears to move upwards ; if it he moved upwards, it appears to
come doumwards.

    Sect. IV.      The Second or Transmission Method.              — Prick   a  pin-hole
in tinfoiL       Shut     one eye and bring the hole within            12 rain, oil' the
open eye.
    Es/,fs.   1, 2,   and   3 may   readily be repeated by this method.
    Kept.   4. Place green         glass  before     the aperture,     and notice      the
size  of the     field, then withdraw          the    glass   suddenly.      The pupil
contracts.       Red glass gave the same result.
    Sect. V. The Third or Refraction Method. — The following ex
ample will make perfectly clear the way of working                        here  : —I   am
looking     at a star,    with   the moon at     full,  a little to one side.      From
the star proceed the rays mentioned at the clo?e of Sect.                   II.    Upon
turning towards           the   moon,    but still keeping my attention con
centrated on the star, the rays of the latter appear to retreat into it                    ;
and upon turning            from the light of the moon,            the   rays emanate
from the star again.
    Erpt.   5.   This    is   typical of about seventy          other experiments         I
have made.         The night is starless.         An isolated      gas lamp,    with no
houses near or any other sources of light, appears                 when seen from a
distance with        the usual rays emanating from it.             I walk towards it
slowly.      At    300 yards no alteration has taken place                in  the rays;
they appear       fixed.      The distance is slowly decreased, but not until
I  am at a distance        of 16 yards do the rays perceptibly shorten;                 in
other words, the light from this one gas lamp is incompetent to
effect a movement of ray iris           until  I  am within 16 yards of it.          Tin:
shortening of the rays is now rapid, for at 10 yards distance                         the
light appears to be without them.
    Expt.    6.  In   the preceding experiment           there is a possibility      that
the rays may be shortened to some extent by the increase in size of
the image on the surface of the cornea as we near the light.                      In  the
present experiment this objection is to some extent removed.                        Two
gas lamps were chosen,           50 yards apart, and whilst walking towards
the nearest my attention was kept exclusively on the rays emanating
from the farthest one.             As  the first   lamp is approached,        the effect
of its light on the iris is visible in the alteration of length of rays
proceeding from the far one.                Thus in the fig. the two lamps are
A   and B, and the observer           stationed at O     sees rays   emanating from
both.     A   is the lamp whose          influence on the iris is to be tested,
and B is the lamplight               used   as  a   tester.     Proceeding from O

     40                      Proceedings        of the Royal Society
     towards B,         a point     b is reached at    which the lamp rays of I) bejjin
      to shorten, i.e., the light of           A  affects the iris.     Getting nearer      still
,
>                                            o      a-     a                               £ b
   to A, a point V is reached, where the distant light                    i, appears to have
    lost its rays.
        The average of           a dozen    experiments gave        as  the value of     LA...
    14 yards,       and     as   the value     of   VA...    8   yards.     Squaring     these
    numbers,       it  appears      that about one-third of the light competent              to
   contract the pupil very markedly is sufficient to start its movement.
        At    present,    I  abstain from comment,            as  I  am continuing       these
   experiments.
               2.   On a New Variety of Ocular Spectrum.                           By
                                           John Aitken.
        If   we look for a short time at any object, and afterwards turn
   the eye      in another direction,         we see a spectral image        of the form of
   the object first looked at.
       Again,     if  after we have looked at any coloured              object we turn the
   eye in another direction, wo see a spectral image of a colour compli
   mentary to that first looked at.
       In addition         to these spectral        forms   and    colours,   I find there is
  another and distinct kind of ocular spectrum,                      which we may call        a
  motion spectrum.               It  is seen when we look first at a body in motion
  and afterwards direct the eye towards an object at rest.                        The object
  at rest, when seen under these conditions, seems to be                          in motion,
  and the direction            of its apparent motion is the opposite              of that of
  the moving body first looked at.
       I  first observed this motion spectrum when looking at the surface
  of a river where            it   was   flowing rapidly, the eye being afterwards
  directed       to a gravel        bank.    The first effect seemed to be an indis
  tinctness       of vision, but,         on carefully    repeating     the experiment,      I
  was much astonished to observe                   that, after looking steadily at the
  stream       and    then at the gravel bank, a narrow spectral                   stream   of
  gravel      seemed to flow steadily through the                  middle of the gravel
  bank, the direction of its motion being the opposite                      of that of the

                              of Edinburgh,             Session 1878-79.                                    41
river.         Sir D. Brewster               made      some experiments while                  looking out
of rapid-moving                trains on the effect of images moving rapidly across
the retina,            but    he does        not seem to have             observed           these   motion
spectra.           Professor         Silvanus         P. Thompson has, however, observed
a   somewhat             similar phenomenon.*                 He   says       :   —"   If,   from    a   rapid
railway train, objects from which the train     receding be watched,     is
they seem to shrink as they are left behind, their images contracting
and      moving from the                  edges of the retina towards its centre.                           If,
after watching this motion for some time, the gaze be transferred                                            to
an object at             a   constant distance from the            eye,   it      seems to be actually
expanding and approaching."
  Under ordinary circumstances                               motion      npectra        are    not       easily
noticed.               Like form and colour             spectra they require special                 precau
tions to be taken before                       they can be distinctly observed.                      I    find,
however, that these precautions are extremely simple, and that but
little apparatus              is   required for showing them distinctly.
       Simply          take    a circular        cardboard      disc,f     painted as shown in
fig.     1,   and mount         it   on    a   hori
zontal shaft.                 Now,     if,   while
this disc          is    being steadily ro

that of the exciting disc.                     Or we may vary the experiment, and
look at     a   sheet    of paper having             a     mottled surface.*                  When we do
so, after       looking at the rotating disc, we                      see   a    circular spectrum               of
the     disc,    in which the markings on the paper                                 no longer appear
stationary, but all seem moving in                         a    circular direction, like               a   slow-
moving whirlpool, the direction of the motion being the opposite                                                 of
that of the exciting disc.
     In   these cases the motion was circular, and the result was                                     a    circu
lar spectral motion.               We      may, however,           vary the experiment, when
we shall find that the spectrum                      will always            correspond        to the      excit
ing motion.          Suppose        we take an endless band of paper,                           with black
bars      painted across          it,    and   pass       it   over     two drums revolving on
horizontal shafts, one placed over the other, so that the paper band
shall move in            a   straight line either upwards or downwards.                                         If,
while this band              is   in motion, the eye be fixed upon                         it   for    a   short
time and then the gaze bo directed to the mottled paper,                                       a   spectrum
of the moving band will                   be seen.        A     narrow          strip of the mottlings
will    appear     to flow through the mottled                        sheet       of paper, reminding
one strongly of the appearance                   of       a    lava stream, the breadth                of the
stream corresponding to the breadth of the moving paper band, and
the direction of its apparent                  motion being the opposite                      of the mov
ing band first looked              at.
     Or we may vary the experiment in this way: — Take                                             a   wheel,

similar to that first described,                     but in this case kept stationary, so
that the white parts seem to travel from the centre to the circum
ference, or from the circumference                        to the centre            of the disc, accord
ing to the direction in which the wheel                           is    turned.          If   the mottled
paper     is    looked at after looking at the apparatus in motion, all the
mottlings in the spectrum seem to be in motion, either towards the

of the real impression.
     These  motion     spectra    are also seen    if  the eyes are closed after
looking at the moving            body, the spectrum of the moving paper
band suggesting a phantom shower of rain in sunshine, the direc
tion of the apparent motion being the opposite                of that of the real
impression.
     It  might be thought, since the spectrum               of the moving band
seen on the        mottled paper seems to be in motion, and as some of
 the mottlings seem to flow past the          others, that     if  we were to draw
 a straight    line across the spectral      stream, the line ought to appear
 bent, because it might be expected that the part of the line in the
 stream would appear to move forwards.                 Such, however,      is not the
 case.     So far   as  my experiments go,        I   have   never seen the least
 appearance       of a bend produced in a straight line;                indeed, the
 straight line does much to stop the apparent motion.                  Again, in the
 first experiment with the circular disc,           if we make      the  drawing at
 which     we afterwards look        larger than the exciting disc,          — as, for
  instance, by extending the spokes            of the wheel to a greater           size
  than the rotating disc,     — then this extension will entirely         destroy    all
  appearance     of rotation, and the wheel will appear           at rest.    Do not
  these last experiments suggest that the seat of the illusion is deeper
  than the retinal         I  shall not, however, attempt to answer this
  question, as the experiments do not point to any definite conclusion.
      Experiments were also made to determine the effect of influencing
  the whole retina.        This    was   done   by looking        so closely at     the
  moving band that its image covered              the whole retina, but no de
   cided effect was noticed.         Experiments       were   also made      with   the
   same object by means of a large          box-shaped arrangement,          the sides
   of which    were made     of tracing  paper having vertical bands of black
   paper 4 cm. broad and fixed 4 cm. apart.            The observer beini,' seated
   in  a chair, the box was let down over him and put in motion, which
   was continued some time ; the box was then raised, but no appear
   ance   of motion in surrounding        objects was observed.          There were,
   however, some curious effects produced by the rotation                      of this
   apparatus.      At certain times, while surrounded by the rotating box,
   the  observer felt as if rotating in the opposite direction.              The most
   certain result, however, was         a  most   disagreeable      sickening effect,

                             (Read 16th December     1878.)
                                       (Abstract.)
    In this memoir I      examine       the principles of the logical calculus of
 Booie,   as  laid down in his celebrated            treatise   on the   "Laws of
 Thought,"      and also the     criticisms which have been published con-
 corning these principles.           I    bring forward     a  new theory    of the
 operation of the        mind,     founded      upon an      analysis of language
and the nature of mathematical reasoning,                   which enables    me  to
correct    these    principles.   to     place  them on a clear, rational, and
generalised     basis, and to show that there is a logical algebra           which
coincides with the ordinary algebra              when its symbols are integral,
but is   a generalised     form of the ordinary algebra when its symbols
are fractional.       Hence all the theorems           in ordinary   algebra  when
generalised     properly are true in the logical algebra.              I  show the
analytical meaning of the axioms of logic and their relation to the
algebraic axioms of operation.               By  means of this algebra     I inves
tigate   the theory of immediate inference,             and   also the conclusions
and numbers of conclusions of different kinds which can be deduced
from premises of certain          given forms.       The memoir also professes
to prove a great number of new theorems                in the theory of necessary
and probable      inference.

       1. Notes on some Experiments with the Telephone.
                             By James Blyth, M.A.
   While experimenting with               an ordinary      Bell telephone,         of small
resistance,   I found    that it   was able to reveal the existence             of electric
currents produced by the mere friction between conducting substances.
This   was shown       in  the   following way.         Two    files had wires firmly
connected to them, and were thereby attached to the terminals of
a telephone circuit          in    a   distant room.       When        these    files were
rubbed against each other,           a most   distinct grating noise was heard in
the receiving telephone.              In order     to  find   if this sound varied,
when different substances            were rubbed together,          the following plan
 was adopted.       A    wire was firmly attached             to a small table-vico,
 and led to one of the terminals             of the telephone circuit, while the
 wire from the other terminal was attached                  to a clamp into which
any substance,       which      it    was   desired to test, could be screwed.
Different substances were then screwed into the vice and clamp, and
rubbed against each other by an assistant,                  in each       case,   as far as
possible, with the same pressure.                 By listening attentively in           the
receiving telephone,        I  endeavoured        to detect any variation in            the
sound as the assistant             passed     from    one    substance       to another.
As far  as  I could     judge, little or no variation            was produced when
the following     substances        were rubbed on themselves               and on each
other, viz.  :  steel,   brass,    iron, zinc, lead, gas carbon, copper, with
possibly the exception of copper on iron, which,                  I  thought, gave the
sound a little louder.
   It  was different, however, when                 two pieces       of antimony       and
bismuth    were    rubbed together.             In this   case the sound was de
cidedly louder.        I tried    also,  with    a very distinct        effect, antimony
rubbing on gold, and antimony on silver.

40                     Proceedings     of the Royal Society
    In   order to augment the currents,            and consequently the sounds
produced in this way,         I took   a large iron fly-wheel mounted on an
axis which ran in centres.            By  a wire attached       to one of the centres
this wheel was connected           to one     of    the   terminals of the circuit,
while    a   file was connected     to  the    other terminal.          The wheel was
then driven rapidly round, and the file held hard on to its rim, — so
hard that sparks of fire were produced               by the friction.        In this way
a very     distinct noise was heard in the receiving telephone.                     I have
also made a variety of the above              experiment by mounting              a  small
cylinder       of antimony     in   a  turning-lathe,        and   driving      it round
against      a bar of bismuth.         This     produces     the loudest and most
distinct noise of anything which            I  have yet tried.
   These experiments demonstrate,              without      doubt, the existence          of
currents produced in conducting substances                  by friction alone,       but it
becomes         a  question   whether they are to be regarded                  as. merely
thermo-electric, or whether they are not the very currents referred
to by    Sir William Thomson as the probable                  cause of friction, and
     Professor Tait, in his " Thermo dynamics,"                where      he says,   " it is
by
possible that all friction, not excepting that caused by actual abrasion,
is due to the production of electricity."
    Instead of rubbing the substances               together,   I  next proceeded to
try the effect of knocking the one against                the other.       For this pur
pose a small anvil was put into metallic connection with one of the
terminals of the circuit, and          a hammer         similarly connected         to the
other.       Each stroke of the hammer              on the anvil was very          faintly
heard in the distant telephone.             As    a  variety of this experiment            1
put   a  small quantity of detonating powder on the anvil, and came
down upon it with           a blow from the hammer.                 I  thought that it
might bo possible to hear something of the sharp snap produced
by such       a   blow.   The sound, however,          heard   in  the telephone       was
not appreciably louder than before.                  Another variety of this ex
periment was made by driving                a   wheel, with large teeth, rapidly
round in the turning-lathe, and holding against                    it  a strong metal
spring.       The rapid clicks produced in this way were heard even
when the telephone was a short distance from the                     ear.     Here, how
ever,   it  is plain that we have       a  mixture of the effects produced               by
nibbing and knocking.
   In   my next experiment        I  took   a   phonograph, and so arranged               it

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                                   47
that a telephone           circuit   was completed                through the spring which
carries      the   pricker,   the pricker         itself, and the cylinder.               When
the    pricker      was    allowed to press hard into the groove,                       and the
cylinder turned, a faint grating noise                       was heard in the telephone',
unless at those points where there happened                              to have been regular
serrate     markings left by      the tool       in cutting        the groove, and then, as
the pricker passed over these,               a   sound more              or less resembling       a
feeble attempt at an articulation was heard.                         I   then put     a sheet    of
tinfoil on the phonograph cylinder, and spoke a                            sentence    loud and
distinct into the mouthpiece, and, for the purpose                           of increasing the
sound, as heard in the .telephone,                I   also included two Bunsen's cells
in tbe circuit.           When the phonograph                was now turned, so as to re
produce       the sentence, the articulation                  was heard      in   the receiving
telephone,         loud enough certainly, but considerably marred                        by the
mere rasping          of the pricker         on       the natural         inequalities of the
tinfoil.
      It   is obvious that, in this experiment, the articulation, such as it
 is, heard in the telephone must be caused by the variation in the
 resistance to the current, which arises from the unequal pressure of
 the pricker upon the tinfoil           as   it follows its indentations.              This   has,
 I think,     an important bearing upon the character of all curves                             got
 by different processes of enlargement                      from the tinfoil record.       Such
 curves could only accurately correspond                          to the movements        of the
 disc which produced the indentations, provided the style attached
 to the lever, for producing the enlargement,                        pressed      exactly on the
 tinfoil     as the pricker did.         Now,         seeing      that the pricker does not
 press equally at all times on the                 tinfoil, it would         be very difficult,
 if not impossible,        so to arrange a style and enlarging lever as to press
 in   a manner so exactly similar.
      The telephone can be employed to illustrate, in a very pleasing
 way, the incipient stage in the breaking-up of a liquid vein into
 globules.         For this   purpose   a vein of acidulated water is mado part
 of    a   telephone circuit, which also includes one or two Bunsen cells.
 This is easily managed by attaching a metallic can, having a small
 orifice in its bottom, to one of the terminals of the circuit, and a
 shallow metallic basin to the other.                  The first vessel, being now filled
 with acidulated water, is held              over the basin, so that the column of
 water from the orifice flows into                    it,   and    so completes      the electric

circuit.    By gradually raising or lowering the upper vessel, a longer
or shorter column of liquid can be made part of the circuit.                   On
listening in the telephone, so long as the liquid vein is short and
limpid, no sound whatever is heard.             This   shows that the electric
current has uninterrupted circulation.          On gradually lengthening the
liquid vein, a point is reached when a rattling noise is heard in the
telephone.       This arises from the altered resistance caused by the
liquid vein beginning to break up into globules.                  On still farther
lengthening the vein,      a  point is very soon reached         when all sound
in the telephone      again ceases.    This  corresponds    to the stage when
the liquid vein has actually separated          into detached      drops, and so
 broken entirely the electric circuit.
 2.   On the Measurement of Beknottedncss.                 By Professor Tait.
                                    (Abstract.)
    In  my former papers on the subject of Knots,         I  have provisionally
 measured Beknottedness       by the smallest     number of changes of sign
 at the crossings, which     will render all   the crossings     nugatory.
    Though     I  have not seen occasion to doubt the accuracy of this
 mode of measurement,        there are two objections to       it — (1) It  is wry
 difficult of application in complex cases         ; (2) It suggests no direct
 relation to the electrodynamic method which, except in the case of
 knots wholly or partially amphicheiral, gives results quite in accord
 ance  with  it.
    The object of the present        paper  is to describe a method which,
 while at least partially meeting        these objections, very considerably
 simplifies some of the more important processes for the treatment of
 knots, which     I have already given.
     In this abstract a very simple example        will  suffice to indicate the
 method.     Take the following six-fold knot
 and modify the sketch,      as on   next page, the dotted line being traced
 always on the right-hand side of the full line      as we go    round the curve.

                   of Edinburgh,     Session 1878-79.                    49
    [In practice, the dotted line may conveniently be drawn with a
coloured pencil or crayon.]
   A little consideration    shows that —
   1.  Of the four angles at each crossing, one is enclosed         between
full lines, and its vertical angle by dotted [coloured] lines.        These
will be called the symmetrical angles.
    2.  The crossing is electrodynamically positive    if it  is over In lite
right in the symmetrical angles, and vice versa.
    [In the figure the two interior crossings  alone are positive.]
    3. If the knot be cut through along        a line dividing the sym
 metrical angles at any crossing, and the pairs of ends on either side
 of that    line  be   reunited, the whole   remains    a knot,    with  one
 crossing less than before (Proa, 1877, p. 322).         If the line divide
 the unsymmetrical angles, the whole becomes a link.
     [Dividing the figure at the upper crossing, it    becomes either the
 twist of five-fold knottiness, or the trefoil knot    once linked with a
 simple ring.]
     These methods are in practice very much superior in convenience
  of application    to those I  have already given, especially when the
  knot to be reduced is complex.
      The paper contains rules for the calculation of the beknottedness
  of the original knot, in terms of the beknottedness and belinkedness
  of these reduced forms     ; so that knottiness   n is made     to depend
  upon n - 1.     I  have  not yet succeeded  in obtaining from      these a
  general   expression such as will take account of all the successive
  reductions of a knot to zero of knottiness.

4.   On the Disruptive Discharge of Electricity.                   By Alexander
               Macfarlane, D.Sc., and P. M. Playfair, M.A.
                                      (Abstract.)
    During     the months of November and December                of this Session
we    have     investigated certain      questions   suggested     by the results
already communicated          to the Society.
    Difference     of Potential required to pass       a spark between (1) ttro
equal    spherical balk at different distances,        (2) a plate and Ixdl      at
different    distances, and (3) a plate and point at different distances.
    A   series of observations     was taken for each of these, and on three
successive days, without altering the arrangement                of the apparatus
or the charge of the electrometer.            The couple of small Leyden jars
were attached        to the conductors      of the Holtz machine,       as we  had
previously found that it was impossible to observe the discharge
between       a plate   and   point with any degree of accuracy when the
capacity     was small
     Two Balls,     each  of -j inch diameter.    — The   series of observations
for the two balls       i3 a more    minute and extended investigation of a
problem we took up and solved approximately before.                      We have
observed       more   minutely the values of the readings           at the smaller
distances,      and also noted the cause of the irregularity at the ends.
We found that         at 80 mm.     small violet sparks began to pass before
the principal white spark, and that the reading was then more am
biguous than for smaller distances.             Escape from the conductor was
 first noticed at 120 mm.*
    Plate and Ball. — We employed              a  tin plate   8 inches    diameter,
and one of the brass balls used in the previous                 experiment.    The
 curve obtained is not very different from that for the two balls            ; it is
 somewhat       more circular.     Small sparks passing before the large one
 were observed to begin at a shorter distance              than   in the previous
 case.     Another irregularity at the end was due to the passing of two
 large    sparks.      Finally,   the   electricity began to escape from the
 insulated wires.
     Plate and Point.      —The     plate used was the      tin  plate of the pre-
    *
       Hence the irregularity previously observed is not due to the escape of
 electricity into the air, but to the passage of small sparks between the
 electrodes.

                         of Edinburgh,               Session 1878-79.                                      r.i
vions experiment          ;    the point was conical and of braes.                            From     1   to
5 mm,    the discharge was in the form of a white spark                                   ;   for higher
distances nothing was visible excepting                           a    glow at the point.              The
series was continued up to 200 mm., as there was no difficulty due
to escapeof the electricity into the air.
  Discharge through a Solid Dielectric. — We obtained, by favour
of Mr Calderwood, of Addiewell Chemical Works, a quantity of a
pure solid paraffin of low melting point.                             The plate electrodes were
separated to a distance of               J   inch inside a glass vessel, the liquefied
paraffin poured in so as to cover the plates completely, and then
allowed to solidify for twenty-four                           hours.        When the          plate    elec
trodes     were charged             the first spark which                   passed   was       large   and
illuminated the whole of                the paraffin; but the succeeding                      discharges
were much smaller, and of equal amount.                                 The first spark produced
a deflection       3-6 times as great as the succeeding                         sparks.        When        the
plate of paraffin was examined afterwards, it was found to be per
forated in a zigzag manner, the hole being surrounded by char.                                             We
found      that   —

    As     an     instance of how the3e experiments may be made directly
 useful,    I     may mention that we obtained two samples                                      of liquid
             Mr Calderwood
 paraffin from                                       to   compare           their electric strength.
 We found the ratio to be P 6.                       It   is,   however, extremely difficult to
 effect the comparison unless we have                         a   considerable quantity of each
 specimen.          It   is   best to have       a   dish of the above form, whore we can

  have    broad     plates,    the lower oue         slightly     raised   above     the   glass
  bottom, and the upper one well                     immersed       in the liquid.          The
  former of these conditions helps to prevent solid particles getting                         in
  between    the plates, and the latter prevents the rising of the                       liquid
  up the stem, aud consequent              splashing about of liquid particles.
     Discharge through            Paraffin    Vapour. — We put the discharging
  vessel, with a quantity          of one of the pure        liquid   paraffins,   inside the
  receiver of an air-pump, exhausted                the air, and allowed the paraffin
  vapour to accumulate.               When      the    barometer-gauge         indicated 50
  mm. pressure, the distance           being   \   inch, we took sparks through the
 vapour.      The spark was of          a broad      section, green at either end,          but
 of a deep violet between.              When     a  quantity of air was let in, white
 jagged sparks were observed                in the midst of the coloured spark.
 From the readings obtained at 50 mm. pressure, we infer that this
 paraffin vapour is T7 times as strong as air.
                 5.   Laboratory Note.              By Professor Tait.
     Last autumn         I   received    from    Mr Maclachlan of Lower Green,
 Mitcham, some specimens of india-rubber tape which had been for
 several    years    wound, under considerable tension, helically                       round
copper wire.         At ordinary       temperatures,        after being peeled off, the
 material shows no tendency to contract                   ;  but   Mr Maclachlan found
 that in hot water it almost instantly resumes its original dimensions.
     I have    recently reproduced           almost     exactly the same results            by
stretching sheet india-rubber, slightly warmed, helically round glass
tubes,    and immersing it for a short time in a freezing                           mixture.
Some of the specimens               thus produced         in   a few minutes compared
favourably in their after behaviour in hot water with those of                              Mr
Maclachlan.
    Even without the use of               a  freezing mixture the effect may bo
produced,     though not         so  perfectly, by drawing out the heated india-
rubber to the point at which its intensibility begins to diminish
very rapidly.         If  it  be held for a few seconds in that state of exten
sion, it shows very little tendency to contract                       till it is  immersed
again    in hot     water.      Then it is instantly reduced to one-fourth or
one-fifth of its previous length, but remains                    permanently stretched
to three or four times            its original length.          This operation        may be

performed many times in succession on the same specimen with the
same results.
    Professor Clerk-Maxwell informs me that similar results arc to be
obtained      with gutta-percha, drawn out when           cooled,  after being
boiled in water.
    The subject is especially interesting as an exaggerated example of
the Ehistuche Nachmrkung, which has recently been discussed at
great length by Boltzmann and others.

                      I.  Acetate  of Trimethyl-Sulphine.
    The acetate is formed by treating the iodide of trimethyl-sulphinc
 with   acetate of silver.    On leaving the strong solution over sulphuric
 acid in vacuo for three weeks no crystallisation took place.       The syrup
 on being heated     in  a small retort gave off water, and, without solidi

but on shaking the mixture with solution of chloride of mercury,
the sulphide of methyl was removed,              leaving a few drops of acetate
of methyl, easily recognised by its fruity smell.

                     II.  Benzoate   of Trimethyl-sulphine.
     The   benzoate    is formed by        treating the iodide     of trimethyl-
sulphine with benzoate of silver.             The solution of the salt can be
evaporated     on the water bath to a syrup.            On leaving it for about
two weeks over sulphuric acid              a  very few    crystals were formed,
which could not       be separated     from the very thick syrup in which
they were suspended.           By adding alcohol it         was   obtained more
easily in small thin plates.         After several days of very cold weather
a   crust formed over the surface of the aqueous solution.
     The thick aqueous        solution on being heated to 10(F C. with a
 current of dry ah passing        over    it gave off some water, but the salt
 did not solidify.       On continuing to heat at about 110°          C,    the clear
 liquid  became milky, sulphide of methyl was given off, and a layer
 of a liquid    formed     above   the heavy       aqueous  solution.      This  was
 collected apart, dried by means of chloride of calcium, and gave                   as
 its boiling point 198°     C, that of      benzoate of methyl.    The decompo
 sition is expressed by the following equation          :—

                   III.   Dithionate of Trimethyl-mlphine.
      The dithionate is formed           by neutralising    an aqueous       solution

  evaporating    a solution of the salt on the water            bath it begins to
  crystallise out.     On leaving the saturated         solution to cool, a large
  quantity   of clear cubical crystals         was obtained,    not hygroscopic,
  insoluble   in hot alcohol,       and,     when   dry, without    any smell of
  sulphide of methyl.

begins to come off also, aud the substance melts.             Heat was applied

      The following     observations       of the temperature           of  the   water at
different depths below the ice covering Linlithgow Loch were made
                                                             " half-turn "

ing thermometers,        which proved to be            a  useful instrument for this
 species    of inquiry.       It was     necessary,       however,     to fit it with a
suitable inverting contrivance,           as  this part of the apparatus supplied
by the maker's is quite useless.              The temperatures          have received a
provisional correction for error of graduation, and they may still
 have to receive     a  further, though certainly very slight, rectification,
 when    a  thorough comparison         with     a   Kew standard        has been made.
The results are given in the table, to which are appended particulars
of position and date corresponding to the stations.

 Here a sample of the water was collected         from   a  depth of 10 feet
 below the ice.    No    temperature   observations were made.
   The observations on the 6th January 1879,               at Station     No.   1
were made principally       with a view to test the action of the thermo
meter   and the inverting      apparatus,   and also to determine at what
depth the water would be found at the temperature              corresponding
to its maximum density.         The result of this day's operations was to
show   that   the thermometer was suitable for such work, and t',
indicate two remarkable conditions of the water of the loch;            nam<4y

 observed     at all at any depth between          the  ice and   the bottom ; and
 second, that the curve representing the vertical distribution                  of tem
 perature    had a point of contrary flexure, showing that the actual
 distribution could never have resulted from the freezing of                     a   thin
 layer on the surface of      a large    volume of water at    a  uniform tempera
 ture, and     the further cooling of       it by conduction from        the lower ice
 surface.     The observed temperatures           showed that,    if   the water     had
 ever    been    at  a  uniform      temperature     throughout      its depth,      that
 temperature       was certainly      much below 39 '2°, and          that while the

was being warmed          by conduction and convection upwards from a
source of heat at the bottom.
     These unexpected      results induced me to repeat my visits to the
loch, and the observations at Stations Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were made
on the 9th and 11th January.                It will  be seen that the results of
them     fully  bear out the conclusions          derived from the preliminary
observations at Station        ]S"o.  1.   At Stations Nos.      2   and    4, situated
in    the  deep western basin of the           loch, the suspected        heating sur
face is separated      by a sufficiently thick stratum of water to enable
its action to be studied separately.              The observations at No.          4  are

temperature rises very quickly in the first fathom, then very slowly
for    some    distance, until, in the neighbourhood of the bottom, it
again rises qnickly, reaching 39-85° in the mud.                                   Had      the water of
the loch been            in the condition usually imagined                             to   immediately
precede       freezing      —that     is,    at the temperature at which                          its water
attains a maximum                  density uniformly               throughout            its depth, wo
should      expect       to find in the distribution                        of temperature             in the
water after the formation of ice the remains of this condition.                                             The
condition referred            to would be represented                   graphically by            a   straight
line drawn parallel to               the line of depths through the temperature
of maximum density,                 and     if   there      were        no supply or removal of
heat from any other quarter than the surface, the curve of tempera
tures at any subsequent time when the loch was covered with ice
would tend           to coincide with            this line at          a    sufficient depth.               The
source      of heat which          these observations show to exist at the bottom
of Linlithgow Loch would                     have    a   tendency to mask but not to ob
literate these remains.                If    the curve of Station                No.   4    be studied in
this light we discover the remains of                         a   comparatively uniform tem
perature of approximately 37°, more than half the water being at                                              a
 temperature between               36-5° and 37'5°.                If   we imagine          the water to
 have been        at   a    certain date uniformly at the temperature                             37°, and
 the surface to have been suddenly covered with ice, and at the same
 time   a   source     of heat to have been applied at the bottom, the dis
 tribution of          temperature          shortly afterwards would,                  I    think, be of
 the    kind      represented        in the       curve.          It    must      be observed            that,
 assuming the water to be pure, both the loss of heat from the sur
face and the supply of                it    from the bottom would affect the inter
 mediate waters by conduction                       alone     until        the   temperature           of the
 bottom had been raised to 39-2°.                        In   the present         case      this tempera
 ture has just been                passed,    and, admitting                the water to bo pure,
 convection would             be beginning            to come into play.                     That      it   has
 begun to do so              is    shown by the flatness                    of   the curvo near             the
 bottom, compared            with its       steepness near the ice.
      Having established            the existence        of this unexpected thermal state
 of the water,         it   was    necessary        to find an explanation.                       The first
 that occurred to me was to suppose that the water of Linlithgow
 Loch       was    not      pure    water,       but contained               dissolved       ingredients.

sufficient to bring its temperature                of maximum density down from
39-2° to about 37°.            Three or four parts of common salt dissolved in
one thousand parts           of the water would be sufficient to produce this
effect, and       it did not     seem     extravagant to look upon this as the
probable solution           of the problem, especially as the loch is the
receptacle for the whole sewage of the town of                        Linlithgow and the
refuse      of several     works.        Accordingly,        on the       20th January, a
sample of water was drawn from                   a  depth of ten feet below the ice
at Station         No.  5, and examined.            My supposition          appeared     likely
to be confirmed by the overpoweringly horrible                         stench    emitted     by
the water, which           argued     an   amount of pollution             not inconsistent
with     a large    quantity of dissolved saline matter.                   On examination,
however,       it  was found to be otherwise.
     When freshly drawn the water was clear, but had become slightly
turbid by the time           it  reached      the laboratory       ; this turbidity disap
peared      on diluting      the water with a large quantity of alcohol.                      It
reacted neutral to test-papers.                Its   specific   gravity was       1 -00035    at
39 "9°     F,   that of distilled       water, at the same             temperature,       being
unity.
     The *mell of the water was removed by boiling.                       Neither sulphate
<if   cipper nor alkaline acetate of lead solutions produced any pre
cipitate of sulphides.
     Finally,     the water contained            only 0-03 grammes             chlorine in a
litre, and was evidently remarkably free from saline ingredients.
     It  remains     to determine by experiment              tjie actual temperature          at
which this water attains            a  maximum density, and also, bv observa
tions in other lochs, whether             a  similar distribution         of temperature      is
to be found.
     Considering the excessively            foul state of the loch, and especially
of the mud at the bottom of the western part, the evolution of heat
cannot      be  wondered at.
     It will    be seen     from the table that the observations made at
No.     2 on the      9th agree substantially with those made at No.                       4 on
the 11th January.             At Stations Nos.           1   and     3   the depth of the

are different.         At No.     1  the water near         the surface       is colder,    and
that near the bottom warmer than at No.                         2.    At No.      1  the   tem
perature       of the mud was not observed, but it would no doubt be

the same water      at  No.  3  being 37 -i" and the mud 37 "8°.      No.  1,
being   on the slope      next the town, is exposed to the filth to be
derived from it   ; it is therefore   not surprising that the bottom water
is warmer than      at No. 3, which is situated on the banks near the
northern shore, where the water is comparatively clear.

   The equation
                                       x2 = x
 expresses  the  condition    that the symbol x be single and positive.
 The equation
                                            — x
 expresses the   condition    that the symbol x be single and negative.
 The principle of contradiction
                                 x  (1  -x)   =0
 can be legitimately      deduced      with   the  help of the fundamental
 axioms of the science.
    The memoir contains       a general     investigation of the conclusions
 which can be drawn from two or more premises            : —

     The Keith Prize for the biennial period 1875-77, which has
 been awarded          to Professor         Heddle, for his papers on the
 "
   Rhombohedral Carbonates,"                 and    on the " Felspars of Scot
 land," originally communicated to the Society, and containing
 important discoveries, was presented by the President (Pro
 fessor Kelland) with the following remarks : —
 Professor       Heddle, — I      am    here   to-night to exemplify          a   remark
 which is often made, that to insure success in an address                    such as      I
 am about to deliver, the best way is to commit the charge of                   it to one
 absolutely ignorant of the subject.             No   false pride    will then stand      in
 the  way of the best sources of information,                    nor will any undue
 admixture of half knowledge clog and darken the truth.                       For every
 particular contained in these remarks, then,              I   at once unhesitatingly
 acknowledge mvself indebted to Professor Geikie.                        When      I   first
 became acquainted with this Society forty years                   ago, there used        to
 frequent     our meetings        men who had the reputation of being
 mineralogists     rather    than     geologists' — Lord Greenock, Allan, and
 probably Jameson himself.             That race has now died out, and with
 them    mineralogy      as  a   distinct   science    has     all but lain dormant
 amongst us.       During    the preceding quarter of a century that science
 had flourished nowhere more vigorously than in Edinburgh.                            Pro
fessor    Jameson     introduced       the   deliniteness       and    system     of the
 Freyburg school, and infused into his pupils such                  a love  of minerals
that numerous       private cabinets        were formed      ;  while under his fos
tering care the University          Museum grew into           a large  and admirable
series.     One of my first acts        as  Professor in the University was to
vote out of the      Iieid Fund, which         had   just   come into our hands, a
large    sum    (some    thousands) to pay back monies                   expended on
minerals throughout a series of years preceding.                         During      those
years   geology,    as   the   science    is now understood,           hardly existed.
For   as the nature and importance            of  the organic remains embedded
in   the    rocks became        recognised,      their    enormous       value in       the

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1878-79.                       63
 elucidation of geological problems gradually drew observers away
from the study of minerals.                 Consequently, as palaeontology in
creased,    mineralogy waned among us. To such an extent was the
study    of   minerals neglected, that geologists even of high reputation
could not distinguish many ordinary varieties.                 But as a knowledge
of rocks presupposes            an acquaintance    more    or less extensive with
minerals, the neglect of mineralogy reacted most disadvantageously
on that domain of geology which deals with the composition and
structure of rocks.            The nomenclature of the rocks of Britain sank
into a state of confusion from which it is now only beginning to
recover.       To you, Professor Heddle,           belongs   the   merit of having
almost      alone    upheld      the mineralogical reputation of your native
country during these long years of depression.                  You have devoted
your life to the study, and have made more analyses of minerals
 than any other observer.              You have not contented yourself with
 determining        their    composition    and their names      ;   you have gone
 into every parish in the more mountainous regions, have searched
 them out in their native localities, and by this means have studied
 their geological relations, heaping up           evidence   from which to reason
  regarding their origin and history.            After thirty  years of continuous
  work you        have     communicated the results of your labours to this
  Society.      For   the first two of these papers,      " On  the Rhombohedral
  Carbonates," and " On             the Felspars,"   in which you        have   greatly
  extended our knowledge of pseudomorphic change among minerals,
  enunciating       a law of the       shrinkage so frequently resulting there
   from, the Society proposes now to express its gratitude to you.                 The
  value of your papers           is  undoubted.     Through the kindness of Mr
   Milne Home       I have been      favoured with the sight of letters addressed
   to you by four eminent mineralogists — Dana, of America                 ; Rammels-
   berg,   of Berlin     ;   Szabo, of Buda-Pesth ; and King, of Queen's
   College, Gal way.         Szabo states that the notice of Professor Heddle's
                                                      in Groth's     " Zeitschrift fiir
   paper on the Feldspars which appeared

  placing himself in direct communication with                 the    author.     Dana

                       Professor Heddle.           Chapter V.
                                      (Abstract.)
     In this chapter Dr Heddle             considered    the micas occurring       in
 Scotland.       These he found to be Muscovite             or Muscovy glass, and
margarodite      — of  the white micas; Biotito, lepidomelane, and a new
 species    which    he   proposes     to   call  Haughtonite,      after Professor
 Haughton of Dublin — of          the dark micas.        He   also finds the species
pihlite,     hitherto   unrecognised in         Britain,   occurring     in quantity
in    the   central   districts   of Banffshire, and in the west            of Aber
 deenshire.
     In connection with       the first of these micas, the mode of formation
 of exfiltration veins, and        the metamorpbism of gneiss into the grey
 granite of Aberdeenshire, were considered.
     Dr Heddle found that        margarodite     is the glistening constituent of
 all   the so-called   talc slates    which he had analysed         ; he doubts the
 occurrence     of the last-named      rock in Scotland,     as no one   of the rocks
 which ho has examined,          and which have        passed by that name, was
found to contain any talc.
    Biotite in Scotland is characteristic of gramdar limestones,               which
also     rarely   contain    margarodite.         Lepidomelane,        the   ordinary
dark-granite mica of Ireland,             he had found        in Scotland in only
two localities.

     Haughtonite, which is a ferrous oxide mica, with little magnesia,
he finds to be the mica special to most of the grey and pale-coloured
granites of Scotland;      and it also occurs in the diorites of Banffshire.
This new mica likewise        occurs    somewhat      rarely on the Continent,
though hitherto unrecognised as a distinct species.
2. On the Carboniferous Volcanic Rocks in the Basin of the
        Firth of Forth — their Structure in             the    Field and under
        the Microscope.       By Professor Geikie, F.K.S.
                                  (Abstract.)
     In the introductory portion of      the paper a sketch is given of the
present state of opinion among Continental              petrographers     regarding
 volcanic rocks associated      with palaeozoic formations.             The author
 points out that   a relic of Werner's belief in the recentness of volcanic
 action may still be traced pervading the ideas of German geologists.
 In   this paper he endeavours to show that, alike in their formation in
 the field and in their structure under the microscope,             the basalts and
 tuffs of pakeozoic time were     as  truly the products of volcanic action
 as the lavas and ashes of the         present    day.    The area selected for
  description is the basin of the Firth of Forth.              After  an outline of
 the labours of previous observers        in this    classic    region,  the author
  sketches the history of volcanic action there, showing that volcanoes
  abounded and threw out an enormous               pile of material during the
  time of the Lower        Old Red    Sandstone.        After     a long period of
  quiescence,   the subterranean    disturbances were renewed in an early
  part of the Carboniferous period, and continued until near the close
  of the deposition of    the Carboniferous Limestone series.              It is with
  the history and the products of this second volcanic epoch that the
  present communication deals.
      The paper is divided into two        parts.     The first of these treats
  of the history of volcanic action during the Carboniferous period
  in the basin of the Firth of Forth.               That area consists         of six
  volcanic districts, in several   cases remarkably          independent of each
  other   ; and, though separated      only by a few miles, yet producing
  very distinct forms of lava and tuff.        The structure of the volcanic
  rocks in the field is then traced.        Detailed      descriptions are given

 66                  Proceedings         of the Royal Society
 of some of the more typical necks or volcanic funnels which sup
 plied the sheets of rock now so abundant at the surface, and com
 parisons    are drawn between           their characters           and those of tertiary
 and recent cones aud craters.              The numerous             intrusive      sheets and
 dykes are described        in their relation          to the surrounding            rocks and
 to the position of the         volcanic vents.            An account is given of the
 bedded    lavas and tuffs so       copiously interstratified with the Carboni
 ferous formations, and         their identity with modern volcanic masses
 13 insisted on.
    The second part of the paper deals with the petrography of the
 igneous rocks, aod more especially with their characters                          as revealed
 by the    microscope.        The author states that he has been engaged
 during the last ten years iu carrying on this investigation, and that
he has studied some hundreds               of slices of the rocks from all parts
of the region.        After alluding      to what has been published by other
 observers    on this subject, he proceeds              to describe        the rocks under
the two main divisions of,           I. Crystalline        ;  II. Fragmental.
    I. Crystalline. — These             embrace        all    the   melted or lavaform
rocks.      They may       be subdivided        into four classes:            — 1st, Augite-
Fetepar Rocks, which include three types                   of structure — (1) granitoid,
 consisting of     a   crystalline mixture of a triclinie felspar (but some
times orthoclase), augite, titaniferous iron, and apatite, with occasion
ally biotite, and more           rarely quartz       ;    (2)   Doleritic    — a crystalline
mixture of triclinie         felspar and       augite,       with     titaniferous iron       or
magnetite,      apatite,   and    frequently       olivine, with         a  variable propor
tion of     a  half-glassy ground-mass           ;     (3)     Basaltic — a mixture           of
minutely granulated (and larger, more definitely crystallised) augite,
triclinie   felspar,    magnetite,    and    olivine, with usually some apatite
in a glassy      or half-glassy       ground mass.             2d.    Olivine (Serpentine)
Augite    Rocks,     consisting mainly of serpentine                    throughout,       while
abundant crystals of altered            olivine occur, fresh augite, titaniferous
or magnetic       iron, apatite,       and occasionally            traces     of   a   triclinie
felspar.     Whore      the   last-named      mineral increases             in amount, the
rock assumes the character of            a much        altered    "diabase."          3d.   Fel
spar-magnetite      Rock*, consisting essentially of              a   triclinie felspar and
grains or shred-like particles of a black magnetic                     mineral, sometimes
with   large   orthoclase      crystals,   rarely with augite,              in   a   porphyry
ground-mass.         4th.   Orthoclase    Rocks or Felsites.

    IL Fragmental. — The          rocks included in this class embrace all
 the agglomerates, breccias, and tuffs.      Their characters     are described
in detail, and it is shown that they consist mainly of            the granular
peperino or detritus of the lavas.

                                    (Ahtfrad.)
    Mr Dudgeon exhibited some specimens of auriferous quartz from
Wanlockhead and Leadhills districts.
     No. 1 was found in July 1878, by Thomas Tennant in Win gate
burn, Leadhills ; it is a very rich specimen, and is now placed in
 the   collection    of Scotch minerals in the Museum of Science              and
  Art.
     No.  2  was found by Eleanor Handcock in April 1878, on the banks
  of the Wanlock water, Duntereleuch.
     No.    3,   found   by E. Benzie, daughter of police constable              at
  Leadhills,    in Glengonar water, Leadhills, in 1878.
     No. 4, found in Longcleuch Burn, Leadhills, and in the              posses
  sion of Mr Joseph Gill, local factor to the Earl of Hopetoun.
     Declarations     as to No. 1  and  2 made   before   a   Justice of  Peace,

        Ice in Linlithgow              Loch.           By    Mr   J.   Y. Buchanan.
      In continuation of             the     observations         into the condition of the
water of frozen lochs, which were communicated to the Society at
the meeting            of the 20th January 1879,               I   have been able to repeat
the observations             in Linlithgow Loch on two separate days, and also
to visit Loch Lomond.                  The observations in Linlithgow Loch were
made on the 25th                   January       and     1st February,           both times    at the
same spot, from which the Court House Flagstaff bore N.                                     150i° E.,
and the Rickles  Island N. 63J° E., the depth being 48 feet.  On
the 25th January there was  diminution of pressure under the ice,
                                             a
so    that when        it   was pierced          the air rushed in with              a   roaring noise
for about        a    minute, when      it   stopped, and the water rose in the hole.
On the 1st February, on the other hand, the ice was cracking and
resounding on all sides, and water                           rose at once in the hole when
the     ice was        pierced,     there    being at the same time                  a   considerable
escape of air.              These two stations have been numbered respectively
6     and    7
             ;   they are exactly in the                 same spot,      a       few yards distant
from that of No.              4.    The ice was very decidedly thicker than                         it
had bean.

    From     these   observations we have the mean temperature                  of the
48 feet of water 37'83° on 25th                 January,     and   38 28° on the    1st
February.         The heat required to produce             this rise of temperature
is very    considerable, and would            require the      combustion of very
nearly two tons of coal per acre.
     It was shown that the mineral constituents of this water were
 insufficient     to produce      a lowering of its temperature          of maximum
 density   :   it  was, however, uncertain whether this effect might not
 have    been produced by the substances                 which    gave   the water its
 peculiar odour.        The actual temperature of maximum density of the
  water was accordingly compared           with that of distilled water in         the
 same piezometer, and no difference             could be detected.
     Hence it was evident that, before being completely frozen over,
 Linlithgow Loch         must have been cooled down throughout to a mean
 temperature of certainly two degrees lower than that of its maximum
 density.       As this conclusion       was     at   variance   with the generally
 accepted      doctrine, it was necessary           to test it by observations in
 another lake, and in one of undoubted purity.                   The result of obser
  vations made with          this purpose   in Loch Lomond            on the 28th and
  29th January was that the general                  lowering   of temperature     was
  even greater than       in Linlithgow Loch,         the  mean temperature      under
  the ice at a spot 51 feet deep being 34 -05°              F.    Observations under
  the ice were made         at four stations between Balloch and Luss, and
   several observations were made          in    the water off the edge of the ice,
      vol. x                                                                  K

70                    Proceedings       of the Royal Society
where      it terminated towards          the upper and deeper reaches           of the
loch.
    It  results, from the discussion of these results,              that the pheno
mena attending the freezing of               a fresh-water lake may be stated as
follows     : —
    First. Cooling down of          the whole water to au approximately            uni
form temperature         of 39 "2° F.
    Second.      Local formation of ice generally as          a shore  fringe.
    Third. Convection currents flowing               at the surface from the ice to
the middle of the loch, and at the bottom from the middle to the
edge, caused by the disturbance of the equilibrium                    in  consequence
of the local occurrence of ice.
    Fourth.      Continuance      of these currents for some time without
appreciable       diminution of strength, then gradual slackening of these
currents      as the temperature       of the open water becomes lower, and
the    consequent      difference    of density on which their existence            de
pends becomes less.
    Fifth. The velocity of         the water      leaving the ice fringe and the
facilities for losing heat at the surface, by radiation or convection,
are so related that a portion           of water leaving the ice fringe freezes
be fore   it   can mix with the warmer water offshore.
    Sixth. When condition fifth has been attained, rapid propagation of
ice over the surface, and complete              covering of the water with ice.
    Seventh.      Existence of the water under the exceptional condition
of  a  uniform surface        temperature,      and consequent      rapid equalising
of differences      of density in different        parts.    Did  the loch consist   of
a mass      of water enclosed      in   a   basin which neither supplied nor re
 moved heat, the condition of the water would alter only very slowly,
owing to variation in thickness of the ice covering,                 and the gradual
alteration of temperature          of the water by conduction from the lower
ice surface.
    Hence the temperature          of the bulk of the water under the ice of
a  frozen lake      will  tend to be uniform, and the uniform              temperature
to which       it approximates will be determined by              a number of local
circumstances.         It will lie between 39-2° and              32°    F., and will
depend        on  the shape     and   position of       the loch as well    as the geo
graphical features         of the surrounding          land, and especially on the
severity of the weather.           The body of        a   loch will be cooled     more

when it has been frozen by a moderate                      and comparatively long-con
tinued    frost tban when the ice has been formed                           quickly by very
severe   frost.      For the       more       severe the     frost the     sooner will it be
able to overtake           the water leaving the ice fringe                 ;   in other words,
the stronger       will   be the current which            it will    be able      to arrest, the
greater the head which             it will      be able    to stem          But the head is
causedby tbe higher               temperature         of the open water            as    compared
with that under the               ice.        Hence the more severe the frost, the
higher   will be     tbe temperature which               it will    be able to fix.
  Eighth. Condition              seventh       is affected    by heat supplied from the
bottom.      The amount            due to the internal heat of the earth is cer
tainly under present circumstances inappreciable.      That due to
decay of organic material in the water or at the bottom is also in all
probability insensible in lochs of such purity as Loch Lomond,
thougb it is of very serious importance in polluted lakes like Lin
lithgow.
   Ninth.     The change of the water of a lake affects the distribution
of temperature after it is frozen.                   When the loch          is entirely frozen
over, the supply is delivered entirely at the surface,                            and        therefore
sensibly at a temperature                of   32°   F., which is      also the temperature
of the outflow.            This water finds its way from its                      source       to the
outlet close under the ice, and lowers slightly the temperature                                     of
the water     in    the neighbourhood               of the ice.     The water which finds
its way from the open part to the outlet does                         so   along the bottom,
and   it is taken from           the deep warm water of the open part in virtue
of the convection currents at the edge of the ice.                          The temperature
of the supply thus furnished to the frozen basin depends                                      first on
that of its source, namely, the deep water of the ofien part of the
lake, and then on the configuration of the bottom, more especially
on the      maximum depth on the ridge separating                           the    frozen        basin
from the open             one.     The shallower the water on the ridge the
nearer     will   the deep water have to come                to the surface             in    order to
surmount      it,   and consequently the colder will                 it   become.
   The rising of warm water to the surface was very manifest at the
passage between Inchtavannach                        and the Dumbartonshire                   shore of
the loch.

      Report of a Series of Experiments made in a Hall in
      Upper (trove Place — Dimensions 50x25 feet, height
      about 20 feet ; a Stove Chamber being outside at the
      south end, its roof about 8 feet in height ; the only direct
      connection with the Hall being an opening in the mutual
      wall about 7 or 8 feet from the Hoor, and between 3 and
      4 square feet dimensions.                  By Charles J. Henderson,
      Edinburgh.         Communicated by Professor Jenkin.
   Thermometers were placed throughout the hall, one on each of the
four walls,   6 feet  from the floor, the one on the south wall being a
couple of feet below the inlet for the hot air.                 Three were placed
along   the centre of the roof, 2 feet or so under the roof.                  In the
stove-chamber,    first one and afterwards two stoves were placed, with
double smoke-pipes       before entering the chimney.
   The trials were made for many weeks, and the tables on the two
following pages give      a   fair representation     of the results obtained in
the   warming of the hall          ;   the effect on the   four thermometers,        6
feet from the floor on all the four walls, being so remarkable as to
induce my submitting these experiments to the notice of the Royal
Society.      Precisely     as   the heat,     accumulated      in  the stove-room,
entered    the hall, each of these four thermometers               rose  in  an equal
degree, as shown       in   the    tables, though the     one at the north end
was 50 feet off.      The effect on the three         roof thermometers        is also
shown in Table No.        II.      The stove-room     had  a  doorway to outside,
which during heating was only opened to               a small extent.
   It is worthy of notice the amount of heat obtained from the small
quantity of coals consumed,             which it is thought is the result of the
peculiar construction of the stove smoke-pipes,                  each   having four
flanges  ;  and the effect of placing two stoves         in  the chamber      gives a
very remarkable result         as    regards the fuel consumed,       it being much
the same as for one       ;   showing the advantage,         where     much heat is
required,   of increasing the number and not the size of the stoves.

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1878-79.                         75
     Various suggestions have occurred           to me since these experiments
were made for further improving the system, which                    I   may shortly
mention.
     1. As to the stove-room,       it ought   to he lined    in the inner portion
with      some    radiating  metal or non-conducting           substance,     and be
divided into two parts, one containing the bodies of                   the stoves    or
pipes, the other for firing, &c., a doorway being left                   between   the
two for the admission           of such amount of air as required.               And
further,     as the  quick removal of       the heat   given off from the metal
of the stoves or pipes is of importance, it is           proposed     to introduce a
fan in the inner division to be worked from              the outer, and to admit
as small a portion of cold air as may be practicable for carrying off
the heat into the hall or church.
     From the result of       these experiments      I have come to the conclu
 sion that for warming          and    ventilating   buildings    a   stove-room      is
 required,     but the best      mode    of raising heat      therein is an open
 question.
      For large buildings     I believe    steam-pipes    placed   in the chamber
 would       be the cheapest, the      boiler being either in the chamber            or
  outside.      The heat would be greater than from hot water, but this
  latter would answer very well, and, perhaps, on the whole, would bo
  preferable, the amount of heat being regulated                 by the extent of
  pipes    ; and it cannot fail to occur to every one that the result ob
  tained from the above experiments of the effect of accumulated heat
   discharged into a building         in  the manner described           would in all
   respects he preferable to the       present   system of pipes distributed          in
   the   building itself.    It is a mistake to introduce heat into a church
   or hall by dispersing it in pipes covered with gratings             ;  the waste of
   heat must be very great, while,       if the same amount were accumulated
   in  a chamber,     and sent on, as described     above,   it will   be distributed
   in  a way so perfectly suitable to what is required,         as to cause    wonder
   that so valuable a property of heat had not long ago been known.
                                      Ventilation.
       The stove-chamber is itself an efficient means for the introduction
    of fresh moderately warm air, by simply opening the outer door and
    allowing    the air to pass over the heated         stoves or pipes, aided,        if
    required, by using the fan.          But   the more    important matter        still

 76                 Proceedings         of the Royal Society
 remains, of getting quit of the vitiated              air produced       in crowded
assemblies.      This  also formed the subject          of experiment in the       hall
by my having temporary wooden                 tubes,   12x6     inches wide,    placed
along the walls about          6 feet  from the floor,    and discharging outside
the roof.      These, in     a crowded     meeting,    were found to be very effi
cient in carrying off the vitiated air, though occasionally a                    back-
 draught came down        ;   but were the discharge into a          cavity above the
 ceiling, or an archimedean            can   at the opening,       the  back-draught
 would    be avoided.
    I  have perfect faith in the efficiency         of these wall-tubes in carry
 ing off the vitiated air, and may mention an attempt                   I  made  for a
 visible proof of this.        I  burnt brown paper to produce smoke.              The
 smoke ascended only a few feet, and then spread out horizontally                    in
 a cloud,    and when near any of the tubes           it was drawn up.
                                        Remarks.
    In Table No. II.        the course of the hot air on entering the           hall is
 pretty well shown.          The larger     portion, of course, mounts towards
 the roof, along which         it travels   at somewhat     different temperatures.
 Not    so, however,   below where         the audience     sits, — there the gradu
 ally-rising temperature        is practically equal in     all  corners of the   hall,
 and    that  without any appreciable difference              in time between       the
 effects on the several thermometers.
 2.  Chapters     on the Mineralogy of Scotland.                      By Professor
             Heddle.      Chapter       VI. "     Chloritic Miuerals."
    In this Chapter, Dr Heddle               discussed    the   substances    usually
thrown together, under the term of Chloritic Minerals.                    He showed,
by an extensive      series of analyses,      that they were to be divided into
three groups    — those which        occurred   in inetainorphic rocks, in recent
strata, and in volcanic rocks.
    He proposed     to confine       the term Chloritic     to the minerals which
are found in metamorphic rocks, and                to apply the term, the Sapo-
nites, to those which occur in volcanic rocks.
    In Scotland, metamorphic rocks               afforded    the    species  Pennina,
Ripidolite,     Chlorite,     and   Chloritoid.      The New Red Sandstoae of
 Elgin yielded Glauconite.             Volcanic    rocks   contained, plugging up

their     steam    holes, Delessite, Chlorophseite, Hullite, Saponito, and
 Celadonite.
     Of these, Delessite       seemed to he confined to igneous         rocks of Old
Red Sandstone           age — Chloroptueite      and Hullite to more recent vol
canic* ; while the others occurred in rocks of both of these                 ages.
    He doubted whether            the so-called   Viridite of penologists     had any
claim,     to a specific title — possibly it might be cither Delessite,
Saponite, or Celadonite.             He regarded it as most probably the last
of these.       No attempt        had  been    made to show that      it  was not an
already named substance ; and uutil there was good                    appearance     of
this, it was in no way entitled to a place in mineral                 nomenclature.
     Two new minerals, belonging             to the   first of these groups, were
noticed      as occurring     in granite   near Tongue       in Sutherland, and in
 Rubislaw quarry.
      3. On Deep-Sea Thermometers.                   By Mr     J. Y.  Buchanan.
     For    the purpose    of observing the temperature of the waters below
 the surface in      lakes and seas, two classes of thermometers           have been
 used — namely, ordinary             thermometers       and self-registering     ones.
 The earliest observations          were made with the ordinary thermometer,
 and it was used in one of two ways — either it was sunk itself to the
 desired depth, and was so enveloped                and protected     by badly con
  ducting material, that in bringing it up again through the layers                  of
  water of different temperature it had not time to alter its own tem-
  perature, or a quantity of the water at the desired depth was enclosed
  in  a bucket of suitable construction and brought to the surface, and
  then immediately tested with the thermometer.                Many very excellent
  and trustworthy        observations exist which have been made in one of
  these ways.        Our first knowledge of the temperature              of the deep
  water of fresh-water lakes was obtained from the observations of
  Saussure on the lakes of Switzerland, made with                 a thermometer so
  padded and protected that it could be drawn up through 1000 feet
  of water of any temperature likely to be found in nature without
  sensibly     altering   its   temperature.      The self-acting bucket or        sea-
  gauge was used at an earlier date            in the determination of       the tem
   perature of the deep water of the ocean.                   The accuracy     of the
   results   obtained by this method depends greatly on the skill of the
   observer.      In  the case of Saussure      and of Fischer and Brunner, the
          vol.  x.                                                           L

 78                    Proceedings of      the  Royal Society
 results are clearly to be relied on implicitly.                In    the  experiments
 with   the   sea    bucket, also, excellent results have               been obtained.
The results obtained by both methods of experimenting                        will  be  the
 more accurate the more uniform the temperature                   of the water.       The
temperature,        especially of the bottom water, has also frequently
 been determined by bringing up a quantity of the mud, and                         taking
 its temperature       when it arrives on board.            This method       also   gives
 very satisfactory results when a          considerable quantity of mud is at
 disposal.
    Self-Registering      Thermometers.     — By far       the greatest      number     of
 observations has been made            with self-registering thermometers of
 one form or another.
     The first self-registering thermometer was made by Cavendish.*
 He constructed both        a  maximum and        a  minimum thermometer,             and
 they were of the kind called by the French                     d,   deversement,     out
flow thermometers.           In  fact, his maximum thermometer is in every
 particular    identical    with that known in France                  as  Walferdin's    ;
 his minimum         is on the    same principle,       but has      a  U-formed stem
 instead   of  a straight one.       The disadvantages of this form of ther
 mometer     are two — namely, the indications             are not continuous,        but
by jerks,     depending on the size of the mercury drops,                     and they
require to be constantly set, the maximum at                       a   higher and the
 minimum at       a  lower temperature      than the one to be observed            ; they
 also require constant comparison           with   a standard.         They are, there
fore, not suitable for use where many observations have to be made
expeditiously.
    In  the year 1782       Sixf published      a   description of the combined
maximum and minimum                 thermometer which bears his name, and
which has since continued to assert its place among meteorological
instruments as perhaps the best self-registering thermometer.                         The
instrument is too well known to require particular der,cription.                        It
may, however,        be noted that      Six himself did not            use a hair for a
spring to keep his indices from falling down, but                  a fine glass   thread
soldered    to the top of the index, and sticking up in a direction very
slightly inclined to that of the length of the index, so that it pressed
gently against        the sides of the tube.         The advantage         of the glass

over the hair is that it does not lose its elasticity                                   ;   but, on the
other hand, the index takes up more room, and requires a thermo
meter with a longer stem.
    Maximum and minimum thermometers                             such       as Cavendish's and
Six's, when used for         deep-sea exploration, show only the maximum
and minimum temperatures                to which they have been exposed                                in any
one    excursion,     and a single observation with such                               a    thermometer
does not give us with certainty the                    temperature           of the water at the
depth to which it has been sunk.                          Hence,       if    we had           a    right to
assume     that the    temperature         of   a sea     or lake might vary in any con
ceivable way with the depth, these instruments would be valueless.
We have, however, no right                 to make this assumption                     ;    we know, on
the contrary,       that in all seas whose                  surface     is not exposed                      to a
freezing temperature, the temperature                       of   the    water will                as   a rule
diminish      as the depth increases             ;   that, therefore, the minimum tem-
1*'rature, as shown by the self-registering thermometer,                                    will, in        fact,
ba the temperature at the greatest                       depth attained by this thermo
meter.       Hence, in such       cases,    this instrument is to be relied on, and
more especially when series of                       temperatures           arc    taken- — that                 is,
when the temperatures              at      different depths in tho same locality
are taken, so that the evidence of the decrease of temperature                                              with
increase    of depth   is   rendered    as      strong    as possible.            In   order to rentier
 an account of the state of any lake or sea as regards temperature,                                         it   is
 absolutely necessary to have such serial observations                            ;    hence, for such
 investigations, the maximum and minimum thermometer                                         is    not only
 perfectly    trustworthy,        but   a       most      valuable          and,       indeed,          indis
 pensable     instrument, for      it   has the great advantage                        that, as        it   is   in
 the strictest sense se//-registering,                any number can be attached                                 to
 the same line, and so at one haul the temperature                            can be observed at
a     number of different depths.
      For isolated observations         the thermometers               just       described            are not
 so    satisfactory, and    a   very great amount of ingenuity has boon dis
 played in the invention             of machines for                  registering             tho       actual
 temperature of the water at             any depth independently of that of                                  tho
 water above it.        None of the instruments devised for this purpose
 have been strictly         ne//-registering         ;    they have all                required             some
 assistance    from the observer,           who, by various forms of mechanical
 appliance,    brings about      a   catastrophe           which       leaves      its mark on the

condition of the instrument.                           It   is obvious that any             control which
an observer           may have over an instrument separated                               from   him by, it

mechanical contrivance this longitudinal motion may be made to
produce one of rotation, and, in fact, the assistance afforded hy the
observer to the thermometer to enable       to register its own temit

whole         circle when            it    has reached           the    desired         depth.       The first
observer         who made use of this device                            was Aime\            His working

nately only after he was obliged to leave the Mediterranean, which
had been the scene of his labours, that he invented the very elegant
combination of thermometers                        by which he was enabled to ascertain
the temperature              at any depth, no matter what the intervening                                         dis
tribution might be.                   It    is   described in the memoir just cited.                               It
consists       of two outflow thermometers,                        so    constructed that the one
of them registers the sum of the rises of temperature,                                      and the other
the sum of the falls of temperature,                             to which      it   is    exposed          in any
excursion.            When           they    have       reached         the    required depth they
are inverted,            and on their way back to the surface they register,
as above described,                the rises and falls of temperature                       to which they
are        exposed.         If   r   be the       sum of the            rises of temperature,                   and

the        temperature           at the depth where                they were            inverted           will    be

      If    they are allowed to register                      on the way down, and                    then in
verted at the greatest depth, so as not to register on the way up,
the     effect    will      be precisely the same, though the functions                                     of the
thermometers             will     be reversed.
     Beautiful and ingenious as Aimers thermometers                                        are, they have
the     disadvantages             common         to    all outflow        thermometers           ;    they are
neither simple enough nor handy enough                                  for work involving many
observations.               The      inverting         thermometer,            patented by                 Messrs

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                            81
 Xt-yretti & Zambra,        satisfies   the conditions required of           a   thermo
 meter for isolated observations as completely                as can be     hoped      for.
It   is a mercurial thermometer          ; the bore   of the stem is contracted to
the smallest      possible diameter at a point about an inch from the
neck of the bulb.         As long    as the thermometer       is standing vertically
stem uppermost, the mercury is continuous in stem and bulb, but if it
 be inverted the mercury parts             at the contraction, the portion in tho
stem    falling down into      the point.       The stem is graduated          from the
point     towards    the bulb,      and the temperature          at the     moment       of
inversion is     read off by the height of the mercury in tho end of tho
stem.       This thermometer exists in two varieties,                the one with         a
straight stem, which registers by simple inversion, tho other with a
 TJ-formed stem, which requires to be turned completely round.
 The turning arrangement for               the latter instrument       is a somewhat
 elaborate     and expensive instrument, but it answers                   its purpose.
 The inverting      arrangement,     supplied with      the half-turn thermometer,
 is somewhat clumsy and unsatisfactory.                  The half-turn instrument,
 when fitted with       a suitable inverting arrangement,          is to be preferred
 to the others in all work at moderate               depths.      For ocean work it
  would probably be       necessary     to give up the protection of the whole
  stem, as it would        be impossible       to guarantee      a tube,    which can
  contain    the whole instrument, against             collapse    when exposed          to
  pressures of over 500 or 1000 fathoms of water.                   If   the bulb and
  the twist on the stem were protected            it would     be quite sufficient.
      Sources   of Error in     the   Iwlicatiom of various        Thermometers.        —
  When an ordinary thermometer, protected by badly-conducting
  envelopes, is used, it is obviously exposed to alteration of tempera
  ture by being pulled through warmer or colder water on its way to
  the surface.     Whether any sensible error is likely to result from this
  cause    must he determined in each particular case by experience.
  The    more   perfectly it resists      change   of temperature the longer it
  will take to    assume the temperature         of the water.      Saussure      left his
  thermometer down for twelve or fourteen hours for each observa
  tion, so that this method is now seldom                   used.     Similarly,      also,
  the method which depends on bringing up                 a sample    of the water in
  a vessel fitted for the     purpose, and taking its temperature with an
  ordinary thermometer when it reaches the surface, has been discon
   tinued, for although it does not take much more time than would

  be necessary for sending down a thermometer and                              bringing it up,
  it is impossible          to bring up water from                great     depths in warm
  climates    without sensible change of temperature.
      In  the case     of outilow thermometers,               the   delicacy of the         instru
  ment is limited by the size of the mercury drops.                          In the   inverting
  thermometers        of Negretti and Zambra an error may arise                        from the
  difference    of volume of the mercury in the stem at the temperature
  at   which    it was inverted, and at that at which                        it is read.          In
  an extreme       case     this may amount to              as  much     as 0-4°   F.   ;   it  can,
  however,     be allowed for.
      In Six's instruments          there    is a possible        error from looseness            of
  the indices,    in  consequence         of which they are apt to be shaken out
  of their places by any jarring of the line.                     Errors from this source
  can be avoided to a great             extent by attaching the thermometer                       to
 the line by means of an elastic or india-rubber stop.
     All   the self-registering instruments                are liable    to error from          the
 effects    of pressure.        The pressure           inside    a thermometer         is    never
 greater than that of the atmosphere when it was sealed up.                               It  may,
 however,      be   exposed       outside to a pressure              of 500 or 600 atmo
 spheres.      The effect of this difference             of pressure on the outside and
 inside of the glass envelope               is to make         it tend    to collapse.         The
 bulb of the thermometer is squeezed, and its volume in consequence
 diminished.         The liquid which it contains is thereby forced into
 the    stem, and     its apparent volume             is greater      than it would           have
 been     had   there     been    no excess       of    pressure     on the outside of the
instrument.         The temperature            of the instrument            is measured          by
the apparent volume of the              liquid which it contains          ;  hence the effect
of pressure       is to raise        the   observed        temperature       above    the true
temperature.          Parrot and Lenz,* in 1832, made a series of experi
ments      on   the    ell'ect  of pressure        on thermometers.             They experi
mented at pressures up to 100 atmospheres,                       and observed differences
between       the    apparent        and the true temperatures                  of  as       much
as    20°   C.    They      found      that for the         same instrument         the com
pression      was     simply      proportional        to    the   pressure.       They        used
a    thermometer        as    a  manometer.             After this      date it was usual
to    attempt     some       kind of protection for self-registering thermo
meters.        Those with         straight      stems,      such as Walferdin's              mini-

 mam,       were   sealed up in glass tubes, and so completely protected.
 Those     whose     stems were bent had to be enclosed                  in metal cases
 closed with a screw.            This form of protection never           answered      well,
as     it was impossible to screw on the cover so tight that water under
the great pressures met with at considerable depths would not find
its way in. In order not to have to abandon the use of thermo
meters of         the   convenient form of Six's, the device               of protecting
the bulb only was hit upon, and it appears that the first ther
mometer of this kind was used by Captain Fallen on board
 H.M.S.        Cyclops.       The effect of pressure         on    the   stem    is    quite
insignificant, and under ordinary circumstances insensible. For,
 in nearly all seas where the surface temperature is over 40" F.,
 the temperature of the water diminishes as the depth                          increases,
 and therefore it is the minimum leg which is used,                              and tho
 effective     part of it is that filled with           spirit,    which    may     have    a
  length of at      most three inches.       The effect of pressure in diminish
  ing the volume of            a  short piece     of    thermometer tubing             must
  certainly    be very small, but its actual value can only be determined
   by removing       the bulb and taking the           piece    of the stem between
   the mercury and the neck of the bulb                as   the bulb     of  a new     ther
   mometer, and determining experimentally the effect of pressure                         on
   it.    An approximation        to the effect may be made            by exposing tho
   thermometer to various high pressures              at known       temperatures        and
   observing the rise of the maximum index, then removing the bulb
   and calibrating the stem.          Knowing,     then, the ratio of the volume
   of this part of       the   minimum     leg filled with spirit to the whole
   volume, from the bulb to the maximum index, it may                        be assumed
   that the compression will be in the same ratio.                     And this value
   will probably      be greater    than the real one, for the compression                 of
   the water produces of itself a certain rise of temperature,                  and     con
   sequently     raises    the   maximum      index.       This     can,   however, be
   estimated either by comparison with               a   completely protected          ther
    mometer,     or by bringing the minimum               index also home          on    the
    mercury before raising the pressure.           If, then,     there has been a rise
   of   temperature    caused by compression,        there    will  be a corresponding
   lowering     of temperature       on relieving     the   pressure.       If the     com
    pression   apparatus     be allowed to      stand, after      the   pressure     is up,
    until it   has    dissipated the heat evolved by the compression,                    tho

84                      Proceedinga           of the Royal Society
relief of pressure            will   cause a corresponding absorption                 of   heat
which        will show itself in            the    position of       the minimum        index.
Some        experiments         which     I   have      made    in this direction      show     a
lowering of temperature               of 0-3° F. for the relief of a pressure             of 2^-
tons per square inch, the whole rise of the maximum index                              having
been      1 -8°  F.
     We      may,   I  think, be quite certain that when the minimum leg                       is
the one used and the temperature                     low, the error caused by the effect
of pressure on the stem is inappreciable.
     Cavendish, who invented the self-registering thermometer,                        foresaw
also the most         important of the uses to which it could be applied.
Thus he suggests that the higher regions                        of the atmosphere       might
be investigated by attaching                 it to a kite — balloons not having been
invented.           With       regard    to deep-sea explorations,           he   says  :
                                                                                           "  If
instruments of the nature above described                        were to be used for      find
ing the temper of the              sea at great depths,          some alteration would       be
necessary in the construction of them, principally                        on account    of the
great pressure of the water, the                 ill   effect of which can,     I believe,   be
 prevented        no other way than by leaving the tube open."
     This     was written in 1757, and                it  was not    till 1762 that Canton
 proved that liquids are compressible.                        Cavendish therefore       hoped
 that    as the pressure         would not produce distortion of the glass when
 the tube was open,             it would    have      no visible effect on the      apparent
 volume of the liquid.              The device of leaving his thermometer                 open
 at the end was adopted                by Aime in some of his experiments,                  the
 etl'eet   of   pressure on the apparent             volume     of the liquid being deter
 mined independently, and               a correction applied accordingly.           I devised
 and constructed          a   mercurial thermometer,            or piezometer, on the same
 principle,* but my object in admitting                        the water    pressure    to the
 inside of the instrument was to utilise it in shifting the scale of the
 thermometer         as the depths        changed.          The thing registered      in such
 instruments is always the apparent volume of the liquid, and this
 varies with the temperature               and the pressure.          Hence the indications
 will    represent the sum          of  the effects       of  change    of temperature      and
 of pressure.          If    from any independent source we know either of
 these, we can determine the other.                       In a sea  of uniform temperature
 throughout         its depth, the apparent volume of the liquid would

creased with the depth, the apparent volume of the liquid would
diminish at a slower rate ; hut it would be always possible to deter
mine the true temperature                   as       long as it did not increase at so great
a rate as to dilate            the liquid more                   than    it   was          compressed          by the
increasing        pressure.           For      the        investigation         of         seas such        as    the
Mediterranean this form of instrument                                        is most          valuable.          The
method       of       determining           accurately both depth                           and temperature

above referred to.
     In
      the great majority of cases the most convenient instrument
to use is the form of Six's thermometer with protected bulb known
as     the Millar-Casella thermometer, with the following additions
and improvements, which                        Mr Casella              has    applied to them at my
suggestion : — The             size    of the instmment                    is increased              so    that the
degrees       are       wider apart,           a degree            Fahrenheit              on the         minimum
leg occupying            about three millimetres of its length.                                      Besides the
scale      of degrees        which        is attached             on enamelled slips to the vul
 canite at the sides of the stem, there is an arbitrary                                              (millimetre)
 scale     etched on the              stem       itself.          The        values         of     the divisions
 of this      scale      are    ascertained                by     a careful            comparison           with     a
 standard         thermometer.              It       is    thus     possible to               read        with    cer
 tainty to       a    quarter of a millimetre or                   a   twelfth of           a degree        Fahren
 heit.       The errors due to the                        scale    not being rigidly attached to
 the thermometer, and to the difficulty of determining the height of
 the      index by       reference        to     a    scale       at the      side      of instead of over
 it,   are   eliminated.          Finally, by having the ordinary                                   scale      at this
 sides, the instrument                can be              used    independently of the arbitrary
 scale, and, even            where the arbitrary scale                        is   principally            relied on,
 the scale of degrees                 enables             the observer to know very approxi
 mately the true temperature at the moment of observation without
 reference        to tables, and, by noting on every occasion                                        the reading
 on both scales, the chance of errors from misreading                                          greatly reduced.
       The maximum                                                                         is is   of larger bore

thus much time be saved.                       In my own           practice    I   generally use           four

temperature          when tested by this instrument, it must be replaced by
the mercury piezometer                   (b), which possesses the advantage                      that the
position of the thermometric scale shifts along the stem according
as the depth varies.                  Also any number of them can be used at the
same time at different depths                         on the        same line.       In     deep ocean
soundings            the combination                 of this instrument             with      the     water
piezometer           for the determination of both depth and temperature
independently of the length of the sounding line is invaluable for
accurate work.              The inverting thermometer                   of Messrs Negretti and
Zambra         (e)   is   the instrument most suitable for isolated observations.
It   is   also of very great             use    for supplementing and controlling                           the
observations          with the other instruments, especially                          in the         case    of

-L Preliminary         Note    on   a Crystalline         Compound         formed
       in Water containing Sulphuretted Hydrogen                       and Mer-
       captan in Solution.        By   J.  Adrian Blaikie, B.Sc.
    In  the process of making mercaptan            by collecting the distillate
from     a mixture    of ethyl-sulphate of calcium and            sulphydrate of
potassium, along with water and mercaptan, a considerable                 quantity
of crystalline  substance was observed to collect in the receiver, and also
towards the end of the condenser.           The receiver having been placed
in a freezing mixture,      to condense as much mercaptan           as possible,  it
 was thought that the crystalline substance was ice, and the freezing
 mixture was      removed.     The    crystals,   however,     continued to be
 formed, and even stopped       up the end of the condenser, so that it
 was necessary to pour in hot water to melt them.              In  a few minutes
 they were again formed, not only in the receiver, but half way up
 the condensing tubes, through which water at about                   2-3° C. was
 running.     As it  was evident that these crystals could not bo ice, the
  conditions   under which they were formed, and their composition,
  were subjected to investigation.
     The solution of sulphydrate of potassium having been completely
  saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen at a low temperature,            a consider
  able quantity of that gas was evolved before the formation of mercap
  tan took place.    The crystals were therefore formed in an atmosphere
  of sulphuretted hydrogen, and         as only water       and mercaptan     were
  present,  could consist   of water combined         either  with one or with
  both of the other substances.
     By pouring    a few drops of mercaptan       into sulphuretted hydrogen
  water at  0°C, immediately      a few crystals were formed.          By   passing
  sulphuretted hydrogen gas into water saturated with mercaptan, and
  with  meTcaptan floating on the surface,      in  a  few minutes crystallisa
  tion took place, a large amount of sulphuretted hydrogen was absorbed.

88                 Proceedings of       the  lloyal Society
and the water thickened into a soft crystalline mass.              The quantity
of the crystals depended on the amount of mercaptan              if sulphuretted
hydrogen were in excess, or on the amount of sulphuretted hydrogen
if mercaptan    were in excess.
    On cooling water saturated       with mercaptan        no such crystalline
appearance was observed.        As is known from "Welder's experiments
(Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, xxxiii. 125), sulphuretted
hydrogen only forms a hydrate at            -  16* G, or under considerable
pressure.     From these results    it   is evident that both sulphuretted
hydrogen and mercaptan          are necessary      for the formation of        this
crystalline compound.
    The crystalline mass has much the same appearance                  as  hydrate
of chlorine, but is colourless.        In   the   mother liquid      the   crystals
exist for an indefinite time at any temperature below                3'G; when
dried they rapidly melt even at        0° C.    Above   3°  G they melt in the
mother liquid, with evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen,               and forma
tion of   a  thin layer of mercaptan        above the water.       Their speeilic
gravity is greater than that of the mother liquid, which in turn is
greater than that of ice.      By allowing       the crystals   to stand in    this
mother liquid, in a corked      flask cooled     by means of ice-cold water,
a   crust forms on the surface, which appears          to consist of hexagonal
plates.
    Newly    formed crystals when observed             under    the    microscope
appear to be prisms,     some long and line, others short and thick, but
as   they rapidly    melt,  their   form could       not   be  more     accurately
observed.     They dissolve rapidly in absolute alcohol at         - 10° G, with
evolution of a little sulphuretted hydrogen.
    A  mass of the crystals,    when allowed to evaporate slowly, smell
strongly of mercaptan,       and   deposit     sulphur.     Rapidly    heated   on
platinum foil they suddenly melt, and a gas is given off which
burns with      a blue   flame.    The water left becomes milky with
separation    of sulphur.    On further heat being applied the water is
evaporated,     and the sulphur burnt, without           any residue.        When
dried between      well-cooled filter paper,       and   dissolved in alcohol,
with    acetate of lead, a dark brown precipitate of sulpiride of lead
 is thrown down, any precipitate         of mercaptide    of lead being hidden
by the darker sulphide.
    The    presence   of mercaptan        was    distinctly   proved      by com

fitted     with a platinum                   gauze          cone,        rapidly washed                 with          ice-cold
water,      and     dried          on    well-cooled               filter         paper.           When dried                  as
thoroughly as possible,                  they were rapidly placed                              in a weighed tost
tube,      cooled    in        a    freezing mixture, weighed,                               and     inserted in an
open      combustion tube,               the lower end of which was at a                                          dull       red

      The    excess of carbon            in No.         I.    is   caused probably by the difficulty
    in obtaining    a     perfectly dry substance, free from adhering mercaptan.
      Direct estimations of sulphur                          have not as yet proved satisfactory                                ;
    in some experiments mercaptan was oxidised along with sulphuretted
    hydrogen, in other cases                     it    was        not.        It       is   hoped    that shortly               a
    method may be obtained for the more accurate estimation of sulphur
    in this substance.
         From the    above results           it      would appear that the chief constituent
    of this crystalline compound                 water (not less than 90 per cent.),
                                                        is
    combined -with          a       small quantity of mercaptan and sulphuretted
    hydrogen.
         With sulphide of ethyl, sulphuretted hydrogen, and                                                      water, no
    crystalline compound                is    formed at 0° C.                          With sulphide of amyl
    or with sulphydrate of amyl the results were also negative.
         With sulphide of methyl                   the formation of                    a    crystalline compound
    is   obtained with         ease.     To      a     small quantity of water at                           2°   C.   a    little
    pure    sulphide of methyl was added,                                 and sulphuretted                       hydrogen
    passed in.       In    a       very few minutes crystallisation                                commenced,               and
    sulphuretted        hydrogen             was       absorbed.                   These      crystals           are       more
    stable than     those of mercaptan,                        and       it   is       the writer's intention to
    study this compound                 in order to discover whether                               it   has      a    definite

                     Machine at Different Speeds.
     The following          measurements                         Gramme
                                                were made by means of a
machine, recently procured for the University.        I desired to make
use of    not only for electric light, but for electrolysis, the exciting
         it,
of electromagnets, and various other purposes for which we liave
hitherto       used        from    4   to 40    or so Bunsen cells.                  I      therefore
arranged the driving-gear               so that with          the     same motor           (a   3i h.p.
gas-engine)      it   was easy to use either of three speeds.                          These       are,
approximately, 800, 533, and 320 turns per minute.                                    The electro
motive force varies,               of course,   not only with the speed but                       with
the resistance of the              whole circuit — falling off          at first rapidly          and
then more slowly for any one speed,                     as    the resistance          is   increased.
As  I   had no        means        of measuring       the speed        directly,     I     was some
what puzzled           at first to find         the    electromotive         force     at any one
speed rise      to    a     maximum, and then            rapidly fall off            as the     whole
resistance      was gradually diminished.                    ButI      soon found that            this
was due in groat part                to the slipping      of the driving-belts (though
they were very tight), whenever the intensity of the current exceeded
a   certain amount.          A    liberal use of rosin almost removed this anomaly,
though there          is   reason to believe there       is   still   considerable         slipping.
     The following table gives the average of                  a    number of experiments
which accord fairly with one another.                         The resistance          of the con
ductor of the Gramme                 machine    is   about 1-16 B. A. units.                 For the
added    resistance        I      used coils of stout covered            copper       wire which
were in the laboratory, having resistances                          0-054,   1"844, and 3-63,
respectively.          The first was always in circuit, and                  a   portion of      it,   of
resistance 0"00lo, was introduced into the circuit of                            a   galvanometer
having   a     resistance 23.          The deflections        of the galvanometer                wens
observed with the first coil alone               in   the circuit of the Gramme,                 then
with the addition of the second or third, and finally with all the coils.
     The explosions in the gas-engine occur only at every second stroke
of the piston.             This   and other causes render             the driving power not
absolutely steady, but the average deflection                          of the galvanometer
was very easily observed.

    Next, instead of the second or third coils above mentioned, a
 Duboseq's lamp was included in the circuit, the other arrangements
 being as before, and the speed being 800 nominal.                The deflection
 corresponded to an electromotive force of about 39 Bunsen cells,
 and a resistance of 2-66.       As  the lamp itself was sometimes         found
 to have a resistance      of as much as 0-6, and        as the    carbons  have
 a resistance     of from 0"115 to 0-045, per      4 inches,    it appears  that,
 approximately,      the resistance  of the electric arc, under these condi
 tions, is at least 0'8.
     Subsequent experiments,      in which   the lamp was not used, gave re
 sistances varying from 0-75 to 1-2, according to the length of the arc
 —and     when a little sodium was introduced, it fell to 0-25.            These
 estimates,   of course, include the effect due to heating and pointing
  the carbons.
     The want of accurate speed determinations, of course, deprives
 these results of scientific value,        but they are very useful        as   an
 expression    of the electromotive   force practically to be obtained from
 the Gramme machine under different circumstances                of its ordinary
  working, — showing, as they do, what adjustments to make for the
  purposes of a particular experiment.
    * This
            particular number must be over-estimated, for about 6 h.p. is re
  quired to maintain an electromotive force of 38 Bunsens in a resistance 1 '5.

   The very rapid increase of electromotive force with                  diminished
resistance at the lowest speed, seems to show that the               speed is very
considerably overrated         when stated as 800 or 533, with               trie re
sistance   between      1  and   2  B. A. units.      I  hope soon to     have the
means of accurately         measuring     the speed     realised,  and shall     then
repeat these experiments          for   a scientific, and not a mere       practical
purpose.

    This  is really Laplace's subject in his Dynamical Theory                 of the
Tides   ; where    it  is dealt   with in its utmost generality         except    one
 important restriction, — the motion of           each particle to be infinitely
nearly horizontal, and the velocity to be always equal for all par

tides in the            same vertical.              This implies that               the greatest           depth
must      be small           in comparison with the                         distance      that has to be
travelled to find                the deviation           from levelness            of the water-surface
altered     by        a sensible fraction                of its maximum                 amount.           In   the
present short communication                         I   adopt this restriction             ;    and farther,
instead of supposing the water to cover the whole or a large part of
the surface of a solid spheroid as does Laplace, I take the simpler
problem of an area of water so small that the equilibrium-figure of
its surface is not sensibly curved. Imagine a basin of water of
any shape, and of depth, not                        necessarily           uniform, but, at greatest,
small in comparison with the                            least diameter.             Let this basin             and
the water in it rotate round                    a       vertical axis with angular velocity                       u<
so small that the greatest                      equilibrium               slope    due    to    it   may be a
small fraction of                the radian     :   in other words, the angular velocity
must      be small in comparison                with          *J    f^- ,   where    g   denotes         gravity,

great     importance in respect to the theory of diurnal tides                 in  the

         M'Kendrick.
                                        Abstract.
    Dr Coats       stated    that this communication referred         to part of    an
investigation on the physiological action of anesthetics, undertaken,
at the      request    of the British      Medical Association, by      Dr  Ramsay,
 1)r    M'Kendrick,       . and   himself.    After describing     the   method      of
 obtaining accurate tracings of variations in blood-pressure               by  means
 of   a  kymograph, he stated that the facts           obtained     from these     re-

                       of Edinburgh,          Session 1878-79.                       101
 searches    seemed     to the Committee to warrant the following                    con-
 elusions  :—
    1.  Both chloroform          and ethidene administered to animals have a
decided effect in reducing the blood-pressure,                    while ether has no
appreciable effect of this kind.
    2.  Chloroform       reduces the pressure          much more rapidly and to         a
greater extent than ethidene.
    3.  Chloroform        has     sometimes      an    unexpected     and apparently
capricious     effect   on the heart's       action, the pressure being reduced
with great rapidity almost to nil, while                  the pulsations are greatly
retarded     or even      stopped.       The occurrence         of these sudden and
unlooked-for      effects     on the heart's      action seems to       be  a source   of
serious    danger to life, all the more                that in two instances        they
occurred      more    than a minute after chloroform had ceased to                     be
ad ministered, and after the recovery             of the blood- pressure.
    4.  Ethidene      reduces      the   blood-pressuro by regular           gradations
and     not, so far as observed,             by these       sudden   and unexpected
 depressions.
    5.  Chloroform may cause death in dogs either by primarily para
 lysing   the heart or the respiratory mechanism.                   The variations in
 this respect seem to depend to some extent on individual peculiari
 ties of the animals        ;  in some the cardiac           centres are more    readily
 affected,  in  others    the respiratory.        But peculiarities in the condi
 tion of the same animal very probal               <ly  have    some  effect in deter
 mining the vulnerability           of these two centres respectively, and they
 may both fail simultaneously.
    6.  In  most cases respiration stops            before    the heart's   action, but
 there   was one     instance       in which respiration continued while the
heart had stopped, and only failed a considerable                  number of seconds
after the heart had resumed.
    7.  The   use of artificial       respiration was very effective in restoring
animals in danger of dying from the influence of chloroform.                          In
one instance its prolonged use produced recovery                      even   when the
heart had ceased beating for a considerable                 time.
    8.  Under the      use of ethidene        there was on no single occasion an
 absolute cessation        either of the heart's          action or of respiration,
 although they were sometimes               very much reduced.           It  can there
 fore be said that, though not free from danger                   on the side of the
    VOL. X.                                                                    o

 heart       and    respiration, this agent                     is,   in   a    very high degree,      safer
 than chloroform.
       9.   These results confirm and amplify those stated in a previous
 report, to the effect                 that othidene does not compromise the heart
 us    does       chloroform.            By        the     method of experimentation                   then
 employed,          the       effect    on    the        blood-pressure could not be deter
 mined, and altogether the results here obtained are more                                      exact and
 unequivocal.

positive integral powers of one quantity, the elements of the second
the like positive integral powers                        of another quantity, and so on,               the

   Every          alternant of the            a"' degree              is   evidently   a   function of   n
variables,        viz., the n quantities whose powers are the elements.                                To
interchange         two of these variables would be the same as to inter
change        two   of the rows of the determinant, and therefore would
have        the   effect      of merely changing the sign of the function.                               A

tinguishing         the       two kinds        as        alternating            and permanent.        The
narrower meaning of symmetric having, however, been adhered                                            to,
the other         kind of function,                viz., that above              exemplified, has    been

order 0, 1, 2, 3,        ....
                         is equal to the difference-product of its
variables.  In regard to every other alternant it is evident that it
must contain       the    said difference-product as a factor, but what the
co-factor     should     be is not so readily               seen.         In particular         cases,

                                 Professor Blackie.
                                      (Abstract.)
   Professor Blackie, after paying          a   high compliment to the erudition,
 ingenuity, and fine taste of the Aberdeen Hellenist,                              proceeded          to
 give reasons     why, in his opinion, the theory now broached, to the
 effect that certain books of the         " Iliad"      were composed by the author
 of the " Odyssey," which author is                    to    be considered           as    the real
 Homer, though not destitute          of a certain plausibility,                   is untenable.
 The reasons were — (1.) The character of the minstrel                        as   distinguished
 from the literary epos warrants                the    presumption that any small
 diversity in certain secondary        characteristics of different sections of
                                    it,
 the poem, as we now have           is     a    legitimate proof, not of diversity
 of authorship,        but only of diversity           of materials collected from
 different sources.       (2.) The manner in which the minstrel epos was
 originally     circulated, not as    separate literary composition to be
                                      a
 read and studied, but as       a   sequence      of easily separable cantos to                       be
 handed about and sung separately,               rendered           it,   even when wrought
 into   a   finished artistic whole by the genius               of    a     great singer, pecu
 liarly liable to interpolations and variations of various kinds, which
 form no legitimate ground of induction                     with    regard to the character

  104                 Proceedings of         the   Royal Society
 or attitude of the original          composer.       (3.) Not a few of the most
 prominent differential features           emphasized by Professor Geddes are
 to be looked rather as the two sides               of one rich mind than as the
 diverse workmanship          of two different minds.           A  great poet   will   be
 as tender   on one occasion as he is fierce on another, and                  Goethe    is
 not the less author of "Torquato Tasso" because he is the author of
 " Faust."
               (4.) Mot the least objection to the books exsected by Mr
 Grote, and appropriated by Professor Geddes, being attributed w
 the author    of  the   " Odyssey,"     is the    fact that some of these books
are at once the most poetically impressive              and the most     fully charged
 with the fervour peculiar to the             " Iliad,"  and, if they are not abso
lutely necessary to what Mr Grote calls the logical sequence of the
poem, do certainly contribute most largely to its effect as a                  work of
art.    (5.) Some of the differentia1 features dwelt on by the Aber
deen Professor are either too slight, too sparse, and too equivocal to
warrant any sure induction, or are explained most naturally by the
character    and tone of the poem, and             the nature of the subject.         In
the   quict books of the
                                " Iliad"    some things would naturally occur
that are more kindred to the gentle tone of the " Odyssey," than the
fervid and somewhat tierce tone and contents of those books of the
"Iliad"     where      Achilles    is the dominant        figure.     (6.) Lastly, the
theory of development in moral                 and religious matters applied by
Professor Geddes to the " Odyssey," and what he calls the Odyssean
books of the      "Iliad," Professor Blackie felt himself             compelled   flatly
to deny.      Jove    is in every respect as stern and        just a moral governor
of the world in the        " Iliad"   as in the     " Odyssey ;" and the haughti
ness of Agamemnon            meets with       its retribution,    as  publicly and    as
prominently in the one poem,            as does the insolence        of the Suitors in
the other.      In the " Iliad," Zeus is          the steward of national war —
                     ; in the
                                 " Odyssey"       the avenger     of domestic wrong
Tama's iro\t/xoio
(£tVios)  ; but in both poems he is equally moral in great cosmical
matters, and equally immoral, as              it strikes   us, in certain small per
sonal matters.        There are no palaeozoic and neozoic periods of theo
logical belief to warrant the assumption              of successive stages of moral
development in different portions of the Homeric poems.
    At the close of Professor Blackie's paper, Professor Campbell, St
Andrews, remarked that before reading the book of Professor Geddes
he  looked upon Grote's theory with some doubt and suspicion, but

                     of Edinburgh,    Session  1 878-79.                  1 0.1
 after   reading the book his opinion was modified.              Ho thought
 Professor Geddes had strengthened the case for Grote's theory,
 though not to the extent of proving an affirmative.
    Dr Donaldson       concurred with the views of Professor Blackie.
     Professor Sellar, while having the greatest admiration for Professor
Geddes' s knowledge and ingenuity, felt that he had done nothing in
the   way of enlightening those interested in the subject.

 2.   The Principles      of the Algebra of Logic.      Part   III. — Appli
         cation to certain Problems in the Theory of Probability.
         By Dr   Alexander Macfarlane.
      The Algebra of Logic, being the science of Necessity and Prob
  ability, supplies a variety of methods of great power for solving
  problems in the theory of Probability.          I propose to bring before
  the Society a few examples extracted from my work on the
   " Principles of the Algebra of Logic," which is about to bo
  published.     A  large  class of problems, some of which have created
   considerable    diversity    of  opinion   among     mathematicians       of
   eminence, can be solved by means of a single theorem.              It  con
   sists in finding the arithmetical       value of —     .    The   meaning
   of this expression is shown by the diagram —
       The collection of individuals    forming the subject of discourse
   is represented by the      part of the page within      the  square,  those
    which have a character x by the part inside the one circular line,
    and those which    have the character  y by the   part inside the other

applying to           a    modification of the problem.                                  Boole goes further, and
 finds     the most probable value of the probability.                                               Wilbraham             con

1.  The Anatomy of the Northern Beluga (B. Catodon) compared
      with that of other Whales.               By Morrison Watson, M.D..
       F.R.S.E., and Alfred H. Young, M.B., &c, Owens College,
       Manchester.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The specimen which formed the subject of this memoir was one
of three, imported into England by           Mr Farini of London.
   The skeleton      being already well known, and the state                  of    the
parts preventing an examination of the muscular anatomy,                   attention
was directed solely to that          of the viscera, of which         no complete
description had hitherto been            given.    Drs Barclay and          Neill in
this country, and subsequently Professor Wyman                    iu America, had
previously investigated some points in the anatomy of the soft
parts   of Beluga, but their descriptions are            so     fragmentary as to
necessitate   a   more    accurate     and extended investigation             of   the
viscera.
   In addition     to a    full description of    the various organs, a com
parison is instituted between these and the corresponding structures
of other Cetaceans.
   With    regard    to the    relation in which Beluga stands              to other
genera, the comparative        observations detailed in the memoir show
that, so far as the soft parts are concerned,         Beluga in many respects
presents   a  close resemblance        to Grampus and to Globio-cephalus,
whilst   it differs from both         in several    minor points.          From     an
examination of the skeleton, Professor Flower' concludes                  that   " the
Narwhal and the Beluga appear to separate themselves                   from all the
rest, by certain well-marked        structural conditions, especially in the
characters   of the cervical vertebra'.         As these two animals are in
almost    every   part    of their     skeleton nearly identical,"         Professor
Flower is disposed
                          " to unite the two genera into a distinct               sub
family, placing it next to the Platanistida'."              Unfortunately,       such
information    as we possess regarding       the soft parts of the Narwhal           is
of too imperfect      a character    to admit of the comparison being fol

lowed     out.    If, however, the number and            arrangement    of the nasal
sacs,   as  forming an element in the determination of the affinities
of different      Cetaceans,      is deserving of the importance attributed
to them by          some     writers,     those    of  Beluga certainly      seem    to
associate that genus with Monodon,                  and to separate it from        the
other    genera    above     named.       It  should, however, be noted that the
sub-division of       the trachea into       four bronchi in Monodon is widely
different from that which obtains in Beluga and in every other
toothed     whale of which we have any knowledge, with the single
exception      of Pontoporia.          In view of the scantiness of information
regarding the anatomy of Monodon, the determination of the exact
affinities of Beluga must be left to future observers.
               2.   Fifth Report of the Boulder Committee.
    The Committee had submitted to them Notes by the Convener of
 two visits to the West Highlands (including                   the Outer Hebrides)
 which he had        made during the summer and autumn              of 1878.    These
 Notes, accompanied by diagrams of boulders and striated rocks, afford
 a large amount of information                bearing on the subject of boulder
 transport, the direction of transport, and the agent of transport.
    There     has   also   been     laid   before   the   Committee a report        by
 William Jolly, of Inverness,            one of its members,      " On the Transpor
 tation of Bocks         found on the Shores           of the Moray      Firth;"    as
 also Notes by Messrs          Somervail and Henderson (Edinburgh),              " On
 Boulders and Striated Rocks in the Pentlnnd Hills."
    The Committee         have     had an opportunity of seeing these Notes
 and Reports       in printed proof sheets.           The Convener, on his own
 responsibility,     sent the      MSS.     to the printer   ;  and  the Committee
 approve of his having taken this course.

                                i. — island     of iona.
    The Convener having occasion                to be in this island      for a few
 hours, went to the boulder referred to in the Committee's                    Second
 Report, situated on the west side of Dun-Ii hill.
    Its peculiar position appearing to him to deserve a more special
 notice, he gives     in  fig. 1 a   sketch of   it taken from the north.

     Tho boulder consists                of a coarse-grainod              granite.        But     in Iona
there is no granite rock of any kind.                            Tho prevailing rock is a                 fine
grained gneiss, approaching in many places to clay slate.
     Captain Stewart of Coll was with the Convener when he                                   examined
the      bouldor.          On breaking            off portions from                it,   and also from
another small boulder lying below, exactly similar in composition,
he at onco said,            " This    is    Coll granite."
     These Iona         boulders, in respect both of situation and                              position,
undoubtedly indicate, that they were lodged by some agent                                            which
brought them from the N. or       N.W. That agent had stranded
upon the hill and stuck there till the boulders dropped from it.
  From no eastern quarter could the boulders have reached their
position. Their site    250 feet above the sea.
                                    is            The hill on which
they are, being 350 feet high, and forming                          a     ridge of about        a   quarter
of   a     nule running north and south, would preclude access from any
eastern point.
      The granite in the Ross of Mull, situated to the east of Iona,                                        is
different in composition from that of the boulders now referred to.
On the east side of Iona there are granite boulders, similar to the
Mull       granite,    as   mentioned in the Committee's second Report.                                   But
the boulders on the                 N.\V. shoulder of " Dun-Ii                 "
                                                                                   are larger grained
and        of   a   different colour        ;   and they occupy            a   level considerably
above most of the granite                    rocks at the Boss of           Mull.
      With      reference       to Captain          Stewart's remark,                as   to the large
boulder above referred to being of the same kind of granite                                     as   in   the
island of Coll, the suggestion                    is   so    far favoured by the position of
Coll, which bears about                     N.N.W. from Iona, and                    is   distant about
20 miles.            But     on tho         other hand, the Convener must state that
when he visited the island of Coll                        a   few days afterwards,              ho found
that tho rocks everywhere                       were gneiss,        and     with only occasional
veins of granite.              The boulders he saw on Coll were of granite.
                                      II.       ISLAND      OF   TIREE.
      1.    Heynish         Hill,    situated      near     the    S.W.      end         of the      island,
reaches         a   height of about             600 feet above the sea-level.                   This hill
consists chiefly of gneiss rock, though in some parts the ingredients
become so coarse as to pass into granite.

                                  of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                           115
     The    hill was              ascended    from the south side, under the guidance of
!Mr M'Quarrie, who is tenant of an extensive farm, on which the
hill, or the greater part of     situated.
                                               it,

   The hill on its west side abuts on the sea cliffs.                                     The slope of the
hill there has on    a number of rocky knolls.
                                   it
     Almost every knoll has on its N.W. side, facing the                                     sea,   boulders,
more or less rounded.
     The following are the dimensions of some of the larger boulders: —
   (1.) 11 x   x         8         5    = 440 cubic feet, resting on the side of                     a   knoll
facing "W.N.W.
     (2.)       9   x   4     x   5   = 180 cubic feet, resting on the side of                       a   knoll
facing          W. by N.,             at height of 360           feet above         the sea,       which   is   a
quarter of          a    mile distant, and open between                        S.   and    N.N.W.          This
boulder                  coarse         granite — the knoll
                 is                                                  is

     (3.)       8   x   7     x   5   = 280 cubic feet, resting on the                     side of   a   knoll
facing          N.W. by N.,                at height of 365               feet above        the sea.       Sea
is   quarter of          a    mile distant, and access from                    it   is   open at any point
between S.W. and due north.
   (4.) Two clusters of large boulders were met with, the uppermost
so placed as to show that       must have come from the westward.
                                                   it
The sea          is     within half       a   mile to the westward.
   On this Heynish hill, the boulders are more                                  numerous         on the sides
facing the W. and N.W. than on any other                                        side.       On the slopes
facing the E. and S.E. there are also boulders, but in numbers not
nearly so great.
      2.    After examining Heynish hill,                         the Convener passed                through
the    island about due north along what                                  is   called the Big Cornaig
Road.            To     the eastward          of this road there are several rocky knolls,
the tops of which are from 80 to 110 feet above the                                         sea.     Most of
them present bare rock on their west sides, and have boulders also
on these sides.                     One of these knolls was ascended, called " Drum-
            "
buim             (meaning yellow rock), for the examination of                               a   boulder ob
 served to be very near its top.                         Its dimensions         were      10x6x6         = 360
cubic feet.              It   consisted       of   a   light   coloured    gneiss    ;
                                                                                         — the rock of      the
knoll       is   also gneiss, but dark coloured.
     Another rocky                  knoll about         a   mile to the N\E.               of the last, was
visited to              see   some boulders, nicknamed, in Gaelic,                           " The Giant's
Pebbles."               The legend,           as related        by   a    native resident           near    the

116                     Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
phico to the Rev.         Mr M'Donald of Helipol, who             was the  Convener's
guide on this occasion, is that three giants living in Barra, wishing
to try how far they could throw a stone, took the largest                      pebbles
they could find at Barra, and flung them in the direction                    of Tiree,
which is situated          S.E. of Barra, and about          40 miles  distant.      The
story goes, that the stones reached Tiree, and fell very near one
another.        The knoll referred to is clustered over with huge boulders.
Three or four are from           8 to 10 feet       high, and from 20 to 25 feet
along each side.            There may be about 20 or 30 boulders                 of all
sizes  ;   they are on the knoll, and none on the flat ground adjoining,
a circumstance        suggesting    that the knoll, by being above the adjoin
ing surface of the land, had intercepted the agent which was carrying
the boulders,       and caused them to be deposited            there.
    3.
          " Ben Oott " hill,     on the     north side of Tiree, forms a ridgo
running north and south for about                   a quarter of a mile,       and     is
from       120   to   130 feet    above     the   sea.   A    very large number       of
boulders,      chiefly gneiss, are on its Js'.W. flanks.             A few occur      on
the flat summit, and some arc also on the                S.E.   slope, as if they had
been pushed over the top from the             N.W.       On the flat ground beyond
the limits of the        hill towards    the S.E. there arc few or no boulders.
    4.   In Tiree,   the evidence of the sea having stood recently at a higher
level is very striking.         On   a great   part of the island there are exten
sive beds of a stratified muddy sand, sometimes                   15 to 20 feet deep,
evidently      a sea deposit.       In other    parts of the island there are huge
beds or banks of shingle, composed                chiefly of well-rounded pebbles
of hard gneiss rock, similar to what occurs on the existing shores of
all the Hebrides, at places exposed to the action of heavy                 sea waves.
The pebbles in these shingle banks sometimes are twice the size of                     a
man's head, but the great mass of the pebbles                  are  half of this  size.
They point to        a  period when the       sea  must have      stood here at least
40 feet, probably more, above the present                 level, and when, by       the
force of the waves, fragments              of gneiss rock were worn down into
elliptic, and sometimes          even     perfectly spherical,     forms.    The Con
vener brought away a few specimens.
                                HI.  — ISLAND     OF   COLL.
    1.   Under      the   guidance     of the Rev.       Mr Eraser, Free Church
minister, the Convener visited Bein Hock,                 a  hill on the west side of

                              of Edinburgh,             Session         1S78-79.                                117
the island and very close upon the                             sea.     Its highest point            is about
290 feet above the sea.
   At the foot of this hill                        there is another low                  hill,    called    Rein
Meanach, above                80 feet above the sea.                  Fig.   2   gives a sketch of both
hills.  Ben Hock has two boulders on its top, the smaller one, A,
260 feet, the larger one, B, 270 feet above the sea. Enlarged views
of these are given in figs. 3 and 4, to show their size and position,
and the fact (which Mr Fraser thought curious) that each rests on
three smaller boulders. A rests on a rock surface sloping down
X."W. at an angle of 16°. The rock on which B rests is nearly
flat.
   The boulder C                on Meanach has nothing peculiar about                               it,    except
for size — being   it           16 x 20 x 13 feet.
    These boulders               are    a     coarse granite,           which,        however,       in some
parts        passes      into   a   dark-coloured gneiss.                    The rock of the hill                 is
also gneiss         ;    but they are all veritable erratics, and must have come
 from        some region in the N."\V.
        2.   Mr Fraser next guided                 the Convener to               a   spot    situated      about
 half-a-mile            to the east      of Ben Hock,                 at Grassipol. that he might
 look at what            he   (Mr Fraser)          considered          to be an immense               accumu
 lation of boulders.
        The Convener, on viewing the place from                              a   distance,       thought that
 the blocks             might be only fragments                 from     a   cliff adjoining,         and       not
 erratics      ;   but, on going to the spot, he found they were                                     boulders,
 and in            positions of much interest.                         They       were      lying    in many
  cases over one another on a flat meadow,                               and formed an elongated
 heap, more or less parallel with the line of                               hill distant thirty or
                                                                              a
 forty yards from               them     to the S.E.                  The meadow extended N.E.
 and S.W. about 350 to 400 yards, and towards the N.W. about 200
 yards — viz., in width.                 The height of the meadow                            above        the sea
  was about 80 feet.                    The    sea was         situated to the N.W., and dis
  tant about three-quarters                   of   a   mile.      The height of the hill above
  the meadow on the S.E. was about 80 feet.                                       A   few boulders were
  lying      scattered        on the slope of this                hill facing         the    N.W.          It   was
  manifest that the great accumulation of boulders on the meadow
  along       the base of the            hill could            be best explained                 by supposing
  that the          boulders had all               come        from the          N.W., and had                  been
   skipped by the             hill in   an easterly movement.                        One of the boulders

 118                  Proceedings     of the Royal       Society
 on the meadow was 30 feet in height.               (Fig.  5 gives a     view of     this
 spot.)
    Near the west         end   of the hill just referred to there was                    a
 projecting knoll which had apparently intercepted a number                             of
 boulders.      There wero about twenty altogether piled on one another,
 and so piled as to indicate that the uppermost could not                   well have
 obtained     its position except      by   coming from         a  N.W. direction.
 (Fig.  6  is intended to show this cluster of boulders.)
    Close to this place there was a vein of quartz, which                   showed, a
 smooth surface, sloping down towards the              N.W.,     as  if polished by
 some agent which had pressed heavily over              it from that direction.
    3.  In   crossing   the island, from Arinagour          on the east coast          to
 Bein Hock on the west, by the road leading past Arnibost                       school-
 house, there is a manifest difference          in the size and number of            the
boulders.       At and near Arinagour the boulders are few in number,
 and small.      At and near Arnibost, which is about a mile inland,
 they become         numerous,    and occupy significant positions, many
 being on smoothed        rocks facing the west.
    At Grassipol, and        on the sea-coast       adjoining     Bein Hock         hill,
 there are boulders of enormous           size.     The rock on       which most of
 those boulders lie is about 90 feet above the             sea,   and slopes down
 towards the      W.N.W.       at  an  angle     of about 10°.        It   presents     a
 surface   due apparently to some powerful agency which has levelled
aud smoothed        it.  Many other examples of this can be seen, close
 to the highroad near the schoolhouse             of Arnibost, and particularly
on the low rocky        hills south of  the road.
    These    smoothed     rock surfaces, sloping down towards the north
west, are easily distinguishable from the natural surfaces of the rock
strata.      The gneiss rock, especially         in this part of      the island,      is
seldom in the form of regular beds.               Where such occur, the dip is
not towards the N.W., but towards the S. and S.E.
    At  the   S.W.    end of the island there are several         granite boulders
lying   on gneiss rocks.      One, which was the largest he saw, attracted
the Convener's special        attention, lying close to the mansion-house
of Coll,     belonging to     Mr Stewart.         Its length      was    35   feet,  its
width     15 feet, and its height above           the surface     of the ground 8
feet.    It   was leaning on, or at all events          pressing    against, a mass
of gneiss     rock on its S.E. side.         The granite was coarse-grained

                         of Edinburgh,            Session 1878-79.                                        119
and reddish,          because of the felspar             in it.        Preparations were being
made      for blasting the boulder.                      As Captain Stewart                    was        well
acquainted with this                huge       block, he had been probably thinking
of it when he saw the Iona Boulder, and                                      compared      it       to    Coll
granite.
  4.    Macculloch, in his            account     of the geology of Coll, refers to a
" block of augit " which,             he says, he found at a great distance from the
shore, and which he thought must "be a transported block,"                                               as ho
had seen no such rock in situ in the island, and he throws                                               out   a
conjecture that it may                somehow        have       come from Rum, of which
island augit,         he says, forms a large              portion.           This block of               augit
the Convener did not                meet with.
   The island of Rum is               situated     north by east of Coll, and distant
about twenty          miles.
   5.     It is   somewhat curious that two of these Coll boulders should
be described in            Dr Johnston's narrative of his tour through                                     the
 Western Highlands,               and in Boswell's          Diary.           The passages are                  as
 follows : —
   Johnston         says    :   — " For natural curiosities, I                    was    only shown
 two great masses of stone, which lie loose upon the ground — one on
 the top of the hill, and the other at                          a     small distance           from the
 bottom.          They certainly were never put into their present position
 by human strength or skill                ;   and, though an earthquake might have
 broken off the lower stone and rolled it into the valley, no account
 can be given of the other which lies on the hill, unless (which 1
 forgot to examine) there be still near it some higher rock from
 which it might have been torn.       All nations have traditions that
 their ancestors were giants, and these stones are said to have been
                                                  "
 thrown up and down by a giant and his mistress.
    Boswell, in his notes referring to these boulders,                                  says   :   — " Coll
 and    I    passed    by       a place    where there is         a    very large stone — a vast
 weight for Ajax.               The tradition      is,   that   a   giant threw such another
 stone at his mistress            up to the top of the                hill   at   a   small distance,
 and that she, in return, threw this mass down to him — all in sport.
 Mulo       me petit lusciva        pwlla."
    Again Boswell writes, 9th October 1784:                             — "As in our                present
 confinement,         anything which has even the name of curious was an
 object     of attention,       I   proposed     that Coll should show me the great

120                    Proceedings of          the   Royal Society
stone, mentioned         in  a former     page as having been thrown by a giant
to the top of a mountain.                Dr Johnston      said he would accompany
us    as  far   as     riding     on    horseback      was   practicable — which       he
did.     Coll  and     I  scrambled       up the rest.     Dr J.   placed    himself on
the ground, with          his back against         a  fragment of rock,        while we
were employed         examining the stone, which           did  not repay our trouble
in getting    to   it.     Dr  J.   amused      himself reading a book which he
found in the garret of Coil's house."
    The stone mentioned            in these extracts     as at the  "top of     a  moun
tain," is the one at the top of i,en Hock, marked                   B, and shown in
fig. 4.
   The other stone, mentioned               as   being at a " small distance from
the bottom," is C.
    Boswell observes that an examination of the boulder at the top
of the hill did not repay his trouble in getting to                      it;  but.  if he
had been able to elicit, from a study of the boulder and its site,
the information which geological               science now reveals, he would have
thought that the trouble of getting to it was well repaid, and                         ho
would have been able to give               a more     probable explanation of how-
it came to the top of the            hill, than that    a giant threw it up there at
his mistress.
                                IV. — ISLAND      OF  STAFF A.
    In  the Committee's         second Report notice is taken of a hasty visit
to this trap island by the Convener, which,                    having occurred       on a
stormy     day,   afforded       an opportunity        of discovering      only one or
two blocks of red granite.
    On account       of the interest        of finding on an island boulders or
even pebbles        of rocks,       not existing there       in  situ, the Convener,
in June last,        paid another half-hour's visit to               Staffa,  by means
of the passenger steamboat, which takes tourists to the caves.
    Ho   remembered         that, on the occasion         when he formerly visited
the island, the boulders fallen in                with  were   chiefly in the founda
tions and walls of ruined cottages and                   sheep   stalls.    The basaltic
 rocks of the island         were no doubt found less suitable for building
 purposes.      On this occasion,           by the advice      of the captain of the
 steamer, the Convener sought for pebbles and boulders                       in   a small
 bay on the cast side of the island.               He found several small boulders

                        of Edinburgh,      Session 1878-79.                       121
lying       on  the   surface,  not only of red granite, but also of gneiss,
quartzite, and limestone,         none of which occur       as 1-ocks or    strata in
Staffa.
       About fifty yards from this      place, a bank of consolidated         shingle
-was observed,       apparently an old     sea beach about     36 feet above high
-water-mark, from the breaking up of which, in all probability, the
 boulders above        specified  were derived.
       Dr   Maeculloch,     when he visited Staffa in 1818, noticed             these
 boulders, and       was much puzzled       to account   for them.       Ho says —
 "I       must    not   quit   Staffa  without   describing     a   bed of     matter
 which,       however     foreign to    the structure of the island,           is   by
 no means foreign to its mineral history, giving rise, at                  the same
 time, to geological questions of considerable importance.                    This   is
 aD     alluvial   deposit,  consisting of various    transported     stones,  which
  may be seen on the surface in different parts of the island.                   It  is
  particularly     conspicuous    near the landing place, and on the western
  abrupt      edge of the cliff.      The fragments     are of various kinds —
  quartz, granite, and blue schist, intermixed with blue quartz                  rock,
  and trap — all of them substances which enter into the composition
  of the neighbouring islands of Rum, Skye, and Mull, but which arc
  found in situ no nearer than in the latter island.              The distanca       of
  Staffa from Mull is not less than seven miles.              The surface of the
  Earth everywhere          presents   appearances   indicating      great changes
  and revolutions, of which none are more unquestionable than the
  existence     of transported stones and alluvial substances in countries
  far removed from those where similar rocks are now found in their
  natural situations.        The insular position of the example now under
  consideration, proves that it could not have resulted from the flow
  of water, whether that flow was gradual or sudden, without at the
  same time supposing a state of the surface               in which Staffa        was
  continuous, at least, with the neighbouring island of Mull."                  (Vol.
   ii.  p. 22.)
       Maeculloch      here    evidently   alludes  to    the   theory originally
   propounded by Sir James Hall for              explaining     the    transport    of
   boulders    by a diluvial current.      To render such     a  theory applicable
   to the Staffa boulders, Maeculloch assumes the necessity               of joining
   the   island to Mull, though there are now seven miles of            sea between
    them, with     a  depth of 50 to 60 fathoms.        At that      time, the idea

thought of.
                                        V.        ISLAND OF BARRA.
     This island,         near        its north end, contains                    a    magnificent boulder.
Its    size      exceeds        that of any seen by the Convener in Scotland,
and        the site it occupies                   is full of interest.                  The legend,          before
referred         to, of giants in Barra throwing                               large    boulders to Tiree,
may have been suggested to the Tirce people,                                         by hearing that             very
large boulders existed in Barra.
     On figs.         7 and 8,     two views of this boulder are given, both from
the north.             The first view is taken at about                          200 yards,        the second
about 50 yards distance.
     Tho boulder rests on                     a    broad        mass      of     gravel      and sand,           with
numerous              cockles     in    it,   at      a     height above             the    sea   of 230 feet.
It    is   distant from the            sea        about     a   quarter of        a     mile.     The present
shore      is   to the north.           The great open ocean                     is    chiefly to the        N.W.,
and very partially to the                     N.E.
      The Convener dug below the boulder in several places, and found
everywhere sand and                     fine          gravel.       A number of rabbit burrows,
under and about the boulder, confirmed                                    this observation              regarding
the materials            of the site.
      The height of the boulder                       is   about    25    or 26 feet.             Its extreme
length        is   from 37 to 38 feet                 ;    and its width         about 18 feet — assum
ing two tons for              a   cubic yard,              the weight of the boulder would be
nearly 890 tons.
      The longer axis of tho boulder was found to be                                       N.W. by N.
      The flat on which the boulder rests, consists                                          apparently of          a
sua    deposit.*          Patches of              a    similar deposit occur in several                       spots
round and              near     the    boulder, and at higher levels.                             For   example,
there       is   a    rocky knoll,            about          100       yards     to     the west,       clustered
with boulders,             255 feet above                   the    sea.    These           boulders are lying
partly on rock, partly on the shelly gravel.                                         Ben Erival         is   a    hill
adjoining the big boulder on the south, and reaching to                                            a    height      of
about 600 feet above                   the sea.             Sand with shells was found among
the rocky crevices of the                     hill,        up to   a   height of 457 feet.
      The boulder consists of                 a    coarse gniess almost approaching granite.

The        gnieas      of Ben Erival, and of the other adjoining rocky knolls,
is more         close-grained      in composition.
     On       fig.    9   there     is  a  ground      plan,     from memory,         showing
the position of the                "boulder   in relation       to adjoining     hills.    Ben
More, which reaches               a height of 330 feet above the sea, and is about
a    mile to the north, is              covered with      thick beds of sand and fine
graTel, full of cockle and other                sea shells.
     It    is also worthy of notice           that at present, the bay, immediately
to the north of Ben Erival,                   has   in it   an immense       bed of     living
cockles — so immense that it               is found profitable to gather them from
time to time, and             send them to Glasgow for sale.
     There is something therefore in the sea or the sea-bottom in this
district, which now as formerly favours the growth of the Cardium
 ertvle.
      That this         " Big  Bock of the Glen
                                                      " forms      a veritable boulder, and
 that, when it was brought to the spot which it now occupies, it was
 deposited on what was then                 a submarine bank, not much doubt can
 be entertained.*             The boulder must therefore have been floated to
 the spot where            it now lies — but from what quarter 1 From the S.,
 S.E., or S.W., come it could not ;— as Ben Erival, on whoso north
 flank      it   rests, and which ranges for about two miles cast and west,
 precludes that idea.                 There being open sea to the N.W. and N.E.,
 from either of these qtiarters it might have come, but from no other.
      The plan on fig.          9   explains more clearly how the boulder might
  have been floated from these quarters,                   and been intercepted in its
  further progress to the south by Ben Erival.
      An examination of the              numerous     smaller boulders in this district,
  also indicated           transportation from         somo point       between     west and
  north.         The following are cases         : —
       1.   To the west of        the big boulder, and about            100   yards distant,
  there is a small but steep rocky                knoll   (fig.    9, letter  b)  whose top
  reaches to a height of 255 feet above the sea, and which is covered
  with boulders, especially on the N.W.
       On a minute study of the relative positions of the boulders on this
      *
          The submarine character of the bank docs not depend solely oil the
   presence      in it of sea-shells, for they might have been blown up from the
   existing       sea-shore by storms.       But the materials forming the bank being
   found, by digging under the boulder, to consist of sand and gravel, they
   afford the strongest evidence of a submarine origin.

  124                      Proceedings       of the Royal Society
  knoll, it was         found that those which wore uppermost                 must have
  come from the          N.W., otherwise they could not            have    got into    the
 positions they occupy.
     There were no boulders near the top of the knoll on the                         S.E.
 side    ; but at the base of the knoll on that side, several boulders were
 lying, which might have fallen from the top.                  They were not heaped
 on one        another,     as they were        at the  top of the   knoll,    but  lying
 separate.
     2.    About 200 yards to the N.E. of the big boulder there                       is a
 boulder on smoothed             rock which dips due north at an angle of
 20°.       The sizo of the boulder is            5 x 4 x 4 feet.    The steepness      of
 the rock surface          on which    it   lies, is so great, that   it would have      a
 better chance of obtaining and retaining its position by coming from
the north, than from any other quarter.
    3.     About      300   yards to the S.E. of the       "big boulder" there is        a
boulder 8h          x  6  x 5 feet, at a height of about 228 feet above the
sea,    shown on fig.       10.   The boulder at its east end presses closely on
a    rock, which          has prevented        it moving further        in   an  easterly
direction.
    4.     On the N.W. side of Bon Erival, where its sides slope down
steeply to the sea, there          are numerous        boulders, and many of them
pressing        in like manner       against      the rocks   of  the   hill, in such    a
way     as to    show that they must have come from some point between
west and north.             They are at various heights, from 400 to 500 feet
above the sea.
    5.    There is a low hill to the             N.NJW. of Ben Erival, adjoining
"
   Traigh Vore," or Great Strand (a narrow neck of sand which here
separates the east and west shores), through part of which an open
fissure      in  the solid rocks runs for some distance.              It  has evidently
been one of those rents alluded to by Maeculloeh in his Account of
Barra, which had once been filled by trap, but " of which the ex
posed portions have been washed                  out."   (Vol. i. p. 89.)
    The height above tho sea-level is about 120 feet.
    For     about 80 yards, this rent or fissure now presents               two vertical
walls of gneiss, from           11  to    12   yards apart, and from       8  to 14 feet
high.
    Tho direction of the rent is (by compass)                 N.W.     and    S.E.   The
rocks on the nurilt           wall  are    rounded, and in many places           present

jagged.          The     appearances on the north walls can be naturally ac
counted for by the action of a strong                                 sea    current moving from
W.N.'W., which would, with any                          bodies floating in              or swept along
by    it,   grate against the north, but not against the south wall.                                      (See

    6. Ben More               isa    hill   on   the farm of Eoligarry tenanted by Dr
MacGillivray.                 Its west      end forms    a    steepish sea cliff, rising up to              a
height of 330            feet above the sea.              Half way up this               sea    cliff, there
is                 10x5 feet, resting on the rocky surface, which
     a boulder, 20 x
here dips towards the W.S.W.    But the rock, judging by the marks
on it, has          been       smoothed          by something passing over                    it   from the
             and the boulder                is   blocked at its S.E. end by                     a   vertical
portion of         the   hill,      as shown on fig.      1    2.
     7.     At Castle Bay, which                 is   at the    south end of Barra, the hills
are seen to         be more covered              with boulders on their                N.W.     sides than
on any other.                 This observation, however,                was made only from the
steamboat.
     Mr     J.   F. Campbell, in his             paper on the

Hebrides,"          states         that, in Sept.       1871,        he took rubbings               of stri;u
at Castle Bay, showing that the striating agent had come from N.
by    W. (magn.)
  He mentions also that on the small island of Bernera, above 12
miles to the south of Barra, " the last of the Hebrides," he got
striae at     a    height of 720 feet above the                 sea,   crossing the strike of the
rock, from          N.N.W. (Lond.                Geol. Soc.    Journal, vol. xxix.)
     In     coasting along the east shore of Barra                          it   is   perceivable,        from
the deck of the steamboat,                        that the rocks on the                 sea    cliffs which
face the          N.W.        have     been smoothed,               whilst    the      rocks facing the
 east are rough and jagged.
     8.     On the      hill called Scurrival,          whose        west side rises abruptly up
 from the         sea    to   a    height of about 240 feet, the hard gneiss rocks
 present many proofs of grinding, and                               also of transporting               agency
 from the         N.W.
     The         rock-strata here are tolerably                     horizontal        and     form blocks
 lying about north and south.                           The vertical sides facing the                      sea
 present         frequent          smoothings, which                could have been                made    by
 the      action of       a        strong    N.W. current, especially                  if     loaded      with

smoothings.
      The examples                are numerous          on this    hill of boulders blocked on
their S.E.             ends       or sides.        They are      cases     exactly similar to that
shown on fig.             12.        These boulders are within 200 yards of the open
ocean, and              less than 100 feet above its level.                        The situation and
position of these boulders combine to show that they must have
come from the westward — though                            in that direction             there       is only
tho wide Atlantic.
     At      the very top of the                  hill, which    consists        of well rounded and
smoothed              surfaces of gneiss, numerous boulders lie scattered                            — most
of them on that part of the top facing                           W.N.W.
                                         VI. — ISLAND OF SOUTH           UIST.
      1.    Beginning near the south                     end, notice has           to be    taken of         a
well        striated       gneiss         rock,    recently     exposed          by the     removal of
materials           for tho high road.               The spot is on the east bank      of Loch
Dunkellio             and at the west side of a                 hill called Carshavaule, which
is marked             on the Admiralty               map as 226      feet        high.    The striated
rock is only about 20 feet above the sea-level.
     The rock had been covered by                         a bed    of coarse sand intermixed
with clay, so that its surface had been protected                                  from the weather.
Tho protecting cover contained numerous                              pebbles, hard and angular,
the        pressure      of which           on the rock,        if they     passed       over    it,   would
probably cause                 striae.
     The rock consists                   of strata    which dip W.S.W. at an angle                         of
about        10°.       They were thus conveniently situated for being struck
and pressed on by any striating agent from the west.
     The lengths of the blocks rounded and striated were respectively,
4,   7,    and   5     feet.
     The striae run in               a     direction N.W. by N. and slope up towards
5.E. by          S.
     If     these striae          were caused by rough stones                    carried in      a     strong
current flowing from the                     N.W.,     or pushed by floating ice, the stria'
would slope              upward in the above                    direction, because the current
would in this low lying spot have to rise, to pass through                                       a     valley
situated         close at hand, immediately to the south of Carshavaule                                  hill.
     Mr     J.   F. Campbell in his                 paper (before referred to) states that in

                                of Edinburgh,             Session 1878-79.                             127

" striae         running from N. 40° W. (magn.) pointing at                                  a gap   in the
hills."'This is probably                          the same spot as that noticed by the
Convener.   It was shown                           to     him by Mr Prever,              factor to Mrs
Gordon of Clnny.
      2.     Loch Boisdale,             a sea   loch, is situated on the east coast.                 On tho
north side of the loch,                     there is a         hill called Kennet, reaching            to a
height of about 890 feet.
   The rocks on itsN.W.                         side, from bottom to top, present numerous
examples of flattened and rounded surfaces.                                      The surfaces facing
the S.E. on all                sides of the       hill   are rough and angular.               On the west
side of          the    hill,   at various        levels between          the bottom and the top,
there        are numerous boulders, some of them, by the way                                    in which
they lie, affording unmistakable                               evidence    of the       direction     from
which they came.
      For       example,        there    are two boulders on a narrow shelf of rock
 which          slopes       down S.W. at an angle of 40°.                       The shelf is 96 feet
 above the            sea,    and quite close to the              sea.    The shelf is on the           sea
 cliff, which is                so steep,        that the        wonder      is,   how the      boulders
 could have found                   a   cleft in    it    to hold them.            (Fig. No.    14 shows
 these          boulders.)          On the east side                of the       boulders thero        is   a
 projecting ledge, against which the eastmost boulder (A) presses, and
 which had stopped its farther progress eastward.     Another boulder
 (B)       lies upon         (A), and which,         to get on the         top of (A), must have
 come        from some westerly point, — probably                               the    N.W.      A     line
 through the chief points of contact and the centres of bulk runs
 in    a     direction          N.N.W.            A      study of the boulders on the spot
 showed that,            if     they had been brought to this site from any other
 direction, they would                     inevitably have slid down the steep rocky
 bank into the               sea.   These blocks are nearly equal in size, viz., about
5
x
3           x   2   feet.
      Fig.       15    shows        a   large    boulder of coarse granite               resting on         a
 wedge of gneiss rock.                     The wedge or knob               is   under the boulder        at
 its east end, and tilts up the boulder slightly so as to show daylight
 under the boulder at that end.                           It   rests on tho ground chiefly at its
 west end.              By this         wedge     (a     in    the figure) the boulder has evi
 dently         been         stopped     in its progress           from the           N.W.     From its
 rounded shape, one might infer that tho boulder had been rolled or
    vol x.                                                R

                                                                   was stopped.             The west
much rounder and smoother than any other side ; so, probably after
it had stuck, the current which brought     beat and chafed on its westit,
side, and smoothed it.    This boulder lies on level plateau of rock               a
about 202 feet above the sea.                            It    is   all      open country          towards the
N.W.       and    N.E., whilst                the Kennet               hill, reaching to           a   height of
890 feet,    is    within half-a-mile of the boulder to the S.E. and                                         E.S.E.
     On the west slope of this hill, at                            a   height of 300 feet above the
sea, the gneiss presents                a     rocky surface               sloping down towards                    the
west      at an angle               of about            10°.       A      boulder of coarse granite,
7x6x4            feet, rests partly on                  it     and on another smaller boulder
underneath.            This       boulder,        at its S.E. end, abuts                    against the rock.
It   has come, therefore,                 almost         certainly, from some north-westerly
point and stuck there.                   (Fig.     16 represents              this case.)
     Not    far    from the top of the hill, viz., at 712 feet above the
sea-level, there          isa   very large angular boulder on                           a   flat ledge       of rock,
on the N.        W.   side, with open country iu that direction.                                   This boulder
is   19x13x8              feet.         Its further            progress            eastward     has     evidently
been stopped          by    a     projecting clifi' of the hill on its south-east                               side,
as   shown in fig. 17.
     3.   Several large boulders                  may be seen at                    a   small village, where
the Free Church and Roman Catholic Church are situated at a                                                    junc
tion of the roads from Barra and Loch Boisdale, about two miles to
the south of Askernish.                        There      is       here   a   whole cluster of boulders.
One,      16x6x5           feet, leans slanting upon the others, and must have
come from the             N.W.       to attain its position.
     4.   On the hill to the east of Askernish, and on its side facing
 the west,        there        is   a    surface         of rock, sloping down W.S.W.                              at
an angle          of 30°, well smoothed.                           A    boulder rests on this slope,
 partly on the surface                    of      the     rock and partly on                       some      smaller
 boulders which lie between the rock and                                     it,   near its   S.E.     end.      The
 boulder has evidently obtained                                its position             by coming from the
 N.W.
     This   is    more clearly proved by                      a    number of ruts or               striae,    visible
 on the rock          a   few feet below the boulder, which run, as shown                                         on
 tig. 18, by the arrows,                 in   a   direction from N.W. to S.E.                             That the
 striating agent first struck the rock from the N.W.,                                         is   made evident
 by the circumstance                 that most of the                  striae are deeper           and wider at

their N. W. than at their S.E.                           ends.           This change in the              striae can bo
accounted              for by supposing that                  the striating agent as                it   moved      over
the     rock,           acted       with a lessening                pressure,           by having rebounded
from the rock after                    the first impact.
  5.        On Mingary Hill, reaching                          a    height of about 600 feet above
the sea, three miles N.E.                               of Askernish,                   many boulders occur,
especially,                  N.W. flanks. Most of them occupy
                        as usual, on the
              —
separate spots but in some places they are in clusters — heaped on one
another. In this last class of cases, there is generally a knoll of
some         kind standing up                    above         the general              surface,     on      or round
which the boulders lie.
      One of the             most interesting spots                      on this        hill   is a spur from           it
projecting N.W., to which Mr Drever (who resides at Askernish),
conducted the Convener.     His object was to point out there a
boulder of considerable size which had shortly before been seen
by       Mr Jolly of Inverness.                              The hill in                question      is shown          in
fig.     19.            The     hill     here     reaches           to    a    height of 270              feet     above
 the        sea,       and it slopes             down at an angle of about                                15°     to the
 N.W.              But about           30 or 35 feet from the top, there                            is   a   horizontal
 plateau,           on      which         a     number           of boulders              lie together.              Has
 this been an old sea-margin,                                from        which the smaller stones have
 been        washed away,                   leaving on             it,    as       on   a beach,         the     heavier
 boulders          i     The largest boulder in the figure, lower than all the rest,
 is   1
      1     x   9   x   8   feet.      It     lies on bare rock sloping down towards the
 X.W., from which quarter                              it,   as well       as all the others, had appa-
 rently come. The transporting agent                                      seems to have struck upon the
 hill, and discharged its cargo there.
       Very near the top of                     the     hill, there            is
                                                                               a        rocky surface, rounded
 and        striated,         the      striae    running           N.W. by N.                  A   vein of quartz
 about       3     inches wide crosses this rock, and for about                                      1
                                                                                                     2         inches   it
 presents          a    beautifully         smoothed          surface.
       6.    At    a    place       called Jocdar, situated on the main road one and
 a     half mile south of the Ferry                                  between             Uist and Benbecula,
 smoothed               rocks have              been     exposed              to    view by the removal of
  gravel, &c.               These rocks are at               a   height of about 25 feet above the
  sea.       The         rocks are literally                 covered           by parallel         striae,      ruts, and
  grooves, the direction                      of all which          is    N.W. by W.
       On these             rocks        there    arc        twelve or              fourteen deep              ruts and

130                    Proceedings of            the   Royal Society
grooves, some of them 4 or 5 feet                   in length.       One   of them,       at its
N.W.     end, measures 8 inches across, and 2 inches in depth ;                       another
measures        at its    N.W.      end,     12 inches in        width, and      Ih inch in
depth    ;   another    9   inches in width, and           1
                                                             \  inch in depth.           These,
and    most      of the others, show            a greater     depth and width         at their
          than at their S.E. ends.              In   fact, they all gradually     lessen and
disappear       towards the S.E.
    At this     place, the smoothed           faces of the rock slope at an          angle of
 10° or 12° to the westward.
    7.  There is another exposure                  of well rounded, smoothed,               and
striated     rocks,    close to the        Ferry     between      I»enbeeula    and    Uist —
i.e., about       half    a   mile to the west, on the south side of a bye
road.      The rocks arc here, as at the place last mentioned, of hard
gneiss, and most beautifully               polished.       They had been covered           by a
bed of clay containing numerous                    hard pebbles,      a portion of the bed
still remaining upon the polished rock.                      Here, as at Jocar, some         of
the grooves are several            inches in width, and             as  much   as   2  inches
in depth, and several feet long.                  The deepest and widest ends are
also, as before, at the          N.W.
    One of the rounded rocky bosses is polished not only on the top
but at the sides,        as  shown on fig. 20.            Having regard to the bearings
of the     knoll, which        is elliptic in shape, the          polishing and striation
on both sides         could have been effected only by                   a current flowing
from the      N.W.*
    8.  On the road           between        Grogarry      (the   mansion-house       of Mrs
Gordon        of Cluny) and            Loch      Skiport      (on    the   east coast),    the
following places of interest were observed                    :—
    At  about      1h  mile from Grogarry, on the south side of the road,
the    hard     gneiss     rock, which         had recently been uncovered, was
found to have been ground down and polished into extensive surfaces
dipping      N.N.W.,        at an angle       of about 20°.          These   surfaces     were
covered by innumerable               striae,  and by several ruts and grooves            — all
running in       a direction E.S.E. up the face of the rock at an angle of 7'
or 8°.      It is very probable that             a   current from the        N.W.,     loaded
   *
      These    two beautiful examples of rooks, smoothed and striated, at Joear
and at the Ferry, were pointed           out by Alexander Carmichael,        Esq., Creagorry,
who resides near the Ferry.           Both he and Jlra Carmichael took much interest
in th" Convener's researches, the latter kindly giving to him sketches which
she had made of several interesting boulders,

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                              131
with      hard gritty materials coming against the rock dipping                 as ahovo
explained, would            be deflected in its course along the face       of   the rock
from S.E. to E.S.E. At the N. W. end one groove measured 2 inches
wide and \ inch deep ; another, 2 inches wide and Jth inch deep.
They became fainter towards their S.E. ends.
      At   another place on the road side, the stri;v ran W.S.W., but
 the surface of the striated rock              faced   the south, and it was in           a
 confined valley only about 30 feet above the                sea.
      On the      hill adjoining,   1 22 feet above the sea, a granite        knoll      on
 an open moor showed a deep rut about 18 inches long, running from
 W.N.W., its          west end being deepest and widest.
      At   another place the boulder had in its progress eastward been in
 tercepted by a vertical ledge of rock at its east end, and it was resting
 on a horizontal bed of rock, just as in figs. 10 and 12.
      At another place        there were    5  or  6 huge   boulders piled over one
  another, all resting on           a  rocky knoll, standing above the general
  surface     of   the adjoining district.      The topmost boulder, lying in              a
  slanting      position on the others, could have obtained that position
  only by coming from the westward.                   This  spot was 80 feet above
  the sea.
       About      3 miles to the      north of Askernish,        on the east side of
  the main        road, there is a perched block of granite, on the pointed
  summit of a rocky hill about             1 30 feet above the sea.         Two views
  are    given in tigs.     21 and   22.  The base on which the boulder stands
  is exceedingly          narrow.     The boulder is in size 14          x 12 x 8 feet,
  and its contact        with  the rock is only     6x4    feet.    A  steep    hill  rises
   near the boulder         on its east side, but the boulder could not have
   fallen from it.        That hill would arrest an iceberg or ice-floe,           if   the
   boulder came        in that way from     the west.      As    the  ice melted,       the
   boulder might have          subsided gently on the peak.             Some      smaller
   boulders      cap a rocky      knoll below,    as shown on the figures.              All
   these    indicate transport from the       N.W.    by some means.
       9.  Loch Eport is        a remarkably narrow arm of the             sea,   on the
    feist  coast,    which    runs more     than    half-way     across   North Uist,
    towards the west coast.          From the deck of the steamboat numerous
    boulders were        seen, most of them resting on knolls.             The smooth
    faces of   the rocks were all strikingly towards the N.W., whilst the
    rough    and jagged rocks all fronted the S.E.

                                                             showed         that         the
their smoothest sides towards the N.W., and their rough sides
towards the S.E.    Boulders in great numbers were lying on these
smoothed        surfaces, and on the              N.W.        sides    of   the hills.
    Before      concluding        his notice           of Uist,        the Convener may                    advert
to one       feature     in the physical aspect of the island, viz.,                                      the ex
traordinary         number        of small lakes.                 When       any         of the          hills    are
climbed, which afford even                     a tolerable        view of the low grounds,                            it
would almost seem that more of the island consists of lakes                                               than     of
dry land.           The cause of this feature                     probably         is,   that the generai
level of the island              is   so    little     above       the      sea,    that the             hollows
occupied        by these         lakes      can      never        be   emptied.                It   is    another
striking feature, that most of these hollows lie in the same direction,
viz.,    W.N.W.        and     E.S.E.
                                     VII.— ISLAND           OF CANNA.
    The Convener when                     in the steamboat               made        the acquaintance
of Mr William Bain, generally residing at Tiree, who takes                                                      con
tracts    for       erecting     buildings        in        the    Hebrides.              He         mentioned
that he had lately built                   a   new     schoolhouse            in Canna,              an island
situated near Rum.                He told the Convener that he had found                                          on
the islet of Sanda,            which forms the south side of Canna Harbour,
blocks of       a     red sandstone            which he made use of for the lintels
and corners of the school doors and windows.                                   The largest of these
blocks was about             6   x    4x   2   feet.         He knew that these sandstone
blocks differed from the rock of the island, which he described                                                   as
a   sort of blue slaty schist,                  ill-adapted for building.                            He reco"-
nised these red sandstone                  blocks      as    of the same nature                     as rocks      in
 the island of Hum, which were good for building purposes, as he had
 quarried them for that purpose.
    This statement       Mr Bain by                    is    confirmed         by    Macculloch.                 He
      — " Sandy isle, like Canna,
 says                                                   presents         examples              of    a    circum
 stance      rare    in the      Western          Islands,         viz., loose           fragments           of    a
 different rock from that of which                     it    is   formed,      lying on the surface.
There are largo blocks of red sandstone somewhat rounded, and they
are found in considerable abundance on the flat shores of both. The
                                                                                                            '

                          of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                      133
rock       of which they consist is that which forms                sr< largo, a portion
of    Eum and of Skye.' " (Vol. i. p. 467.)
     With reference        to the conjecture that these red sandstone           boulders
in    Sandy may have been transported from Rum or Skye, a proba
bility      of its correctness is afforded by the circumstance that the red
sandstone rocks of Rum and Skye                   are situated on the sides of these
islands facing Sandy and Canna.
                                      VIII. — HARRIS.
      1.    At  Bodeh     the south end of Harris, there is               a  hill called
 Strondaval,        638 feet      high.    It   is steep and rocky        on   all sides,
 especially the west and south.                 The Convener, under        the guidance
 of Lord      Dnnmore's gamekeeper,            scrambled along its south and oast
 sides, and found that the smooth                    faces   of the rocks all looked
 towards the W.N.W.                On the east side of the          hill there    was an
 entire     absence    of smoothed      rocks.     That side    had   apparently been
  the    lee side, not having been grated upon by the agency,                  whatever
  that was, which had smoothed the west                  side.
      There were many boulders on the hill, chiefly angular                       ;  some
  pretty large, but none of any special interest.
      2.   At Borve, on the         west   coast, about half-way        between Rodel
  and Tarbert, there is a remarkable accumulation of boulders on the
  side of the hill, sloping down to the             sea.   The general dip of the      hill
  (which reaches a height of about 800 feet) is towards the                      west   or
  west by north (magn. ). The rocks are of gneiss, and present a                 series of
  beds, layers, or benches more or less horizontal, forming, as it were,
  a gigantic      staircase along the      hill  face for about   half   a mile, several
  hundred       feet high — all more or less covered             by boulders.       These
  benches of rock, in many places, show that they have been rounded
   by severe pressure from west by north.                The boulders which lie on
   them give evidence of transport from the west.
      Fig. 23 is intended, by a sectional view of the hill, to show
   the disposition of its rocks and the position of the boulders on
   them.
      Fig. 24 gives a view of two boulders lying on                  a  portion     of the
   rocks forming the        hill just mentioned.          The position of both indi
   cates blockage and stoppage           on their east sides.      Their own relative
    positions afford similar evidence,

   3.   Near Lach Castle valley, i.e., about           l\  mile south of it, and
about    2  miles north of Borve, a striated rock was observed on the
roadside.        It  had   recently been uncovered        by the removal of road
materials.        The rock was Silurian.           It  was well     smoothed,     and
sloped gently to the west.           The  striae  were minute, but         quite dis
cernible, and running N.W.              The rock was on the           N.W. side of
the   hill called in     the Admiralty   chart Carron      Hill, and   close to   the
sea,  which was all open toward the N.W.                  As Carron Hill, with a
height     of    786    feet,  was  to the     S. and    S.E.,   the   presumption
afforded     by the surrounding        land features      was   that the striating
agent hat', come from the north.
   4.   Lach      Castle bay and valley is shown on figs. 25 and 26.
When the tide is out, the road between Borve and Tarbert crosses a
sandy flat    ;   but when the tide is up, the margin of the land is indi
cated by the        dotted line.     There is an immense          accumulation      of
boulders on the S.E. side of the hill marked A, where                  Carron Hill,
above referred        to, is situated.   The   X  on the lig. indicates the sfwt
where the striated        rock was observed.
   If, when       the sea stood say 1000 feet or more above              its present
level, boulders were brought by a current from the                 N.W.,    the facts
observable      in this Lach Castle valley could be explained.
   In that      case,   the current would flow through the valley, pressing
most    upon the range of hills on the east side, and smoothing its
rocks; whilst the rocks on the west side of the valley would remain
rough.      This is found to be the      case on an     examination of the two
sides   of the valley.
   Icebergs or floo ice carrying boulders may have flowed up the
valley from the north, discharging them               chiefly on the hills along
the east side       of   the valley.   These hills bear on their sides and
ridges numerous         boulders, some of large size.       Several of these were
examined,       and   one or two gave       indubitable     proof,   by their sites
and    by their own positions, that they had come from the north
or  N.W.
   In   the centre of the valley there is an elongated             ridge (as shown
on fig. 25, I.e.) which bears far more boulders than the depressed
portions between it and the sides of the valley.               There may be two
ways of accounting for this.             If  the valley     was originally     of  its
present form, any ice borne on a current flowing through the valley

                          of Edinburgh,      Session 1878-79.                         135
from the N. W. would strand more frequently on the central ridge
and on the east side than elsewhere.                   If the valley was originally
filled up to the level of the central ridge, the debris at its two sides
must have been             scoured    out by the rivers now flowing through it;
and in this         case,  whilst  the boulders    in these  parts would       gradually
 find their way to the channel of the rivers and to the sea, the central
 ridge would retain most of the boulders originally lodged on it.
       On this ridge the smoothed rocks face due N. and not N.W.
  This deviation          may be accounted for by the valley                 here   being
  between two elevated ranges of hills running almost duo north and
  south, which would cause the current to flow in             a  direction due south.
       One of the boulders on this central ridge measured                  16x14x12
  feet, = about 200 tons in weight.
        It will    be observed that on       the   S.E. side of    A    there is a large
  accumulation         of boulders.     These might have been floated there by
  an eddy occasioned by the projecting headland near A.
        5.   Almost     H   mile to the south of        Tarbert,    there    are   several
   large boulders, on the east side of the high road leading from Tar
   bert to Lach Castle.             The Convener, on examining             them,    found
   them to be granite of a grey colour, whilst the rocks in the hills
   about them are gneiss.
         These boulders being within half           a mile of tha     sea,  which is to
    the eastward, and being at a height of about 100 feet above the sea-
    level.    it might have    been presumed      that they could have come from
    the eastward.         But  these   boulders were on      hill   slopes    facing the
    west; and as the slopes were stecpish, it was not easy to understand
     why,    if the boulders had      come from the east, they had not rolled to
     the foot of the slopes.        On the other hand, there were towaids the
     west and north, ranges         of hills, reaching to heights above the level
     of the bouldere, viz.,toabout       200 or 300 feet.    But towards       the  N.W.,
     and at a distance of three-quarters of a mile, there was a gap or
     depression      in the hill range; and,       on applying     the spirit-level,     it
      was   found     that the depression was about the            same level as the
      boulders, so that they might have          come    from that quarter by flota
      tion, and been lodged on their present sites.
          Fig. 27 is intended to represent what has just been described.                 B
      are the    boulders,  AAA    a range   of hills  to the westward,       with   a gap
      in those at G, bearing      N.W. from      the boulders.

    6.     On the hills north of Tarbert there are many                            unmistakable
signs of a     N.W. current           up to the highest level which the                Convener
was able to climb to, viz., 800 feet above the sea.
    (a.) There are multitudes of knolls or bosses of rock, rounded and
smoothed    on their west sides, but rough on their east sides.  There
are none which show opposite                       markings.
   (I/.) There are many cases of boulders lying in such a way as to
show that they had been stopped there in their progress eastward.
One        example   is given in fig 28, where hard gneiss rocks had been
rounded       and smoothed           from the westward, and a number of boulders
— several of granite — were lying at the base of these rocks.     A
westerly current, if it smoothed the rocks, might have also brought
the boulders.
    (c.)    At Avon        Sue, or Fincastle, the handsome                mansion-house of
Mr Scott, banker, London,                     on the sea-shore      about       11    miles west
from Tarbert, the following observations                       were made   :   —
    A lit tle way up         the   hill,   above the stables, a striated rock was met
with.       The smoothed rock sloped down towards the                     sea      in a direction
S.S.E.        Three ruts on this smoothed                   surface when measured               were
found to      be    from 18 to 23 inches               long, and about         2   inches wide
Their direction was due east and west.                         The ruts were deepest and
widest at the west end.                  In   consequence      of the direction in which
the      smoothed      rock        sloped,     a    N.W. current, coming              against     it,
would bo diverted into               a     direction nearly due east.              The lines of
the ruts in that direction ran up on the rock surface at an angle of
about 8° or 10°.
    On tins hill slope there were several boulders whose                             position in
dicated      clearly that they had                  come from the westward, — that is,
from the      sea.     These proofs were the same as those explained                              in
regard to other cases (see tigs. 10 and 12), and therefore                           need not be
repeated here.
                     IX.   — ROAD     FROM TARBERT TO STORNOWAY.
    1.     Where     the joad leaves the              sea   and   strikes north        there     are
enormous        boulders, partly buried in drift, on the west                          flanks of
the hills.         This    road reaches            its summit level at about 650 feet
— a      distance    of about         2    miles.      The valley    is   narrow, between
ranges of high         hills   on each side, and runs in              a   direction E.N.E.

                               of Edinburgh,                   Session 1878-79.                                     137
As the summit                  was        approached,            it   was observed             that the boulders
became less in size and fewer in number.                                       This is quite intelligible
if all   the country had                  been under the sea, and a current flowing from
the    W.N.W.,            as this valley, on account of its direction, would have
no great force of current in                           it,    and the passage would be too narrow
for much          ice to pass through it.
   At       the summit level,                    a     striated rock was observed,                          the    stri;e
running W.S.W., i.e., parallel with the general axis of the valley.
  2. At Ardvourlie there       trainee of boulders extending for
                                                     is   a                                                              at
least half       a    mile, running in                a     direction east by north.                On examining
several clusters of boulders,                         it    became apparent that the boulders had
come not from the east but from the west.
      Ardvourlie,           to which this trainee reached,                          is   close to the sea, viz.,
 on a branch of Loch Seaforth, and the valley rises in                                                   a    direction
 about west by south.                            In       following with the eye the line of the
 trainee,        it   was seen to point towards                            a   gap or depression                  in the
 range of hills at the west, distant about two miles.                                              The Convener
 regretted very much that                             it      was not      in his power               to follow this
 trainee and investigate the correctness of his conjecture — that the
  boulders may have come from the westward through the gap.
       3.   Soval      is  a   shooting lodge of Sir James Matheson, on the road
  to Stornoway, and about                             12     miles from it.           To the east of Soval
  there     is   a rocky ridge, distant about half a mile, and at                                        a    height of
  about 220 feet above the                           sea.
       On this rocky ridge the smooth faces of the rocks look towards the
  N.W.           Indeed, in the whole of the district north of Ardvourlie,                                                a
  distance of about 15 miles, this was the                                          case       with      all the hills
  passed.
       On the ridge just mentioned                              there was       a   boulder close upon its
  edge,     which          gave         clear indication              of   a   N.W.           current.        The rock
  lorming         the site         of    the boulder had been smoothed,                               and     it   sloped
  towards         W.N.W. at                an angle of from 20" to 25°.                            The boulder            is
  in     size         x   3|   x   2     ft.     The longer axis of the boulder                          is   W.N.W.,
  and its sharpest end                     is   towards the west.                It      is   shown in fig.        29.
       4.   For       7   or   8   miles to the south of Stornoway, the district passed
  through         by the high road                            from Tarbert, Ardvourlie,                   and Soval,
   consists       of an extended plain covered                                 by peat and coarse pasture.
   The height above the                        sea   is     from 200 to 230 feet.                 No hills        or even

138                             Proceedings      of the Royal Society
rocks arc visible.                 There is an entire absence of boulders.                         From
the banks of the small streams                     and the ditches by the side                    of the
road,       it was plain that            sand and gravel lies in great beds immediaWly
below the surface.
                                   X. — NORTH PART OK THE LEWIS.
      The Convener, through the courtesy of                       Mr M'Kay of Stornoway,
Sir James Matheson's factor,                     was    enabled to visit Lochs Ourn and
Sheil, arms of the                 sea, to the   south of Stornoway, on the cast coast
of Lewis.              He landed from the steam yacht at both of these places,
and had time to ascend several hills.
      The rocks here,             as at most    other places, present their smooth faces
to the    W.N.W., their rough faces to the E.S.E.
      At Loch Ourn, one of the boulders at a height of                             200     feet above
the sea (size           7x5x4            feet) lay on the west        side    of   the   hill   upon    a
rock surface sloping down to                     N.W.    at an angle of 20°.
      At Loch Sheil,              at a height of 325           feet above      the sea, the oniy
boulder of any                   size    (10x6x4       feet)    was    on     a hill-side         facing
W.N.W., and                 on a rock surface          sloping down in that direction at
an angle of 15°             ;    but    5 or 6 yards   below the boulder, the slope down
of the rock was 30".                     The longer axis of the boulder pointed west
by north.
      The       yacht steamed             round the     "Shiant" Islands, to               afford      an
opportunity             of seeing          their magnificent basaltic columns.                     They
are        on a   grander scale than those in Staffa, and exhibit remarkable
curvatures.             These islands are partly composed                    also of schists and
stratified rocks, more susceptible                     of diluvial action          than the hard
basalt      ;   and    it   was easy to see even from the deck                     of the steamer
that        a   N.W.        current had        acted     on    them.          Boulders          also   of
considerable           size were observed          on the slopes facing the              Jv.W.
      The Convener regretted                  much     that there was no opportunity of
landing.
      4.    U   ig,   on the west coast of Lewis.               On the hill near the parish
church, about 186 feet above the                       sea,   all the smoothed           rocks front
W.S.AV".,         and on many rock surfaces                    sloping down towards west
boulders were lying.
  At two          places, rocks were found with ruts and striae.                         As at both,
the general            features were the same, one only may be illustrated                             by

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1 878-79.                                     139
a    diagram, fig. 30, and on account                   of a peculiarity that the            ruts
crossed a fissure        in   the rocky surface.
     The general surface of the smoothed                     rock at both places dipped
doe west      at an angle of         1 2°,  and looked out on the             Atlantic    Ocean,
which was only a quarter of                a  mile distant.       The direction of the ruts
and striae was the same at both places, viz.,                     W.N.W., and rising           up
E.S.E. on the         surface    of the rock       at an angle of about 10°.          Probably
owing to the obstruction which                   a  current striking the rocky surface,
dipping due west, would                meet, a      W.N.W. direction would be the
result    of a current from            the    N.W. At both places the nits were
wider and deeper at the west ends than at the east ends.                                 One of
the ruts was carefully measured, and showed at the west end a width
of 2 inches and          a  depth of      J  of an inch    ;   at the east end a depth of
£th of an inch         ;  and there, the width ceased to be distinguishable.
     The peculiarity           before    referred     to  was     a small fault or fissure
 crossing the rocky surface             as   shown on the figure by the letters a,              h,
 r.     The   fissure    had caused,        as  it  were, an upthrow           of the rock, of
 about     J of an inch.          Where       the rut     crossed the       fissure, there was
 a   slight   deviation       in  the line of the         rut,   as   shown in the figure.
 The hard pebble or stone which produced the rut, meeting with the
  obstruction caused          by the upthrow, had been slightly diverted from
  its course,    but it had eventually             passed    over the upthrow, breaking
  off the edge of the rock.
      5.  Miavig is        a   small hamlet situated on an arm                     of the    sea,
   branching up from Loch Roag on the west coast of Lewis.                                About
   half a     mile   to the      N.W.       of Miavig        a   hill   called    " Dramamin
            "
   Voltas     (height above sea 270 feet) rises above                   the    general   surface
   of the  district, and has been the means of arresting                        a multitude of
  large boulders.         They are clustered and piled over one another upon
   the   north and west sides of the hill (sec fig. 31).                     A few lie on the
  cist side, a little way below, as if they had tumbled or slipped down
  from the top.
                             from " Garry-na-hine

      6. On the road                                            to Loch Carlowrie          there
  ure several     objects of interest.
      The hills are rocky.           Their     smoothed faces arc all, as elsewhere, on
  and towards the west;             their rough faces on and               towards     the east.
  There seems, however, to have been a slight change here in the
   direction of the current         ;  for whilst at Breasdeit village the smoothed

140                          Proceedings               of the Royal Society
rocks      faced       W.N.W., towards                  the north there was a gradual                      change
to due west, and then ultimately at Carlowrie to                                         W.S.W. and          S.W.
Thesa       deviations from the normal direction                                     occur        at low     levels.
Near the hill tops, at from 300 to 400 feet above the                                             sea,   there was
little deviation from                    W.N.W.
   The Convener examined                           a   striated rock near the                     north end         of
Loeh-na-Muilve                mentioned by Mr James Geikie in his paper on                                     the
glacial phenomena                     of the Hebrides (" London Geological Society's
                "
Journal              for 1873,        p. 537). As there are some points of interest on
this rock not included in Mr Geikie's notice of                                    it,   a   representation        of
the rock        is    given in fig.        32.
   The rock dips down towards W.S.W. at an angle of about 30°.
There are two portions of smoothed                                    rock visible           as   shown in the
figure — the            space between              them          consisting of       a    stony clay, which
probably lies on rock, though the rock                                 is   not visible.            The part       of
the rock which               is   visible has evidently been smoothed by the passage
over       it   of some material — such                          as   the clay, of which                 a portion
remains,            containing pebbles and stones.                          The   striae      and ruts are not
all parallel.            The lowest rise upwards across the rock at an angle of
about 8°.             The ruts in the upper portions of the rock surface rise
up more quickly                   till   at length, in the highest                    part, they rise at an
angle of about 26°.                       Another feature               is,   that some of the ruts are
deeper and wider at their west end than at their east end.                                                     The
directions of the lowest ruts                          is   N.W., of          the highest          W.N.W.          If
the general line of the current was                               W.N.W.,         the highest ruts would
be more             likely   to indicate that direction than the lowest.
      At Garry-na-hine, and                  also on the hills                about two miles north of
it,   there arc numerous                   cases       of boulders on smoothed                      rock surfaces
facing the west, the boulders being blocked at their S.E. ends by
special obstructions, which were in each case distinctly observable.
      7.   Mr James Geikie                   refers         to    a   water shed             called      " Beinn   a
Bhuna" on the road between Stornoway and " Garry-na-hine," where
he says there are
                                  "   smoothed         and glistening domes of gneiss."
      The Convener examined                        all the rocky knolls at the place referred
to, on both sides of the summit level, which                                    is   about 400 feet above
the sea.              The smoothed surfaces are numerous,                                and particularly          on
the west             side, where          they face the N.W.                      The boulders are also
more        numerous              on that side,             and       are generally on rock surfacts

                           of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                          141
dipping        toward W.N.W. at angle of 10° or 12°.                      The longer axis
of the boulders was mostly in the same direction.
    8. About two miles east of " Garry -na-hine," a quarry on the road
side at a height of about 160 feet above the sea had been opened
for road materials.               A   tough strong clay covers the gneiss rocks
here    ;   and.    above the clay there are beds of gravel and sand,                         all
evidently sea deposits.
     9     The Convener visited             the rocking      stone on a       hill   358    feet
above the sea near Tolsta, about                  12 miles to the         N.E. of Storno-
way.         Resting       on the gneiss      rock, at    a  part of its base near the
centre,      it can be      moved a few inches up and down by the hand only.
 It   is about       18 feet long, 5 feet high, and 4 feet wide.                   Its   longer
 axis points         N.N.W.        There is an opening among the hills in that
 direction, through which it might have been floated to its site ;
 whilst towards the S.E. the hills reach to a greater height, and would
  prevent        the boulder       coming from that quarter.               The boulder is
  extremely angular, and has undergone                   no rolling or pushing.
       10.    About     five miles to the       N.E. of Stornoway           there    are three
  hills called the Barvas Hills,             each from 800 to 900 feet high.
       The Convener           examined tho two eastmost hills, and found                       as
   iollows     : —
       Both hills        on the     N.   and    especially    tho   N.W.      sides,    present
   precipitous cliffs, and surfaces well rounded and smoothed                         ;  but no
   striae    were seen.
       On the W. and S.W.               sides of the middle         hill,  there are also a
   few smoothed rocks.
       There are boulders on both hills on all sides, and up to nearly
   the top, but they are           in greatest numbers on the          N.W.     sides.
        On    the middle      hill, very   near the top       on its   N.W.      side, one of
   the smoothed rocks is traversed                  by a   thick vein of quartz.             The
   quartz also presented             a smoothed      surface.     A   specimen       of it was
   brought away.
        There was one boulder             (6x5x4         feet)   lying on     a sido      of the
    middle       hill facing N. by E.         It  might have come from the N.W.,
    as    in that direction         there   was    no obstruction.         From N.E., E.,
    S.E., or S., it is difficult             to suppose      it could      have     come,      on
    account of the interposition of the eastmost hill.
        On the eastmost hill, at          a  height of 700 feet on the north side,

  142                  Proceedings     of the Royal        Society
 rocks were found smoothed from the               N.W.       A  portion of smoothed
 quartz was found here also.
     1 1.  The Convener drove along the coast from Barvas village                         to
 Dalbeag,      a distance     of about   9 miles.        He was unable to reach
 Dalbeag hills, about          2  miles farther on.        He could      see,   however,
 that these hills presented large surfaces            of bare rock on their west
 sides.     He ascended one or two other hills of granite situated close
 to the sea,       and  up to a height of about 380 feet.              On these      liills
 ho found abundance            of smoothed      rock surfaces       sloping down to
 W.N. W.         In  one case only, the direction was somewhat                abnormal,
 viz., west by north.
    About half       a mile to the east of Dalbeag farm-house                 there is a
 steepish bank facing the sea (which is due west, and only a quarter
 of a   mile distant), surmounted by          a  cliff, as shown in fig. 33.         The
 bank is about 50 feet high, and is covered                by boulders and gravel.
 On the very top, viz., about 285 feet above the               sea,  the bare granite
 rock has been planed down and is occupied by                a  number of boulders.
The only boulders which showed               direction of transport indicated             a
 N.W. direction.
    At    Sheabost,    a  place between      Dalbeag and Barvas, notice was
taken of a remarkable           assemblage of gravel knolls          on both side3 of
the road, but not forming a continuous kaim.                     These     knolls were
approximately elliptic in shape, the longer axis being about 50 or
 100 yards,       their breadth 10 or 12, and their height from 20 to
 30 feet.      Most of these gravel knolls have their longer axis running
in nearly the same direction, viz., north and south.                  Large boulders
lie on these knolls, and mostly on the west sides.
                                                                                   '
    The boulders were in some places piled above one another.                        The
uppermost       showed from their position that they had come from the
westward.         The height of these knolls above the            sea   is about     1 30
feet.     The distance from the sea-coast is about half a mile.
    Nearer Barvas village there is         a lake called TJrraghay, on the west
side of which there          is a remarkable assemblage of large boulders,
some of them         granite,   forming   a sort    of trainee    running      W.N.W.
No rock      is visible here.      The ridge on which the boulders lie seems
to be composed         of coarse water-borne         gravel.     One of the largest
boulders measured         12   x 10 x 5 feet.       Its longer axis lay W.N.W.
The uppermost         boulders indicated transport from the N.W.

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1878-79.                         143
      At Shadir, about 4 or 5 miles to the east of Barvas, there is a
lake whose longer axis runs N.N.W. ; its west bank has on it a
considerable number of boulders, at a height of 240 feet above the
sea.
      At Galston       farm and shooting-lodge         there  are some rocky cliffs,
 reaching to a height of           120 feet above      the  sea,  bared   as   usual on
 the    N.W.      slopes, and having a few small boulders on these slopes.
       A   new school       was   built  last   year  near   Shadir, the stones for
 which consisted entirely of boulders extracted from under the peat.
 One of the masons employed on the school stated that many of the
 boulders consisted of Dalbeag granite, a variety which, on account
  of being better adapted for building than most of the rocks in the
  island, is well known         to the native masons.        One of the gateways to
  Stomoway castle          was built of it.       Dalbeag is distant from Shudir
  about 14 miles, and bears from Shadir west by south.
       The scarcity of boulders in         the district between      Barvas and the
   Ness, when compared with their numbers                almost everywhere        else in
   the Lewis, may probably be accounted                for by the absence of any
   ranges    of hills in   the north end of the island.        If the  sea stood    1000
   feet    or more     above  its present     level, with a current in it from the
   N.W., and this current loaded with ice carrying               boulders,   it is  to be
   expected that these ice floes, when obstructed              in their progress by
    submarine rocks, would discharge            their stony cargoes on these rocks,
    whilst in the districts        where   there   were no submarine rocks,            the
    current would flow on unimpeded.
        12.  In   the neighbourhood of Stornoway there is the peninsula of
    Eye, on which the Convener found some smoothed rocks, and some
    boulders deserving of notice.          Smoothed rocks occur to the west of
    Phabaill village, their smooth sides facing the west.                 Boulders of
     LTieiss and of a hornblendic rock lie on the moor to the S.W. of
     the village.     The rock in situ here is a species of conglomerate                or
     breccia.     The gneiss boulders most probably come from the Barvas
     hills, as   they   consist    of gneiss.     The   Convener      was    told    of  a
     hornblendic      rock, similar to that of the boulders,           being     on    the
     N.W. shore of the Eye peninsula, but he had not time to go in
      search  of it.
         The Convener was informed by Henry Caunter, Esq. ,               a gentleman
      of scientific knowledge resident at Stornoway, in the employment of
            VOL X.                                                             S

144               Proceedings      of the Royal Society
Sir James Matheson, of        a sandstone   boulder near the     brickwork a:
Garabost, unlike any rock at present known in the Lewis              ; and. he
pointed out to the Convener some building               stones brought     from
Loch Broom on the coast of Wester Ross, which he thought               exactly
resembled    the rock composing the boulder.
   As  the   occurrence    of this  sandstone    boulder at Garabost      is of
importance, by its bearing       on the question of transport, the         Con
vener made     a special  inspection of it.
   The    Convener,    having     been   introduced     by   Mr Caunter          to
M'Fadzyen, the manager of the brickwork,             was taken by the     latter
to the boulder, and was informed by him that some years                  ago     it
had been partially blasted with        gunpowder for building        pur1w?es,
It had originally weighed about        8 or 9 tons,   but the lower half    still
remained, showing its shape and position.          The boulder was a coarse
brown sandstone,      full of quartz    pebbles   about    the size of a small
pea.
   The boulder was on the side of        a hill sloping towards the     sea,   on
the  N.W.   side   of the Eye peninsula, and facing the west.            It  was
buried in   a bed   of gravelly clay, which had all the appearance              of
being   a  marine deposit,     and  it was   within    a mile's distance from
Garabost brickwork.         The height of the boulder above the sea          was
about   50 feet, and its distance      from the sea about      a  quartet of     a
mile.
   The Convener found on the surface of the same hill, sloping                  to
the west, another sandstone        boulder about the size of a man's head,
exactly similar in composition.
   The   hill  on the side of which these boulders were lying, rises up
gently towards the S.E. to a height of about 160 feet above the              sea.
   Now it   appears, from what      Mr Caunter     stated, that no sandstone
rock, exactly similar to that of these boulders, had been seen in             the
Lewis  ;  but, on the other hand, the geological        formation or class of
rocks  to which     these   sandstone   boulders belong, does exist in       the
Lewis.     Dr Macculloch, in his       geological   map of the West High
lands, indicates, by its appropriate colour, this formation as occurring
for many miles on the east coast of the island, near Stornoway.
   The Convener had pointed out to him by Mr Caunter a long               range
of high cliffs along the shore, to the north and south of Stornoway,
of a sandstone    breccia or conglomerate,     identical in composition with

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1878-79.                           145
a breccia       or conglomerate       occuning      on the      mainland, and which
I)r   Maeculloch       and Professor Nicol (" London Geological Society's
Journal" for         1856, p. 37) concur in representing as " the bottom
beds" of the          great    sandstone    formation which          lines the north
west coast of Scotland, and which constitutes the entire mass of a
number of small islands lying off the coast, extending from Cape
Wrath       to Skye, a distance     of about     100 miles.      Dr Maeculloch        men
tions having observed a similar conglomerate                  on the west side of the
Lewis.        ("Western Islands," vol.         i. p. 196.)
    These breccia sandstone cliffs extend along the east coast of Lewis
for    about      15    miles.     Referring      to    them,     Mr James          Geikie
                                                      "
 (" London Geological Society's Journal for 1873, p. 534)                       says that
 " red
          sandstone and conglomerate of Cambrian age cover                     a  portion
 of the Eye peninsula and the shores of Stornoway harbour                      at  Arnish
 point.      The same deposits        are continued        north   as   far as  Gres." —
 Gres is about 15 miles to the north of Arnish.
     This sandstone formation          is not confined     to the coast.      It  extends
 some distance inland, though how far has not been ascertained.                         Mr
  Caunter showed to the Convener a bed of the breccia in the channel
  of a stream      which runs through his garden               on the north       side   of
  Stornoway.        Mr Geikie, in his paper before          referred to, suggests that
  " red sandstone                                          at no great distance from
                       may occupy the sea-bottom
  Cellar   Head, and hence wo are not compelled to suppose that these
  sandstone     fragments     have   travelled from the mainland"               (p.  539).
  The    "sandstone       fragments"      here    alluded     to  by   Mr Geikie,       are
  " red sandstone
                       boulders, lying in the fields, which we found at the
  Butt
         "                                                                     " the sea-

  west coast).       Cellar Head is a point on the east coast of Lewis,
  5 or  6  miles south from " the Butt."
     Mr    Caunter told the Convener that he had seen the sandstone
  boulders on the shore between              the   Butt of Lewis         and   Ness, and
  that they occur there inland up to a height of 300 feet.
     Now,     a presumption arises, from the number of these sandstone
  boulders at and near the Butt, that there must be in that district
  rock  in situ of the       same nature.        The Convener regretted             having
  been   prevented searching the coast and fields between the Butt and
  Bar? as, to examine these boulders and                 see  if any   sandstone     rocks

                                                         He, however, saw
the intelligent ground officer at Barvas, and learnt from him that
about a mile or more to the west of the mouth of the Barvas
river, where it flows into the                          sea, there are       rocks which seemed to
him to have the appearance                             of sandstone         rocks,      but that he was
not competent to judge of such                          a matter.
   In     these circumstances,                   the     presumption is that the sandstone
boulder at Garabost came, like all the other boulders in the                                             Lewis,
from the westward,                  and not from the mainland of Ross-shire.
   13. The Convener                      (IX.,       art. 4)    referred     to the flatness             of the
district to the south of Stornoway.                             Between Stornoway and Barvas
and also both towards Dalbeag and the                                   Butt of Lewis, the island
presents similar tracts of flatness.                           The general height above the sea
is much            the   same over both                 districts, viz., from 200 to 300 feet.
The deposits forming these extensive plains consist of great sheets
of gravel, sand, and stony clay,' — the clay being generally the lowest
bed.          In    these      Hat districts,           there      is   a    remarkable scarcity                of
boulders           when compared with their number to the south, and these
few are much below the average size.
   A     great       many sections             of these deposits were examined for                             sea
shells    ;
              — but      the only place where                  shells were seen by the Convener
was at the brickwork                     of Garabost above referred                     to.     These shells
— chieflythe Cardiura edule —have long been an object of interest,
and were examined by the late Dr John Davy of London, as well as
by Sir Charles W. Thomson and Dr Carpenter.    At one time they
were thought to be arctic                        ;   but the latest opinion               is,   that they      are
of the type now existing in the adjoining sea.
   Mr James Geikie                  gives an account             of this Garabost deposit in the
memoir read by him before the London Geological Society in                                                April
1878.         But his         account     is   founded,        as he says,     chiefly on information
supplied by              Mr    Gaunter,     whose letter he quotes.                  As the Convener
made      a    careful examination of this clay-bed, he gives, with the aid
of fig. 34, the following                      description of           it
                                                                        :   — a,   is   gneiss rock       ;
                                                                                                              b,
                                                                                                              is
coarse shingle             ;   c,   is   the bed        of clay now worked;                   and   d,   is   sand
covering the clay.
   The Convener picked up fragments                                 of the shells from the bed                  b,
as also        several well-rounded boulders                       of   gneiss, about the size of                a
child's head.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                   147
     The manager of the brickwork pointed                 out    how the upper part
of the clay-bed appeared to have been scooped out in some parts ;
the hollow thus made being filled with sand and mud.                         The bottom
of the clay-bed was not sufficiently exposed when the Convener
visited the place, so       as  to show the bed of shingle            ;  but there was
a heap     of  coarse gravel near        the work, which        the     manager     stated
had come from the bottom of the clay-bed.                  The Convener had also
explained to him       the vegetable remains         said to have been found in
the upper part of the clay, to which Mr Gcikie alludes,                      as supposed
by    Mr   Caunter to have been        "  common sea tangle;
                                                                    "
                                                                        but of this the
Convener       saw no specimen.
    Mr Geikie     mentions that the clay-bed           at Garabost       is  " in all  pro
bability of the       same, or approximately the same, age as the similar
 beds     in the north of the island"               (Land.    Geol.     Soc.    Quarterly
Journal, vol. xxxiv. p. 827).
     The Convener      made an attempt          to reach the north of the island,
 to see those shelly clay-beds         referred to by      Mr Gcikie         ; but, from
 want of time, he failed to get so far north.                     He therefore        may
 be   permitted    to refer to      Mr Geikie's       account    of these beds, and
  to quote one or two passages:
     " At Port of Ness the boulder clay contains                    patches      of sand.
  But the most remarkable           feature   is the presence of broken arctic
  and boreal shells, which        occur   in an irregular manner through the
   mass.     The   upper    surface     of   the boulder     clay is denuded;              a
   character   better shown in fig. 37, which is taken from the same
  locality.   The stratified    beds contain shells, most        of which arc in           a
 fragmentary      state,  but    some perfect      specimens       may      be   detected.
  They belong to arctic and northern               species."       Another       place   is
 mentioned      where "    the beds       consist of an upper series of sand
 and    gravel deposits,     more     or less separated       from an underlying
  deposit   of imperfectly laminated dark blue            and     grey clay,     and   silt
 or  mud.      ShelU occur in both."           ("Great Ice Age,"            2d    edition,
 p.  170.)
    These shelly beds of boulder clay, according to Mr Gcikie, extend
 over a considerable tract in the north of Lewis.                  He states, p. 183,
 "                     in
    The shelly tills        the   sea cliffs   near   the Butt     stretch across the
 id and from shore to shore, a distance of two miles or thereabout,
 forming a narrow belt of low ground, which                    does not rise more

 148                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 than 90 feet or so above the              sea.    The deposits extend       for some
 what less than        a  mile along the east coast, but on the west side of
 the   island one can trace them for              a distance    cf three: miles."
    In   connection    with this northern part of the island, it is proper to
 notice several remarkable        lines of kaims or gravel ridges and knolls.
 The Convener's        attention was first called         to these by     Mr Mackay
 (Sir James Matheson's commissioner),               who pointed them out from
the high road        between    Stornoway and Barvas,           as  a  feature  of the
district ho hnd seen nowhere             else.    The Convener observed these
ridges on both sides of the mad, and a few days afterwards he had
an opportunity        of walking along one of them              to the north     of the
Barvas hills.        The ridges    consist     of gravel    and sand, and      reach      a
height of 30 to 50 feet above the adjoining                      level ground,      from
which they are the more easily distinguished by the uniformly green
colour of the herbage on them, whereas the fiat district they traverse
is   covered     with brown peat and            moss.      Each of these gravelly
ridges     is continuous for more than half              a  mile, and they deviate
very     little from     one direction, which        is   about    W.N.W. (magn.)
When       on the top of the Barvas hills, the Convener was able to trace
the line of one of these kaims, for at least two miles, running                      in  a
direction N. W. and S.E.            It passes Loch      Scarabhat at its south end.
In   several   parts   of their course, boulders occur            on the   ridges and
sides of these kaims.         At  one place, two or three miles north            of the
Barvas hills, to which the Convener was conducted                     by Mr M'lver,
an intelligent       gamekeeper,      well acquainted        with    the  district,    he
found the kaim expanded               into   a   number of grassy knolls, much
resorted to     in  summer    for the good pasturage           they afford to cows.
These knolls were, in some spots, well covered                  with boulders     :   the
highest knolls being those where               the boulders are most numerous.
The boulders were sometimes               on the east sides of the knolls, but
more frequently         on the   west     sides.    At two      places, the boulders
were heaped        and piled on one another.             The Convener attempted
to elicit from their relative positions, the quarter from which they
had come.          Most of the boulders showed unmistakably that they
had     come     from the     N.W., but         some also     from    W.S.W.         One
boulder indicated transport from AT.N.E.
   An old      man     who was looking after the cows at this shieling
noticing the attention         paid    by us to the boulders,         volunteered      to

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                 149
mention        that   robbers used        to   live   in    the    recesses    among     the
boulders.        The Convener's man-servaut            crept into one of the recesses
pointed out, which          was so large as not only to admit him, but con
ceal   him when in it from our view.
    Another observation by the Convener in connection with this
district     may be mentioned.              On the north side             of the     middle
Barvas      hill  there is a deep hollow, like a huge trench, close to and
parallel with       the northern contour of the              hill,  suggesting    the idea,
that when        the   country was submerged, an oceanic current from the
N.W. striking         on the    hill  may     have   scooped out the         drift forming
the sea-bottom at this place.
     1 4.  The Convener was as much impressed as Mr Geikie appears
to have been with the number and direction of lakes in the Lewis.
 In his "Great Ice Age"                 ed., p. 168), under the head of
                                                                                    " Lakes
                                  (2d
 occupying hollows in            the    till or    other    superficial deposits,"       Mr
 Geikie states, — " They        rest sometimes in the hollows between banks
 of till, and not unfrequently in                cup-shaped        depressions     of  sand
 and gravel.         The most considerable          assemblage of these lakes             of
  which    I know,     is in the Island of Lewis          ;   the   low lying tracts of
  which are literally       peppered       with lakelets.          Not   a few of these
  belong to the drift-dammed series.               But hundreds          of them     appear
  to rest   in hollows of     the   till, their longer axis pointing by N.W.
  and    S.E."    The Convener remembers              that when on the road from
  Stornoway to Garry-na-hine, he stopped                 the carriage       to  count the
  lakes spread out before him.           They were      17   in number — though        seen
  from a    point only about      300 feet above the sea.             To the north and
  north-east of the Barvas hills the lakes are even more numerous.
     The Convener also concurs with Mr Geikie in his remarks (Loud.
   Geol. Soc. Journal, vol. xxix. p. 541) that, "with one exception, all
  the   longest and most considerable            lakes range in        a   direction from
  S.E. to    N.W."        "They extend in long            lines, often for a mile or
  two,   with   an insignificant breadth."
     When Mr Geikie         proceeds to suggest a cause for the formation of
  these lakes, and      for their  persistency     in  a  N.W. and S.E. direction,
  the Convener is unable to concur.                He says — " When the ice that
  swept across the Lewis finally vanished,             it left   as marks     of its power
  not only rounded and fluted            hill  tops, but hollows scooped             out in
  the  solid gneiss.      The till that accumulated            below the ice was also

150                      Proceedings          of the Royal Society
at the same time found arranged                     in long parallel banks,             running in
the exact direction followed                  by the ice     striae   and roches moufonnee?.
The arrangement            of the      till into long parallel mounds is a feature
with which           I have     long been familiar."
                                                               " The N.W. and            S.E.    lakes
then rest in true rock basins, and also in hollows between parallel
banks formed wholly of till, or partly of rock and (page 542).                till"
   The Convener walked along the banks of many of the lakes in
the northern part           of   the Lewis.         He docs not remember having seen
much       or indeed       any rock          on    those    banks.        At all events,          the
banks certainly in most cases consist of gravel and till, forming
" long parallel mounds,"               as stated      by   Mr Geikie.          On some       of the
heights,      as at     Bein-na-Bhuna,            there    are domes      of smoothed           rock.
But    because they are round and smooth, the Convener does not admit
that    they thereby prove glacier agency.                     The main facts mentioned
by Mr Geikie the Convener quite admits, viz., that most of the lakes
are    "occupying        hollows in the till and other superficial deposits" —
that the axis of these hollows                      is,   generally speaking,           N.W. and
S.E. — and that this also              is   the direction of the ruts           and flutings on
smoothed        rocks.          Mr Geikie      assumes that these lake                hollows, and
these ruts and flutings, were made                    by one and the same agent, viz.,
ice,   which came from the ,S.E.                   The Convener, on the other hand,
ventures       to suggest that the ruts and flutings may have                          been made
by an agent which came from the opposite direction, viz., the N.W.;
and that this agent may have been an oceanic current loaded with
ice, which ploughed through the old sea-bottom, pushing hard stones
over submarine           rocks, which were thereby smoothed                     and striated.
      There    is    one general       view put forth by              Mr Geikie with which
the Convener agrees.                   Mr Geikie, after traversing                the whole       of
thi:   Outer Hebrides, from the Butt of Lewis to Barra Head,                                     has
formed        an opinion         that the phenomena            of smoothed            and   striated
rocks and boulders in all these islands can be best explained by one
agent, which embraced               and spread over the whole, and reached up
to at least 1600           feet above the           present     sea-level.       The Convener
concurs in that view.               In all    the Hebrides which the Convener was
able to visit he found             a   remarkable          agreement     in    the direction      of
boulder transport and of rock striatums, and in the disposition                                   of
superficial         deposits.      This      agreement       does      certainly suggest         the
agency of some general                 agent embracing          all the islands.         The only

question is,        What   was this agent     1   "Was    it  a sheet of ice from Ross-
shire, crossing        the  deep channels      of   the Great and        Little Minch and

2000 feet above its present level             ?
      As reference has been made to the low-lying level plains occurring
in the Lewis, and to the beds of sea-shells in the till, it may not be
deemed         irrelevant to mention that        there are on many parts horizontal
terraces,       bounded     by cliffs which seem to indicate old sea-margins.
 Along the east coast, from Loch Seaforth to Stornoway, there are
cliffs at heights of 11, 40, 81, 180, and 220 feet above the sea.                         The
 road     from Stornoway to Garry-na-hine, for some miles, passes through
 a   valley exhibiting a sea cliff at a height of from 210 to 220 feet.
 The valley through which the Biver Barvas flows to the sea, exhibits
  distinctly two terraces with cliffs, one 40 feet and the other 170 feet,
  above the sea.
       The theory of an ice-sheet          from Ross-shire overspreading all the
  Outer Hebrides is too large a question to be discussed in this Report.
  But as having an important bearing on the question,                          the Convener
  may       advert   to the way in which            the boulders are distributed            in
   these     islands.     It  has been      already remarked that boulders are
  scanty      on the east coasts     of  those islands, and           in particular    on the
   low-lying districts      in the north of Lewis.             It  may be supposed that
   it is only natural that the boulders should be most abundant on the
    west coasts,     as the highest    hills  are there.         But it     does not follow
   that the      boulders, because they rest on these hills, were generated
    there.      For   example,  the large boulder on the west flank of Dun                   Ii
    in lona, the numberless        boulders on the        sea   cliffs on the west coasts
    of Tiree,     Coll, Barra, Uist, Harris, and         the Lewis, must           have come
    from the       westward,    and    been     stranded       on    the   first islands,   or
    submarine       rocks or shoals, which impeded              the farther progress        of
     the   ice   which brought       them.      On that theory, it would not                be
    difficult    to explain why        the   boulders, whilst           abundant on        the
     mountains which fringe the west coast of the Hebrides, should be
     fMeially     absent   from the eastern          and     northern      portions of the
     l.ewis,  where there are no hills, or any other obstruction to tho ice
     iu a sea,   if one  prevailed, about 1000 feet above the present level.
         If glaciers   ever  existed    among      the  hills of Harris, their         effects

  152                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 must     have   been     confined to     their    own valleys.           Though Mr
 James Geikio, in his valuable Memoir on the                      Glaciation of the
 Hebrides,     assumes      that there     were    such     glaciers,    he  not only
 admits but maintains, that           "the     ice,   with    which the mountain
 valleys of Harris and the south were filled, had no share                    whatever
 in the glaciation     of the northern part of        the  island, extending from
 the base of the       mountains to the Butt,          a distance     of not less than
 35 or 40 miles.         Where, then, did the ice come from which over
 flowed    this by far the largest part of the island              ?    There is only
 one place whence it could have come, — the mainland."                      Mr Geikie
 "contends     that it    was amongst"       the    " mountains of Wester          Ross,
 fringing the borders of the Minch,              that the glaciers        which     over
                                           "                                        "
 flowed the Lewis were nourished             (" Lond. Geol. Soc. Journal               for
 1873,    p. 544).      In his    second    Memoir, read in April 1878,                Mr
Geikie extends       this theory to all the Outer Hebrides, maintaining
 " that   the whole         the Long    Island, from the Butt of Lewis to
                        of
Biura     Head, has been overflowed from the Minch by ice that moved
outwards from the inner islands and the mainland" (p. 861.) If
this had been the case, one would have expected to find boulders
chiefly on the east coasts of the             Hebrides, and few on the               iced
coasts.     But  the facts     are entirely the other way.             Not only     is it
on the    hills of  the west    coasts that boulders most            abound,   and are
largest in size ; but      it is  also on the slopes of the           hills facing    the
Atlantic that     these boulders are mostly seated.             On the hills of       the
east coast next the Minch, the boulders are few and small, and they
are chiefly on the west flanks of these hills, and therefore                  unlikely
to have come across the Minch.
                     xr. — OBAN    AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD.
    In   the  immediate       neighbourhood of this town, there are                some
facts of interest.
    (1.) There, as among the Hebrides, the smoothed                     rocks on      the
hills above Oban face the N.W.
    A little  above the Craig-Ard       Hotel, there is       a fissure   in the    hills
from    12  to 20 yards wide, and running due north and south for 200
yards, at an elevation above the sea of about 180 feet.                    The  fissure
has apparently been occupied          by   a trap   dyke, which, from the        sea or
other natural agencies, has decayed and disappeared.                     The walls     of

                        of Edinburgh,      Session 1878-79.                       153
the fissure are from 12 to 20 feet in height.               The east wall of the
fissure presents numerous portions of rock well rounded and smooth.
The west wall is rough and jagged.               These appearances suggest the
action of a current which has grated on the east wall and not on
the west      wall.
    As this is     a case exactly similar      to that referred     to as occurring
in Barra, and shown hy           figure   11, it is  unnecessary     to give another
diagram.
    (2.) Not far from the foregoing spot there is a coarse-grained con
glomerate rock. It is at the junction of three roads.                        It is the
same species of rock which forms what is called the Dogstone on the
avenue to Dunolly, at Ohan.               The included boulders and pebbles
are   well rounded, and consist of hard           gneiss and quartzite.
    Fig.    35 represents     a  portion of this conglomerate           rock, — about
 20   feet across — viz., between         east and west,     and   5   feet   between
 north and south.           On the side of the rock facing the             N.W.    the
 hard pebbles and boulders in the rock have all been ground down
 to an even surface       ; whilst on the side facing the S.E. the pebbles
 and boulders retain their original            shapes, and stand up above          the
 clay matrix of the rock.
     (3.)  About 6h miles from Oban, at          a place   called " Lailt," there is
  a boulder of considerable         size called
                                                 " Clach-a-Currail     "
                                                                          or Pcrched-
  np Boulder.        Its height is   14 feet, and its girth about the middle
  29 feet.      Its situation is extremely critical, being        on the edge of a
  precipice     which goes down at an angle of about 75° for 50 feet.
  The    rock    of the boulder is peculiar, — a dark chocolate-coloured
  porphyry.        No rock of that description         elsewhere     could the Con
  vener hear of.
     How the boulder got into the site it now occupies, or from what
  quarter    it   came,  it would    be difficult   to say.     Judging from the
  position of the boulder, the presumption is that it came from the
  S.E, i.e., down the valley leading up to Loch Awe. But it may
  have come from the         N.W.,     as in that direction there is a valley by
  which it could have floated to its present position.
     About half a mile to the N.E. of this boulder there are fragments
  of what had been a much larger boulder, which a year ago had been
  blown up      for building   purposes.      It was a coarse granite,      whilst all
  the  rocks in the district are gneiss.            Its position suggested trans-
                                                                                       j

port from the S. or S.W.                       as    the most probable quarter,            though           the
ISr.W. was not impossible.
      Most of the small hills in this neighbourhood are bare on the
N.W.,              and are smoothed            on that side only.
  (4.) The Convener paid a visit to a glen called Glenlonnan,                                             the
mouth of which comes down to Loch Etivo near Taynuilt.                                                      He
had been told of there being several large boulders on a                                      hill   called
Bein Glas in that glen, about                            1700   feet high.      This is the glen
referred            to in the last Report of the Committee, page 12 and                                  sec
tion      5.        He was guided to these boulders by                    Mr Clerk,       a   son of     the
tenant of the farm of Duntonichan, of which Bein Glas forms part.
In    ascending              the north Hank of the hill, it was observed that the
smoothed              rocks here as elsewhere               distinctly sloped        down towards
the N.W., and that rounded boulders were often on these rocks.
The rock of the hill was gneiss, and most of the boulders were also
gneiss         ;   but there were also some of granite,                     a few of mica            slate,
and       a        very small one of quartzita                  The largest         granite boulder
passed measured                       61 x 4 x 3 feet.     The longer axis pointed              N.N.W.
The rocky surface on                      which it    rested dipped due north.
     When            a     height of 1619 feet was reached, which was near the
top of the hill, it created                         some surprise to find that there                 were
smoothed                 rocks        facing   the     south,    besides      others      facing        the
north.
     Several          large boulders were found occupying positions on slopes
facing tho south.                     One of these was a well-rounded grey granite, at a
height of 1573                    feet.
     At    a height of 1637 feet there was a boulder,                         8x5x5           feet, very
angular.              It   was a dark purple claystone,             in    appearance          similar    to
the boulder, shortly above mentioned,                           seen at    Lailt.    It   was resting
on a      shelf of gravel, but the general slope of the hill was exceedingly
steep, viz., forming an angle of about 35°, sloping down                                  S.E.
     Judging by               the position of these boulders, and the steepness of
the hillside               facing tho S.E. or the S.S.E. which they occupied,                           the
presumption                 is,   that they had come from that direction.                     The rocks
of the         hill      at this spot are also smoothed in that direction.                     Towards
the south there are high mountains in the distance.
     Another grey granite boulder,                     3x3x2       feet, was found at          a   height
of 1645 feet on                   a   rocky slope, less steep, but        still facing    the south.

                        of Edinburgh,      Session 1878-79.                      155
      At   a height of 1683         feet, about    11   feet  below the summit,
smoothed          rocks    were   still found sloping        gently   towards     the
south.
      On descending the hill towards the north, by a more westerly
path than that followed in ascending, it was observed that, at a
height of       1554 feet, the smoothed      rocks faced the north.
      Some of the boulders met with on            the descent were of the same
dark purple porphyry seen at Lailt.
      (5.) On reaching Loch Etive, the Convener visited the Airde point,
 a   projecting cape or headland on the west side of the loch. At this
 point there were many well-smoothed rocks up to a height of 276
 feet above the       sea, and  facing up the glen towards Loch Awo.           There
 can be no doubt that these rocks had been smoothed by glacier action.
 On this Airde point there were numerous boulders, chiefly of grey
 ijranite. They may have been pushed down the glen by a glacier ; —
  indeed it seemed the most probable supposition.                   But they might
  have been floated         up from the N.W.           None of the boulders      seen
   were in such a position as to indicate with any certainty the quarter
   from which they had come.
       It may    be added that the rocks on the south shore of Loch Etive,
   as far down as Connel ferry, and even              lower, show smoothings       all
    lacing up toward the head of the loch, suggesting                 glacier action
    from the upper part of the valley.
       (6.)  In   the Fourth     Report by the Committee (p. 11), reference
    was made       to boulders observed     in the Island        of Kerrera, at the
    north end.       This   year the Convener had an opportunity             of exa
    mining     the boulders in the        middle    of the     island, where    it  is
    traversed    by the high road leading from Baltimore                farm to the
    ferry for    Mull    on  the west side of the         island, called "Bal-na-
    Bok."
        On his way across the Island, ho had pointed out to him by Mr
    M'Dougal,      tenant of Baltimore farm, three           or four well-rounded
    boulders of a coarse granite, having a red tinge, imparted from the
    felspar   crystals.    They were from       2   to 3 feet in     diameter.     Mr
     M'Dougal stated that there was no granite rock in Kerrera which he
     knew of ; and that the nearest place where he had heard that granite
     of that  kind   was worked was at Morven, about 12 miles across the
     sea  to the north.      He   was sure it was not the same as any he hud
                                                                                       }

builder, Oban,      as  one who had a practical knowledge             of granite
rocks.
   On the hill sides facing the north and west, the Convener observed
bore and there several boulders.          They were all mostly of the same
coarse-grained granite.      There was one of    a purple claystone porphyry.
When      he reached     " Bal-na-Bok,"     he   passed   several   boulders      of
coarse-grained     granite,  and   one    block of mica schist,      which had
been hollowed out for some domestic             use.    He learnt from the old
ferryman (M'Kinnon) and his daughter, that there were boulders of
granite about 4 feet high at or near the tops of the hills to the south
of the ferry.     Rainy weather prevented        access  to them.
   On returning to Oban, the Convener called on John M'Dougal,
the builder, and showed to him specimens              of the granite boulders
which he had found in Kerrera.             On asking him     if he knew where
there were any roeJcs in the    hills of a similar description, he said that
he know of two places,      — one to the south of Ben Oruachan, the other
in Morven,    —   and that he thought the Morven rock more nearly
resembled    the specimens shown.
   He was not acquainted         with any granite exactly similar existing
in the island of Mull.        He knew very well the red granite           of  the
Ross    of Mull   ; and   he added     that, at a place which be called the
" North     Bay of Mull," there was a grey-coloured              granite,  much
lighter in colour than that in Loch Etive.
   In   these   circumstances,    it is still   matter   of doubt from what
quarter these red granite boulders in Kerrera were transported.
   (7.)   The Convener next day paid           a  short visit to Easdale,    and
was conducted       by Mr John Clerk, blacksmith, Kilbride, to several
places in the neighbourhood, for an inspection of boulders which
had been reported       by him in one of the circulars to this Committee.
The district visited was that traversed by the high road to Clachan
Bridge, situated       about  3  miles   to  the   N.N.E.    of Easdale.     The
rocks    of this district are all    a blue clay slate, extensively quarried
for roofing.     Most of the boulders examined were of             grey- granite,
but their position did not indicate clearly the quarter             from wluch
they came.      They probably came from the north or west, as there
 was less in these directions to obstruct them in their transport than
in any other direction.

                        of Edinburgh,      Session 1878-79.                       157
     To the south of Easdale, there is an extensive terrace along the
coast, about 18 or 20 feet above high-water mark, and some hundreds
of yards wide, bounded by a range of high rocky cliffs, with caves
which evidently had          been formerly reached and undermined by sea
waves.        On   this terrace lay a cluster of boulders, several of them
of grey-coloured granite, which              most    probably   had   been lodged
where     they now lie by ice floating from the north, and arrested in
its further progress south by these rocky cliffs. Several boulders
were noticed by the Convener at and near the tops of these cliffs,
which he regretted not having had time to inspect.
     M_r Clerk informed him that on the hill immediately                to the cast
 of Easdale, about          1200   feet  in height,    there  were   near the      top
 several large boulders, which           he hoped would be examined          at some
 future period.
      Whilst it       seemed     probable   that these     Easdale grey       granite
  boulders     came from the north, there was one large claystone           boulder,
  o{  a purple colour, which, from its position, seemed to the Convene1'
  to have come from the south.             Its  size was  12x7x6      feet.     It lay
  on the shore near Clachan Bridge.              On asking Mr Clerk     if  he knew
   of any rock in situ similar to that of the boulder, he pointed to                  a
   lull about    a mile distant, situated    to the south.
      The Convener has referred to several boulders of           a purple-coloured
   claystone,    very similar to this one, as having been seen by him at
   " Lailt "                   and " Duntonichan " (4)
                (3)   above,                                   above,   which also
   suggested transport from the hills to the south.
      (8.) The Convener on 1st July ascended Ben Cruachan from
   Inverawe, up as far as 2725 feet, and made the following observa
   tions  : —
       Until    a level above     the sea was reached        of about    1330     feet,
   few    boulders      were    met   with.       At and     above    that     height
   the boulders were numerous,          and many of them of large size.          They
   were    most numerous on the           N.W. shoulder of      the hill.    In that
   direction there was the least obstruction to transport.                  Due N.,
   IS'.E, E,, S.E., S.W.,         due   W.,    there  were   hills of formidable
   height which        would obstruct.      Towards the      W.N.W. and N.W.
    there were only the      hills in Mull and Ardnamurchan, distant             from
    30 to   40 miles.
       The possibility    of transport by    a  glacier down from Loch Awe or

   158                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
   Dalmally, was not overlooked.               But      if any glacier had     filled the
  valley to the height of 1330 feet, bringing down boulders, these boul
  ders would have much more probably been lodged on the                      hill to   the
  north of Cruachan, called Daranish, opposite to Bonawe, where there
  is now a great quarry         of granite.     But     on that   hill, at least  on the
  side opposite       to and looking       up towards Loch Awe, only a few
  boulders were discernible.
      On the other hand,         if boulders   were brought by a        N.W. current,
  the part of Cruachan which would bo first and chiefly struck                     would
  be  its N.W. shoulder, where the boulders now lie in great heaps,
  whilst that part of Daranish hill, which faces about south by west,
  would be sheltered from the current.
     The following        boulders of considerable size indicated by their
 position that they probably had come from the                   N.W. : —
     One     at a   height of       1890    feet,    resting on    gravel,   15 x 9   x  5
 feet.
     Another at      a  height of 1943 feet.          It  was 13 feet long x 7 feet
 high.      Its longer axis      bore  N.W. by W. At its west end, its width
 was 2 feet, at its east end           5 feet.     It also lay on gravel and small
 boulders.
     At   a height of 2194 feet, the rocks of the             hill — a  coarse reddish
 granite — presented extensive smoothings facing W. by N.
     At a height of 2386 feet, there was a boulder 7x6x5                            feet,
 evidently blocked on its E.S.E. side by the rock of the hill.
     At  a  height of 2428 feet,       a grey  granite boulder was found near           a
 summit level, where            the   rock — a    red or    yellow felspar — showed
 smoothings from the N.W.
     The hill to which these observations                apply was not one of the
 central peaks of Cruachan, but situated to the                  N.W.      This hill is
 known in Gaelic by           a name    which in English means           " hill of the
horse heel."        Its  top was not reached by about 100 feet.               Boulders
were, however,         descried on    it reaching     to the very top.
    Descent from this hill was made on the side next to Cruachan,
i.e., on its S.E.        and   S.   side.    No   smoothed     rocks were observed
on these sides, and but few boulders.
    If   a  glacier    descended      the valley from Loch Awe, grating on
Cruachan, it is natural to suppose                that the rocks on these flanks
of    Cruachan would          have     shown some smoothings.              There is    a

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1878-79.                      159
 vertical     cliff of rock, about      60   feet  above     the River Awe,       on
Cruaehan, which did suggest glacier friction; and at a height of 334
feet above      the sea, above Liverawe, the Convener found rocks which
seemed to have been smoothed from the               W.S.W.         But   above  that
height the rocks presented          smoothings successively from           N.W. by
N., from      N.N.W.     and  W.N. W.,— the W.N.W. being in the highest
parte    of the hill, apparently the     most persistent direction.
     (9.) The Convener afterwards        proceeded to the head of Loch Etivo
in    a steamboat, and then travelled by coach nine or ten miles to the
head     of Glen Etive, to   a height of about 600 feet above the sea.          The
whole       of this valley   has at one time been         filled with gravel and
boulders       of grey granite.      A  great   part of this mass of drift had
apparently been scoured out by the action of the numerous streams
 which descend from the high steep mountains on each side of the
 glen.      Terraces were occasionally visible on the south side of the
 glen, np to a height of about 500 feet above the present                 channel of
 the river, consisting of clay, gravel, and sand, which may have been
  the bottom of an estuary in former times.
                                XII. — LOCH CRERAN.
       The   Convener     paid a visit    to Loch     Creran, having last year
   seen   that there were there more objects of interest than he had then
   been able to overtake.
       At the mouth of Loch Creran,         where    it joins   the   Linnhe Loch,
   the rocks are    all smoothed when they       face the   W.N.W.       at about 70
   feet above the sea, and also at Craigan Ferry.              But about      a mile
   higher up the loch, the smoothed rocks face W.S.W.               , at a height of
   about 80 feet above the sea.
       Near the sea-level, the smoothing of the rocks seemed attributable
   to  the action of some force moving down the valley, whilst rocks at
   a  higher level, say 100 feet and more above the             sea,  grinding from
   the  N.W. — i.e.,   vp the  valley — seemed undoubted.
       On going up the glen towards Carroban hill, notice was taken of
   a trainee   of boulders which     appeared    to go over a summit level to
   the east   of that hill.   The boulders are all of       a  dark-coloured fine
   grained granite, and are apparently the same as the Fasnacloich and
    Appin boulders referred to in last year's Report.                 Mr Hall, the
    intelligent tenant of Fasnacloich, who from boyhood has lived in
          vol  x                                                            T

160                            Proceedings of          the       Royal Society
the        district,      mentioned          that    the trainee               of boulders          could        be
followed for some distance                       over the hill, towards Glen                       Etive       and
Glencoe.
      A    very large          boulder exists in         a   cul       de sue      formed    by lofty hill;
near Carphin at the head of the valley.                                  It    goes by the name              of the
Ardshiel boulder, in consequence                         of having been made use of                         by the
proprietor of Ardshiel for concealment                                 in the time of the Rebellion.
This boulder              is 40 x 27 x 15 feet = about 1000 tons.
      A    fissure exists through the middle of                          it,   which   is   large enough         to
allow of           a     man    getting into        it   from the top, where, however,                         the
fissure      is    not discoverable          at any distance               in consequence of beech-
wood growing on it.                    This boulder              is,   in composition of rock,                 the
samo as            all    the rest of the boulders in the glen,                             and    it   has un
doubtedly been floated like the rest, up the glen.                                      It   is   blocked       on
its west side by                a    large    mass of rock, which                    stopped       its further
progress up the glen.                   Its height           above       the sea       is    506 feet.         On
account of its weight, the ice which rafted                                   it   was probably so deep
in the water that   could not get over the summit level by which
                                it
smaller boulders passed to the east of Carroban hill.
      The boulders in Glen Creran are mostly on coarse gravel.                                           At    one
place above Salar House, there                         is    a   cluster of boulders on                 a   rocky
knoll.
   The summit level on the                      east     side of Carroban              hill   is   about 800
feet above               the sea.      If    the sea,       when         these boulders were                being
transported,             stood, say 2000 feet higher than at present, any currvnt
from the N.W.  would llow through and over that Carroban pass.
On that supposition,   would not be difficult to account for the
                                      it
trainee  of boulders in Glen Creran and for the presence                                                    of the
gigantic boulder in the cul de nac at Carphin.
      If    Robert Hall's statement                    that the black granite boulders                         are
traceable          up the Carroban valley, and over the summit level which
separates           Glen Creran from Glen Etive, some of these boulders
should        be    found in the upper parts of Glen Etive. As the Con
vener        passed        up that valley on the coach which travels                                    between
Loch Etive and Glencoe, he observed several boulders on the moors,
near the road, exceedingly like the Loch Creran boulders;                                                but   he
had no opportunity of particularly examining them.
   "With the view of so far testing                          the statement             by Hall, the Con-

                        of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                         161
vener   at a subsequent date walked across the moors from Ballachulish
Hotel    to Carroban     hill,  to see if   there were any black granite boulders
in   that quarter.        He fell in with several at          a height of about       800
feet above the sea, and he saw that boulders                  were thickly spread up
the valley to the summit           level, but unfortunately, he was prevented
reaching them for examination on account of distance.
    It  is worthy of          remark,     however,       that in     this   side   valley,
ruTining    up    from    Glen      Creran, grey        granite     boulders are also
numerous,      whilst in Glen          Creran itself        there    are  none.      Now,
at this place        the   rocks in situ are          slate    rocks.      The    nearest
mountain of         grey   granite is situated          to the      N.W., about four
 miles distant.       A N.W. current would bring                fragments     of rock to
the place where        the Convener found them, but not to Ulen Creran,
 at least to its lower parts.
                                    xiil — GLENCOE.
    This valley is quite         as remarkable for objects            of geological     in
 terest, as for picturesque scenery and for stirring historical deeds.
    It  contains many phenomena               of extreme       importance,     connected
 with the transport of boulders and the grinding down of rocks.
    The Convener began his examination of the glen, at "Alt na Fay,"
 a place about 17 miles distant from Ballachulish                    Hotel, and about
 3  miles distant from King's House.
    Having introduced himself to John Matheson, a young shepherd
               "
 residing at Alt na Fay," the Convener obtained his services as a
 guide for some distance down the glen.
    The first  place visited was a gravel knoll, near               Matheson's house,
 having on it    a cluster of boulders, the largest            and   uppermost being
 well  seen from the coach road.          Its  size is 8 x 4 x 4 ft., and it consists
 of  a hard   clay slate similar to that of the neighbouring                     hills in
 the north.     Underneath this boulder, there was one of smaller size,
 consisting   of a red felspar, of which, as Matheson informed the
 Convener, there was also rock in the hills.                 But   there were no     hills
 within   a quarter of a mile of this gravel               knoll, and no cliffs from
 which the boulders on it could have fallen.                     The top of the knoll
 was about 30 feet above          its base, and was of a somewhat                conical
 shape.    An examination of its        side, showed       numerous      boulders,   half
 buried in the gravel composing         it.    On the    irest side, there were from

162                   Proceedings        of the Royal Society
twenty to thirty boulders, on the               east   side only one or two.           The
greatest number consisted           of grey     granite — of which rock, however,
aa  Matheson assured the Convener, there was none in Glencoe ; the
nearest being, as he said, on the shore at Ballachulish                    Hotel, at the
mouth of the (lien, and farther westward towards Duror.
    Matheson then conducted                the     Convener dawn        the    valley    on
the north side to some larger boulders.                    .Several were     pointed out
from 10 to 12 feet long, at heights of 1200 to 1400 feet above
the sea.       These     also were of grey granite,          their longer axis being
about    east and west, or parallel with              the direction     of the glen, at
this place, and about 400 feet above the bottom of the glen.
    About 50 feet above these grey granite boulders, smoothed rocks
were observed.           There were no         striae ;  but the smoothing seemed
due to a frictional agent which had come down the glen.
    ( hi the same (north) side of the valley, the Convener had pointed
out to him by Matheson, at one or two places, about 1183 feet above
the sea, a mass       of   conglomerate       rock in situ, similar,      as  he said, to
the
      " Dog-stone      "
                          at Oban.      The Convener observed that two frag
 ments     had    been    detached     from the rock, and been formed                 into
 boulders.    One was on the slope of the hill, about 50 yards                 west of the
parent rock, and 30 feet below it in level; the other of these boulders.
 and larger in size, was resting on the schist                 rock of the hill. about
 200 yards west of the            parent rock, and about           45 feet below     it in
 level.     These observations indicated that some agent had here been
 Moving down the glen, and had both                     broken oil' and      transported
 portions of the conglomerate           rock.
     On the other hand, there is a cliff of this conglomerate                 rock which
 holds in a cleft of it        a grey granite      boulder, aud in a position which
 shows     that    it had     eome   up   tlx-   glen from the       west.     Fig.  30 A
 represents      this boulder leaning on the hill rock,                the view     being
 taken from the south, about               500     yards distant.      Fig. 36    B repre
 sents    the   same boulder, viewed from the                north, at a distance of
 about    10 yards.
     Matheson next          informed the Convener that            if  the latter wished
 to see the biggest         boulder    in Glencoe, he would have to cross to
  the opposite     side, at a place about           a   mile further down, and at         a
  considerable     height above the river channel.
     The     Convener went to the               place    and  found     the   boulder in

                          of Edinburgh,               Setssion 1878-79.                                      1(53
question.       A
               path from the cottage occupied by Buchanan (a shep
herd) led to it. The boulder being of very irregular shape, its exact
dimensions were not ascertained.      Its girth at the level of the
.ground was ascertained,                    by walking round                it,   to be     22 yards-'.        Its
height seemed             to be about 15 feet.                   The rock composing                    it   was   a
coarse conglomerate.                   It   was resting on             a   ilat or terrace of gravel.
Its height above             the channel of the                 river was about 450 feet, and
above the sea 1215 feet.
  The position of the boulder seems to                              be indicated on the Ordnance
map by the words " Mcannar Clach."
      The Convener           was unable to form                a   distinct opinion on the ques
tion, whether this boulder                    had come down the glen, or hud come up
the glen.  Its height                  above the sea was nearly the same as the con
glomerate cliff higher                 up the glen, before spoken of.                        But,   if   a   frag
 ment from that cliff,             it   must have crossed the valley.                        The following
 considerations favoured the idea that                     it    had been floated up the valley.
 It   was resting on the shoulder of                   a   hill facing        the      N.W. and
                                                                                              ;          on the
 same shoulder there were multitudes of smaller boulders of conglomer
 ate rock, apparently due to the same mode of transport.                                            A   plan of
 the position       is   shown on fig. 37, where                   B   represents the big boulder.
 Some boulders, apparently of                     a   similar character, were visible at                          A,
 though they were not visited.                        If   a   N.W. current, bearing                  boulders,
 cume up the glen,                it   might lodge the boulders at                        A   and B.          The
 Convener believes                that conglomerate                rock occurs near the foot of
 Olencoe, as, when there, he 6aw fragments                                  which appeared to have
 fallen from        a    cliff.    If    this be the           case,       the theory which ascribes
 transport of these boulders up the glen would be strengthened.
      It   was observed,          that the above " big boulder" rests on                          a   terrace of
 gravel        It   is   rather a bed of stony clay, as such seemed to be the
 character of sections cut through by streams for about 200 feet above
 the boulder        ;     and this stony clay contained numbers                                   of pebbles
 and small boulders.                   It   was   plainly       a   water deposit.                Above this
  stony clay, there appeared                   to he extensive beds                     of sand;        and       on
  several    of the hills,        near the foot of Glencoe, even                          up to the height
  of 2000 feet, sand in large quantities was observed                                   ;   but   it   was only
  through a telescope that the observation was made.
      About half         a   mile below Buchanan's cottage, at the ninth mile
  stone from Ballachulish,                  the Convener observed                  a   rock well smoothed

  164                   Proceedings          of the Royal Society
  and striated   ;   it   was at the side          of the highroad.        The surface of
  the rock sloped due south at an angle of about 15°.                      The striee had
  a direction N. 55° W.            ;  whilst the axis of the valley here             was    If.
  65°  \V.   There was nothing to indicate whether the striating agent
  had moved up or moved down the glen.
     One of the most interesting spots                  in Glencoe    is where the     valley
 is narrowest,     i.e., where the         hills   on each side approach so near, that
 their respective        rocky cliffs front each other at a distance of only
 about    300 yards.          This narrow          defile   occurs  about   a mile    to the
 west of Buchanan's cottage.                   The river here has cut through the
 slaty schist rocks to         a  depth of about 60 feet.
     Fig.  38   will give         some     idea    of this defile.       There is    a  large
 plateau of rocks, consisting of slaty schist, which has been                    evidently
 ground down by           a heavy       body or bodies       passing   and   pressing    over
 it from the east, i.e., down the valley.                   There are elongated     shallow
 hollows also on these rocks parallel with the axis of the valley, which
 hollows are near the middle, as                if  the pressure there had been much
 greater (viz., at    A    and B) than higher up at C.               The smoothing and
 the hollowing seem to have commenced                      on the east side, as the edges
 of the strata are mostly smoothed on the edges facing the east.                          On
 the west side they are somewhat                  rough and jagged.
    The figure represents             a  boulder lying on the smoothed            rocks on
 the   north side.         It    had not fallen from the cliffs.              If it had, it
 would assuredly         not have stuck in its present               precarious   position.
 It  is a true erratic, and must have                   been brought up the glen at a
period subsequent            to the smoothing of the rocks.                The surface of
the rock on which           it  lies, slopes down towards the west.
    About     a     quarter        of    a   mile lower        down    the  glen   another
smoothed     rock occurs, which in like manner shows frictional agency
over and upon         it from        the eastward.         The rough parts of the rock
face the    west,      and there         form     a   cliff about   50 feet high, which
has evidently stopped a number of erratics in their progress up the
glen, as they lie       in   great numbers at the foot of the crag, some rest
ing on others.         Fig. 39 represent these bouldera, showing how they
have    been    obstructed, and             how the uppermost            boulder    of   the
two must have come from the west to obtain its position above the
other.     The rocks in the cliff are               a  reddish felspar.     The boulders
are a fine-grained        gneiss.

   The Ordnance Surveyors having reported to the Bouldor Committee
a very large boulder seen by them at the foot of Glencoe, and having
had.       the goodness to indicate its                      exact       position on           their         map,
the Convener             made      an attempt        to find and examine                      it.        On the
map the boulder              is indicated by the name                of " Craig Bhatan," which
it is believed           means      " rock icith         trees."         The Convener saw the
boulder, at the             distance    of about         a   quarter of       a    mile, with bushes
growing on it ; but he was prevented reaching  in consequence                      it,
of being unable to ford   river between him and it. The size
                                         a
of the boulder was stated by the Ordnance Surveyors to be 90
feet in circumference,                 and about 10 feet high, and                       it   appeared to
the Convener to be of that size. It lies in   meadow adjoining              a
the River Coe, about half mile to the S.W. of the Glencoe Hotel.

The meadow      about 200 feet above the sea, and
                       is                             closely sur                        is
 rounded by mountains                  exceeding      in height 2000 feet on all sides
 except       two.       One of these           sides,        to   the     east,    is   the valley            of
 Glencoe.          The      other side, to the north,                 is   the valley leading to
 the    sea at Loch Leven, distant about 13 miles.
       A3 the boulder seemed to be resting on an extensive mass of
 gravel,     it   seemed      to the Convener very probable that                          it        had come
 from the north, i.e., up the Loch Leven Valley.
       On the right bank of the River Coe, nearly opposite                                          the large
 Iwulder just          referred    to, there   is    a   rocky knoll standing from 20 to
 30 feet above the adjoining district.                       This knoll has had           lodged on its
 north side,       a   number of boulders, whose                     relative positions indicate
 transport from the north, i.e., up the glen.                            One of these               is   a   dark
 micaceous        rock, glistering with abundance of mica.                           A    few hundred
 yards to the north of the knoll, there                       is
                                                              a     rocky conical hill, reaching
 to    a   height of about 90 feet above the adjoining district.                                It   is   on the
 map called        "Tom       a   Grianain."         It consists      of vertical strata of mica
 schist,— the only place where, in the course of this day's perambula
 tion, that kind of rock was                 seen.       There can be little doubt, there
  fore, that the mica             schist boulder just mentioned had come from
  " Tom      a   Grianain," i.e., from the north, and been torn from the hill
  by   floating ice.
       The facts ascertained            in Glencoe           seem to indicate two separate
  agencies.       In   the first place, there was              a   glacier,   which planed down
  the rocks, so as to produce the extensive smoothing.,; and groovingu

seen at the narrow defile and elsewhere.               In  the   second    place,    and
subsequent     to  that epoch,       the whole of the          mountains        in   this
district underwent submergence            beneath    the sea,   in consequence of
which     not only was     the Glencoe valley filled and choked                     with
gravel, clay, and    sand  ; but the highest hills adjoining             were under
water,    and subjected to    a great      sea-current,   loaded   with   ice,   which
flowed from the     N.W.      This glacial current brought from                hills   in
the west, fragments      of rocks from these hills, and              dropped       them
in the valley at various points.

   In this district,  the  hills adjoining the        coast present   on   their west
slopes, even to their tops, numerous examples of large boulders.
    1.  Fig. 40 indicates the hills immediately above the Hotel, with
coloured dots to represent the boulders on them.
   One of these, the Convener found to be                in  the   position     and   of
the dimensions shown        in fig.   41.
   Its height   above the sea is 675 feet         ; but the important feature is
that   it is on the verge of a precipice,          which goes sheer down            ver
tically about 100 feet.          The boulder is         a coarse-grained       reddish
brown sandstone,     entirely different from the rocks of the hills, which
consist of a slaty schist — being a variety of gneiss.                  The longer
axis of the boulder lies     N.W. by W.
   There are several other boulders visible along or near to the verge
of the clifi's, most of them consisting of the same sort of sandstone,
and some consisting of a reddish granite — all evidently erratics.
   On the lower slopes         of   these    hills,  facing the     west,    there   are
hundreds of similar boulders.           They are mostly rounded at the ends,
and in that respect are quite distinguishable from the rock fragments
lying also on the hill slopes, which have fallen from the cliffs above.
   2.  To the N.E. of Gairloch Hotel there are other perched boulders.
Fig. 42 shows one of them resting on              a small ledge of gneiss rock,
whose general slope is due west at an angle of about 50°.                      It  rests
on the rock only at its east end        ;   the west   half for about    5   feet does
not touch the rock of the       hill   at all.      Its height     above    the sea   is
657 feet.
   This boulder could have been           deposited    on ita narrow site only by
floating to it from the westward.

     3. Fif-f. 43 represents a boulder on another                   hill near Gairloch, 747
feet above        the   sea, on the edge of a high              cliff facing   the west, and
partially resting on two small boulders at its east end.                        It is a coarse
grained granite, whilst the rock of the                    hill is  a schistose    gneiss.    It
projects        2J  feet beyond the edge, and it in like manner                     could not
fwssibly have obtained its position except                         by being brought from
the west.
      4.    Fig. 44    represents     a   hill about      one mile      N.E. from Gairloch
 Hotel, at the top of which (585 feet above the sea) two boulders
 attract notice           The largest is a block of close-grained Silurian rock,
 blue in colour and very hard.                The smaller is      a  small block of reddish-
 brown sandstone, with minute pebbles                        in it of quartz      and   felspar.
 The rock          of the hill       here is a bluish           clay slate, the      strata   of
 which are almost vertical.
       Fig. 45 is     a  representation of the largest of these boulders taken
  from its      N.E. side at      a distance      of about     10 yards.      The Convener,
  on a minute examination, found that the boulder was resting on the
  rock of the       hill, at three points, and that at the lower end it projected
   2 feet      beyond      one of      the    points of attachment."             The    boulder
   sloped      down towards        the     N.W.     at an angle of 15°.         The points of
   attachment        to the rock seemed          so   slight that the Convener thought
   he    would have little difficulty with a crowbar in precipitating the
    boulder     down     the precipice
        The red sandstone           boulder is about 10 yards distant from the
    large boulder, and lay on            a  rocky surface facing the         W.N.W.
         5.  Near the foot of the         hill just referred       to, there is a rocky knoll
    on    the top    of which     a  number of true erratics are clustered.                  The
     uppermost is 6 x 5 x 3 feet in size, and lies in such a position over
     the others as to show that            it had  most probably come from the             N.W.
     This cluster is shown on           fig.  46.
         6.   There was only one place where             striae on a smoothed      rock surface
     were observed.         It was about half a mile to the                N.E. of Gairloch
      Hotel, its height above the sea 340 feet.                Fig. 47 represents thisrork
      surface.    It elopes   about due west at an angle of 30 ", till it comes to               a
      nearly vertical cliff.      The boulder is 10 feet high,               6 feet   wide, and
      about 4 feet    thick      It  is within      2  or  3 feet    of the edge of the pre
      cipice,  which is about 50 to 60 feet high.              On one side of the boulder,
      several   stria  are visible, running E. by N.             They had apparently com

as   they are deeper and wider at that end than at the east end-
     Between Gairloch and Loch Fionn, a distance of about                                    10 miles,
all the hills have abundance of boulders on their sides                                    up to their
tops, and generally these are most numerous on the west                                     sides ;
at one place, 600             feet above the sea, two boulders were                       observed on
a    rock surface sloping towards the                     W.S.W., and which apparently
had come upon the hill from that quarter.
     At first the Convener              was surprised to find that the smooth                         rock
surfaces,        and some of the boulders in the district                         between     Gairloch
and Loch Fionn indicated agency not from the                                    N.W. but from the
W.S.W.            He ultimately         saw an explanation                 of this deviation from
the normal direction, by the existence                            of   a   high range of hills due
east of Gairloch,            which might have deflected                    a    N.W. current, and
caused      it   to How      E.N.E. instead of S.E.
     It   has been mentioned             that most of the boulders on                        the      hilis
near Gairloch           are composed          of   a   reddish brown sandstona rock with
small pebbles in             it,   and that this rock             is   entirely different from the
rocks of these hills.
     This reddish-brown             sandstone          rock exists largely in still along the
the coast to the         N.W. of Gairloch.                 Professor           Geikie, in his recent
Geological Map of Scotland, states this to be the                                 case.     It   is   also
spoken to,         as   existing     in that quarter, by Professor Nieol and by
Robert       Chambers.              There     can       be no doubt,           therefore, that these
Gairloch sandstone             boulders,       as      seen by the Convener               at levels ex
ceeding      700 feet above           the sea,          have   come        from that district         — as
indeed the boulders themselves                      indicate alike by their situation and
their altitudes on the hills.
                                        XV.   — LOCH       MAREE.
     The road from Gairloch to Loch Maree passes through                                     a     valley
running for        a    mile or more in        a       direction pretty uniformly            W.N.W.
and       E.S.E.        At    several     places         on the roadside            smoothed rocks
were      observed with striai running                      in that direction.             There was
nothing to show whether the rock had been smoothed and striated
by   a    glacier or by sea ice.
     On the hills to the west                      of Loch Maree Hotel, reaching to                      a
height of about          1   000 feet above the            sea,    multitudes of red sandstone

                          of Edinburgh,         Session 1879-79.                                 169
boulders         occur, more        particularly    on the         N.W.       sides of the       hills
and on their tops.             On one     hill (950     feet above the sea), presenting
on its top a nearly level surface                  of about 80 yards diameter,                       the
Convener counted twenty                  boulders,      each exceeding           2   or   3   feet in
diameter.          Most of these were a coarse pebbly sandstone, the same
in its general          character    as the    Gairlooh boulders          ;   whilst there wen;
amongst          them, just as on the Gairloch hills, a few of                            a   reddish-
coloured         granite.      These boulders,         when on or near hill tops, were

        about 30 feet, nearly vertical ; be is a shelf on which the boulder rests ;

        It there rests partly on rock, partly on small boulders.
 lying on        the bare well-rounded          gneiss rock, and when on the 6ides
 of hills,       were   generally on or in beds                of coarse gravel.               One    of
 the boulders,          4x3x3          feet,   lying    near      hill top on the N.W.
                                                                   a
 side, had its longer axis pointing                    also    N.W. On another gneiss
 hill    (also    west of the Hotel),           and at about 310 feet above the
 sea, a sandstone           boulder was found perched near the top, at its west
 side, as shown          in   the above section (figs.         1   and    2).

170                    Proceedings of          the   Royal Society
    Professor Nicol, in his paper on the " .Rocks of the North-West                            of
Scotland,"* with reference to the hills about Loch Maree and Gair-
loch,   adverts     to their being         " still   strewed with        innumerable frag
ments of red sandstone,             perched, like sentinels,          in the most exposed
and   perilous positions,          on the very edge of some lofty cliff, or                   on
the polished summit of the domes                      of gneiss."        In    a footnote     he
remarks     it   as   "a curious       fact   that,    on  these gneiss         hills,   by  far
                                                                           '
the majority, probably nine-tenths or more, of these                         perched blocks,'
are red sandstone."
    The fact would be " curious,"                 if   these sandstone          boulders had
been,   as   Professor Nicol supposed,               ''floated     on icebergs        from the
mountains from the east" (page 39), because, to the east of Gairloeh
and Loch Maree there are no mountains of red sandstone.                              Professor
Nicol, in this paper                                        to  "  the red sandstone          as
                                particularly adverts
forming     a   narrow band along the western                  shore, never        reaching to
the watershed         of the country."           Again (page 37), he repeats, thai
"  the red sandstone        on the west forms a narrow band along the shore,
and never extended            far into the interior."
    That being the          case,    it would indeed          be   "curious" if the         red
sandstone boulders which               cover    the   hills about Gairloeh           and  Loch
Maree     had     all   been     "floated     on    icebergs     from the east."            But
assume that they had been floated from the                       N.W.,       and an explana
tion is at once obtained.
    A  curious     belt of sandstone          rocks     occurs    to the south of         Loch
Maree Hotel.          Through and across this belt the high road passes for
about two miles, so that an excellent view is obtained                         of the remark
able dislocations and denudations of these rocks which have occurred.
These nicks differ in many respects from the rock of the sandstone
boulders    to which reference has            just   been made.
    Professor Nicol explains that the sandstone of the west coast is
"a   coarse grit, graduating into a fine conglomerate,                        with fragments
rarely an       inch     or    more     in  diameter"        (page      19).      That is    the
character      of the rock, forming the boulders                    ;   but    the sandstone
rocks which occur near the south end of Loch Maree are correctly
described      by Professor Nicol            as
                                                   "  a very remarkable             breccia    of
quartz and gneiss in sharp, angular fragments," the largest of which
 fragments      noticed      by   him he measured, and found it to be ''16
         *
           Proceedings      of the London Geological       Society,    for 1S56, p. 29.

                         of Edinburgh,        Session     1 878-79.                         171
inches long by            9 broad and 7 thick, but the generality arc much
smaller " (page         28).
      Referring      to this     peculiar    rock,   Professor        Nicol     observes      : —
"The       red sandstone         in this district     has undergone           enormous        de
nudation.          On the shore of Loch Maree it is often                  broken up into
huge masses or divided by gaps and fissures, some of them 20 to
 30 feet deep. The surface of the beds is strewed with [immense
 angular and ruin-like             blocks, some       of them        poised     on    a   single
 corner     on the very edge of            a cliff.     All   this indicates extensive
 destruction       of the strata.       Detached fragments             of the breccia are
 found in hollows of              the  gneiss   hills,   far from the main masses
 evidently left there in          the general denudation."
       Now in what direction          were these    "  fragments       carried," and from
  what quarter           did   this   "general      denudation" — this            "enormous
  denudation "—come            ?
       The following       facts leave no doubt on the subject           : — The     smoothed
  surfaces      of   these    breccia   rocks face N.W.          ;   the rough sides            are
  towards       the S.E.         Fragments     lie on the surface             to tin:     south,
  beyond        the    line    which    separates      these    rocks      as   a   formation
  from      the    quartzite     rocks of     Ben Eay.          Within        the    limits      of
  the     formation,        huge    masses,    weighing       hundreds         of    tons,      are
   lying    at   the    north base of cliffs — not having fallen                  from      these
   cliffs, but apparently brought there from the north, and left there,
   in  consequence       of having been obstructed and arrested by the cliffs
   in their further       progress to the south.
       These facts are in entire consistency              with the theory of            a strong
    ice-laden    sea  current which flowed from the N.W.                    The valley now
    occupied by Loch Maree,             with mountains         on each side          exceeding
     1000 feet in height, happens            to run     N.W. and S.E.,          so that when
    this district was submerged,         a  glacial current flowing from           a  northerly
    point would produce all the effects on these breccia                         rocks which
    have been described.
        Before passing from the district of Gairloch and Loch Maree, the
     Convener thinks it only due to his friend the late Robert Chambers
     to advert to the observations which ho made in districts adjoining
     to the    north.       He makes this reference,         as    the facts     observed        by
     Chambers have          a  close  relation to those which the Convener has
     just been describing.

  172                  Proceedings of         the  Royal Society
     Dr    Chambers'      paper   was read before         this Society in December
                                                                                "
  1852, and was published in the           "Edin. New Phil. Journal               for 1853.
  The author's      chief object was to point out that there were, in his
 opinion, two sets of phenomena              in  regard to boulders and smoothed
 rocks.      One set he considered         to be the effects of local glaciers,         the
 other he ascribed to        a general   glaciation of the entire country.
     The Convener does not mean to discuss                 this theory.         He wishes
 only to notice the facts which               Dr Chambers brought forward in
 support of it.
     Dr Chambers       states —
     1.   That    on     Cuineag      and     Canish    (quartz      hills    in    Assynt.
 situated     about     thirty     miles     to    the    north     of Gairloch),        he
 found,     "up    to   a height     of 1700       and   1800     feet,   strife   running
 from    about N.       60°    W., with      certain    exceptions.        One of these
exceptions     was at the base of Cuineag, where the streaks                      are from
the direct north, apparently by reason of the turn which the agent
had     there received      from the     base    of the adjoining        hill      Another
exception was at the hollow dividing                the mass of the         hill from its
loftiest top, where another system of streakings                    had come in from
the direct west."
    2.   "On   a  summit south from Ben More, fully 1500 feet high,
and     four or five miles to the S.E. of Cuineag, there are streak
ings on the quartz,          observing    the normal direction of this general
movement,       viz., from N. 60°      W."
    3.   On   the    gneissic   platform between         Coul More and Suilvean
(south     part of Assynt),        Dr Chambers         says     he   "found polished
surfaces striated from         N.W.     to  W.      To the west      and north of the
latter mountain are markings in all respects similar.                          These are
situations where no local glaciers could exist."
    4.
         " Streaking,     precisely     the     same    as   that of Cuineag           and
Canish, exists at an elevation of at least 2000 feet on the similar
quartz mountain named Ben Eay, south of Loch Maree, and forty
miles from Assynt        — this striation being        from    N.W.     or thereabouts,
and totally irrespective of the form of the              hill."
    5.
         " Passing northward         to Rhiconich,       we find near          that place
striae coming      in from the coast, viz., from the N.W., and passing
across a high moor, with           no regard      whatever to the inequalities of
the ground."

                        of Edinburgh,           Session 1878-79.                    173
     6.  " A little further north, at Laxfonl, a fine surface is marked
with striation from the Jf.W., being across the valley in which it
occurs.       At an opening in the bold gneissic coast which looks out
upon the Pentland             Firth,    there     is strong marking in a direction
from KN.W."
     7. "The high          desolate   tract called Moin, between           Loch Eribol
and Tongue bay,              where    there     is   nothing   that could restrain or
guide the movement of             the ice, exhibits striation from N. 28°         W.
     8.  " Striae, N.    25°  W.,   occur four miles to the east of Tongue bay."
     Thus    at all  these localities north of Gairloch visited by Chambers,
 the rock striations        were such as to satisfy him that some vast agent
 from the N.W. — i.e., from              the    Atlantic    Ocean  — had struck upon
 the country, and left its marks              on    hills up  to a height of at least
 2000 feet above the present sea-level.
                    XVL      STRATHGLASS AND GLEN URQUHART.
     The Convener, in September                last, proceeded    up Strathglass, with
 the view of ascending          the mountain called         "Mam Saul,"      about 3880
 feet high, in quest of what was supposed by the Ordnance Surveyors
 to be an old sea terrace.             Weather both stormy and hazy defeated
 this attempt      ; but whilst      in  the district, the Convener, accompanied
  by Mr Jolly of Inverness,           made some observations perhaps             not un
  deserving of being recorded.
      On the     hill  above     Affric   Hotel,      on the   east side   of the River
  Cannich,     a rock was met with, planed and striated,                at a height of
  450 feet above the bridge across that river, and about 720 feet above
  the   sea.    The    striae  were running          north by west,   a  direction coin
  ciding with that of Cannich valley.
      At  a height of 970 feet above the sea a granite boulder was lying
  on the upturned edges of the gneiss rock of the hill, lying in such
  a position as to indicate that           it  had probably come from a west by
  north direction.
      At the summit of        the  hill, about 1170 feet above the sea, numerous
  boulders were found, chiefly on slopes facing the N.W.
      On the high road to Drumnadrochit                    and Urquhart,      at two or
   three places a few miles from Affric Hotel, rocks ground down and
  striated   on the south side of the road were noticed.                The striae were
  running about east and west, or parallel with the axis of the valley.

174                  Proceedings        of the Royal Society
    At   the   top  of the hill, about       660   feet  above    the  sea,  several
boulders were found, the largest being           4x3x3     feet.    These boulders
were resting on a bed of sandy clay, and on a slope of the               hill facing
west    by south.      Th,: west side of the boulders was well rounded,
us  if ground down and         smoothed     by the friction    of bodies passing
over it from the west.
    All  the rocks exposed on the         hills here, up to the summit level of
the   road,    which     reached     about 927 feet above        the  sea, showed
smoothings on their west sides.
    The whole of Glen Urquhart has evidently, at some former period-
been choked with drift.            Bods of gravel,   clay, and sand    still remain
on the    hills  on each side up to the very top.          Hence, probably, the
luxuriance of vegetation         which this beautiful glen manifests.
    On the north bank of Loch Ness, about half a mile to the                 east    of
Urquhart,      a  number of conglomerate          boulders  lie on the hill side
In walking up         the   hill  the   Convener counted      six, of which the
largest was      7x5x4      feet, from a level of 200 feet to a level of 800
feet above Loch Ness.
    The rocks of the hill here are gneiss, so that these boulders               have
been brought to whore they now lie, most probably from Mealfour-
vounie, which consists entirely of conglomerate             rock, and is situated
a  few miles to the west.
    One of the boulders is at a height of 340 feet above               Loch Ness,
which corresponds with the lino of an old horizontal terrace, visible
along the south bank of Loch Ness to the eastward.
    At   the height of 450         feet above    the loch, deep beds of       a   tine
sandy clay occur,       just  above the landing pier at Urquhart.

    On the Corryarrick road (about two miles S.W. of the town) one
boulder was noticed which seemed to indicate the direction in which
it had come.        Fig. 46 shows this boulder of grey gneiss lying on                ;i
steep bank of gravel         at the base of a rocky cliff, which          is a buff-
coloured     felspathic rock.      The slope of the hill is towards N. W.         The
 boulder,   therefore,     probably came from that direction.           It  happens
to be at the same height above               Loch Ness (viz., 207 feet) as         the
lowest    of the conglomerate          boulders above mentioned seen to            tin-
east   of Urquhart.

                                   XVIII. — BEN NEVIS.
     The track commonly followed by tourists ascending the mountain
leads up the      N.W. shoulder of           the hill.    Boulders of enormous size
occur on each side of the track.                 The following       measurements        will
give some       idea of the size of these masses              ;   thoy happened to bo
within      from     20   to 30 yards of          the  track   ;   but larger      boulders
were      seen   at   a  greater    distance:        A boulder 16x10x10                 feet,
l«rtially sunk in        a  gravel bed     ;  a boulder 15 x 7       x 5   feet,  lying    on
rock;      a boulder       13x7x4         feet;      a boulder nearly         cubical, the
sides being about 4 feet square.                The three first mentioned had their
longer axis      N.W.     and   S.E.; and this       was the rule       with almost        all
the     boulders, whose        length was much greater than their breadth.
 The boulders         measured     were at levels above          the  sea    between     900
 and    1 200  feet.    But    there were boulders of great            size up to 2000
 feet or more, and there were some near the base of the                          mountain.
 Many of these lastrnamed            had, however,        been utilised for building
 purposes.       Mr Doig, builder in Fort- William, who                 accompanied       the
 Convener      in his   ascent, mentioned,         that having been contractor for
 the Town Hospital,          he had made use of one boulder, situated                 at the
  foot of the    hill, which     was four times as large as any of those above
 mentioned,      and that all the rubble-work              of the front wall of the
  hospital —extending         to about 80       yards — had      been obtained       out of
  this boulder.
      Mr Doitj, who evidently            was     intimately     acquainted      with    both
  boulders and rocks on Ben Nevis, had no doubt that all the boulders
  on the   N.W. shoulder of        the Ben were different from any rock in the
   mountain.       He   stated that the boulders were               mostly all granite,
   both red    and grey granite, but mostly grey.                   Those examined         by
   the  Convener were all grey granite, very similar to the rock worked
  at  Ballaehulish and Duror, about 30 miles to the west.

      The Convener regrets not having had                an opportunity of visiting

of the island there are boulders and smoothed rocks well deserving of
careful study.
     After what Principal Forbes                  said about the existence                 of smoothed
rocks, and of grooves or striae on these rocks (which he                                       unhesitat
ingly ascribed to glacier action), it is impossible to dispute                                    that    on
this island, small       as    it     is,   there      must have been ice enough                    in   the
different conies to form glaciers.                           Perhaps there           would        be less
difliculty    in adopting           the      theory,    were      it   supposed      that      Skye      had
stood much higher out of the sea at the time when these effects were
produced.
     Principal Forbes in his              paper, among other effects ascribed                     by him
to the Skye glaciers,         speaks           of "   the occurrence         of large angular            de
tached    masses of hypersthene rock iwiscd upon others, or                                    fantasti
cally balanced on the insulated tops of the elliptical domes of rock"
(page 92).     He also, on this point, quotes Dr Macculloeh, who
supposed that these detached masses were merely fragments                                     which had
fallen from adjoining               hills.       But     he      admits that "          the    mode      in
which these fragments lie                 is   remarkable.            The bottom of the valley
is   covered with rocky eminences,                    of which the summits are not only
bare, but often very narrow, while                          their declivities are steep and
sometimes      perpendicular.                Upon these rocks the fragments lie,                       and
in positions so extraordinary, that                    it   is   scarcely    possible      to conceive
how they have risen so high after the rebound, or how they                                            have
remained      balanced   on the very verge of                     a   precipice.        One weighing
about 10 tons has becom,:              a     rocking stone.            Another of not less            than
50 tons      stands on the narrow edge of                     a    rock 100 feet higher than
                                                                                                          "

("   Western Islands," vol.           i.     p. 388).
     One of these boulders, perched                    "on       the narrow edge of             a   rock,"
was noticed by the Convener near where the boat                                    takes      passengers
ashore    at the    head of Loch                 Scavaig.             Fig.   48     represents        this
boulder —    a   shows its position relative to Lake Coruisk and the sea                                 ;
b   shows its position more exactly on the rock where                              it   stands.
     Dr Macculloch's          idea     of the          boulder        having       fallen      from      an
adjoining cliff, and rebounded on to the top of the rock where                                           it
stands, of course cannot be entertained.
     On the other hand,       if     the       boulder was brought by a glacier from

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                 177
the   eastward,   and projected      from the glacier's         surface, would     the
boulder  have rested where it fell ? Is it not probable that it would
have slid down the smooth rock into the sea 1
  The surface on which it lies, slopes steeply towards the sea, in a
direction W. by N.; and under its S.E.                 end,   there    are two small
boulders which seem to have obstructed                 progress in that direction.
These circumstances conveyed           to the Convener's mind the impres
sion that   the boulder    may     have been    brought by floating ice, and
been thus landed on the rock which it occupies.
   It is   right to add that the smoothed        rocks, which         occur near   the
shore adjoining the lake, have all the appearance               of a great amphi-
theatre, into which floating ice may have entered, and in which ice
may have circulated as in an eddy, abrading the rocks                     forming the
bottom and sides of the amphitheatre.
  This view of the matter is not inconsistent with                    the theory, that
before the land was submerged,          a   glacier had existed in the valley,
and formed smoothings and groovings also on the rocks as observed
by Principal Forbes.
  The Convener, seeing the importance of ascertaining beyond all doubt the true
character of the materials forming the site of the "Big Boulder," in Barra(i<. 122),
wrote lately to Dr MacGillivray of Eoligarry, the tenant of the farm on which
the boulder is situated, to request that he would dig under the boulder as far
as could be done with safety, and send a written report of what was found.
Since these sheets were printed, the Convener has received a letter, from
which the following are extracts :—
    " Having at length got milder weather, we proceeded to the ' Big Boulder of
the Glen,' and made the cuts or drains under     it,as you directed,  to the depth
of three feet on both sides, and also at the west end of the boulder.
    " The first substance found for about foot deep, was black soil or earth and
                                            a
cockle-shells, mixed up with   a  few stones.  Below that, as deep as we could
conveniently go, very hard gravel and lumps of stone, extremely firm and
difficult to pick out, — should say, because being so much compressed by the
                       I
enormous weight of the boulder.
    " The rock of the hill did not appear at all on any side, or under the
 boulder for three feet at least.   It seemed resting entirely on soil and gravel    ;
 site very high, almost on the surface, so that   a spade can be pushed nearly to
 the centre in one or two places.
    "The stone, to even an ordinary observer, would appear to have been
 brought to its present situation by some agency or other, as the place looks
 quite unnatural to it."

Notes by William Jolly, Esq., Inverness, on the Transport atios
   of Rocks pound on the South Shores of the Moray Firth.
                  (Sent to Boulder Committee,             Octolxr 1878.)
    Along the south shores of the inner portion of the                     Moray Firth,
certain      movements      of rocks have taken place in geological                   times
which       are interesting as hearing on the inquiry into                   the general
transportation of boulders over Scotland.                   These rocks are,      happily,
of very distinctive         varieties,   which      renders    the    question of their
source and movements            a comparatively easy one.              On these,     I  beg
to   offer    somo rapid      notes,    in connection with           the   work of the
Boulder Committee.
                      L    THE GRANITE OF THE DIRRIE MORE.
    At   the back of Ben       Wyvis,      on the road to Ullapool, between             the
 Ken    and    Strath Vaich,        there    exists   a  development of        a  peculiar
granite     in situ, easily   seen    in  passing     along the road.        The granite
occupies a considerable          area in the centre        of the valley, and is seen
in great extent in the bed of the river, to which                     it imparts   a wild
and picturesque         character,    as the water dashes          and foams amongst
its projecting      masses.      The rock consists of the usual ingredients of
trinary granite, but its distinctive             feature is the existence        of lenti
cular pieces of dark mica, arranged                 throughout its pinkish mass in
pretty regular layers, which give the rock somewhat                       of the general
aspect     of  a stratified     deposit.       It  is peculiar      in general appear
ance, and       is easily distinguished          wherever seen hy its kenapeckbr
character, even when not broken up.                   This rock     is found scattered
all over the country to             the   eastward      of its parent     position,    and
would seem to have been carried                   down     the  Blackwater valley in
which it is found, and also right through the deep glen which exists
in the very centre of the great bulk of Ben Wyvis, and which forms
its most distinctive feature           as  seen from the        Dime More, or       Great
Slope,     as the    long road     to Ullapool       is called.     Thus viewed, Ben
Wyvis      seems cleft into two mighty masses by this great gorge,                     and
has from this point, perhaps,               its grandest      and most commanding
aspect.       This granite is found           scattered     abundantly      all over the
Black Isle, where it exists           as the most      abundant surface rock, being
imbedded       in  the debris and       boulder clay that clothes the whole of

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                           179
its surface-.     It  may be seen    in boulders which     have been broken up
for fencing       purposes,    showing the interior composition very well,
along the road from Conan village to Ferintosh,               where   it forms   the
greater part of the dyke that skirts the highway.                It occurs right on
 the summit of the Mulbuie, or Yellow Ridge, which forms the back
 bone of the Black Isle. It can be seen there to good advantage,
 along the old road between Dingwall and Inverness, which ran right
 over the Mulbuie between Conan and Tor Inn, a path which must
 now be traversed        on foot, and which       commands     a magnificent pro
 spect.      These granite blocks are scattered all over the eastern slopes
 of the Mulbuie, and           may be seen on the       Black Isle coast of the
  Moray Firth, as at Avoch, Fortrose, and along the district traversed
  by the high road leading to Cromarty.
      The blocks have been carried across, not only the ridge of the
  Black Isle, but what is now the Moray Firth, to beyond Elgin, and
  they may      be seen on the coast between        Bu.gbead and Lossiemouth.
  At    Lossiemouth, on the high ridge of Stotneld above Branderburgh,
  several masses may be observed in the dyke above the Public School.
   I  have no notes of its appearance       east of this point.
                           II. — THE  LOCH NESS     GRANITE.
       At the northern     end   of Loch Ness, on its western side,          a large
   patch of red granite exists along the shore — from              a point a little
   south of Loch End Hotel, at a burn just opposite Dores, to a point
   about a mile south of the mouth of the Abriachan Burn — and extends
   westwards from the loch in a triangular outline some two or more
   miles broad, forming the mass of the high             hill  between    Loch End
   and Abriachan, which there bounds the loch.                This granite   is fine
   grained and of a light pinkish colour, and is used for commercial
    purposes,   numerous examples         of it being to be seen in Tom-na-
    Hurich   cemetery near Inverness, and elsewhere.            The smahness and
    compactness     of its component     ingredients are its chief peculiarities.
    It occurs  in the abundant gravel       deposits  to the eastwards      of Loch
    Ness, in Tom-na-Hurich        for instance,   as noted   long ago by George
    Anderson, the      eminent geologist and joint author of Anderson's
    excellent guide-books to the         Highlands;      and eastwards      of  this,
     on beyond    Nairn and Forres.        It  is found less in large boulders,
     though it occurs     in  considerable    masses, than as forming        part of

180                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
the gravel deposits which form so marked                  a feature    on the
shores of the Moray        Firth.
                 III. — THE   LIVER-COLOURED       CONGLOMERATE.
   On the east shore of Loch Ness, opposite this granite,                    extending
from Loch Ashie to a little south of the Fall of Foyers, stretches a
high ridge formed of Old Red conglomerate,                of which also the great
mass of Mealfourvounie          on the opposite shores of        Loch Ness wholly
consists,  up to its very summit (3060 feet), which is the highest
point attained by this hasal deposit of the Old Red of Scotland.
This   conglomerate,      on the east side of the loch, is best seen            on
Stratherrick road from Inverness, where it runs above Loch                      Dirntel-
chaig, south of its junction         with the   roadtoDores, and along the aide
of Loch Kecklish (Ceo-glash), which lies between Loch Dunteh
and Bochrubin.         Here it forms a series of very striking precipices,
vertical,   bare,    and cracked, overhanging the              road and loch,        and
having a remarkable appearance,             arising from their form and com
position.     This   conglomerate      happens to contain in great abundance,
imbedded in its matrix,            a  certain dark-purplish         or liver-coloured
quartzite, in pieces of considerable size.            This quartzite is so marked
and peculiar that it can be           easily distinguished in any boulders in
 which it occurs, and it seems, so far as               I  have    seen (and    I   have
 examined the most of the country minutely), to be peculiar to the
 conglomerate on this part of Loch Ness             ; so  that its existence     in  any
 conglomerate      block is    a  very sure     evidence of its parent site.            A
 very good place to      see  it in situ is  an abrupt     little hill    close  by   the
junction of the Stratherrick and Dores roads, crowned by an ancient
 hill fort, called Caistcal-an-Duin-Riahhuich,               or the Castle of the
 Grey Hillock, with rough enclosing walls, easily noted from the high
 way.     The fort is also worth visiting, on its own account, and for
 the fine view obtained from its summit; and there this liver-coloured
 quartzite may be well          seen embedded        in the conglomerate which
 forms the mass of the        hill
    This    special    conglomerate       is   scattered    to   the   N.R of        this
 point, in very numerous            masses,     onwards     beyond       Elgin.      One
 peculiarity of this rock is that it is found so frequently in large
 blocks, often of immense size, — so large that they have attracted the
 attention of the old inhabitants and have received local names                    ; ami

are    very abundant, on the flat Old Red Sandstone ridge of the Leys,
lying      between      the valleys of the Ness and the Nairn, where they
are    frequently very large.                    The great boulder near the battle-field
of    Culloden,        known        as Cumberland's Stone, is formed                           of       it,   being

this    part of the country,            is   a   worthy specimen;              several large boulders

   ] 82                  Proceedings of      the   Royal Society
   patch of grey granite,        occupying nearly the centre of the strath.                    It
  is very well exhibited near the Roman Catholic chapel, where it
   occurs    in situ in   large masses, and where        it  has been   worked.          It     is
  a   granite of very good quality, and has been greatly used                    for build
  ing   ; and   it would    be much more used       if it  were more accessible          from
  lines of public communication.             It  extends     down the pass        of IDver-
  farigaig, where it forms the rock of its upper portion,                       the lower
  being the Old Red conglomerate.                  This grey      granite is found            in
  blocks of different sizes, some of them large, all over the country
  cast towards Elgin, intermingled            with the conglomerate            just     men
  tioned   ;  but it never occurs in such largo masses as the conglomerate,
  which, from its nature and origiual position, it could not do.                        It    is
  remarkable       that this granite is also found in blocks scattered over
  the very top      of  the ridge  of  conglomerate      between   Loch Keckli^h and
  Loch Ness, already described,           sometimes      finely perched      on its very
 summits,        which     range between     1400     and     1500  feet,   and    I   have
 numerous        notes of big boulders of      it found     there.
   V. — THE     GNEISS OF STltATHERIUCK       AND THE MOXAGHLEA MOUNTAINS.
      Parallel to the line of conglomerate          blocks scattered between Loch
 Ness and Lossiemouth, often intermingled with it and the granite of
 Stratherrick, but occurring much more abundantly to the east                     of it.    is
 found     a   broad band of boulders of grey gneiss.                 These are      of   all
 sizes, frequently large enough to have claimed popular notice                     and     to
 have received        local names, and are often placed in remarkable                   and
elevated positions.           The character     of the rock may be well seen              on
the side of the road between             Inverness and Fair, in the dyke near
the Free Church of Farr, and in the               fine group of boulders           in   the
centre     of the      valley, which forms so striking             and    interesting       a
geological      feature there.      They occur in astonishing numbers round
Loch-na-Clachan,           or the Loch    of the Stones, into which the stream
from Loch Duntelchaig Hows, near the old parish church of Dun-
lichity.       There they form grand and picturesque               groups    of all sizi*
and     forms, on the        east side  of  the   loch and up to the elevated
summits of the hill*, above             1400    feet high, and      where     they may
often     be seen,     right    on  their crests, standing in         a   serrated    line
against      the   sky.     Altogether, this is one of the most remarkable
aggregations       of blocks that    I know,    and   it  has already been referred

                         of Edinburgh,      Session 1878-79.                        is:?
to by Dr Milne Home, in his valuable                paper on Glen Roy.          Farther
up the Nairn,         near  Farr House,   stretches a long flat plateau of gravel
and. other       debris, which stretches right across the valley, and through
which the river          has had to cleave its way in the narrow gorge below
 Flichity      Castle.      On this plateau     is found another striking           and
 numerous        assemblage     of huge blocks, well worth a visit, often of
 large     size and peculiar forms, scattered          singly and in groups, some
 of     them standing erect like great pillars.            Frequently these gneiss
 blocks      have been left in remarkable         places.    On Craig-a-Chlachan,
  which overlooks          the church of     Dunlichity,     on the west shore        of
  Loch-na-Chlachan,          near its top,   on the edge of a steep precipice.
  is poised     a block of gneiss      li  feet long, 10 feet in height, which
  catches     the   eye of the traveller from all points, and is known                as
  Clarh-na-Fhreiceadan           or Faire, or the        Stone of the      Watch,     on
  account of its elevated station (1120 feet), standing, as it does, like
  a sentinel, to guard the surrounding region.
      To the    east of the Free Church of Farr, right on the peaked top of
   the highest     hill  seen from that part of the valley, may           be observed
   what seems a shepherd's         cairn marking its summit.           This provoked
   my curiosity for years, and this season           I ascended the mountain and
   found that it consisted of       a great   block of gneiss split in two, and
   known, from this circumstance,          as the Clach Siiolte, or        Split Rock.
   It  has been originally a cube of stone, 9 feet scpuare and 5 feet high,
   now split at two- thirds of its breadth, the larger part having remained
   in its original position and the smaller having fallen over.               It stands
   nearly 1000 feet above the valley below, and nearly 1600 feet above
   the sea.     Another Clach Sgiolte, on or very near the top of the great
   mountain, overlooking the narrow gorge of Conaglen, near Dunma-
   glass, at the very head waters of the Nairn, called Ben               Dhu Choire,
   at a height of 2260 feet.         This block    I  have not yet ascended to.*
       Another striking example of these           gneiss blocks is found beyond
   the inn of Flichity above Farr, on              the north     slope   of the finely
   crested ridge that lies between          the valley of the       Nairn    and   Loch
   Kuthven.        It  is called Clach-a-B/wnat, or the Stone of the Bonnet.
   This is a very large block, worth a visit.             In this part of    the valley
   of the   Nairn, numerous other blocks           occur singly and in groups in
      *                                                                           of the
         Then is another Clach Sgiolte, about 1J mile from           the  source
    Findhorn, called the Eskiu, some 2070 feet above the sea.

the bottom of the valley, and high on its sides up to the                   crests of
the enclosing       hills, on which they may be seen standing against the
sky line.
    Farther     down the valley, below Daviot                and  not far   from the
mansion    of Nairnside, a very fine boulder is perched on              the top of a
steep    rock overlooking          the    river,   on  its eastern    bank.      It     is
21 feet x 12 feet x 15 feet in height, and forms a fine object as seen
from below, from the peculiarity of its position and great size.                       It
is called CIwh-an-uHaidh,            or the Stone of the Treasure-Trove, from
the prevalent idea that treasures              lie concealed under such remark
able rocks    ;    for there    are numerous        blocks with the same name
and tradition, in various parts of the Highlands.
     On the same side of the Nairn,              and not far from the block       just
mentioned,        another is found, high up on the hill bounding                   the
valley, and seen against the sky from below, very distinctly so from
 the Cumberland Stone, and from the road                   to the far-famed    Clava,
 with its    cairns       and   standing-stones.        It   is called  Clachra-nid,
 differently interpreted to be the Stone of the                  Nest, an unlikely
 meaning,    and more probably the Stone of the Whistle, as the point
 to which the herd ascended to whistle and call on the cattle scattered
 over the   hill   slopes there, when he went to drive them home for the
 night.    It   is a very fine block, measuring          21 feet x 21 feet  x 20 feet
 high, and has       a  commanding position (950 feet), with a splendid pro
 spect, over the pastoral Nairn, away to the distant N."\V. Highlands.
     There are numerous other blocks of the same gneiss worthy                        of
 mention,    but the foregoing will suffice         as examples.      They are found
 extending to the eastwards like the rocks already mentioned.
                            VI. — THE    KINSTEARY    GRANITE.
     Near Nairn, on the estate of Kinsteary, occurs               a considerable    de
  velopment of granite, of distinctive character and great value.                 It   is
  of  a rich flesh-colour,      and   its chief feature is the existence of fine
  large  crystals      of orthoclase felspar, which give it its special beauty,
  approaching in appearance           as  it does to a rich-coloured marble.          It
  has only been recently worked for the market, but has already taken
  a high place, and is largely used in London and elsewhere                   for  fine
  ornamental       purposes.      It  may be seen in situ, quarried at different
  places, at a short distance from Nairn, on the road to Ardclach.

                           o/ Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                           185
     This peculiar granite, which can easily be distinguished wherever it
occurs,       is  found abundantly         to the eastwards       of its original position.
In all the dykes and houses in and round Auldearn, and all over the
Moyness          district, it may      be seen as the most abundant rock.                It  ex
tends eastwards beyond Forres, gradually lessening                          in amount but
still abundant, over the flats of                Kinloss and up       on the high ridge of
 Burgie to         its summit       above the Donping          Stone, and beyond         Elgin
 to   Lossiemouth and further              east.    Pieces of it may be seen on the
 shores        of Loch       Spynie near the blocks of conglomerate                   already
 mentioned.*
      The foregoing          are the chief examples          of travelled boulders       found
 on the        south shores of the Moray Firtlu                   Many others occur, but
  these      have      been mentioned because              they consist      of rocks of        a
  more       or less pronounced character, easily distinguished where                     seen  ;
  therefore         furnishing        important      evidence       as  to    the   direction
  and       extent      of  the transporting agents.            From     the map,      it will
   be      seen      that    the     general    direction      of   movement       of      these
   blocks        has    been    eastwards,       but     chiefly   from    S.W.     to    N.E.,
   parallel      to the trend of the coast of the              Moray Firth at this part.
   None of these rocks are found to the wc4 of the points tn situ where
    the parent        rock is found      ; at least,   I  have found none, and         I  speak
   from a       pretty extensive knowledge of the district.                What    the trans
    porting agent          or agents    were — whether        glaciers, or icebergs, or ice
    floes, or     water currents, or one or more of those together— however
    interesting and important — it would                  be foreign to the       purpose      of
     the present       paper to consider ; but that these rocks were carried from
     their native       sources    and scattered       widely and numerously to the
     eastwards, over a large           extent    of country, cannot for a moment               be
     'loubted.     f

            I have no notes of the distribution of these boulders east of Lossiemouth.
      Mr Wallace, head master of Inverness High School, and a good geologist, tells
      me that he saw recently large blocks of both the Dime More and Kinsteary
      granites at   Buckie in Banff, dug out of the new harbour.             It would be inter
      esting to ascertain      how far east these easily distinguished rocks have been
       carried.

                By Alex. Somehvail,          Stationer, Edinburgh.
     Besides the boulders described          by the late     Mr Charles Maclaren
in his " Geology of Fife and the Lothians," and also by Professor
Geikie iu the " Edinburgh Memoir of the Geological Survey," as
having been carried           from the Highlands,         there   are  others which
would indicate       a  transport from     a  different direction.
     On the highest summits of the Pentland Hills (Scald Law, Car-
nethy, South Black Hill, North Black Hill, and others which are
composed       of various varieties of porphyrites) are found numerous
boulders of fine conglomerates,            grits, and sandstones,       intermingled
with    a  few boulders of quartz, greenstone,            and other rocks, all par
tially or entirely covered by a deposit of peat, which in some places
on and near the summits of the               hills attains   a  thickness of nearly
six feet.      The sandstone boulders vary in size from mere fragments
up to large masses which           I was unable to dig      up.    They are common
on the very highest point of Carnethy (S. 1),* more so on Scald                  Law
(the highest of the range) and South Black                      Hill, and still more
abundant on the West or North Black Hill.                       They are smaller in
size and less numerous as            we   approach    the   hills in  the neighbour
hood     of Edinburgh — viz., towards          the east.
     On     a careful    examination       of the above-mentioned sandstone
boulders,     with    regard    to mineral composition, texture,          and colour,
there can be no doubt that they have               been    derived from the sand
stone strata which form the Cairn Hills.                 The highest point of the
Cairns is 1844 feet, or 46 feet below the level of Carnethy, and 54
feet lower than        Scald Law, which is 1898 feet above the sea-level.
     It  would follow       from    this, that the transport of the sandstone
boulders has taken place from S.W. to N.E., or very near this direc
tion.      There are other indications            which confirm this movement
Mr John Henderson              has,  in the "Transactions         of the Edinburgh
Geological Society," vol. ii. page 365, described                the occurrence   of a

Mr     Henderson's   notes, is appended.      On this plan the localities mentioned

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                       187
large slab of sandstone             lying in the gorge of the Bonally                          Burn,
derived from beds of the same rock about half                           a   mile to the S.W.
     In   a deep      cutting     recently made          in    the boulder clay at              Aln
wick Hill,          near   Liberton,   I    observed      many boulders of Old Red
Sandstone, which must have been carried                            from the vicinity of the
Carlops,      where the same rock occurs in situ.                            There were         also
boulders of various varieties            of porphyrites, which form the hills
to the S.W.           The same      remarks hold good with regard to boulders
I saw dug from very              deep excavations made two years ago at Sea-
field, near Leith, all bearing out            a   transport of some kind along tin:
trend of the Pentlands, or from S.W. to N.E.
     A fact in connection with the Old Red Sandstone boulders I ob
served at Alnwick      Hill appears worth recording. Many of these
boulders      were     vory round and smooth,                 so   much so that they sug
gested the idea that the agent which                     transported them           to their pre
sent position could not have produced this effect during transport,                               as
the distance from their source is so very small, but in all likelihood
found them worn and rounded beforo being carried along.
                              NOTE ON THE BOULDER CLAY.
     There    is,   in my opinion, no true till               or boulder clay resting on
any of the Pentland              summits.      "What       has been described                as such
by    Dr Croll      on the    top of Allermuir           Hill      seemed to mo simply             a
peaty soil formed by the decomposition of the underlying                                 rock and
debris, and the decay of vegetable matter, making up                          a   heterogeneous
deposit      which, however, has no connection with the true boulder-
clay occurring at lower levels.

visitsI    made       to the Pentland        Hills   ;   but as my chief object then
was      to examine the older rocks,               my      observation         on      the    recent
deposits are by no means complete.

      Striatal Rock              Surfaces.
                                                 — Only two localities          were observed.                  Dr
Croll, in         a paper        on
                                       " The Boulder Clay of Caithness," first                            made
known that he had discovered                            a   striated rock on the top of Aller-
muir        Hill,      at a height              of   1647      feet    above    the     sea.      I     visited
Allermuir Hill                some time after this discovery, and was fortunate
enough to find a portion                        of   the striated surface.            The rock          of the
summit of the hill is felstone, very much weathered                                     and broken up,
and    it   is only in the            little hollows, which             are covered with a            blackish
earth, that indications                    of rubbed or scratched               surfaces        are     found.
The portion             I   discovered,         although it was only a few inches square,
was finely striated,                 and    I   had no difficulty           in making out the direc
tion of the            striae,   and the direction from which                      the striating agent
had come, which was about                            W.S.W.           (See Plan,   H.   1.)      The other
locality      I   discovered           during a very dry summer, when the water in
Bonally           Pond was very low.                        The striae occur here on a reddish
sandstone,          which crops out along the south-east                           side of the pond,
at an elevation of about 1100 feet                             above     the sea (H.      2).         There   is
here    a     much larger surface                     of striated         rock than on           Allermuir
Hill, but         it   is   mostly always covered by the water of the pond.                                   I
had an opportunity,                    however, of seeing               a   portion of    it    again      last
summer.           I     then took the direction of the striations, and found
them, as on            Allermuir Hill, W.S.W.                    I     may remark that this agrees
with        the direction             of   the striae        on the rocks       of    at least         twenty
localities that        I     have examined in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,
and    in    no instance          in this neighbourhood                  have I    observed the rocks
slriated in        a    direction N.W. and S.E.
      Boulders occur at all heights up to 1400 feet, and all sizes up                                         to
10 or 12 tons.                   Several very large ones lie on the north side of
Capelaw Hill,               at about 1200 feet above the sea (H. 3).                           They     are   of
a    dark crystalline greenstone, unlike any of the igneous rocks in this
district.         Purther west, on the west side of Harbour Hill, there                                    is   a
great number of smaller blocks of the same greenstone                                    (H.     4).     They
appear to me to lie on about                          a     uniform level along the            hill    side, at
about 900 or 1000 feet above the sea.                                  The prevailing boulders                in
t   he northern portion of the                  hills     are of greenstone,       while those further
to the      S.W.        are mostly sandstone.
     Boulder Clays.              —
                                 I     have observed            two localities where these               occur
in considerable              quantities, one at tho north-west corner                      of    Glencorse

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                180
Reservoir, at      an elevation    of 900  feet  (H  5).    It is a stiff reddish clay,
full    of -well rubbed and scratched stones, and differing in no way from
the     boulder clay of the lower districts.          The other locality is about
three miles to      the S.AV. of this,   in  the same line of valley between the
hills,    at an elevation    of about   1100 feet.       It is of the same character
as the last, but is covered by a great deposit of gravel and boulders,
which extends across the broad valley between Hare Hill and
 South Black Hill (H. 6).
     Another     large  deposit of gravel and boulders is at thy mouth of
 the broad valley in which the Bonally Pond lies, at an elevation
also of     1100 feet above the sea.           This deposit encloses some very
 large boulders of greenstone (H. 6).

     1.   Mr M'Laren, in his "Geology               of Fife and the Lothians,"
  states   :—
            " There are few opportunities of observing ' groovings ' on the
     (1.)
  Pentland Hills.        I  noticed them, however, at Westwater of Dun-
  syre, on the top of a      thick   bed  of hard   sandstone,    from which       12 or
  14 feet of alluvium         had been      removed.       The    dressings     pointed
  exactly east and west ; and the evidence            was the more        satisfactory,
  as the direction of the stream on whoso bank the rock was situated,
  and of the valley in which the stream flowed, was south and north.
  They were very distinct, the larger groovings being about                     li  inch
  broad, and -^ths of an inch deep.             The locality must be 800 or 900
                        "
  feet above the sea       (page 294).
                                                                            — -first, as
     (2.) Travelled blocks are important in two respects:
  indicating the action of currents or other transporting agents no
  longer operating; and next,        as illustrating changes which have taken
  place subsequently to their deposition in the spots                 where    we iiml
  them.

     a.         " In tho Pentlands                    there   is   a   boulder of mica slate, 'weigh
ing         8     or    10 tons, on the               east end of Hare            Hill       (see   plan annexed,
M.         1 ).    It       reposes on the surface of the west side of the glen                                 leading
north from Habbics How to Bavelaw, on a declivity about 80 feet
above the bottom.                         The nearest spot from which this mass                             could          be
derived is the portion of the Grampians about Loch Vennacher or
Loch Karn, 50 miles distant" (page 301).
  Further, this block tells us that the surface of the hills where it
now rests must have been in a different condition                                                    when        it    was
deposited.                   It   lies on the side of a declivity,                    where         a large       stone,
either hurried hither by a current, or dropped from an iceberg,
would not stop, but roll down to the bottom of the valley.                                                             The
reasonable                  inference      is,   that the valley betweenHare Hill and
North Black Hill                      was then filled with " materials which have sincv

     h.      Half       a     mile south from this, three greenstone                                boulders          of   2
or   3      tons        weight each are                lying on the edge of                a   precipice, about
200 feet above South Burn.       (Sec plan, M. 2.)
     These have certainly travelled some miles, and the bed of clay
seen below them                      is   no doubt            a   remnant of that which then rilled
up the ravine, and prevented them descending                                          to the bottom.
     c.     On the east end of West North Black                                  Hill     there     is

boulder of              8    tons weight.             (See plan,       M   3.)
     This block               may not have travelled far.                     But       it   rests on     a     surface
as    steep            as    the roof of         a    house (inclined both above and below at
45°), and about 400 feet above the bottom of the valley.
     It      is    impossible that            it      could be dropped here, or brought to the
spot by           a    current, without descending to the bottom, unless sustained
in its plate by matter since removed.
     This single block informs                         us that the ravine about 100 yards wide
at the surface                    of the marsh, which separates Black                          Hill from Beild
Hill,       must then have been filled up                         with alluvial matter              to the height
of 400 feet at least above its present bottom,                                    which        is    probably          50
feet above the true bottom                            in   the rock (page 302).

the level of the Compensation Pond, there                                        is   a   very large boulder

hills, and none near            them,   except      in situations     500   or 600 feet
lower.
      This hlock      has probably been transported           in  the same manner as
 the     mass of mica slate
                                 (a above).
      e.   The   same remarks apply to a greenstone               boulder lying half       a
 mile N.W. of Logan House,              on the south side of West Black                Hill,
 about 1400 feet aboye the sea.              It   is of 12 or 14 tons weight.           (See
 plan, }L 5.)
       There    are   many others in elevated           situations of      3   or   4   tons
  weight.
       The   substance    is generally greenstone, the least brittle probably
 of all rocks, and of        course the best fitted to resist        fracture.      Nearly
  all the blocks have their         angles rounded off.
      /.   On the banks of Eight Mile Burn, in the low ground, there is
  a mass       of alluvium     about    100 feet thick, containing          hundreds of
  trap boulders of all sizes up to 10 tons weight.                  It  consists    of two
  beds, — the      older, a blue unctuous clay, the newer a red clay.                    The
  large blocks are chiefly        in the  latter.
       There are many similar travelled blocks in the burn flowing from
   the old Reservoir        to Bonally, and probably in all the streams                    of
   these    hills  (page 303).
        2,  Prof essor Geikie, in his Memoir " On          the Geology of the Neigh
   bourhood of Edinburgh," published                   in 1861, observes (1) that
    " boulder-clay lies
                             along the north-west flanks of the Pentlands,
   rising to a level of at least 1300 feet."
        When the clay      has been recently removed,             we usually      find the
    rock    below polished, grooved, and scratched               in  a direction nearly
    E. and    W., or E.S.E. and W.N.W.                These markings even remain
    distinct on hard greenstones         which have remained             exposed      to the
    weather for an indefinite period.
        The parallelism      of  the striations throughout the present district
    shows that the floating ice must have moved             in a  pretty uniform direc
    tion; and that it was from the west is rendered clear by the striation
     of the western face of the hills, by the great depth of               drift   on their
     eastern sides, and     by the fact that        the transported boulders, when
     traceable to their parent rock, have been carried from west                     to east
     (page 126).

     (2.) Of boulders which have undoubtedly been transported either
 from Cantyre or the Grampian Highlands,                I  may refer to the mass
 of mica slate about       8 or 10 tons, on the      8.E.  side of Hare  Hill above
 Habbie's How, which was first noticed by Mr Maclaren.
     (3.) On the other side of the valley, on the S.W. slope of North
 Black Hill, several smaller masses of white quartz rock occur, fully
 1300 feet above the sea-level.
    Masses of gneiss, mica-slate, and a hard metamorphic conglomerate,
are found in tolerable         abundance     all over the district.
     3.  Mr Croll, in " Climate         and Time,"    gives the following obser
 vations    : —
     "On      ascending    Attermuir      Hill  (1617 feet), Mr Bennie and I
found its summit ice-worn and striated.                 The striae were all in one
uniform direction, nearly east and west.               On examining them with
a   lens,    we had     no    difficulty  in determining that the        ice which
affected them came from the west, not from the east.                   On the    sum
mit of the        hill we also      found patches     of boulder clay in hollow
basins of the rock.           At  one spot  it  was upwards of a foot in depth,
and     rested   on the ice-polished surface.          Of    100 pebbles   collected
from the clay, just       as   they turned up, every one, with the exception
of    3 or 4 composed        of hard quartz, presented        a flattened and ice-
worn surface, and 44 were distinctly striated.                 A number of      these
stones must have come from the Highlands                  to the north-west.
    "On       ascending   Scald Law (1808 feet), 4 miles S.W. of Aller-
muir,     we found in the debris covering its summit hundreds of
transported stones of all sizes, from             1  to 18 inches     in diameter"

2.   Remarks on the Boulder Report by the Convener of the
         Committee, read (in the absence of Mr Milne Home, Con
        vener), by      Mr Ralph Richardson, Member of                Committee.
   This Report contains information               applicable to three districts    of
country, namely —
                           1.   Pentland Hills.
                           2. Morayshire.
                          3. Islands     of the West Coast, and
                                  part of the Mainland.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                              193
                                1.  Pentland Hills.
      The impression hitherto had          been, that the boulders on these        hills
indicated a movement exclusively from the north-west                   ;  and there is
no doubt         that the mica slate boulders on these hills indicate such
a    direction    ; but Messrs Somervail & Henderson, in the notes con
tained       in this Report, have discovered          a separate   movement        from
the -west-south-west,        by the occurrence      of certain sandstone        blocks,
 which they think can be traced to a particular                 hill  or   hills in  the
 Pentland range            This point is so important, that it     is hoped further
 inquiry may         be made regarding it.
                                   2.   Morayshire.
       The boulders in this country are described in a very interesting
 Report        by Mr Jolly, Inverness,           a member      of the      Committee.
 Mr Jolly's concluding paragraph             deserves notice.      He    says,
                                                                                " None
 of these boulders are to the west of the points in situ where                       tho
  parent      rock is found — at      least  I  have   found   none,     and   I  speak
  from      a  pretty extensive knowledge of            the  district.      What     the
  transporting agent or agents            were,   whether glaciers,      icebergs,   ice
  floes,    or water-currents, or       one or more       of these together,       how
  ever interesting       and important, it would be foreign to the purpose
  of the present paper to consider ; but that these rocks were carried
   from      their native    sources,   and scattered     widely and numerously
   to the eastwards,        over a large       extent of    country, cannot for         a
   moment be doubted."
         3.  Islands of the West Coast, and tart of the Mainland.
        It will  be seen from the Report that my own personal survey last
   summer       was chiefly among        the islands,    which, commencing with
    Iona at the south, stretches        through the Western         Hebrides to the
    north end of the Lewis, a distance of 120 or 130 miles.                  I selected
    these islands for two reasons         :— 1st.  Because the boulders on them
    would be in their original undisturbed            positions  ; 2d.     Because one
    of the agencies by which transport of boulders has hitherto                     been
    most commonly explained, i.e., local glaciers, could hardly be adopted
     for these    island boulders.      The highest mountain in any of these
    islands    does not exceed     2000 feet, and on most of the islands the
     height of the    hills does not exceed 500 feet.        Moreover, even in the

194                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
hillicst districts,    there    are no valleys in which glaciers             could     have
been formed.         Therefore, in studying the question of boulder trans
port,   I thought the problem would bo simplified when one of                           the
explanations, and that the most commonly received,                          was   inappli
cable.     In this view of         the  matter,      I  am glad     now to find that
Mr James Geikie,           the    well-known        persistent advocate        of   glacier
agency,     concurs.      Since my visit to the Hebrides,               I   have    read   a
most interesting report by him, published in the
                                                                     " Transactions of
                                            "
the London Geological Society                  for October last.          In this report
Mr Geikie       describes a visit he had paid to the Western Hebrides.
Referring to South Uist, the highest                  hill in which (Mount Hecla)
reaches    to about 2000 feet above              the sea, Mr Geikie says — The
                                                                                     "
nature of the ground is not such              as  would favour        the  formation      01
local glaciers      of any importance.               If   such    ever   hung on        the
southern slope         of the mountain,            they must have           been    of in
significant     size, for they       have   left no moraines         behind them." —
(Page 842.)
   So also,   in referring      to  North Uist, Mr Geikie            says —
                                                                              "I   saw no
trace of terminal moraines.             In   short, evidence       of local glaciaticm
appears     to be wanting,        and  if  any local glacier ever           did exist,    it
must have been        of insignificant dimensions." — (Page 848.)
   The question remains whether the                     Islands    suggest    any other
agency     than local glaciers.         In examining          the   Report, it will      be
found that the following positions             seem    to be   established : —
                                       Boulders.
   1st.   The great majority of the boulders are situated on the slopes
          of hills which face the north-icest.
   2d. Though        there    are boulders in all parts of the Islands,               tbey
      are more numerous          on the West sides         of  the Islands than else
      where.
   3d. Multitudes         of boulders occupy positions which                 they couhl
      not have come into, except from the north-west.
   4th.   In  a  few   cases,  the parent rocks        of boulders were discovered.
      On the mainland,            near  Gair Loch and Loch Maree, several
      boulders of a peculiar sandstone               rock occur, which must           have
      come from north-west, as          it is only     in that direction that        there
      are rocks of the same description,

                     of Edinburgh,       Session 1878-79.                       195
    Also on the north         end of the Lewis,         granite boulders occur
traceable to   hills situated to    the westward.
    As  to boulders on the west coasts,          if they came from the north
west, there     can of course      be for      them    no parent rock in this
country.
                                  Rock Surfaces.
    The Report contains information on other points bearing closely
on the question of boulder transport.
    I  was particularly struck with       the fact, that the bare rocks of the
Islands, and also on the mainland, were smooth on the sides facing
the vest,   but rough     on the sides facing the east.
    In  some parts,    the rocks had evidently been ground down under
the operation of heavy bodies moving over thorn.                 Th' direction in
which this    grinding had      taken place was in many instances            shown
by long lines of furrows and           striae,    which were uniformly       in  the
 direction of north-west and south-east.
    Mr Geikie, in his first     paper on the Hebrides, read to the London
 Geological Society in 1873, notices one or two of these striated rocks,
 and 'admits    the   direction to be as now stated.             He asserts very
 firmly, that the striating agent must have moved from the south-east.
 It appeared to me, however, on a minute examination of the in
 dividual striae, that the agent which produced them moved from the
 north-west, inasmuch as the striie or ruts were generally deepest at
 the north-west ends, and faded away at the south-east              ends.
     In two  cases  of  these striated rocks,      I saw  clearly what had been
 the tools  which produced       the strife.     The rock was being uncovered
 by work-people       for the sake of obtaining           road   materials.     The
 covering of the rock consisted        of a sandy clay, having imbedded            in
 it angular pebbles of quartz, granite, and other hard rocks.               If these
  materials were pushed and pressed over the rock, there could be no
  doubt what the effect would be.
                                Submarine Banks.
      Another set of phenomena        bearing on this subject, is the existence
  of gravel   and clay beds of undoubted               submarine formation.         I
  visited a  brickwork      near   Stornoway,       the clay   of which contains
  fragments   of   sea shells, at a height of 250         feet above the sea.       I
  heard of there being similar beds for miles along the coast on both

196                       Proceedings of                   the   Royal Society
sides of the           Butt of Lewis, but              I   was unable to visit them.                       I learn
that Mr James Geikie had not only seen these clay beds, but found
that some of the shells in them were of an Arctic type.                                                    — (See
Report, p. 37.)
  There are also in the north part of the Lewis, long ridges                                                   and
high        mounds of gravel,                sand,         and mud,           which must have                 been
formed by the action of water                     ;   and    it deserves          notice that some of the
longest of these kaiins run in a north-west and south-east                                        direction.
     In connection with                 the      smoothed              rocks,     and      these submarine
formations, it is not unimportant                                 to remark          that      many      of    the
boulders must have come at                        a subsequent            period     ;    for they lie        upon
the striated rocks, and also upon the kaiins and gravel mounds.
     Now, the question is whether, in any part of the world, we find
phenomena             analogous    to the facts brought out              in this Report J
     In Sir          George    Nares' account                of his recent Arctic voyage,                      the
following            account     is given by Captain                    Fielden,         the   Naturalist         of
the expedition (vol.             ii.   page 343)       :    —
     "   Sea-ice moved up and down by tidal action, or driven on shore
by gales, was found to be                    a    very potent            agent      in    the glaciation          of
rocks and pebbles.               The work was seen in progress along the                                   shores
of the Polar Basin.                At    the south end                  of   a    small island in Black-

     " On shelving shores,              as    the tide recedes, the hummocks, sliding

marked and peculiar sound, resulting from the grating                                           of     included
pebbles with the rocky floor beneath, or in some cases on                                                   other
pebbles included in drift overlying the rock."

  A       case   exactly parallel           is   mentioned by Sir Charles Lyell.                            who,
when travelling in the Bay of Fundy, North America, fell in with

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                 197
a large      surface of flat sandstone           rock on the sea-beach, containing
stria and furrows, of which he gives a diagram, and which he was
satisfied      had been formed by hard stones fixed on the bottom of
floating ice, or pushed           before it.      At    the place   in question,   the tide
rises from 40 to 50 feet, and flows at the rate of ten miles an hour,
so that      the work done when the            sea covered      the rock, became visible
when the          tide was out.      — (" Travels in North America," by Sir
Charles       Lyell, vol. ii. page 174.)
     In Mr Campbell's " Short American Tramp," several similar cases
on the shores of Labrador, of rocks not only ground and smoothed,
but also striated, are given (pages 53, 94, and 107).                         He mentions
also the      following fact :— " The         effect of heavy ice on the water-line
is here     conspicuous.         A berg  about 40 feet out of water was aground
at the      back of one steep island.              It  seemed to have taken the form
of the rocks, against which              it  was ground by a heavy swell.               The
 tee teas    actually rubbing the stone           for that     height    above water, awl
for 400 feet under it.            It was moved by all the power              of an Atlantic
 wave.        Along   the whole coast,      for     a height     of from    40 to 50 feet,
 an     irregular    zone    of rock    is   thus     scoured    bright and smooth."     —
 (Page 93.)
      1  have thought      it right   to quote these authorities, because            of the
 strong      opinion     recently expressed,           in  more     than one influential
 quarter,      against the possibility          of rocks being ground, smoothed,
 and striated       by floating ice.
      One    thing is clear, that in the Hebrides the                sea must have stood
 at a higher      level at former periods, and that the                sea   had an Arctic
 temperature.         But   on the mainland of Scotland, there are tracts                of
 what appear to be sea-beds of gravel,                  sand, and clay, up to a height
 of at least     2000 feet.        Reference may be made to Arctic shells on
  Snowdon, and near Macclesfield, at nearly the same level,                         in beds
 of day     and gravel.        Along with       these facts,    it  must be remembered
 that boulders       have been found          on our Highland           hills, even up to
 2000 feet,       and in some cases upon what are unquestionable sub
  marine deposits.        In   this respect Scotland presents nothing different
 from      what exists        elsewhere.      In Norway,           Sweden,      and North
  America,     there   are   in like manner boulders lying              on what are now
  admitted      to be submarine deposits at very high levels.                      To this
  fact   Mr Croll, in his highly speculative volume called " Climate                   and

198                           Proceedings            of the Royal              Society
Time," makes the following reference                              :   — " In    every part      of the    globe
where        glaciation has been found, evidence                               of the submergence                   of
the land- has also been found along                               with it."           "The submergence
of our country would of course have allowed floating ice to                                                   pass
over        it,   had there been any to pass over                          ;   but submergence would
not have            produced the              ice,    neither          would     it     have brought the
ice        from the          Arctic      regions,      where          it    had already existed." —
(Page 390.)
      Of    course, there must have                  been some oceanic                  current from           the
north-west sweeping over this part of Europe, and which continued
from time to time,                as the sea         fell, bringing boulders to be deposited
from ice-floes on the hills.                       Where the boulders came from, cannot
at present          be even conjectured.                    The fact only           is   established that,
when the boulders came, the                           sea   stood          at least      2000   feet above
its present             level,   and      that there was               a    north-west current,           with
flouting ice, which brought the boulders.
      It    is    hoped       that this boulder inquiry will continue.                             There        is
now more than geological                      interest attaching to               it,   for the facts    seem
to throw light               on important            astronomical questions connected                     with
the physical condition of our planet.                                  Mr Croll's theory         is,   that     at
one period, ice had accumulated                          at the        North Pole         to the extent         of
three       or four miles               in thickness, which would of itself                        cause an
elevation of the                 sea,    for reasons        explained by him, and                      resting
apparently on sound principles.
      Before concluding                 those      remarks upon the                Hebrides       boulders,
and upon the evidence                     they afford        of       a    transport from the north
west,  I         wish to refer to        a    confirmation of these views which                    I     have
had much pleasure in finding from the last Report of the Boulder
Committee of the British Association.                                      In this Report       an interests
ing account          is      given of individual boulders and groups                            of boulders
in Leicestershire.                In     most of the cases mentioned,                    the parent rocks
have been discovered,                   and     in all   these cases,           these    parent rocks an
(tituated to the north-west                   of   the boulders.
      With        regard to the general direction                      of the agency concerned                 in
the transport of boulders, and the                          smoothing of rocks in the                         dis
tricts embraced in the Report, which                              is      shown to have been             from
W.N.W.,            it   is   important        to remark that there                 are exceptions, and
to note the circumstances                     on which these exceptions occur.

                         of Edinburgh,        Session    1878-79.                    199
     In  two parts of the Lewis,         where    hills prevail,   the movement,        ns
indicated by the positions of             the   boulders, and the smoothed           sur
faces of rocks, has         been from    W.S.W.         At  these places (page 26 of
Report, near foot, and page             20, near     top,) it will bo observed that
there are low-lying narrow               defiles   or elongated     valleys, forming
grooves      through the country, whose general                axis is W.S.W.      , and
 with rocky       sides.
     My    idea is, that whilst       in   the higher parts      of the country the
 general traces of a        W.N.W. current         is everywhere distinct, in low-
 lying valleys,      the direction     of the current would change, in corre
 spondence with          the axis of these valleys.          Hence, in valleys, the
 positions of the boulders         are often not the same as at higher levels.
     This remark probably         applies to some of the boulders reported             on
 by Mr      Jolly   of Inverness.      Thus the Derrie More granite boulders,
 traceable even as far east        as  Elgin    and Lossiemouth, indicate trans
  port from about W.N.W.               On the other hand, the boulders,           whose
  parent rocks are situated on the hills forming the sides of the Great
  Glen (viz., Caledonian Canal),           have moved,      not E.S.E. (the normal
  direction), but     E.N.E.    There can be no doubt that when the sea stood
  at a height of say 2000 feet above its present level, and with a general
  oceanic current from the        W.N.W.,       the current in Glen-na-Albin itself
  — i.e.,  between the walls of the valley — would be in the line of that
  valley, forming a deep fissure across the country, runuing about N.E.,
  and that the force of this abnormal current would                    be  sufficient to
  carry boulders transported          through it in a north- easterly direction,
  till it united with      the more general stream from the            W.N.W.
      Bofore closing these remarks,          I  wish to point out, that there         are
   two localities mentioned in the Report which afford evidence that
  Local Glaciers had existed              before    the   country was       submerged.
  These places        are Glencoe and Loch            Etive.    It  is  shown in the
   Report how in the first instance           these glens     had been scoured        out
  and polished by ice flowing down the valleys, bringing rocks, which
  exist in situ only at the head.            It  must have been after this period
   that submergence        occurred,   because     marine    deposits    of gravel   and
   sand   are found      in different    parts,  with boulders resting        on them,
   which undoubtedly came from some distant point in the north-west.
   These would have been all scoured out by a Local Glacier, had they
   been deposited at a preceding          period.

                      Theorem.        By Professor Tait.
                                    (Abstract.)
    Minding's Theorem deals with what may be called by analogy                       the
"focal lines," of the system of single resultants of           a set   of given  force?,
applied at given points to a rigid body, when these forces are turned
about    so as to preserve   unchanged        their inclinations to one another.
    Having     obtained an exceedingly simple proof of the theorem                    by
quaternions,     I next tried to lind the locus of the foot of the                  per
pendicular let fall on each of these resultants from the                    " centre of
the plane     of centres."    The resulting equation is very complex :—
but   if  we extend the data so as to include every position                     of  the
central    axis (whether there is a couple or no), we arrive at                  a very
simple, and at the same time singular, result.
   The locus has then the equation
                                     p — tj/aij/a,
where a is a given vector,     n  a   given pure strain, and        \p any rotational
strain.     This  represents a volume not a surface.
   In   the statical problem
                                      -era. =  0,
and the locus is the volume included between the two sheets of                      the
electric image of a Frcsnel's Wave-surface,            in which     one of the three
parameters is infinite.      This   image has the equation
a surface whose treatment       is easy.       But when    -ma   does not vaniih     we
have for the boundary of the locus
                      S (p - *a)   (z*2  +  p2j\p  - «ra) = 0   ,
which is by no means so simple.

1.  The Pituri Poison of Australia,                 By Dr Thomas R.            Fraser,
      Professor of Materia Medica. University of Edinburgh.
                                    (Abstract.)
   An opportunity for examining the Pituri of Australia was afforded
to  the author by Dr Bancroft of Brisbane, who, in 1877, gave him

                        of Edinburgh,              Session 1878-79.                               201
for that purpose specimens                  of dry broken leaves of the plant, in
the form  in which it is used by the natives, and also a small
quantity of watery extract.
  After describing its use by the natives of Australia, the author
advanced reasons in support of Von Mueller's opinion, that Pituri
is obtained from Duboinia Hopwoodii,                        and that this plant should
be placed      in the   Solanaceae.
     By a modification         of Sta's process for the separation                   of alkaloids,
he   obtained from the extract an active principle                          in   the      form of    a
pale, yellowish-brown,              alkaline fluid, freely soluble in water, alcohol,
ether, chloroform,          amylic alcohol and benzole; of                   a greater si<ecilic
gravity      than    that    of water        ;    and possessing        a   burning         alkaline
taste,    and an odour resembling that of both conia and nicotia.                                    A
solution   in water of this alkaloid and of its hydrochloratc gave
precipitates  with bichloride of platinum, solution of iodine in
iodide      of potassium, iodide of mercury and potassium,                                 iodide of
cadmium        and potassium, iodide of potassium                     and bismuth,               picric
acid, bromine         water, perchloride of mercury, trichloride                           of gold,
and other       re-ngents,     and several of the precipitates were crystalline.
Strong solution         of the hydrochloratc gave precipitates with potash
and soda.
     The chemical characters               suggested      a close resemblanco               between
pituria and nicotia, which was supported by the examination of the
physiological        action.        The extract and active principle act                    as   local
irritants,     and produce death                 mainly by rendering the respiration
 difficult or impossible.             The circulation         is,   however,         also affected,
 the strength       of the cardiac         systole being at first increased               and after
 wards diminished.             It    was    also found       that the cardio-inhibitory
 fibres     of the vagus are at first stimulated and then paralysed                          ;    that
 the     arterial   blood-pressure         is    at   first increased       and then greatly
 diminished     ;   and that, in frogs, the peripheral terminations of the
 motor nerves         are    paralysed, and the cutaneous                   pigment becomes
 diffused.      Contraction of the pupils occurs before death.
     When either the extract or active principle                        is   applied directly
 to the eye-ball,       irritation with increased             lachrymation           is   produced,
 and the     pupil becomes for          a   short time contracted, and afterwards
 dilated.      The last      effect    was        not   observed     with        a   specimen        of
  nicotia    in the     author's       possession,        and, accordingly,            a   doubt     is

 suggested     as to the      identity of the pituri alkaloid with the alka
 loid of tohacco       ;  hut it would       appear   that some observers        have

    It  was pointed        out as a remarkable fact that the aborigines of
 Australia    should have discovered, and when discovered, placed a
 high value upon the action of a substance              closely resembling      in its
 composition and effects the tobacco so well known to, and so highly
 appreciated by, millions of the human race.

 3.  Note on the Probability that              a Marriage entered into hy             a
        Man above the Age of 40 will be Fruitful. By Thomas
        Bond Sprague, M.A., F.RS.E. (Plate XIV.)
    When it       is desired    to disentail a landed estate, it is necessary
for the heir in possession, after obtaining the consent of the first
*ubstitute heir, to pay           to  the   second   and third heirs the         esti
mated value of their expectancy or interest              in the     estate.   In   the
calculations that have to be made for the purpose of ascertaining
this value,      the   actuary has often to take         into account not only
the probabilities        of life, but the probabilities      of marriage      and    of
leaving issue.        The heir in possession may be unmarried, in which
case   he may       marry at some future time,          and   leave    a  child  who
would inherit the estate to the exclusion of the subsequent heirs                      :
or the heir    in   possession   may be married but have         no children,     and
the probabilities then to be estimated            are (1) that his present wife
will   have   a child     at some future      time,  and (2) that she will         die
before    her husband, that ho will then marry a second time,                    and
have    issue   by his second        marriage.      Similar contingencies        may
occur   with    regard    to the first substitute heir.        The theory of      the
calculation of life contingencies is well understood              ;  and much     has
been done      in the way of accumulating marriage statistics and                 cal
culating the probability that         a man of any age, bachelor or widower,
will marry      at some future time       ;  but little,  if anything,      has heeu

done      in the direction of estimating whether the marriage                                  so entered
into      will be fruitful or not. My object in the present                                   note    is to
contribute            towards the elucidation of this question.
     The statistics furnished in the Decennial Census Reports and in
the Annual              Reports of the Registrar-General,                        afford the means of
calculating             the marriage rate among the general                             population, but
these          are    of no   assistance         to us in the present inquiry.                    First,   as
regards          the rate of marriage,             it would         be clearly unsafe          to assume
that the rate deduced from statistics as to the general                                       population,
of which the working                  classes form a very large majority, would be
applicable             to the landed gentry.                Secondly, the above mentioned
statistics give us no information                         whatever as to the fruitfulness                   of
the marriages              entered into.          It is   therefore necessary to seek statistics
in   some            other quarter, and statistics very trustworthy and perfectly
suitable for our purpose,                  are found among the records of the                       British
Peerage as contained                  in the various              Peerages       published annually.
The facts given               in them      are not so numerous as could be desired                         for
special purposes,             but it is of even more importance that our statistics
should be accurate than that they should be very numerous.                                                  It
 therefore seems              to me that the statistics obtained from a careful
 examination               of the   records       of the British Peerage                  may safely       be
 adopted as the basis                of our calculations in the present                       subject.       I
 have          accordingly taken the volume cf Lodge's Peerage for the year
 1871, and             gone carefully through              it,   noting all the cases of marriages
         men, whether bachelors or widowers, entered                                  into after the
 of of
                                                                                                           age
         40.     The total number of such men,                        as   to whom the necessary
 information was complete, was 339, of whom 132 were bachelors and
 207 widowers.                These may seem small numbers on which to base                                  a
 general         law   ;   but, in default of larger numbers,                   I     think   we must do
 the best we             can to     see    what conclusions may safely be drawn from
 them.           The following table shows the ages at which the marriages
 were contracted,              and how many of those contracted at each age were
 fruitful or unfruitful.                  Most of the marriages included in the obser
 vations were               contracted many years ago,                     so    that the information
  contained            in the volume of Lodge                    was taken as conclusive as to
  whether the marriages                   were    fruitful or       not.        For   the comparatively
  few as to           which there         seemed    a     doubt,  I   referred to the volume                ot
  Burke's Peerage,              published in              1878.      In all      cases   if   a   child was

    Here we        see  that, on the whole, both                 among       bachelors     and
 widowers,      the probability      of a marriage         being unfruitful increases
 with the age of the husband.               The progression        among the bachelors
 is less regular than among the widowers ; but this is no doubt to be
 explained       by the    smaller numbers             that are under observation.
 When we take the bachelors               and widowers together, the progression

206                   Proceedings         of the Royal Society
is remarkably regular         ;  in fact so regular, that, notwithstanding                     the
comparatively small numbers                  observed,       we     shall be justified           in
believing that we have here an indication of a law of nature, upon
which we may safely base our calculations.
   In order     to make         our conclusions practically serviceable,                    it    is
necessary to calculate        from them the probability for every                     age from
40 onwards, or, in technical language,                  to graduate       the probabilities.
This   I do  by   a  graphic method.            In    the appended         figure   I  take the
abscissa to represent       the age, and the ordinate the probability that                         a
marriage    entered into at that age            will    be unfruitful.         Thus, for      a;;*
42, being the middle of the five              ages 40-44, the probability is "285,
and this is represented          by the point A.           In   the same way the points
E, C,   13, E, F, G,     II,  represent      the probabilities for the ages 47, 52,
57, 62, 67, 72, 77.          Then, joining these points by straight lines, I
draw   a curve    which shall follow the general course of the points                           as
faithfully   as is   consistent with the avoidance                  of irregularities in       its
form.     Then, by estimating the ordinates of the points where                               the
curve cuts the vertical lines in the diagram,                    I  obtain   a first approxi
mation to the adjusted probability                   for each       age,  and this is      after
wards corrected by        a process     which it seems unnecessary                 to  describe
on the present occasion.           The following are the values which                     I thus
obtained : —

     I will    not attempt to discuss          the  various points on which the
 fruitfulness of      a marriage     depends.      The most important of them
 is clearly the age of the wife ; and consistently with this, we see that
 the probability of a marriage           being unfruitful,       increases with great
 rapidity     between    the ages of 50 and 60         ; obviously because a much
 larger proportion of the wives married by men of these ages are past
  child-bearing than is the c.ise with those married by men under 50.
     It  is but very rarely that the information available to the public
  will enable      us to form even        a reasonable      conjecture whether the
  absence    of  issue of a marriage      is attributable     to the husband or to
  the wife, but such cases do occasionally occur.                 For   instance,   when
  a man marries a widow of 30 who has already had several children,
  it may fairly be inferred that it is the fault of the husband                  if there
  are no children born        of hei- second     marriage.    So, again,     if there are
  no children born       of  a marriage,    the wife dies, and the husband then
   marries a second       time and has a family, it may fairly be inferred
   that the absence     of children of    the first marriage was not attributable
   to him.     It  is obvious that cases of this kind are             so  very few that
   we cannot attempt        to base any general reasoning           upon them, nor is
   it all  necessary that we should do so.

    It  only remains to mention that in obtaining the probabilities
above set forth no account has been taken of the age of                    the   -wife at
the date of marriage.           Our conclusion therefrom will have no appli
cation to individual         cases  where     the age of the wife is       known,     but
are only applicable to the cases indicated at the outset, where                        the
men we are considering are not contemplating marriage.                         In   other
words,     we have      calculated the probability          that,   if  a man who is
either now married            or   who is single and is not contemplating
marriage,      shall hereafter     enter   into a marriage at      a  certain age,     the
marriage      will be unfruitful.

       1. Notice of the Death of the President of the Society.
                                 By the Chairman.
     Sir Alexander Grant said: —
    Gentlemen,      — "VVe    cannot pass to the proceedings           of this evening
without       some    reference     to   the    calamity which      has   befallen    the
 Royal Society of Edinburgh,              and    under the sorrowful         impression
of     which     wo    now meet — the           sudden   death    of    our honoured
 and well-beloved President.
     We knew,      alas  !  gentlemen,     that his health had been           failing   of
 late, and that when, only six months ago, he first took his seat                       as
 President of this Society, his vigour was impaired, at all events                     for
 the time.
     But when      the lamp of his          spirit blazed up so brightly, in          the
 address which he delivered to the                University,  less than one montL
 since,   and which         was    received     with   pleasure     and     enthusiasm
 by the students         and    his colleagues,      and all    the    large   audience

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                                  209
that were gathered round —on that occasion,                        I say, who could have
expected        that his       end   was so near       ?     He  seemed    to exhibit vital
force such as might carry him through many a year more                              upon this
earth.
     Perhaps, had he listened                 to   the    first premonitions of disease,
had he recognised the necessity                   of repose and inaction, this might
have been         the   case.    But   he was of too ardent a nature to            " husband
out life's taper to the close," and amidst the regrets and lamentations
which have now been called forth, may we not say that there was
some consolation              in that last public scene            1   May we not almost
say that        he was felix opport imitate mortis ?                     He died, like a
victorious warrior, with the affectionate cheers                        of the University
which he had loved so well still ringing                          in his   ears.     He sank
 surrounded by the hues of               a refulgent and happy sunset after             a long
 bright summer day.
     I  shall only venture, gentlemen,               to offer a few words of personal
 recollection of our friend whom we have lost.
     His kindly         presence seems to belong to this room, as                it  does also
 to the      University,        and   to the very streets            of Edinburgh.         His
 sympathetic         nature led him always to identify                   himself with the
 human interests             among      which       he   found     himself   thrown.        As
 professor of mathematics for forty -one years, he was not only one of
 the best     and    most     highly    appreciated       teachers   that the University
 of Edinburgh ever had, but also one of its most loyal members and
 devoted champions.              In  University matters he had that true insight
 which is begotten by sympathy                   ; so that though he was an English
 man, born          and bred        in   an    English       parsonage, and educated         at
 Cambridge         till  he was    thirty   years old, ho is acknowledged to have
  understood        the    Scotch Universities         — better almost than any            one
  else.     In his    addresses and his conversation              he loved to dwell more
  on the merits than on the imperfections of the Universities                          of this
  country,       and he earnestly deprecated                any reforms      which     should
  destroy the essential character of those Universities.                    He had, in the
  best sense, a      thoroughly academic             mind.      Indeed, he was the typo
  and    model of an academic                figure.      Of   genuine   piety ;   with deep
   learning     in his own subject          ;   with a modest, seemly, and dignified
  exterior    ;  he was full of bright pleasantry and the sweet amenities
   of life.     Hia interests were not confined to the Universities ; he

  210               Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 adopted and took to his heart the hroad land of               Scotland ; and it
  was a lahour of love with him to assist in administering one of the
  most important     of  the educational Trusts of this country.            It would
 be   utterly out of place — both       on this occasion     and   for myself — to
  attempt to speak       of the scientific merits which rendered Professor
  Kelland worthy, by universal consent, to hold the high place of
 President in this Society. I will now merely recall one or two of his
 own utterances, still full of meaning for us, extracted from those
 addresses, which      were always so pleasing and always so character
 istic of him.    Whenever       I have   listened to or read these addresses,
 they reminded me of that description of              a Roman worthy      :
                       Venit et Crispi jueunda senectus
               Cujus erant mores, qualis facundia, mite
               Ingenium.
                               The pleasant old man, Crispus,
               Whose life and mind were, like his oratory,
               All in a gentle strain.
     But there was more than mere gentleness              in Professor Kelland's
 utterances.     He had the art of conveying many deep and pregnant
 truths in apparently light and mirthful sentences.              I  never knew        a
 lecturer who was at the same time so sunny and so wise.                    Had    his
 life been prolonged and his health restored, we might have expected
 him often to delight us from this chair.                  But it   has  otherwise
 seemed good to Providence.
     Nineteen years ago Professor Kelland returned to his class after
 being face to face with death          in   a  terrible railway accident.         He
 had travelled sooner       than some thought prudent after the injuries
he had received.        He said, in an address to his students,        "I   believed
 that the path of duty is the safest and the easiest path, and               I acted
on this conviction       when, against      the   advice of my friends,      I came
down suddenly amongst you."              He spoke then of the deaths of             no
less than twenty-nine        professors    which     had occurred    since he     had
joined    the  University,    and   he added,       "but   I am spared       a  little
while."      In that    address   he seemed       to rise to a survey of human
life, especially  a  life spent in pursuit of science.           He paid a noble
tribute to the earnest genius         of Professor George       Wilson, then re
cently dead, whom he compared              and contrasted     in  a most interest
ing way with the           great   mathematician        Baron   Canchy, and        he
quoted that     beautiful saying, which might almost be considered                  to

                      of Edinburgh,          Session 1878-79.                           211
have been the motto of Professor Kelland's                    life  :
                                                                        " The   measure    of
the happiness of a man is the number of things which he loves and
blesses, which       he    is loved and        blessed      by."       From    the  address
which Professor Kelland delivered                   to    us at the opening of this
session,  I   must beg to quote           three    sentences.         The   first indicates
the spirit in which he accepted              the    office of President.          He said    :
" To
       myself this honour         has come neither to gratify ambition nor to
administer to self-conceit.            It  has descended          on me all unsought,
through the kindness of the many friends who have sat with me in
this room, and      the only emotion         it  awakens      is that of affection      and
gratitude."      In the     second     sentence     which     I  shall recall, Professor
Kelland    evinces his warm interest            in   the rising generation         of scien
tific workers.       He says: — "One word which                   I   venture    on as both
encouraging for the present and hopeful for the future, is the remark
able number of young men who are just entering on their work.
In the fasciculus of        the    Society's Proceedings just issued,               I count
no less    than eleven        names     of young men just entering on their
career   of investigation.          How many of             them      have   caught their
inspiration    from contact         with those older workers who have been
long among us      ?    How many         have    been drawn out and cheered by
the associations of this room."             In    the    last  sentence which        I shall
quote Professor       Kelland teaches us how now we ought                         to regard
himself.      Ho              " The feelings which arise on
                  says   :                                                   casting one's
thoughts back through twenty years are full of sadness when they
fasten on    individual      members of the          Society whose presence at our
meetings was a source of pleasure                not unmixed with pride, but of
sadness, brightened         by glimpses       of the future, when we think of
them as members of          a  living body,     as workers even now in the field
which man has been sent                into the world          to   cultivate — the field
where truth is to be sought and found."                    As   a member of that         liv
ing body, as an immortal worker in that field                    of truth, with "       sad
 ness brightened by glimpses            of the future," we must now think of
 Philip Kelland.
    It was moved by the Chairman,

  2.  Why the Barometer                 does     not always indicate the Heal
         Weight of the Mass of Atmosphere                     aloft.      A   continuation
         of the Paper on this subject laid before the Society in
         Session 1876 and 1877.                 By Robert Tennent.
      Meteorological phenomena are in all               cases to be regarded         as being
  both a cause and an effect        ;   owing to this, and also to the imperfect
  state of our knowledge on this subject,               it may be safely asserted          that
  exception     proves    or tests the rule.          Taking up the subject           in this
  point of view, much assistance is in this way to                     be   acquired when
  attempts arc made to explain the phenomena                       which are under con
  sideration,    and    hence   these     negative       conclusions       can   to a large
  extent be taken advantage           of.     As  an illustration        of this, can    it  be
 assumed      that  a barometer       placed     on the surface         of the earth, and
  which    always correctly indicates the amount                     of pressure       on its
 cistern,   will  also always correctly         indicate the weight of the           mass    of
 air aloft, both when it is at rest and when it is in rapid motion,
 accompanied       by the important element of friction.                   Equal identity
 of pressure in both such         cases    is assumed, although no observations
 to  justify   the correctness     of this assertion         have been made.            With
 the atmosphere        in a state  of perfect       rest, setting aside       just  now the
 effects of heat and vapour,          there    will  be an upward normal diminu
 tion of pressure, but with the same superincumbent mass of air                             no
 longer at rest, but attended with the dynamical element of motion in
 the rapid upper strata,       will    there not then be an upward abnormal
 diminution of pressure, due to the              " lifting" of    the air on the surface
and its accumulation          aloft?       It  is this point which was shown in
the former paper, and is now here to be more                       fully  explained.       In
both such       cases,  and under the same superincumbent mass of air,
can the barometer,         placed     on the      surface, possibly show the            same
amount      of pressure    ?   It  is only by a series of barometers                  placed
vertically above each other to            a great height,      and not very far apart,
that the amount of pressure in both such                    cases   will   be  found    to be
the same.
     Mathematical meteorological            investigations cannot be here intro
duced with perfect         accuracy, and only to a small extent, where                      so
much      complexity, irregularity,           and    want of uniformity            is to    be

found, and where barometric observations                     are not always absolutely
reliable, nor also are the gradients and isobars which depend upon
them.        In  such an imperfect state of matters, exceptional                  cases must
always be       found,     and these,    if not   disadvantageously         too numerous,
must      consequently,         as above      remarked,      be   regarded       as   being  a
negative       test or proof of the conclusions arrived at.                    The import
ance     of barometric       observations      is however well known, but, as has
been pointed         out by the Astronomer Royal and others,                   a great mass
of these is valueless and simply overwhelming, while comparatively
 few definite conclusions have as yet been arrived at.                            Hence ex
 planatory theories           must be produced           to point out the particular
 direction in which such observations                  ought to be carried out.             In
 such a subject as this, the greater the extent to which investigation
 takes place the greater           will   be the amount         of difficulty and        com
 plexity, but such a discovery is only to be regarded                     as  being a more
  accurate approach to ultimate reliable conclusions.
      The object of this paper is to show, mainly in                  a mechanical       point
  of view,    why     the  fall of   the    barometer     to  a great     extent is due to
  strong winds, setting aside at present                the much       smaller amount of
  fall produced by heat and vapour.                 In other words         the point to be
  explained      is, — why     horizontal movement         takes off vertical pressure.
  This fall, due to strong winds, is produced by a real removal of air
   and the    amount to which it takes place will depend on the extent
   of the resisting surface over which             the winds pass, and also on the
   amount of their source          of supply, which        is indicated so far by the
   steepness    of   the gradients.       In   a somewhat       similar way, when the
   incline at the bottom of a river is very slight, the current                     will then
   move    slowly, and will tend to deepen and accumulate,                    but when the
   incline is much steepened, the current                will then      increase in speed,
   removal      will now     take place, and      it will    consequently       shallow out.
    Although the barometer thus            falls for " removal" of       air, it  is intended
    to show    that this fall is not entirely due to removal, but that it is
    alio partly due to      "lifting," which      is an exhibition of fictitious pres
    sure.    The barometer has been described                as being both       a cause and
    an effect.     An   area of low pressure is a cause of the indraught                     of
    aerial currents,    but owing to the peculiar mode in which they inflow
     to this  low centre by rapid upper currents, a still further diminu
     tion of pressure      will  take   place, as    just   above mentioned,          and this

214                    Proceedings          of (he Royal Society
is to be regarded       as being an effect.                  In another point of                   view, it
may     be here    mentioned,          that     if    a very swift          wind blows               over      a
convex surface, pressure              will then        be diminished, but                   if    the    con
vexity is that of the earth's surface, and the velocity that of                                        actual
winds, the effect will be far too small to be sensible.
     These   rapid upper currents and their effects, to which so                                       much
importance      has been attached, do not consist merely of                             light       rarefied
upper aerial strata          which         can be possessed              of little momentum.
The mode in which they are constructed may be thus described
Their velocity     begins to increase at only a few feet above the surface,
as   has been shown by observations                     ;    this increase goes on often                    to
a    great   height in      the atmosphere,            much of          it,     however,          is   to   be
found in the more weighty and condensed mass of the air not                                            much
above the surface, where              it   must be accompanied by                 a   powerful          force
due to its momentum.               The weight of             a   cubic mile of air amounts
to several millions         of tons    ;    where      many such are in motion, their
weight and their accompanying momentum                                 will     be sufficiently pro
digious to produce the effects which have been pointed out.
     From experiments made by Halley and Hawksbee, they                                            came     to
the conclusion that horizontal movement                          took off vertical                pressure,
while Professor Leslie experimented                     to refute this.*                A   well-known
experiment will illustrate             this.     If   a     current of water flows down                     an

earth's centre remains undiminished ;                             but if in this way it is distri
buted over a greater                   extent of surface, on any point of                          it,   it     may
then practically be regarded as being really diminished.                                          The weight
of the current passing over the orifice at                             C   may therefore be regarded
as operating            in an altered        direction.           With        an incalculable amount
of velocity, gravity may be said totally to disappear.                                          The distribu
tion of pressure               may be exemplified by                     a    cannon ball which,              if  it
falls directly downwards from the mouth of the gun,                                         will then show
its   full weight when                it   comes       in    contact         with   the surface           of the
ground, but            if it   moves rapidly           in   a     horizontal direction its weight
may now be regarded as being distributed over an extent of surface,
on any point of which                      it   is   there      diminished practically.                   When
skating          slowly over thin ice,               it   gives        way, but by passing rapidly
over     it,   this may be done in safety.                      The explanation of this                   is,   that
the ice has not here time to give way                        ;      this   is   no doubt so far correct            ;
but     it   must also be observed, that the weight of the skater,                                 if     at rest,
is    to be      found in      a   vertical direction and                is   then undiminished, but
when he moves               it   is   then distributed over the surface of the ico and
is    in this way lessened.                  The greater the amount of velocity, the
greater        will      be the practical diminution                       of pressure over            a   corre
sponding extent of surface.

the atmosphere          caused      by the      introduction       of the      element          of

the strong upper current,            and let the      diminution      in length of           the
arrows beneath         it  represent     the diminution         in   the     rate   of their
speed.      As  was shown        in  the diagram     in  the last paper* on this sub
ject, these strong upper currents obtained much of their necessary
source    of supply by       "lifting" it from         the slower and more retarded
surface currents beneath            them.     The direction in which this lifting
 takes place is shown by the small arrows inclined                   in the direction in
 which movement          takes place.       Accumulation is here indicated by               the
 comparative     closeness     in  the parallel position of the arrows, while the
rarefaction and diminution of pressure on the surface, due to lifting,
 is indicated by their comparative              wideness in the parallel position              of
 the arrows there.         It   is only   with     a higldy elastic fluid       such as air,
 aided   also by a certain amount of viscosity, and                     accompanied           by
 horizontal surface retardation,           that this alteration in the position                of
 vertical pressure can take place.               If  tho moving currents are non-
 elastic   fluids, such     as    mercury, their rapidly moving upper                    strata
 will only    cause a real diminution           of pressure on the surface, but               no
 increase of pressure or         of accumulation aloft,        because      lifting    cannot
 here take place.         With     a perfect     fluid, also, no surface retardation
 will  be found, and no difference            in   the speed of currents         in  so far as
 they   are due to    this cause.       Hence here, as on         a frictionless      surface,
 "lifting" will     not take place.
     When     a very rapid rise of the barometer                 takes place, as is         fre
 quently to be found in West Indian hurricanes, it may at least                                so
 far be accounted for in this way             ;   when abnormal upward diminu
 tion of pressure is found due to accumulation aloft,                    as   shown in tie
 diagram     No.  3,  and when the motive force which produces                          it  and

rapid descent of the accumulation          mil of    course take   place to over
come the     diminution of     pressure on the surface, and       in this way it
will at least    so far approach the form      of upward normal diminution
of pressure.       A rapid fall of the barometer on the surface will also
in   a similar but in a reverse way take place, when accumulation
begins to take place, with diminution              of pressure on the surface.
Upward normal diminution of            pressure, which is here made use of
as an exemplification       of what takes place, is in all probability seldom
or never to be found, as the atmosphere is rarely,          if ever,   in  a state of
perfect rest, nor is there any uniformity in the effects of heat and
vapour.       It is only in a mechanical      point of view that     it  can assist
in explanations.
     When    the wind, represented    by the arrow    AB, blows    over the top of
 a  wall CD, it will lift   the air and diminish pressure on the lee side at

 the point O, though only to        a small amount, while the weight of the
  atmosphere     may be said to be unaltered.       This diminution of      pressure
  is caused by the wall, which retards the velocity of the wind.            Friction
  on the surface    of  the earth may be exemplified by a long series of
  such walls, which will produce diminution of pressure               immediately
  above    them.    It  is only on a very extensive surface        of, say several
  hundred miles in length, with a corresponding width, that strong
  upper currents can produce lifting and diminution of pressure to its
  full extent; under such circumstances, the comparative height of
  these upper currents will not be great as compared with their
  length.     Redfield has pointed out that depressions             have often a
  height of only     ^ith    part of their width, while in other instances
  their height may be comparatively great in reference to their width,
  in which     case  little or no diminution       of pressure    will    be found.
   The effect of such an extensive        resisting surface    is to produce       re
   tardation   of the surface    currents, along with an imperfect amount

of supply.         If these are not found,           " lifting " will not take          place.
The importance of the difference                 in   the    comparative       height      and
length of the currents, and of the depressions,                  in  a mechanical point
of view, was taken advantage               of in the last paper* to show                   how
depressions       opened out    in front,    and hy so doing moved forward.
    An exemplification of           the effect of an extensive            surface      which
produces      low pressure       may he found in the southern hemisphere
below lat. 40°, where what are called the " roaring forties are to be
                                                                                "

with little intermission,        and extend over a vast portion of the globe.
The Rev. S.        J. Perry, in his voyage there, found the average height
of the barometer         there to be     in November,         29-658° ;     in  December,
29-462°; in January, 29.406°            ;  February, 29.610°.            This may       there
fore be accounted         for by removal and lifting.               In  other countries,
where      calms    and   light winds prevail,         —  where strong winds             blow
only for     a   short time    over    a   small extent of surface,              as in the
Mediterranean, no such low pressure is to be found.                           In    explana
tions attached to the barometer, to show the effects of its rise                            and
fall, calms arc predicted when the mercury is high, as a                              general
rule.     Local exemplifications of lifting from the bottom of                       a valley
are    to   be    found    in tho I'ohn in Switzerland,                 where     the wind
passes rapidly over their summits,                and    are also to be found on             the
lee side of precipices.
    In   the diagram No. 1, where the current of air                  AB lifts up      the air
from the vessel         GHKL, which         is now enclosed on the top, and has
now its source of supply arrested,                 it  is then     that rarefaction         aml
 diminution       of pressure    takes    place     to the    full   extent.      This     may
 also illustrate the etfect of an extensive             resisting surface in arresting
 the source of supply to its surface currents               and causing their retarda
 tion.     In  a  former paper    f it  was stated that,        in   weather     charts, the
 constant rise and       fall of the barometer, which is there reported,                   u   to
 a large extent simply           due to the passage            of air    over    a resisting
 surface; on a frictionless surface             these    mechanical      effects    would      be
 entirely removed.

 Let the narrowing in the parallel position of the upper arrows repre
 sent accumulation aloft, and their widening below represent                      rarefac
 tion and diminution           of pressure.       In this way,       and also owing to
 removal     of air, the fall of      the barometer        with these winds may be
 shown.        North-east winds arc not accompanied                by rapid upper cur
 rents,   which    move    somewhere       about the same rate of speed as those
 on the surface.         For  the sake of illustration,         let it  be supposed   that
 they move even more slowly, and let them                  be  indicated by the shorter

   Accumulation aloft cannot here           be   found   ;  it will now     take place on
   the surface,    as  is shown in this diagram               by the closeness of the
   parallel position of the arrows there.           This tendency to condensation,
   which was also to be found in tho former instance, was there removed
   by the rapid upper currents, which here are not to be found.                      With
    these N.E. winds,      therefore,    as removing and           lifting  does not take

220                    Proceedings of the Royal Society
place,    they are accompanied              by   a rise    of the barometer.            The
mode     in which       these   N.E.   surface    winds are enabled        to overcome
the effect       of friction, and to accumulate             on the surface,       may     be
thus explained.           They are cold and dense, and they enter under
neath a milder atmosphere             in  the form of a wedge and raise          it  above
them.       To enable them to do this they must have                  a  copious    source
of supply from an area of high pressure, and they are also aided
generally       by descending      currents,    which possess      a great   amount       of
potential energy.
    As   is well-known         by seamen, these surface           N.K     winds appear
with     a    remarkable amount           of suddenness       and   violence,    and the
disasters which accompany              them have been often recorded.               South
west gales which            blow aloft approach         much more slowly, and,           as
this approach         is first exhibited aloft, they can be predicted with
much certainty.
    In  the last paper just alluded to           it was mentioned that the range
of the thermometer           is equally great both above and bslow its mean.
But with the barometer,              the extent of its range above the mean
is not more than one-half of that which takes place when                     it  is below
it.    When it       is below the mean, Equatorial winds generally prevail,
such    as     those   S.W. just alluded          to, which     are accompanied          by
removal       and lifting.      When      above the mean, Polar winds and calms
prevail, which are not accompanied                 by removal and lifting.         Hence,
as a general       rule, Equatorial winds exhibit            an amount of fictitious
pressure,       while     Polar   winds      show more nearly, real          or    statical
pressure,       which,     however,     may     possibly be so much in             excess.
Much important information                as to the    mobility of the upper aerial
strata     may     be    shown by        the   experiments       made     by    Professor
Tyndall at Chamouni, and at the summit of Mount Blanc.
    From observations          made by the late         Mr Johnson, director         of the
Oxford University             Observatory, it was found that, at            a height      of
 110 feet from the ground, the velocity of the wind was found to
be    2\    times     that indicated by an            instrument at 22 feet          above
 the soil.       This velocity, of         course,   increases   with    the   elevation,
 and to the        extent of live or six fold,          as  shown by Glaisher.           In
 the   address       of the     President,     H.     S. Eaton,    on   21st    February
 1877,     ho alludes to the ascent            of a balloon from Paris.             At   an
 elevation of 6560           feet, a violent wind          was encountered,        and on

                       of Edinburgh,        Session 1878-79.                              221
Teaching       a point 187 miles north of Christiania, and nearly 1000
miles from Paris in a direct line, the balloon must have sailed at the
rate     of at least   66 miles an hour, while nowhere did the extreme
speed      of the wind     registered    at any observatory         at  all   approach     the
speed      of the balloon.       When     the stratum of clouds             overhead is of
sufficient depth, and when the difference                   in   the velocity       of their
 different strata is sufficiently great, a columnar inclination                       of the
 clouds     in the direction in which they move will bo observed.                        This
 will illustrate the inclination of the columns of air which                           repre
 sent the increasing upward velocity                of  the winds, and is so often
 referred     to.
      Over the ocean, as seamen are well aware,                sea   birds, when strong
 winds prevail,        attempt to fly only           on    the    surface,     where     their
 velocity is retarded,          while above      this they are unable to move
 against them.
      To ascertain the amount of diminished                      or   fictitious pressure
 which is due to lifting, the real weight of the same mass of atmo
 sphere must be ascertained           both when it is at rest and when it is in
 motion.         The results of such an observation,            if  made by a series of
  barometers      placed vertically above each other to              a great height,       and
  not very far apart,        will, in  each case, exhibit          an equal       amount     of
  pressure, and when the atmosphere              is at rest, the barometer on the
  surface    will then   alone show its true weight, but when               it is in motion,
  the barometer      on the surface      will  then    indicate diminished or ficti
  tious pressure,     because     the   air is then       so   far lifted and rarefied
  immediately above           the   surface,   and     is    accumulated         aloft with
  increase      of pressure    there.     The result of this,           as   shown,     is an
  upward       abnormal diminution         of pressure.        The barometer          always
  shows the real pressure of the air            in  contact with its cistern, which
  it does in this latter instance, but it does not here show the weight
   of the superincumbent air, while           in   the former case         it  showed both
   accurately.      In this    way,   and also for other reasons, it does not
   indicate     correctly the height of mountains, nor can observations
   made     at some height and then reduced to sca-level be at all depend
   able.
       Observations with a series of barometers               as   thus just above sug
   gested,    will be best carried out in a wide open atmosphere over the
    sea,  and not in contact with the slopes of a lofty mountain, which,

 222                  Proceedings         of (he Royal Society
 for many reasons, must necessarily                derange   the   observations.       As
 no such     direct observations         can be made at all, results can only
 be arrived at from those which are not absolutely definite and con
 clusive.     Aided by theory,        some of these may be here suggested.
     Observations were          made by Captain          James    in his     cottage     at
 Granton during the prevalence of strong winds.*                      When this     took
 place  in  the form of violent gusts, the instrument                 placed  in  one of
 the rooms, where, of course,           it   was so far confined,       showed    then    a
 considerable      lowering of pressure,           while   that placed      outside    re
 mained comparatively unaltered.                 Could this cottage have been           so
 arranged     or constructed       as to move        forward at    a   uniform rat* of
 speed    with    the   gusts,   pressure      inside would not then at all            be
 reduced,     because    no   local confinement or retardation of the air
 would then take place         ; its amount would then be the same               as that
 shown by the instrument outside.
     Experiments were made by the writer at Craigleith Quarry,                      near
 Edinburgh,     with    a barometer        placed   at the top and at the bottom          :
 the depth of the quarry, as compared with its width, is considerable.
 The remarkable difference            at these spots was this, that while the
 height of the mercury, as observed at the upper part of the quarry,
remained      uniform, or nearly       so,   during strong gusts     ; at the bottom,
its oscillations were very great, with much occasional diminution of
pressure, which then took place when the gusts passed rapidly over
the upper surface, to which the air was drawn up from the bottom                         ;
"lifting"    and accumulation aloft are thus exemplified.               At the bottom,
where the air was confined,           retardation took place.         Had there    been
no such confinement        — had supply         there   been equally copious as on
the surface, no such        oscillations would have taken place.                 This  is
also illustrated by a waterspout,            as shown     in the first paper on this
subject in 1875.
    Observations to throw light upon the subject in question may                      bo
made in the following manner              :  When    a strong wind blows over the
sea,  let there be placed at anchor in the direction in which it blows
a  line of vessels with instruments placed on deck to show                    pressure.
The wind passing over them may then be represented as moving in
inclined columns, in which           case the barometer        does not indicate the
real mass of the air aloft.          Let    another   vessel now move forward in
                *
                    See "Trans.    Roy. Soc.    Edin."vol.  xx. p. 377.

                      of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                        223
the direction and at the same rate of speed                  as that of the wind, a
calm   will now prevail over its deck, and               the columns above       it may
then be regarded as being vertical, and indicative                 of the real weight
of the air aloft    ;  when it passes close alongside of those at anchor,              a
difference of pressure        will  be found      on each, although        the mass of
 air aloft is the same.       For various     reasons, however, the real amount
 of difference here     will not in this way        be correctly ascertained,       and
 it will not be great.       If  a calm prevails         over the vessels at anchor
 they   will then show the real weight aloft.               The moving vessel       will
 now produce       and encounter a force of wind equal to her rate of
 speed, and    will not now show real weight aloft.
    Vessels crossing the        Atlantic against the strong prevailing west
 winds, will increase       their force in proportion           to the rate at    which
 they sail against them.          They must, therefore, indicate           a difference
 of pressure when passing those vessels               returning with the winds in
 their favour.      Its amount will not          bo great, because       the extent of
 the resisting    surface which is represented by their decks is insuffi
 cient to produce retardation           of horizontal       and lateral supply.      If,
 however, the instruments          are placed     in  some enclosure, as was seen
 in the cottage, some amount of difference of pressure                    will then   be
 shown.
    Tor want of space here, and owing to the extreme difficulty                       of
 the subject,  it cannot     here   be   fully explained, but it may          be stated
 that the conclusion        has been arrived         at,   that   as  a  general rule,
 the barometer       in the Tropics, with, of            course,   exceptional cases,
 more nearly    shows the real weight of the atmosphere than it does
 in more   northerly latitudes.        In countries of very different descrip
 tions of structure and climate, this         will probably       bo found to be the
 case, and also    over the land and the        sea.
    The isobars,     which    are constructed        on the supposition        that the
 barometer always shows the real weight of the air, cannot be accu
 rate.   In the different segments which surround an area of low
 pressure, they will require a difference in the amount of their cor
 rection.*    In   the same way, and for other reasons                 also, gradients
 which are figuratively      equal,   as   is well known, do not exhibit the
 same   amount of incline,      or the same amount of inflow of the winds.
 Correction here is evidently also necessary.            —May      1878.

 4.   On    a  Calculus of Relationship.               By Alexander Macfarlane,
                                 M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S.E.
     1.  De Morgan read a paper on the "Logic                  of Relations"    before
 the Cambridge Philosophical               Society, and the paper is printed         in
 their Transactions.          He attempts to deal not only with the            idea of
relationship, but with          the idea of relation       in  general.   As  he does
not deal with exact ideas, ho cannot give any exact results.
    2.   Among        the writings     of Leslie Ellis there are printed some
notes on Boole's         " Laws of Thought," and there he refers to the idea
of relation.         Ho makes the important remark: — "It seems to me
that the mind passes from idea to idea in accordance with                     various
principles       of suggestion,       and that,      in  correspondence    with tie
different classes          of such    principles      of suggestion,    we ought    to
recognise       different branches of the general             theory of inference."
But     he proceeds to discuss          equations expressing any kind of         rela
tion, thus neglecting his own principle of making a special investi
gation lor each really different kind of idea.
    3.   What     I have    attempted to do is to devise       a complete analytical
notation for what can bo represented                   graphically   by means of      a
genealogical       tree, to consider how data           about relationships should
bo expressed,        and to point out rules for manipulating these data.
    4.   The     distinction    between      the    relationship   and the   person-!
between      whom      the relationship exists, can be represented         by means
of small letters in contradistinction to large letters — e.g.,
                                     sA = B + C + D
                       The sons of    A   are B, and C, and D.
    5. The symbol           a has  a  definite arithmetical value, which is         an
integer.       It   is a multiplier,     or operating symbol,      which  changes    A
into B and C and D.
    6.   To express        any relationship      whatever,    we require only four
fundamental symbols expressing                the four fundamental relationships
 (1) of    a  father to his sons, (2) of       a  father to his daughters,   (3) of   a

mother           to her sons, and (4) of a mother to her daughters.                                                             These
 may be          denoted respectively by

      7.    Superior indices and inferior indices.                                                     In   an investigation
 we        may require to consider several different                                               s   relationships        ;   these
are best         distinguished by means of superior indices, e.g.,
                                                            t1,        s2,      s3.
 We also require to consider one of the                                               s's, say         the nth   ;   this   is   pro
perly denoted by s„                     .
      8.    The sign        =   .

                                                      nA=B+C+D.
This equation asserts                           that the sons of                          A    comprise       B,     C,     and 1)
exactly, neither more nor fewer.
      The equation                                             sA =      o-B
denotes that the sons                           of the man             A        are identical with               the sons of
the woman B.                The truth of the equation involves
                                                               s   =   o-
where the          bar denotes that the arithmetical value of the symbol                                                          is
 taken.           What          -       denotes           is   identity               of persons         — not       necessarily
identity of relationships.                            Equations which express                               the latter idea
may be called             identities.
      9.   The sign + has its ordinary meaning.                                                    For   example     —

The 6ons of the man                         A   are identical with the sons of the woman                                          B,

                   the daughters together                              with         the sons of          A  —

     11.    The sign x              .

 226                  Proceedings of the Royal Society

vidually.       Consequently their arithmetical values may be different.
    12.   In this branch of analysis, order is essential.                The   operator
s2  is prior to s\         Hence the commutative law does not                  apply to

stands     in contrast      to    the    branch of analysis which         investigates
quality.       For in  the latter
                                           xy =  yx  .
    At  the same time         it   agrees   with    the Quaternionic     analysis,    fur
in it
                                          VI  =    <1P
is not true in general.           (Tait's "Quaternions," p. 37.)
    13.   I   may here quote a few sentences from a paper by the                   late
Professor Clifford, which throw light on this subject —
    " There     are two sides to the notion of a product.               When    we   say
2  x 3 = 6, we     may regard         the product 6 as a number derived from
the numbers 2 and 3, by a process                 in which they play similar     parts;
or we may regard         it  as   derived from the number          3 by the operation
of doubling.        In   the     former view,       2   and 3 are both numbers     ;   in
the latter view       3   is a number but 2 is an operator,             and the    two
factors      play very distinct           parts."      The   product  of two quality
symbols is of the former kind                 ;   the    product of two relationdtiI
symbols is of the latter kind.

                            smA =    B,              and              s„A = C        ,
then                                      B   =   8„-C       ,
and                                       C   = «„— B.
     The expression           tm— denotes         the relationship            of   sons of the same
father.
     Ifm     =    n,                              thenB = C.
     Thus the general analytical expression for brother includes oneself.

two given data which really afford                    a     conclusion.         Ho was accustomed

abbess        observed       that an elderly nun was often visited by                                a     young
gentleman, and asked what relation he was.                                     "   A      very near rela
tion,"        answered        the nun     ;
                                                  " his mother was my                         mother's         only
child."
      Let    G     denote the gentleman, and                 N   the nun.            Then the condi
tions given are—

      Since       8=1,                                           8g   =   1

      That        is,   the gentleman was the son of the nun.
 When the visitor             is   not said to he young, tho problem presents still
 greater      difficulty to the ordinary intelligence.

     This relationship can be expressed in nine other forms, each                                                   equi

         Curator of the Anatomical Museum of the University                            of
         Edinburgh.
     In   my former paper, read         before    the Society in June 1878,*              1
 gave an account      of observations which            I  had   made on the fungus
 disease affecting    salmon,     and  described      the character of the fungus.
 which I referred to Saprolegnia ferax.
     In the present communication 1 propose                    to   relate  additional
 observations,     and to discuss     the theories      which have been      advanced
 by different writers in explanation               of the    cause    of the   disease.
 Four theories       have   been    advocated,      namely — pollution of        rivers,
 overcrowding, absence of frost, diseased kelts and addled                  ova.
     In    reference  to  the    theory that pollution         is the cause of        the

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1878-79.                         233
fungus      disease of salmon and other fish in the rivers at present
affected    by it,  I  think it   is only necessary       to relate   the fact, that
diseased fish are found in those rivers many miles above all sources
of pollution, to prove that it cannot have originated from that cause.
In    the   Eden River, for twelve miles          above     Carlisle, a district in
which there is no big town or other sources of pollution, the fungus
disease has been found as deadly as below Carlisle after the sewage
of the city has entered        the river.      In   the  Tweed also, both trout
and      greyling,   which   are    non-migratory       fish,   have    been    found
affected    with fungus   where no source       of pollution    is known to exist       ;
for    I have obtained trout from near Broughtou, and greyling from
near      Stobo,   both of which       are   from seven      to   ten   miles   above
Peebles, the town highest up the Tweed.                    Mr Buckland        also,   in
 his Seventeenth        Report on the        Salmon     Fisheries,    England       and
 Wales, 1878, states "that we must look to other circumstances                        in
 order to diagnose the origin of the mysterious disease."
    The theory of overstocking          as the cause of the        disease has been
 advocated by Mr Buckland in            the same report.         He considers that
 "
    owing to the absence of freshes (spates) in a river, the spawned
 tish do not find their way to the sea, so that they accumulate in the
 pools in which the disease breaks out amongst them,                    as gaol-fever
 affected the crowded prisons in former times."
     In   May 1874 the Tweed Commissioners constructed                 a  small pond
 for experimental purposes,         which measured         36 feet by 16 feet, on
 the side of a small stream called Carham Burn, from which a run of
 water was supplied to the pond by a drain pipe.                      On   7th May
 1874, 130 sea-trout smolts, the average                length of each being           8
 inches, were taken from the Tweed and placed in this pond.                      After
 an interval of two years they were              specially examined, weighed,
 aud     measured on the 25th May 1876.              Seventy fish were found in
 the pond, the average length of each was 12£ inches; they were
 now in the whitling stage, and in fine condition.                    After another
 interval of two years there was another examination, when they
  were weighed      and measured      on   the 23d May 1878, when sixty-six
 sea-trout,    of the  average   length of 14      J  inches,   were   found in the
  pond.
      In the interval    between     the   examinations, and probably in the
  season    1876-77, the fish had spawned         in the pond, and       a numerous

  234                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 progeny of parr and orange-fins              were found along with them, all of
 the fish being in fine condition            — the kelts being well mended.             On
 25th      July of the     same year      they were,    on  the occasion    of  the   pond
 being cleaned, again weighed               and measured     ; they now averaged          15
 inches each.           They were again returned to the pond, and retained
 there     till the 2 2d of May 1879, when             thirty of them were marked
 with silver wires and returned to their native Tweed.
      It will    thus bo seen that sixty-six largo fish, whose united              length
 is    80    feet,   along with multitudes          of parr and orange-fins,         were
 cribbed, cabined, and confined for five years in a pond                       no larger
 than an ordinary dining-room, and remained in health                       during that
 period without           exhibiting     any signs of fungus disease, and this
although the pond is situated within                   a  few hundred yards        of the
Tweed — an          affected river.
     There can be no comparison,              I  submit, between a sahnon-pool in
a   river — where        the  full current of     the stream     flowing through the
pool provides for          a constant change       of water — with    a confined pond
fed only by a small pipe             of water and crowded with          fish ; and yet,
in     the latter, no disease         or death, other than that of kelts             after
spawning, has ever been detected.*
    *
        Since   this reference   to the   Carham pond fish was read to the Society, it
has been stated by Inspector Johnston of the            Berwickshire Police that several
fish had been found dead in the pond, which, in his opinion, had died of
fungus disease.         Those deaths, of which there can be no doubt, took place
between 11th February and 3d May 1879, embracing a period of eighty-two
days, during which five lish had been found dead in the pond by Mrs Robson,
the gamekeeper's wife, who fed them.               These fish were shown to Inspector
Johnston, who apparently paid official visits to the pond, and from the appear
ance of the fish he concluded they had died of fungus disease.            I do not accept
.Mr Johnston's opinion on this point.           He was well aware that I was engaged
in a scientific investigation of the disease ; indeed he had, by order of Mr List,
chief-constable,       caught in the Tweed and forwarded to me several salmon to
aid me in my research.         It is singular then, that, knowing the interest I took in
the pond lish, he was silent, and did not at the time report upon the disease,
which, according to his version, had existed in the pond for eighty-two days,
a period of sufficient length for the fungus to have destroyed the fish, both
root and branch ; also, according to his own statement, no one saw the dead
fish, with the exception of himself and Mrs Robson, and probably Mr Robson,
the gamekeeper;          and, consequently,   there is no scientific evidence that the
cause of death was Sairrolcynia ferax ; and, to quote the words used by Mr List
in a letter to me of 21st June,
                                        " if Saprolcgnia ferax had been in the pond,
it must have been seen on the fish on the 22d May, when we saw every one of
them." Taking those facts into consideration,            1 adhere to my statement that

                        of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                         235
    The theory of absence of frost is also advocated                   by  Mr Buckland,
on the ground          that the frost kills the spores of the fungus, and
prevents them from germinating.
    Now,     if this  were the      case,   there   ought to have been no disease
during the past winter, as the severe and long-continued frost should
have     killed the    spores.     But    we know       that the disease has been of
a most      virulent    character     in the Eden, Tweed, and other affected
rivers.      But, further,     I may    add    certain definite facts which show
that the       disease    may     spread    even     where    a  river is coated      with
ice.
    On 5th February         I  received from       J.  Dunne, Esq., chief-constable
of Cumberland           and Westmoreland,           four salmon which wero taken
alive from the river            Caldew, and, along with              them,  a  report by
Inspector       John Nicholson, who           observed     them for a period of nine
teen days.         Annexed is a copy of Inspector Nicholson's report.

     "Sir, — I     beg most      respectfully to inform you that on the l6th
 of last    month five salmon were seen by me in a pool in the river
 (jildew, at Holme         Head Bridge, ono of which had a small white
 mark on the end of its nose, and which                 I thought     showed symptoms
 the case of   the Carham ixjnd fish fully proves that overcrowding is not the
 cause of fungus disease.
    On the other side of the question — The pond-fish had been at least ten times
 specially examined during the five years they had been detained in it.              By in
 vitation of the chairman, I was present on two of those occasions, along with
 members of the experimental committee,            Mr List the conductor of the experi
 ment, a number of other gentlemen             and practical fishermen, and it was a
 matter of surprise to all present that the fish were found in such fine condition.
     At the final examination, which took place on 22d May 1879, I was pre
 vented from being present, but arrangements            were made that if any tish were
 found bearing marks of the disease they were to be transmitted to me.                   On
 the following day Mr List wrote to me that the
                                                           " fish were in splendid condi
 tion for   kelts, not the slightest sign of disease on any one of them."
     It is well known among taxmen, practical fishermen, bailill's, and anglers,
 that it is usual to find dead and dying salmon           and sea-trout in rivers every
  season after they have spawned.          This  kind   of  mortality has been observed
  and written about for upwards of two hundred years.              Isaac Walton mentions
  this as well known in his time, aud there is no reason why the Carham
  detenus should be an exception        to this rule, seeing they had spawned twice
  or thrice  during their detention.

uf fungoid disease.                    I   removed          other two salmon              on the 19th        of
the same month from the mill-dam                                   at Holme        Head, and put       them
into the same pool for safety (they having been left nearly dry),
making a total of seven salmon.                                  On the following day        I   noticed       a
second marked on the dorsal                             fin.      Since the last mentioned            date     I
have not been able to see them distinctly,                                in   consequence of the pool
being       frozen       over with              ice,     until      yesterday.        I    noticed     three
salmon affected out of the seven, and in a much worse condition —
being    all marked                from head to tail                ;    and this morning,       on again
examining them,                I   found the fourth slightly affected, making now
only three out of the seven clear of the supposed disease. — I                                          am,
Sir, your most obedient Servant,
                                                                  " John Nicholson,         Inspector.

  Each of the salmon mentioned                                  in Nicholson's report        had     a label
attached to            it,   stating       when       it    was free of fungus,           and when first
observed to be affected, as follows                         :   —

  No.       2.     A   large male, 30 lbs. —
                                                               " Was      free of fungus on the 16th
January, and was seen to be slightly affected on the 20th January."
  No.       3.     A   female, 14 lbs.           — "Was           free of fungus on 20th January,
and was observed to be affected on the 2d February."
  No.       4.     A   male kelt,          9   lbs.   — "Was        free of fungus on 2d February,
and was observed to be affected                             with fungus        on the 3d (or following
day."
  All       those       salmon         were       carefully examined             — both     anatomically
and     also       microscopically.                   They were found to be affected with
Saprolegnia ferax in various degrees of intensity over the whole
body.  The viscera and organs of generation were perfectly normal,
and     a   number of valuable                         preparations         have    been added to the
Museum which were prepared from them.
   Inspector Nicholson's observations                               are very valuable,       showing not
only the sudden attack                         and rapid growth of the fungus upon                       the
lish, but also that frost and ice have no effect in either checking                                       or
destroying         the growth and spreading                         of the plant, as has been         stated
by Mr Buckland.                     The salmon                 noticed    by Inspector      Nicholson        to

                        of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                           237
be free    of disease       on 20th January was           a    female,   and was frozen
over    for twelve days — from 20th January to 2d Febrnary                         — during
which      period she had been attacked by the                       fungus, which        had
spread     over her from head to tail.            It  is also worthy of remark that
this fish had spawned while                 under the ice.         Some    of  the ripe ova
were     found loose in the abdomen              when     I    opened her for examina
tion, and from the fact that one of the males frozen over along with
her was       in  a   condition     to   impregnate     the     ova, thousands of them
may have been           fertilised.
       The fourth theory, that the kelts are diseased, and                         in conse
 quence are first attacked by the fungus, and communicate                           it to the
 clean fish,       I  conceive     to be no better founded             than the theories
 of pollution, overcrowding, and absence                    of frost.       In support of
 this opinion        I  quote from       Mr Buckland's report,           page   1 1, a  state
 ment by Inspector           John   Nicholson of the Eden district, in which he
 says — "That         the total number of fish buried by the police since the
 1st of    March last is 1451.             Between Armathwaito             and    Sandsfield
 there     were buried          1271   salmon,   40   brandlings        or   parr, and    140
  fresh water trout           (Salmo fario), and in tidal waters of the river
  100 salmon.          The greater part of the 1271 above mentioned salmon
  were clean      fish, having every appearance of having died of the dis
  ease   so   prevalent in the Eden at the time              ;  about 50 were found at
  the river side     in   a dying state, which were        killed    and buried.       About
  200 were       unclean salmon or kelts, which showed no symptoms of
  the disease ; the        brandlings and trout were all diseased."                 Wo   have
  in this report evidence, and that on a large scale, that of the salmon
  buried by the police          in the Carlisle district about 1000 affected with
  fungus     disease were clean fish ; the         200    kelts were not affected by
  the disease.         Again, since     I  began to investigate the fungus disease,
   I have    received,     either from the Tweed or the rivers draining into
   the  Solway,      16   salmon,    9  of which     were      clean   fish.    The addled
   ova suggestion        is scarcely worthy of notice.              There is no evidence
   that a salmon        redd has ever been seen in any river in a state of
   fuugoid growth, or that the fungus,              if  so grown, is the Saprolegnia
  ferax.       Further, there is no evidence            that the fungus which grows
   upon the carcases         of dead kelts, which hitherto have been allowed
    to rot  in the river, is the Saprolegtiia ferax.                 The statement that
    this form of disease has been known in the Tweed for fifty years,

  238                  Proceedings of        the  Royal Society
 has, so far as       I  know, not been supported by scientific evidence,
 and rests mainly on the recollections of old anglers                    and     fisher
 men.
     I shall  now proceed        to relate    observations on the disease          as it
 has shown       itself upon the         salmon and other fish of the river
 Tweed.
     On 12th April         1879,    I  received   from G. H. List, Esq.,          chief-
 constable     of Haddington          and Berwickshire,      three   salmon,     which
 were taken alive from the Tweed on                 11th April.     They    were cap
 tured at Cornhill boat fishery, near Coldstream.                 All  the fish were
 extensively affected        with fungus on all parts of their bodies               and
 fins.
    The fungus is identical with that found upon the salmon                         and
 other fish of the Solway rivers described by me in 1878.
    No.   1, a female salmon.       — This fish     was in the act of spawning
 when captured      ;  complete     dehiscence   of  the ovaries had taken place,
and     the  greater    part of the ova were shed, about six             ounces,     by
 measure, being retained          in  the   cavity of the abdomen.          The ger
minal membranes           of the ovaries        were   plentifully supplied        with
germs for the following season.
    The condition       of this fish as a spawning baggit was very              good ;
the    skin, where      not   covered     with fungus, was clear and         silver}" ;
the gills were high coloured and free from parasites               of any kind;      all
the viscera     were healthy, and a fair amount of fat adhered to the
stomach      and   pyloric     c;uca.    Blood    taken from      the   heart, liver,
spleen, and kidneys          was    carefully examined under the        microscope,
and was found to be perfectly normal.                The lower part of the       intes
tine was filled with       a  semi-transparent mucus of a pale rose colour,
in which bacteria were very numerous.                  Two tape-worms of          large
size filled a considerable        portion of the intestine with their plicated
folds.
    This salmon had       over a dozen large patches of fungus adhering               to
it;  one of them was 4 inches long by 3 inches broad, and was felted
to   one-fourth of an inch            in thickness in the centre,         forming      a
limpet-like     crust of     a  slatey-grey    colour.    On careful removal          of
those patches of fungus, in most instances only                a discoloured     mark
corresponding to the patch was seen adhering to the outer surface of
the scales, which        were   in their normal position       ; but in several      of

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1878-79.                      239
the     thickest patches some of the scales were loose, and an extravasa
tion of blood had taken place            within   the dermal sacs.        On micro
scopical      examination     of this blood it       was    observed to be quite
granular, containing        no discs, and was freely mixed with         oil globules.
The under surface          of the skin opposite to the patches where the
scales were loose         was inflamed and discoloured          over an area larger
 than where        the scales were loose, the tendinous attachment of the
 muscles to the skin         was    intact, and the muscles        themselves    were
 uninjured in any way.
       No. 2, a male kelt. — This salmon had twenty patches of fungus
 on its body and fins, and its mouth was               quite filled with it.       The
 fungus on this fish was           very rank    ; several   patches    were felted to
 five-eighths of an inch in thickness.             The felting is caused in the
 first place by the filaments being twisted upon themselves                 and over
 lying each         other, which      prevents the spores       escaping    from the
  zoosporangia       at the apex of the     filaments in which they germinate
  and grow, and          by the filaments sending out innumerable delicate
  fibres, which are woven by their own growth and the action of the
  water into a thick mat,         in which    the detritus of the river becomes
  embedded.          The blood, mucus, and fiecal matter of this fish were
  examined        in the same way as in the female,              showing the same
  results.       Several teniie were found in the          intestine, otherwise the
   viscera were quite healthy.
        No.   3,  a kipper   grilse. — This salmon had twenty-four            separate
   patches of fungus on its body, fins, and head,                also  a large   patch
   seated on the mucous fold of the mouth, and                involving both     upper
   jaws and palate, which would cause difficulty of breathing, and the
   growth continuing would cause death from suffocation.
         This fish    looked a decided       kelt, and was labelled       as  such   by
    Inspector Johnston         of Coldstream.         However,      on   opening    the
    abdomen       I  was   surprised to find that the testes were not fully
    developed.       The pyloric     caeca  and intestines were loaded with fat,
    and all the viscera were in a healthy condition, and, on the most
    minute and careful examination, nothing               indicating disease of any
    of the organs could be detected.           Externally this fish    was disgusting
     to  look   On, as,  in addition    to the numerous patches         of fungus on
     its body, several cicatrices on the head from former injuries gave               it
     a most    repulsive expression.
            vol. x.                                                           2 i)

  240                  Proceedings of        the    Royal Society
      I   also examined two salmon            taken at Berwick-on-Tweed,                at one
  of  the Berwick      Fisheries    Company's stations, situated in the                     tide
  way about one mile from the            sea.      One of those salmon            I  received
  from Sir Robert         Christison,     the other from            Mr G. L.         Pauline,
  secretary    to the Berwick       Fisheries       Company.         Both of those           fish
  were affected     with fungus, and       were injured about the head and fins
  in  a similar manner to those          taken miles above the tide-way;                     the
  fungus also presented all its characteristic features.                  Both    specimens
  were maiden salmon,        and in excellent condition.                 They were        both
  cooked,     and were partaken of by sixteen persons, twelve of                       whom
  were    fully informed that   the fish were affected with fungus, four per
  sons were not informed       until after they        had digested it.        The   former,
  myself included, all say that they knew no difference                    in  either taste,
  colour,    or smell from fishmongers' salmon             ;  the latter say that        I am
 only trying their nerves         in saying the fish had fungus                  disease, as
  thoy had never eaten better.
     I   have    also examined two other salmon,                   both of which         were
  maidens.       They were both from the Tweed river.                        One    was pre
 sented to me by       Mr  Speedie,     gamekeeper        at the    Inch, who      saw it in
 a  dying state and pushed it out of the river with                   a stick.     This   was
 a  beautiful salmon, with only a few patches                    of fungus     on its body
 and     tail, which were easily rubbed off, leaving only a slight                      stain
 of a brassy hue          where    they were seated,             and with the          scales
 intact.      A  very large patch was seated within the mouth, involving
 both the upper and lower jaws, the palate                    and mucous fold in           the
 upper part of the mouth, and extending to the gills, which                             were
 also   thickly studded with parasitic crustaceans, from                    the combined
 effects of which it was dying of suffocation.
     The other salmon was presented to me by Arthur Campbell,                           Esq.,
 Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh.                It    was captured        in  the Tweed at
 Maxtou.        This fish   was a maiden            salmon,     in high condition,        and
 exceedingly fat and firm.           It   was     injured     about the forehead          and
 nostrils from fungus having been seated upon them.                           The    frontal
bones were exposed, and appeared as                if corroded     by friction, and       the
skin around this part had begun                to slough      ;  no fungus adhered           to
the bare part of the         bone, but the          loose    skin surrounding it         was
thickly     coated with it.   There were        a  number of patches of fungus             on
its body and tins, but no sloughing had taken place under them.                               I

have    injected and preserved           the stomach       and pyloric caica of this
fish as examples of those organs in a high conditioned fish.                          It  was
cooked, and       several    gentlemen who partook of it pronounced it
excellent.
    By the kind attention of James Tait, Esq., of Kelso,                       I received    a
common river-trout         and a minnow, both of which                      were   captured
near Kelso Bridge        in Tweed river      ; both specimens were affected with
fungus — the Saprolegnia ferax.                I may here mention that               I  have
noticed     several   able    letters which have          appeared       in  the Scotsman
newspaper      from time to time, in which               the    writer states that the
fungus is only a secondary           attack, and that a primary disease of an
inflammatory        kind first     affects   the  head      and other parts of the
salmon      before   the   fungus can settle        upon it.           I   do   not for an
instant doubt the fact that the writer saw fish with sores of the
kind described       by him upon them, when there was no fungus pre
sent to cause them.          I  can only say that, among              all the lish which
I   have    received    for examination, consisting of                salmon,     sea-trout,
smolts, common         trout, greyling, and minnows,              I  have     not seen one
 with a sore on         which     this fungus      was      not     present;      while on
 every fish     examined there          were   some    patches        of fungus which
 could easily be wiped off, leaving only a slight                    stain, and in some
 instances no mark could be discerned,              and no loosening and shed
 ding of the scales       or ulceration of the subjacent surface.                    Again,
 in every instance where the fungus was                      rank, long-seated,          and
 felted, sores   in every    degree, from slight abrasion to sloughing, were
 found under them.          With     reference   to the trout and the minnow
 before mentioned,       the trout had fungus seated upon the gums of
 both the upper and lower jaws, which               involved both the teeth and
 lips, and had spread       upward and backward upon the head, and its
 destructive    progress     could be easily traced           : first, the     skin of the
 lips was broken       in  several     places, and shreds          of it were hanging
 loose, to   which the fungus was adhering             ;   while,     as  it  spread back
 ward    over the nostrils        and crown of the head, the skin and its
 pigment     spots   could still be seen intact where the fungus was
 seated,  a  portion of which had been carefully shed aside to expose
 the skin.     On each of the pectoral            fins    a   patch of young fungus
  was seated,  and the mucous coat was seen through the fungus to be
  quite entire ;   the same appearance         was seen upon the anal fin and

242                         Proceedings          of    the    Royal Sociefy
scaled       parts    of the body.               The     minnow         had only one patch                   of
fungus upon           it,   which was seated within its mouth on the inner
margin of the right lower jaw;                           it   filled    the    mouth, which                was
distended by its growth                ;      and every other part of its body was                         free
from fungus or blemish of any kind.
     The reason why most of the fish affected                              with fungus           are first
attacked by          it   upon their heads may arise from various causes.                                   All
river fish present their heads to the downward current of the water
whether they arc swimming                         or    at    rest, and as the spores              of      the
fungus are floating down with the stream, the heads of the fish                                             are
the first parts           to come        in    contact       with and         be affected by them.
Further, the mucous glands are most numerous and active upon                                               the
head of the fish, which                  is    also    more     thickly       covered     with     mucus
than other parts of the body, and the spores which fall upon                                                 it
adhere more readily             ;     and the fins and tail, from their continuous
waving motion, arc more liable to arrest the passing spores than                                           the
parts of the body from which                           they spring, and, from this                 cause,
are generally affected sooner than the bodies of the fish.
     The numbers of the dead and dying fish of all kinds removed from
the river Eden in 1878                   by the police, and published by Mr Buck-
land in his report for that year, show that there were 1271                                     salmon,
140 fresh-water trout, and 40 brandlings or parr, being over 50                                    of      the
large fish to every one               of    the smaller.            About 1000 of           the salmon
were clean fish, and            it    may be inferred that the trout and parr were
also clean, which              goes far to show that the                  so-called       disease    is     as
much     a   mechanical         as   a     functional        one.      Further, from documents
descriptive of the effects of the disease in the river Tweed,
                                                                                                   by in
                                                                                                           the
lower district, during this season 1879, which were collected                                              the
police from taxmen and practical fishermen                              on the river,    I     find that
the proportion of large fish affected, dead or dying — namely, salmon
and     sea-trout     —   is    very great            compared         with     the      smaller      fish,
which wero found to be affected                          in   a     similar way.         The     smaller
fish    alluded to consist of river-trout,                        greyling, smolts, perch,             and
grey mullet.
     From observation of the fungus and of the fish affected by                                        it, I
am     led to believe that the so-called                     salmon disease does not             depend
upon    a    pre-diseased            condition        of the fish.        It    is   a   true parasitic
attack to which every tish in any affected river seems to be                                       liable,

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1878-79.                               243
as every      kind of fish, irrespective of condition,               appears     to be    a
proper     nidus for     the propagation of the Saprolegnia              ferax when a
living spore from that fungus attaches               itself to it.      While engaged
during the spring and summer in the microscopic examination of the
Saprolegnia ferax,          I observed      that as the season advanced many of
the patches       of fungus   seated upon the fish were barren, consisting of
spear-shaped        filaments only, having no zoosporangia              at their apex,
and consequently they produced no zoospores                    ;  the filaments were
long and very thin, and almost void of protoplasmic contents,                        indi
cating     that   the plant was losing its force and        in    a state  of decay.
    The Saprolegnia ferax, in all probability,                is always present         in
our rivers      in  more or less active condition.          It   is believed that this
fungus has two modes of reproduction, namely, by oospores and by
 zoospores.       The oospores        are few   in number, and may            be looked
 upon     as    ova,   and they require sexual impregnation.                    They are
 called    resting spores,      from a belief that they remain dormant in
 the water for an indefinite            period, which may continue for many
 years ; and during         this phase of their life they may germinate                  in
 limited numbers, providing only for the continued existence                       of the
 species.       While in this        state   of abeyance    there     is no plague       of
 {vragus,    from the ova only producing neutral or barren plants, which
 bear no     fruit or   seed.     After  a period,  of longer     or shorter duration,
  a  season, or a series        of seasons, may follow, during which an un
  known      influence arises,       which    acts  upon the resting spores,            by
  which     they are stimulated to great reproductive energy                  ;  and the
  plants they produce being           fruitful, the asexual mode of reproduction
  commences.
     The zoospores are produced in podlike cases called zoosporangia,
  which are situated at the apex            of the filaments,      and may be looked
  upon as     fruit or    seed.    They are the ciliated spores, and are the
  media     by which the         fungus is communicated to the               fish.    The
  zoospores are produced          in   great numbers, each zoosporangium con
  taining from 100 to 150 of them.               The oospores or ova are produced
  in a globular sac, which forms at the root ends                 of the filaments, or
  upon  the roots themselves.            Those sacs are called oogonia, and each
  sac contains a few oospores           or ova, three or four, to nine, being the
  numbers      I have observed       in the four instances    in which      I have    seen
  them,   in the whole      course of my investigations.

   244                     Proceedings            of the Royal Society
      Suppose an oospore              (resting spore)          to be capable      of producing,
   under favourable circumstances,                   a   plant carrying 100 filaments,             and
   each   of    the filaments to produce              100 zoospores,       10,000 germs would
   be derived from a single ovum or resting spore, every one                               of    those
  germs being capable of producing a plant as productive as that from
   which      it derived its         existence,         a   multiplication     of innumerable
   millions would be produced in                   a  few days, the ciliated spores being
  as  plentiful in the water             as  snow-flakes are in the air during               a snow
  shower     ;   and in this way the plague of fungus, the fco-called salmon
  disease, is originated.
      I  obtained in April the living fungus from a greyling caught by
  Mr    J. Willins,       student of medicine, when angling in Keerfield Pool
  in the Tweed, near              Peebles.        It   had    been cut     in two     halves and
  the tail portion selected            ;  it  was      packed in       a tin  vessel    with wet
  moss, which had preserved                  the fungus        in  active vegetative      growth,
  when     I   received     it  on the     morning after its capture.               A   pale pink
  bloom was          plainly      visible     over the       whole surface      of   the matted
  fungus, and, when it was held up between the eye and the light,                                   a
 new growth appeared to cover the older fungus                            on  its outer surface
 to about one-eighth of an inch                   in   height.
     When examined under                     the    microscope       in water,     free ciliated
 zoospores,        which       had escaped          from the zoosporangia            situated      at
 the extremities of the               filaments,         were   observed     in motion — they
 moved in          a  fitful way, by short jerks, not by                  a continuous move
 ment.
     Those zoospores             wore    pyriform         in  shape    during the short        time
 they were observed              in motion      ;  on becoming stationary the cilia dis
appeared, being probably withdrawn                           into the body of the            spore,
which then assumed                a globular form.            This    change   took place in        a
very short time            — not     exceeding         ten    minutes, — and while under
observation minute projections became                            visible on the edge of          the
spore, which           grew     into delicate         filaments of considerable            length.
I   have succeeded          in fixing      the development of the fungus in this
state, and       it  can be seen       in various          stages of growth, all of which
were ciliated spores             within    the space       of  one hour.
    This,      the    asexual      mode       of propagation, is remarkable for                 the
rapidity with which it is accomplished. A few of those                                    ciliated
spores become attached to any part of either a healthy or a                              diseased

                          of Edinburgh,       Session 1878-79.                             245
fish ;   in one hour the cilia will havo             disappeared       and a filament        of
some     length      will  have sprouted from the spore.               Thus, in     a  single
day, a fish, on         which no fungus could            be discerned,       is to-morrow
seen    to be affected, and in three days is spotted                    or patched over
with fungus from head to tail.
    In the second or sexual             mode     of production        of spores a short
pedicle      is pushed out from        one of the sides       of   a filament on which
a   globular       sac — oogonium — is formed, and           within this       sac a num
ber of oospores            are produced,     which are spherical in shape                  and
have a      cell wall or     envelope,   and some are provided with               a nucleus
in the centra            These, after impregnation, escape from the oogonia,
and are probably capable               of living in the water for an indefinite
yieriod,      in   a   dormant or resting state, until the conditions                     arise
which are favourable for their germination.
     It  may be asked, how does the fungus affect the fish, and do any
 recover from its effects         ?  The fungus produces a local irritation and
 inflammation of the integument, as is evidenced by the conges
 tion, and even           ecchymosis of the true skin, by abrading of the
 scales, and       in the    more   advanced     stages by ulceration          and   slough
 ing, affecting        the whole thickness of the integument and mucous
 surface.
      Wherever the fungus adheres and spreads,                     the  function       of the
  skin is necessarily        interfered with.       Light, which is       so essential        to
  the fish in promoting          its pigmentary secretions,           is cut off from          a
  large   portion of its skin.        Eudosinosis, exosmosis,          and the secretion
  of the mucus          for lubrication     are destroyed, and in this way con
  stitutional      symptoms       would be occasioned          which,      if   the   disease
  continued, lead to the death of the fish.
      The second question,          Do any fish       recover    from fungus attack             1
  may now be          answered more hopefully.           The fishermen and watch
  men on the        Tweed report having seen several tish with new skin
  growing over the sores upon their bodies,                 from which          this fungus
   had disappeared,        and   I am  inclined    to believe that this is            so.     A
  male    kelt has been sent to me by Mr List, which was taken in tidal
   water below       Berwick bridge.      This fish is   2 feet   in length,     and weighs
   about    three or four pounds ;         it is  supposed     to have      been affected
   with fungus, aud to have completely recovered                   from its effects.        No
   particle    of fungus could be found upon any part of its body, and

246                     Proceedings of         the   Royal Society
there was only one raw sore.                This    sore was only       jjths of an         inch
in length and $ths in breadth.                 It had    evidently been larger,              and
had a smooth healing border.                  All the     upper surface       of the       head
and snout were covered with skin, but very uneven over its whole
surface,       from depressions        and projections         which     may have          been
caused by sores which have been healed over, and the                            hinder       part
of the operculum had an irregular cicatrix of considerable size upon
it.      Tho breast and belly, from the gill coverts to the vent,                          were
blond-streaked and spotted, and there were brownish                           marks       upon
both its back and sides            as if fungus      had recently adhered to it.              All
the fins wore entire, — not one ray was                  broken    ;  and the fish         as a
whole looked            remarkably      well      for a kelt, and        if it had         been
affected      with fungus, which         I   fully believe, its       recovery     has     been
almost perfect.
     A     salmon     taken at some distance up the river, and which                            is
 affected with fungus, has been taken down                     to Berwick        and   placed
 in    a box or corve, and is now anchored               in  the river,    in  the tideway,
 where the water is at all times less or more salt, and at intervals is
 towed out to         sea, where    tho  full influence of      the salt water acts upon
 it  ;   and when      I  last heard of    it considerable improvement            had taken
 place.       Mr G. H. List        has paid particular attention to the detection
  of any fish being affected with fungus disease in any of the                            coast
  lishing stations;         and, after tho most careful inquiry, no trace of any
  lish in tho least degree diseased at any of those stations could                             be
  got, nor, as far as any fishermen either knew or heard of, was any
  salmon with fungus upon it over seen in salt water.
       I  have tried to propagate       this fungus upon dead flies, spiders,               and
  other      small      animals,    following       tho   directions      of    Pringsheim,
   " N. A. A. L. C,"           1851, p. 417,* who         says—"     All    that is  required
   to obtain a      living    specimen    of this singular plant is to allow                  the
   body of any small animal, such as                a fly or spider, to float for        a few
   days in rain water exposed to the light.                  By this method         a crop of
   Saprohgnia         may be obtained at any season."               In this     way   I   got a
   fungus upon tho flies and spiders after an exposure                      of from     twelve
   to twenty days, which on examination was found to be                           a common

            exactly similar to that produced upon                a solution    of gum-
           gelatine, and meat infusions.           I  have tried to propagate the
                   fungus      upon minnows,       but without success hitherto,
                           the method adopted did not provide the proper
                    being awanting       the necessary    stimulus which exists in
      river, or, what is more         likely, the life of  the fungus itself.       The
minnows were placed             in a large glass vessel filled with town water
from the tap.           A  piece of   skin with this fungus adhering to it was
taken from a        salmon smolt and placed in the water along with them.
In   three days they had eaten up both             skin and fungus, and remained
unaffected.        Several large      patches of this fungus were then taken
from the skin of a salmon and placed               in  the vessel along     with  them.
In   a few days      it had all disappeared, and produced no          effect.  Another
method was suggested             by Mr G. H. List, who        also  kindly furnished
      with material for the trial.             Pieces of skin with this fungus
growing upon them were cut from the bodies of dead                      salmon at the
river side, and were put into wide-mouthed                 bottles, which      were   at
once     filled  with river water, the skin not being allowed to dry.
On receipt       of the bottles the pieces of skin, along with the water in
which they were brought, were emptied into                    the vessel among the
minnows.          The water in      the vessel was not changed for three days,
at the end       of which time the minnows were still unaffected.                 Fresh
water was then put in the vessel, and the pieces of                  skin retained in
the water, which was changed every second day for eight days.
The minnows were not disturbed by the pieces of skin.                              They
nestled under them and nibbled every morsel of fungus from them,
hiding and playing about them               until they had     to be removed from
putridity.        All    the minnows       are  still alive and     are in    beautiful
condition, taking food greedily, worms cut small and crystals of
sugar being       their favourites.       They have been kept since 14th May
till now, 12th        July, and    are as healthy and      lively   as   when put in
the vessel.
    I   have received from Thomas            Key, Esq., Fellow of this Society,
somo     information respecting a disease affecting the 6almon in Lewis
some      years ago, which, from the sores of the skin of the head,
resembled at a first glance a condition                not unfrequently       found on
salmon       affected   with Snprvlegma.         After examining my         specimens,
 Mr Key wrote to me the               following account of the         disease   in tho
        vol. x.                                                             2 k

248                  Proceedings       of the Royal        Society
Lewis, which is of so much interest in connection with this subject
that   I append    it  to my communication         : —
    " From what       I  saw and heard from you,          I am convinced           that     tin,
disease   from which the salmon in the Grimasto                         river    in    Lewis
suffered some eleven years ago differed from the one you                           are now
investigating.       In   the first place, we had no trace of fiinyits, —thn
affection was confined to the head, and although it destroyed many
fish yet very many recovered           from it.      It attacked the fish in               the
sea, or,  according to my theory of its origin, in the brackish water
between    the sea and the mouth of the river.                  It  assuredly had          not
its origin in the river, or in the loch above                 it.     There are many
brown trout in our rivers and lochs, and none of them suffered.
Neither among the multitudes of sea trout about us did                          I  see    one
affected.     The disease     I am   speaking of appeared about the middle
of the season of       1 868.    As happens frequently in the Lewis, the
months of May and June had been very dry, and for weeks                               before
rain came, somc time late in          July, the fish had not           been able to get
up the river in consequence           of want of water at its mouth.                     We
were told that many fish had been found dead                   in   the bay, and after
rain had fallen and we were able to fish in the river and lochs,                           we
 then saw the nature and extent of the disease.                      Fish    were found
dead and dying        in the river     and   at its mouth ; others not too far
gone, took the fly, and were           caught.      On the dead fish examined
the whole of the         upper part of the head was found covered witli
ecchymosed      spots and ulcerated,       the ulcers more         or less superficial,
and some     with   everted edges.        In  some the      cartilages      of    the nose
had been attacked, and one side of it cut out as it were by                           a cor
roding sore.      When cut into, the bones and cartilages of the                       head
were found to be softened,          and thero were marks of inflammation                    in
the brain and membranes.             The eyes were natural, the gills pallid
but otherwise sound,          and   none    of the fins      affected.        In    the far
advanced     cases,   among the fish caught,         the softened      appearance        was
very much the same, whilst            in those less diseased           the ulcers       were
few and small, the rest of the head being simply ecchymosed.                               In
a great many fish recovery          apparently soon commenced, the ulcers
began to cicatrise,       and the fluid in the ecchymosed             spot was       almost
 altogether absorbed.         In  every case,    I    may   say,     we observed         the
 gill covers had     a  dull, white, leprous appearance, and in all the                  fish

that recovered the head was more or less white,                                and continued so
for years afterwards ; and even to this day, every                              now and then,           a
white head, as the gillies               called the diseased              fish,      comes       up from
the sea.
  "It     is a curious and interesting fact that the condition of the fish
was not affected       in    even the far advanced cases.                      Nutrition did not
appear to     have been interfered with.                       The body was as plump and
fat and the       pink colour      as high as usual.                I    did not eat of those
very far gone        in the    disease       ;    of    those less so    I   did     eat, and found
their flavour as         in the healthy                 salmon.     You will           observe      from
what     I have    said that our disease,                  whatever might have been its
cause, was a       disease of the head, and confined to the head.
  "So much for the form of our disease; now                                         as to its origin.
Whatever       may have been the predisposing or its immediate cause,
it is certain that the fish brought it with them from the                                    sea, or, as
in my opinion,           acquired it in the tide-way in Loch Roch-Roag.
They did not take            it down with them when they went to the sea                               as
kelts or smolts, but they brought          it up from the sea in summer                                as
grilse and fresh-run salmon.                      After    mature       consideration of all the
attendant       circumstances,           I       have    come to the conclusion that the
disease arose        from the fish being kept moving so long up and down
between the salt and brackish waters.                             With       each    flood    tide they
moved np        in   dense     masses toward the                  mouth of the river, vainly
looking       for water sufficient to carry them into                          it,   and,    when the
ebb came,       going down again for two or three miles into the deep
and comparatively              Salter    water.           This continuing for            weeks, with
the water       in the bay becoming daily                      more      shallow, the heat and
bright sun during the day was sufficient, in my opinion, to account
for the disease.         I     have      already said the           sea      trout did not suffer,
because    very little water was sufficient to take ^iem into the river,
and    they were kept outside for but       short time.  Again, the fish
                                                           a
in the Blackwater,            a   river within two miles of the Grimasto, had
no disease     — at   least, I    did not hear of any having been seen in                             it;
the reason, as       I   think, being that                at all. times, except in the lowest
neaps, the        tide came up so near its mouth as to allow the fish to get
 into its lowest pools without                    much difficulty.            Against        my theory
 there   is   this to be said     :     as already mentioned, the island                         of Lewis
 has been      subject within         the last fifteen            years, to my knowledge, to

the Lewis that year, and therefore       I  cannot   speak as to    the symp
toms   of that disease   ; but inquiry afterwards failed to         elicit any
evidence   that they resembled    the   outbreak of 1868.     .  .      It  may
be that the fish  in 1868   were in   some peculiar abnormal         condition
                                                    them to disease of the
before com ing up from the sea, predisposing
head ; but at any rate I can give no other cause for the outbreak
than those   I have mentioned."
3.   On the Form and         Structure of the Teeth of Mesoplodon
    Layardii and Mesoplodon Souvrbyii.              By Professor Turner,
    M.B.
   The author in the first instance dsscribed the characters of the
teeth of Menoplodon Layardii from two specimens which had been
collected during the expedition of H.M.S. "Challenger," under the
scientific superintendence of Sir C. Wyville Thomson.                 The one
specimen,   a young animal, under 14 feet        in length,   was obtained
at   Port Sussex,  East Falkland Islands,       by    Mr H.    2,f.   Moseley,
F.R.S.  ; the other,   an  adult skull,    was procured at the Cape          of
Good Hope.
    The teeth of the younger animal, two in number, were imbedded
in their alveoli in the lower jaw. Each tooth consisted of a small
triangular   denticle   or  crown   projecting     outwards,   and slightly
 upwards from the middle of the upper border of the fang. The
 denticle measured 4-10ths inch in its longer diameter, the fang was
 2 inches by 8-10ths.      At the base of the fang was a cleft 2-10ths
inch wide, which      communicated with a pulp cavity that was pro
 longed almost to the apex of the denticle.
    The denticle was invested by enamel,          subjacent to which was
a well-defined mass      of dentine, which      was prolonged as a thin
 layer almost down to the cleft at the root of the fang.             The fang
 was invested by cement, which was separated from the dentine

                      of Edinburgh,      Session   1878-79                    251
by an     opaque layer, consisting of a granulated matrix containing
numerous       branched     and anastomosing vascular         canals,  like    the
Haversian canals of bone.           A   similar layer was prolonged into the
pulp cavity, so as to line the dentine on its inner surface.                 This
layer   is apparently      to be regarded      as a modified form      of   vaso-
dentine.
    The teeth in the adult mandible were formidable tusks, which
curved    up the   sides  of  the beak on to its dorsum, where they decus
sated across     the   middle line.     Each tooth was 14 inches long, 1\
mches of which had protruded beyond the gum.                 It consisted of a
triangular denticle and a strap-shaped          curved shaft.     The denticle
was somewhat         smaller than in the young tooth, and the enamel
was almost entirely worn off its surface.           The size of the tooth was
therefore     due to the enormous         development     of the fang which
formed the strap-shaped shaft.            The shaft consisted for the       most
 part of a cortical layer of cement investing an opaque          central band,
which had the structure of the modified vaso-dentine of the younger
 tooth.     7-10ths of an inch from the summit of the shaft was a
minute     mesial chink     1-1 0th inch long, which represented      the    pulp
 cavity, but the rest of the shaft was solid throughout.           The summit
 of the shaft was more complicated in structure, and consisted from
 without inwards of the following layers :— cement, opaque modified
 vaso-dentine,    opaque     vaso-dentine, dentine, opaque      modified vaso-
 dentine.     When     traced from the summit to the sides         of the shaft
 the dentine and vaso-dentine disappeared,          and  then the two layers
 of modified vaso dentine blended with each            other and formed the
 opaque central band of the rest of the shaft.           The size of the fang
 is due    to the   great   growth of the cement       and the tissue     of the
 opaque central band.         The teeth of this specimen are larger than in
 any  of the previously        recorded specimens,    and the animal        from
 which they are obtained was probably an old male.
    The structure of the teeth of Mesoplodon Sowerbyii was examined
 from the skull described by the author in the " Transactions of the
 Royal Society, Edinburgh,"        1872,   vol xxvi.    Each tooth was later
 ally compressed,     and formed almost an equilateral triangle, and the
 crown was not separated        from the fang by any sharp line of demar
 cation.    The tooth consisted      in great part of dentine, which      in  the
 crown was invested by a layer of not very strongly marked enamel.

The dentine extended down the fang to the sides of the narrow cleft
at its base, which communicated           with the pulp cavity.      This cavity,
bounded by the dentine, was contracted at the base of the fang,
but dilated into      a considerable space in the body of the tooth.             The
fang was invested by cement, but between the cement and dentine
a layer      of modified vaso-dentine was situated which             increased      in
thickness in the lower part of the fang, whilst the dentine became
thin.     The structure of this tooth was then compared with that of
the adult Mesoplodon Sowerbyii described by Professor                   Ray Lan-
kester.*
     The te«th both of M. Layardii and Sowerbyii in their non-erupted
stage do not materially differ        in structure from the ordinary         human
or carnivorous teeth, for the crown is covered              by enamel,      and the
fang by cement, whilst the great body of the tooth consists of                  den
tine, in which is a well-marked pulp cavity.             The exceptional      struc
ture of these teeth       in  the  erupted stage is due to the disappearance
of the enamel from the crown, to the cessation               in  development      of
 the ordinary dentine, and to the excessive            formation    in  the adult
 Sotcerbyii of osteo dentine, and in Layardii of modified           vaso-dentine,
which cause the fang to assume unusual dimensions.

2.   Action of Heat on some Salts of Trimethylsulphine.                         By
        Professor Crum Brown and J. Adrian Blaikie, D.Sc.
        No.   IV.
    L The carbonate of trimethylsulphine             is obtained by the action
of carbonate     of silver   on the iodide of trimethylsulphine.         The solu
tion of the salt may be evaporated          to a syrup  in  the water-bath.     On
standing     for some weeks over        sulphuric   acid in vacuo it crystallises
out    in exceedingly hygroscopic prismatic crystals, containing water
of crystallisation,     and having a strong alkaline reaction.
    Heated     in the air to      100° the salt gives off water, sulphide of
methyl, and carbonic acid.            Heated in a sealed tube to 100° C. for
about eight hours        it was almost entirely decomposed,        gave off a gas
consisting     entirely of carbonic acid, and yielded two layers of liquid
 — the upper, sulphide of methyl ; the lower, water and methylic
 alcohol.      The decomposition is expressed by the equation —
                              +       =
            {(CH3)3}2CO3        H20      2(CH3)2S + CO2 + 2(CH3)OH         .
     II.  The metaphosphate of trimethylsulphine              is obtained by the
 action    of  metaphosphate     of silver on the iodide of trimethylsulphine.
 The metaphosphate          of silver was made from glacial metaphosphate
 of soda (Graham's salt) by precipitation           with nitrate of silver.     The
 metaphosphate         of trimethylsulphine       does  not crystallise,    but on
  evaporation     leaves    a colourless hygroscopic glass, containing         some
  water.
      The salt, when acted upon by heat, gives off sulphide of methyl,
  and the resulting product is at the same time decomposed,                  leaving
  free  metaphosphoric acid.         On further heat being applied the mass
  slightly chars.
      III.   The ferrocyanide of trimethylsulphine            is obtained by the
  action of ferrocyanide       of silver  on the iodide of trimethylsulphine.
  On evaporation       of the solution    the salt crystallises out   in pale-green
  transparent plates ; they are not hygroscopic, and the salt gives               all
   the reactions    of an alkaline ferrocyanide.       On drying over sulphuric
   acid  or phosphoric acid, the crystals lose their water of crystallisa
   tion.    Analysis leads to the formula {(CH3)3S}8Fe2Cy12             + 18H2O    .
      The salt when heated          to 220° C.    gives off sulphide of methyl
   along   with other products, including hydrocyanic           acid, but docs not

heated is carbonised,                 no definite compound being obtained.
     IV.    The ferricyanide of trimethylsulphine                                is    obtained       by    the
action of ferricyanide of silver on the iodide of trimethylsulphine.
On evaporation of the solution                              the    salt crystallises out in                pale
orange-yellow transparent plates, which effloresce in the air.                                             The
salt gives        all   the reactions              of   an alkaline ferricyanide.              On     drying
over phosphoric acid the crystals lose                             all their water of          crystallisa
tion.      Analysis          leads     to the formula {(CH3)3S}0Fe2Cy12+                             15HiO.
The salt when heated behaves similarly to the ferrocyanide.

          Ethylinethylethyl-sulphine.  By Professor Cram Brown

                                                    (Abstract.)
     It   seemed to the authors to be desirable to ascertain                                 the mode in
which       the    salts       of diethylmethyl-sulphine                      and ethylmethylethyl-
sulphine respectively decompose when heated.
     They prepared the iodides by the method                                  described by Kriiger,*
whose       observations on the iodides and chloroplati nates they                                      sub
stantially confirm.
     The benzoates were prepared from the iodides by action of                                     benzoate
of silver.         They are exceedingly soluble substances,                              and were       only
obtained      as    thick syrups.                   Heated to between                 110°   and     120° C.
they decompose              in exactly        the same way, yielding benzoate of methyl
without any benzoate of ethyl.

      Snow, Earth, Grease, &c.                             By Professor George Forbes.
     It   is well known that                 if    an ordinary fowling-piece, charged with
shot or ball, have touched the ground or snow, so as to close                                            the
muzzle of the gun, or                 if   the muzzle of the gun be                    in any      way arti
ficially closed with grease or other substances,                                 the fowling-piece          is
certain to burst at the muzzle when it is discharged.                                         This    would
not   be the ease            if,   instead        of firing   a   shot,   a   piston were driven           up
the tube by hand.                   In this        case   the compressed air would drive                 out

the opposing        plug, which       offers but a very feeble        resistance   to the
internal pressure.           These facts, thoroughly well authenticated, have
not, to my knowledge,             received    a satisfactory explanation, though a
clear idea     of the conditions of the             case is  all that   is required to
explain this, at first sight, anomalous               behaviour.
    The explanation lies in the fact that the charge travels along the
 bore   of the gun,       if   not with the same velocity          as, at least    with   a
velocity comparable           to, that of the transmission of pressure through
 the air, i.e.,    the velocity of sound.             Thus, as the charge advances
along    the barrel it is continually compressing the air immediately in
 front of it    ;  but this    pressure     gets   no relaxation by expansion into
 the front part      of the     barrel.    The compression,      of course, generates
 heat   in the air, which          increases the      velocity of sound through it.
 But this does not affect the question in its general bearings.                      It  is
 sufficient    to notice that the snow, &c., is driven out with the full
 velocity of the charge (neglecting the weight of the snow plug com
 pared   with that of the       charge).     But   before the plug can be driven out
 with this great velocity the pressure behind it must be very grout.
           Let m = the mass of the snow-plug.
                  g = the force of gravity.
                  v = velocity of the bullet or wad when close to the plug
                         (i.e., on leaving the gun).
                  p =the     pressure    of  the air driving out the plug.
                  A  = the sectional area of the bore.
                  b = the length of the snow-plug.
                  p = the density of the snow plug.
     The work done         in giving    to the mass m a velocity = v is
                                         w — -mv1.

   Thus, the pressure at the muzzle             of  the gun is independent        of   the
   diameter    of bore and length        of  plug.

duced     even   by   a    plug of snow or grease of the shortest             length
movable     inside the barrel with the greatest facility.           If the  velocity
of the ball or wad be less than that of sound the snow-plug is                    not
driven out quitu suddenly, and            if  the velocity be small enough the
snow-plug is driven out before the ball or wad reaches the                muzzle.

   I   know no more interesting problem in geology                 than the     ques

northern Europe into the condition in which it is now occupied by
man?      and     it  seems marvellous that geologists            should not yet be
agreed as to        what that     agency was.
     Our own country of Scotland is strewed                  with boulders, many of
immense size, and which we allow have                    been somehow       transported
to   their present sites from remote regions.                Rocks on our hill-sides
have      been     ground      down, smoothed,        and striated      by ponderous
bodies      which      have   come against and rubbed upon them.                 Almost
everywhere         there are deep beds of clay, sand, and gravel forming
 knolls and elongated ridges,              not only on low-lying         districts,  but
 even     on     our highest      hills.   These things        have   been    attracting
 attention       and provoking        discussions for more        than sixty      years  ;
 but no        explanation      has   yet been arrived at,        which    meets    with
 general acceptance.            Some     geologists   insist on the agency         of an
 ice-sheet,     like that in which Greenland         is wrapped     ; Others stand up
  for local glaciers, such as exist         in Switzerland and Norway.             Some
  suggest icebergs        and other forms of floating ice, in a sea which
  submerged        the country.        Each of these theories has its partisans          ;
  for no crucial       test has been discovered         to indicate which of them,
   or  whether any, is well founded.
      The Transactions and Proceedings of our Society contain many
   papers     regarding these phenomena.             Of    these papers,    the earliest
   probably was by        Sir James Hall,       so long ago as the year 1812, and
   he was     followed by M'Laren, Chambers, Fleming, and many other
   Fellows      of our Society, who specially devoted             themselves     to this
    branch    of geological research.
       The last paper published on this subject           in our Proceedings,    was by
    our colleague,    Mr David     Stevenson,    who described a portion of the hill
    in East   Lothian known        as North Berwick Law, which           was found by
    him to have been      ground down, smoothed, and striated.             These effects
    he ascribed to the agency of a glacier, which came from the westward
    ag&inst the    hill, first smoothing       the rocks on its north side       by the
    heavy pressure       of the ice, and afterwards scratching the smoothed
    surface   by hard stones incased in and protruding from one side of the
    glacier.   MrStevenson suggested that theglacier mighteven have been,
     wd probably was,         of such dimensions as to have             enveloped     thu
     whole   of the Law, which reaches a height above the              sea  of 612 feet.
       At the close      of his paper      Mr Stevenson        expressed     an opinion
          vol. x.                                                               2a

and      other places        ;    I    feel sure that       Mr Stevenson himself will                deem
these cases not the                    less interesting,       though      they should warrant
conclusions different from those he suggested.
                            L East Lothian Striated                      Rocks.
     The first of these which                  I    mention,   as    the least complicated,               are
in the village of Liuton.
     The rock is          a claystone         porphyry.        Several smoothed patches of
rock occur here, and two of these show striations on surfaces                                        from
3 to 4 square feet               in extent.
     One of these smoothed                    rocks is horizontal or nearly so                ; and on
it   the stria: have a direction                   W.N.W. and E.S.E.
     The other smoothed rock dips towards the north, at an angle                                          of
about 35°, and on                it,   the striae run due east and west.
     The difference          between the directions of the striae of these two
rocks,        which are only            a   few yards apart from one another,                     may      be
accounted            for by the fact that the same agent which produced                             striae
in   a   certain direction on                a     horizontal surface, would,           if   that agent
could be easily deflected, not produce striae in the same direction                                       on
a    sloping surface.             It would         have less power to move up an inclined
plane, but would move along                         it   more horizontally.
     What        the      striating         agent    was    here,    and in what direction                it
moved,         is    made        manifest by the following                 facts.       Both      patches
of rock were, when        examined them, still partially covered
                                  I                                                                   by   a
coarse clay, full of stones or pebbles, many of which were hard                                         and
angular, but some were soft.                          There were among them bits of                  coal
and limestone, which                        must     have     come      from      the westward,           as
in East Lothian there are no coal or limestone strata                                   to the     east   of
Linton.              In   one of the smoothed                 patches     there     were     two    small
hollows or depressions,                      which       had interrupted          the   continuity        of
some of the striae.                   These depressions on their inner surface                    showed
a    vertical wall on their west side, and                      a   sloping wall on their            east

side,  indicating that the smoothing agent had partially            entered the
hollow, and had worn down a portion of the east sida
   Assuming      that the    general courso of the striating agent hero was
fromW.N.'W.        towards E.S.E., it is quite intelligible that when this
agent,   if of a flexible   nature, impinged on a rock surface       dipping to
the north,     its direction would        change   so as to    bo  moro  to   the
eastward.
   There is another rock of larger dimensions about a mile to the
west of    Linton village,     on the line of the     North British Railway.
It  is about     25  feet   in length and about        18  feet  in height, and
                     EAST      <          s^aj     vtj     s^— --—      WEST
                      Fig I. — Rock  on Railway, near Linton.
  presents a surface nearly vertical.          It is on one side of a gully
  through which the railway passes, the rock being on the south side
  of the line.
      The rock was discovered and exposed to view, when an excavation
  for the railway was made         into  a  thick  bed of boulder-clay which
  occurred here.     The rock now seen had previously been entirely
  covered   by the clay.      With   the consent    and the assistance    of the
  railway authorities,    I had an additional portion of the rock at its
  west end   stripped of the clay, to the extent of several square yards,
  when more smoothing and striation was brought to light.
      Besides the rock which       forms the lowest      and  principal  part  of

 260                        Proceedings           of the Royal                Society
 the bank, there              is a small patch of rock, about 10 feet long by                                       4
 feet wide, at the top of the bank, also smoothed                                 and striated.
     Both rocks dip rapidly, the upper one at an angle of about 55J,
 the lower one             in its lowest part           is vertical.
     The principal               rock is    AB on         the preceding diagram (fig.                    I)   and
 the smaller is            CD.
     The dip of each is indicated by the section at one side.                                       The two
 rocks do not front exactly in the same direction.                                       The lower rock
 fronts N. 11° W. for two-thirds                            from its east end; but near its
 west end          it fronts about N.            30°    W.       The upper rock fronts about
 N. 34° W.
     The      striae     on both rocks are exceedingly numerous.                              There is not
 half a square inch on either without                               ruts or scratches.             Some of
 the striae on the larger rock are from 5 to 6 feet                                      in length,           and
 from     \   to    J an   inch in depth, and from                     2 to 3    inches wide.
     There         is,   however,     a   difference        in the depth of the striie which
 deserves notice and explanation.                           In the upper rock CD, they are
 much deeper and wider than they are generally in the lower                                               rock.
 But in       the lower rock, the grooves or ruts are deeper at the west end
 than towards the east.                    An explanation              is    suggested    by the way           in
 which the rocks front.                    If,   as the     rocks in Linton village indicate,
 the      striating        agent      came       from     W.N.W., the obstruction                        to its
 progress          eastward       would      be greater          by      a    rock facing N. 34° W.
 than by       a    rock facing N. 11° W.                      Hence to overcome that obstruc
 tion, more pressure                 by the striating agent would occur, and                         deeper
 ruts in the rock surface would be made in the former than iu                                                 the
 latter    case.
    It    may be mentioned,                that whilst generally the striae on the                        large
 rock     AB    are horizontal, near the                 top they rise           towards the         east      at
an angle of about 4° or 5°.                      It   may be supposed             that   if   the striating
agent consisted             of   a   mass of detritus, the weight of the mass would
keep      the striating tools in the low parts of the mass in                                 a   line   more
or less horizontal, but that at or near the top of the moving                                            mas?,
its component parts would rise, so                             as to   obtain    a   direction more            in
conformity with the normal movement                                 towards E.S.E.
    In    the upper rock,             CD,   there      is   a   vertical joint, as shown in                   Ike
diagram.            It   has had the effect of breaking                        the continuity of              the
striae.       The joint has           a    breadth        of    6   or   8     inches, forming       a    face

which frouts               N.N.K          There are no striae on this face, as                      a force
coming from             "W.N.W. would not strike                  on it.
   In      the lower rock there are small cavities or depressions                               (a, b, c)
in the general surface, in consequence of which the continuity of the
striae     has been interrupted.                 When       T   first examined the rock, two
of these cavities were filled with boulder-clay.                                  The west sides of
the cavities are vertical, but the east sides are smooth and sloping,
having apparently                   undergone attrition               by the       materials passing
over       them from           the west.             This point is further explained by
the section           EF    at the bottom of the diagram.
    Besides           the smoothed and striated rocks in Linton and near                                    it,
just described, there are cases of the same kind at the following
other places            in East Lothian,              all of which         I      have    examined      —
                                                                                                        :
viz., North           Berwick Harbour, Kingston, Dirleton, Redside, Balgone,
Whitekirk,             Smeaton, and Rhodea                   At    each of these           places    there
are      indications of         a    movement from the westward, in accordance
with what             is   shown by the Linton rocks, and also by the                          striae   on
 North Berwick Law,                  as   inferred by Mr Stevenson in his paper.
 I         have       also within the last             few days            had an opportunity               of
 visiting       North Berwick Law, and of                       seeing     the rock described by
 Mr Stevenson.                It    is   the only part of the              hill   on which    I      could
 find smoothing and striation                    ;    and   it   is   important          to notice     that
it    is   the    N.W. part of             the   hill on which those markings occur.
I   regretted to find, that since                Mr Stevenson's inspection and report
 in the year 1875, most of the smoothed                           and striated rock has been
 destroyed        by quarrying.             But      some parts remained            ;    and having         in
  my hand         a   photograph of the rock, which                   Mr Stevenson had kindly
 given      to me,     I     was at no loss           to see what had             been its principal
  features.       I        brought away          a   specimen         of   the    smoothed      surface,
  which          detached,         and on part of which stri;e occur.                       This     speci
      I I
  men        now      exhibit       to the Society.
  I        found      that    the    smoothed        surface generally dipped towards the
  N. or     N.W. at         an angle of from 65° to 70°.
      Parts of the smoothed surface faced                    N.W., other          parts faced various
  points towards            due N.        and even N. by E.           ;    but wherever the rock
   laced    a   more easterly point, there was no smoothing.                             The specimen
   on the    table shows these differences,                 because    it   has two faces meeting,
   forming an         angle between them, and fronting in diilerent directions.

262                  Proceedings        of the Royal Society
   The only parts of the smoothed               surface striated were those front
ing N.W. by N., or          a   few degrees on either side of that point
   The     striae  and ruts were          quite    as   numerous and         near    one
another as on the North British Railway rock.
   Their direction       was from        W. by     S.  or   W.S.W., and        most of
them were approximately horizontal
   Some of the ruts, especially at their west ends, were                  deep, show
ing,  as  Mr Stevenson         says, that the striating agent, whatever it          was,
must have pressed           on the rock       with   great   force.   Mr    Stevenson
also mentions another important               fact, which     I observed,   that   mine
of the ruts were inclined along the smoothed face up towards                         the
east at angles of from 4° to 20°.

                    Fig. 2.  — Part of I!ock, North Berwick Law.
   The particular direction in which the striating agent came                    on the
rock from the westward may be inferred, by considering that if                        it
came in a direction            parallel with     the  rock it might smooth          but
would     not rut or groove,          as  there    would be no severe         pressure.
Nor,   en the other hand, would            it produce     grooves   or ruts, approxi
mately    horizontal and parallel, if it struck            the rock at right ani/ht.
A line parallel with the rock would be S.W., and a line at right
angles to it about N.N.W.                   The intermediate point would be
W.N.W., from which direction,                therefore,   it may be inferred       that
the striating agent moved upon             North Berwick Law.
   The annexed, fig.        2,  AB and CD, shows        a  portion of smoothed     rock
 with  striae   and   ruts.      These were ouly upon the roekfaee             fronting

N.    10°    W.      At B     and D the rock was well smoothed                 and rounded,
and very     slightly striated. At the east ends, which                  faced    N.     22°   E.,
there     was no striation and little smoothing.
     I may     add, that some of the rocky ridges in East Lothian at the
places ahove mentioned, present               another feature          besides smoothing
and striation deserving notice, and bearing on this subject.
     These       ridges,    generally speaking, trend or run in a direction
E.N.E. and W.S.W.                   On their N.W. sides, at the base of the ridge,
there is often a deep trench, running                   for some hundred yards, and
now filled           with water forming        little    lakes   ;   as, for    example,           at
Smeaton,          Balgone, and on the north side of North Berwick Law.
The probability             is,   that the agent which smoothed           and striated the
upji&r       parts    of these rocks, had scooped              out the softer materials
lying along their            baae    on their north flanks, forming thereby,                  as   it
were,     a   gigantic ditch or trench on these sides.

  numerous striae on this rock, running                  about S.S.E., and in            that
  direction rising up along the surface of the rock at an angle of                    about
  9°.    Fig.  3  illustrates these facts.
      This direction of      the striae upon the surface          of the rock, doping
  in the direction it does, would result from the rock being impinged
  upon by an agent of great weight and power, moving from W.N.W.
      That   such was the normal direction of the movement in this
 district is proved by many markings on other parts of the Stirling
 Castle rocks.        For   example,    there  are several       places where there is
 a  narrow defile or gully between            the rocks running          in  a direction
 approximately         W.N.W.         In   these    gullies,    though the sides          are
 smoothed      by the friction       of some body or bodies passing through
 them,    they are not striated, the pressure              on the sides not having
 been sufficient to produce striae,         these sides      having been parallel          to
 the movement         of the bodies passing between them.
     There arc other hills in Stirlingshire which indicate smoothing                    and
 striation.     Thus, on the Abbot's Craig, near the base of the Wallace
 Monument, at         a  height of 334 feet above            the sea, there    are   well-
 rounded bosses of rock with deep groovings which run                   N.W.   and    S.E
    So also at Torwood, about 5 miles to the S.E. of                 Stirling  Castle,    as
 Sir James Hall first pointed          out, there are striations on the rock bear
ing N.W. and S.E., at           a height of from 330 to 350 feet above the             sea.
    Coming       now to Mid-Lothian,— on the top of Allermuir Hill,
one    of the Pentlands, at a height of 1647 feet above the sea, there
are striations       on the     rocks, as vouched by           Mr Croll     and by Mr
John Henderson.            On others of these hills, at heights of 900                feet,
as    vouched by Mr M'Laren, and of                 1100    feet, as vouched by Mr
Henderson,        there are striated rocks.            All   these are    of the     same
character     as those    in East Lothian.
    Now, with       reference     to the agent      by which these striations         may
be supposed       to have been produced,         it  is important to keep in view,
that at most of the places just mentioned, even at the highest                     levels,
there is abundance         of clay and gravel.
    Thus, Professor Geikie, in his " Memoir on the Geology of                           the
Neighbourhood          of Edinburgh" (p. 126),            says: "Boulder        clay   lies
along the N.W. flanks of the Pentlands                   to the height of at least
1300    feet;"    and    he adds, that     "where      the    clay has been     recently
removed,      we usually       find the rock below polished, grooved,                  and

                        of Edinburgh,          Session 1878-79.                         265
scratched,       in    a     direction     nearly    E.   and W.,        or   E.S.E.    and
W.S.W."
     Much to the same effect,              Mr John Henderson of this city,                an
excellent practical         geologist,    refers to two localities      in the Pentlands
where      clay beds       occur    full of gravel and hard           pebbles.      One   of
these places       is Glencorse, at        a  height of 900 feet, where             he says
there     "is   a   stiff reddish clay full of well-rubbed and                   scratched
stones, and      differing in no way from the boulder-clay of the lower
districts."      The other locality is 3 miles distant, at a height of
about 1100        feet, where (Mr Henderson says) the clay is of the same
character as       the last-mentioned, and covered by a great deposit of
gravel and boulders.
    That ruts and striae on the smooth surface of                 a   rock can      be  pro
duced     by the passage and pressure of hard angular stones, is                      a fact
established       by many        cases carefully observed.          I  remember       many
years ago      having witnessed the effects produced by the giving way
of a large      embankment on the North British Railway at Dunglass
 Bum.        The culvert under the embankment had become choked.
 Water accumulated on the upper side,                   till  at length the embank
 ment gave way.            The materials composing it rushed down the valley
 with much force         ;  Rocks and large blocks of stone along the valley
 were scratched         and rutted by the debris             passing     over    them.     I
 thought the circumstance so instructive that                   I procured one of the
 large striated     blocks, on which no less than 50 or 60 striae had been
 made, and      deposited it in the Museum of this Society.                1  have sought
 for this specimen,        to show     it this  evening,   but without finding it.
            IIL    Information obtained            by Study of Bouldehs.
     Whilst     considering the agency           which produced striai on ruck.i,
 it is not   irrelevant to keep in view the light              thrown on the subject
  by   Boulders.
     Boulders are,     like striated rocks, found        at all levels, from the sea
  shore to   the tops of the highest hills.           Many of      these     boulders are
  traceable   to parent rocks situated in the western districts, and there
  fore  show, as the striated rocks do, an agency of great power which
  moved    from the west.             For   example,    the   mica    slate boulder      on
  ">e   Pentland Hills,        8   or  10 tons    in weight,    at a height of         M00
  tat above     the   sea,   first noticed by      Mr M'Laren,        must, as he says,

tion across the Ochil range and the valley of the Forth.*                                         A    few
days ago        I     was so fortunate as to              fall in with   a small boulder of red
granite, on the farm of Kingston,                          2   miles south of North Berwick
This East Lothian granite boulder                          most probably came also from the
Grampians, and travelled 20 miles farther than the Pentland boulder?.
   There is             a    large     boulder of Carboniferous                   Sandstone on         the
Lammermuir                  Hills,    at    a   height of 1500 feet above the                sea,     first
taken notice of by Professor Geikie in his " Memoir                                   on the Geology
of East Lothian," which must in like manner have come from                                             the
N.W., where rocks                    of that description are situated.
                                                       This boulder
led the Professor to say, that it " seemed to indicate a submersion
[of the land] to the extent of 1500 feet."
   On the farm of Drylaw, near Linton, there                                      is a boulder,      with
striae   on      it,   to which            my attention was some years ago called                          by
Sir Thomas Hepburn of Smeaton. It was met with on the occasion
of deep drain being made through boulder-clay. The boulder
   a                                                                                                       is
of basalt, very similar in composition to rock near the Gullane     a
Hills, situated              to the west.            The length of the boulder              is   6    feet,
its width about               3i     feet, and its depth about           3i   feet.
   It    was          narrower at one end                  than at the other, and that                end
pointed        N.W.

floating in     a     sen 1500 or 2000 feet above the present            level of the Atlantic,       is   an
agent capable of effecting the transportation of the stone, and offers,  think,               I
the only conceivable solution of the difficulty" (Edinburgh 2?eu> Philosophical
Journal for  1846, vol. xl. p. 138).   Referring to this boulder, and to another
of mica slute on the Pentlands, weighing about       of a ton, the late Professor
                                                                   j|

Journal,      vol. v. p. 28).

                            of Edinburgh,               Session 1878-79.                                267
the      boulder lay, had            an excavation made                in   the boulder-clay,          along
the south side             of the boulder, to            see    if   there were striae on         it   also.
It    turned out that there were.
     I found       that     on the north side            of the boulder the            striae ran      in    a
         ction from W.S.W., and on the south side from N.N.W.
           i annexed diagram (fig. 4) represents this boulder, with its
           and south sides striated at the west end of the boulder.                                     The
          were rather more                numerous on the north side,                    AB, than           on
     e   south   side,     CD.
      Evidently it         was the same agency which                        produced the striae on
both       sides.         By coming against the boulder                       at its west end,          this
agency, whatever              it    was, had separated               into two streams or couleex,
and had marked both sides,                        by pressing upon them                 as   it   passed.

 Now this could have been effected                             only by       a   body coming from
 a       direction        intermediate        between          N.N.W.            and   W.8.W.,          i.e.,
 about         W.N.W.         The agent           which      thus divided          into two streams
 must       have     consisted, not of an inflexible                        solid body, but of           "a
 mass," as       Mr Stevenson calls               it,   capable of separation.            The clay in
 which the boulder was buried was                        a   body of this character.              It   con
 tained numbers             of pebbles,      as   usual in boulder-clay, some                so   hard as
     with pressure         to be capable of smoothing and scratching                          any rock
     against   which they were pressed.                  Sir Thomas Hepburn showed                  to me
     aportion of     a   small granite boulder which he bad picked out of theclay.

                                       IV. Conclusion.
     The fads winch           1    have     stated   seem to warrant the theory, that
when these rocks and boulders were                             striated,       this part     of   Europe
was submerged               beneath     a sea     which         reached        to the      tops of    oar
highest hills, and that ice floated                          on this sea,         carrying      boulders
and     discharging them wherever                       the     ice    melted       or was      arrested
by submarine obstructions.
     When      the sea stood at a high level, effects would be produced on
our hill tops and             hill    sides.      As     the sea subsided, similar effecti
would be produced at lower levels.
     During the whole period when Great Britain was submerged,                                        we
know that the            sea was     of so low       a temperature             as to be suited        for
floating ice.           The shells found at a height of 1800 feet in the                            west
of England contain several species of an arctic type.                                   These arctic
species       occur      likewise      in Scotland, but                at    lower    levels,     when,
therefore,        probably the        sea   had greatly subsided.
     What all arctic           voyagers        report     as    having been seen by                them
may,     therefore,         have occurred in Scotland ; for they saw rocks
smoothed          and            —
                        striated, and boulders occupying such positions, — as
to satisfy them             that icebergs,        and        floating ice in various              forms,
were the agents             which had been, and were then, at work in                              these
phenomena.
     With     regard to the glacier theory,             it   seems to me that to account for
the striated rocks and boulders in the valley                          of   the   Forth,   that theory
is attended        with insuperable difficulties.                     If the    striatums on North
Berwick Law, and in East Lothian generally, were due to                                       a glacier,
so must also have been                the striatums on          Stirling Castle rock, the
Abbot's        Craig, Torwood,              and   the     Peutland Hills.    This glacier,
therefore,        must have been of gigantic dimensions,                           filling   the whole
valley of the Forth, reaching to a height of 2000 feet above                                         the
present sea-level,          and to a depth of at least a hundred feet below                           it,
with   a   width of some 20 or 25 miles,                        when at the mouth of                 the
present       Firth of Forth.          But     where could be the birth-place of such
a   glacier   1    Certainly not in the valley of the Forth; for the                               head
of   the valley       is   only 220 feet above the                sea,      that being the        height
of the ridge which separates the valley of Loch Lomond                                       from the
valley of the Forth.

     But even       if it were possible      to suppose    that   a  glacier had been
formed       at the head of the valley, and that it overspread                         East
Lothian,       I    find it difficult      to   understand    how rocks, so nearly
vertical as those at North Berwick and on the railway                        could have
been striated         in the way suggested by Mr Stevenson.                     Stones or
pebbles       at the bottom of a glacier might, by the weight of the
glacier      upon them,        be made        to striate rocks below         the    glacier,
these      rocks forming        the floor upon which the glacier moved.                 But
rocks      which       were  vertical, or nearly      so, could not bo so operated
 on   ;  and there are no observations to warrant the supposition that
 pebbles       are ever imbedded in the ice and                 protruding       from the
 side of a glacier so as to groove the vertical sides of a                 hill.
     The infinite number of the            striae on these steep      rocks at Linton
 and     North Berwick Law          is also a circumstance most unfavourable to
 the supposition that they were formed by stones protruding from the
 side of a glacier.          On the other hand, a thick mass of boulder-clay,
 full of hard pebbles, would be quite capable of striating,                    if the   clay
  containing them were pushed forward and pressed on a rock surface.
      There is another feature which bears on the nature of the striating
  agent        Mr Stevenson correctly pointed out that whilst most of the
  ruts and     striae on North Berwick Law were horizontal, some striae
  rose upwards         towards the east at angles          from   4° to 20°.       On the
  railway rock near         Linton   I  observed    the same feature.        If   the striae
  were formed         by stones protruding from the side of a glacier,                 they
   would all be parallel.         Their want of parallelism         can be more easily
   explained     if  a mass of detritus was the agent.
        There is one circumstance which appears almost conclusive against
   a  glacier having been        the   agent    of stiiation,   at all events        in the
   valley of the       Forth, and strongly favourable          to the theory        I  have
   indicated    in this   paper.
        This circumstance      is the facility    with which      the   striating     agent
   is shown     to have been deflected from its normal course by trivial
    obstructions.       Thus at Linton, in consequence of the rock on which
   the   striating agent impinged dipping due north, at                  a  considerable
    angle,   that agent,      when it came in contact with the rock, was
    deflected   from its E.S.E. normal course to           a direction of due south,
    being a   deflection of 22°.        In  the railway cutting,      where the slope
    of the  rock was greater, and therefore more obstructive, the striating

270                       Proceedings     of the Royal Society
agent was changed            from its   E.S.E normal             course    to a direction             of
E.N.E., being        a deflection of 30° or more.                 At Stirling Castle            rock,
in   consequence      of the rock dipping due west,                    the striating           agent
was changed         from its E.S.E.        course       to a direction             of due south,
being a deflection of 22°.                So also by the Dry law boulder                            the
striating agent was not merely deflected, but made to flow past in
two separate streams, each of which differed by several degrees from
the normal direction.
     Now   I   feci sure that no glacier,             even       of moderate         dimensions,
would have been deflected in its normal course by such obstructions.
It    would have gone straight over these rock surfaces                            in conformity
with    the general       movement       of the whole body of ice              ;   and certainly
when it came against            the     Drylaw boulder,            a block         weighing      less
than two tons,            instead of being divided               by it into two             separate
streams, the glacier would have forced the boulder out of its way
altogether.
     On the other hand,         a sea-current        would be far more likely to                    be
deflected by such obstructions ; and                  if    ice was floating        in it   of such
form and thickness as to reach and plough through the sea-bottom,
the mud and gravel there might be pushed forward                          in such     a way as to
smooth     and striate submarine rocks, whether horizontal or sloping.
     But whilst     I advocate     this theory of floating ice to account for
the phenomena             in this particular         district,    I   admit that there              are
some     difficulties       with which         the     theory has         to   contend.          For
example,       if   the    rock on North Berwick                  Law, described             by Mr
Stevenson, was smoothed and striated by a mass of clay and                                    stones
pushed and pressed            against    it,   what has become of this detritus?
because the rock now stands at least from 20 to 30 feet above the
detritus at its base.            The same remark may be made as to                                  the
striatums on the rocks at Stirling Castle and Abbot's                               Craig, which
arc  still higher above any detritus now on the plains below these
rocks.    This difficulty, however, vanishes, when regard had to the                is
enormous       denudation in every part of Scotland, of which                               there    is
ample evidence.            Moreover, in the          case   of North Berwick Law,              there
is   the remarkable hollow in the detritus along its base on the                               north
side, to which reference          has been           made,     showing that the detritus
there has been scooped out to             a    considerable extent, and this                    may
have happened         after the smoothing and striatum of the rock.

                        of Edinburgh,            Session 1878-79.                                273
on the   Old Red Sandstone formation, which                        was printed in the last
volume of        our Transactions,          was of sufficient merit to entitle             him     to
the award        of the prize, and especially when regard                      was     had to the
many     other      valuable      contributions          which    had been          rendered by
the author       to geological     science.
     The Old     lied Sandstone formation                was well known        in Scotland, by
reason   of the many          treatises,     both popular and scientific, which had
been    published regarding           it,   not only by Scotchmen, but by English
geologistsof reputation, during the last fifty years. But, notwith
standing all that had been done in the way of investigation, the
extent of this Formation on the earth's surface was so great, and
the variations         in its conditions         so numerous, that much remained
to    be done.         There      was       probably        no other Formation,            known
to    geologists,      which occurred in               so    many      countries,       or which
presented        so many       new      forms of animal and               vegetable      life.      It
occurred in England,              Wales, Ireland,            Scotland,       Norway,     Sweden,
Russia, India, South America, and Canada.                           It   was so extensively
developed        in America, that          an American        geologist, lately writing on
the subject, almost            made     it   a   matter of national pride,               that the
 formation was         more     extensive in Canada and the States,                       than in
 Europe, and was also richer in fossils.                      Professor       Geikie    had inti
 mated his intention           of investigating and describing this Formation                       as
it    existed,    not merely in Scotland,                   but on the        Continent.         The
 memoir      lately printed       in our Transactions            was     a   commencement of
 this large undertaking.              That memoir            was confined to the north of
 Scotland,   — viz., the counties of Moray, Sutherland, Ross, Caithness,
 Orkney, and Shetland.                The boundary of the formation in                        these
 parts    was     indicated      by     a    great     belt of shingle,          made    up from
 the waste        of the Old Silurian roeks, and forming                             along       their
 northern        and   eastern     flanks     a      conglomerate        rock.       The waters
 which     beat    on these       Silurian rocks, and in which the deposited
 sediment         ultimately      became   Old Red Sandstone strata,     are
 believed        by Professor        Geikie       to   have been         lacustrine, —    a      view
 originally suggested          by the late       Dr John Fleming,             and    adopted by
 Mr Godwin Austen and other eminent geologists, —judging                                     by   the
 nature of the plants            and fish found in the Scotch strata, none of
 which were considered marine.                    On this principle, Professor Geikie
  has   applied to the northern               district      the term Lake Orcadie.                The

next memoir,       and for which already materials have been largely
obtained,    will   describe    the   formation     as    it  occurs    in the    middle
district   of Scotland,      under the title of Lake Caledonia;                 and      the
third district, comprehending the south of Scotland and the north
of England, will      be described under the title of Lake Cheviot.
    It   was  not     necessary      for   him   (the Chairman) to refer to
Professor    Geikie's     identification     and classification of the rocks
composing      the    strata in the       Scotch     northern        counties, or       the
different fossils found in them.             His object was merely to point
out the     nature and importance of the investigation entered on
by Professor      Geikie,      and on account of which                 this  prize     had
been awarded.         He had      read   with the utmost interest            the expo
sition given in the memoir, indicating,             as  it did,    a large amount not
only of personal       labour on the part of the author, but of                      great
knowledge and ability.          He hoped that this         prize would be accepted
by Professor Geikie as a heartfelt acknowledgment and testimony
by the Council        of   the   eminent services        he had rendered          and     is
rendering to      science     by this work.       He       was sure also       that the
Professor would be pleased to have his name added to the roll of
eminent men of science who had gained this prize in former                         years,
at the    head of which        roll stands Sir Roderick Murchison, whom
Professor Geikie frequently alluded to in his memoir as his "old
chief," and whom they all respected not merely for his great                      geolo
gical discoveries,    but for the substantial benefits               conferred   by him
ou    our Edinburgh        University,     by founding         in it that Chair          of
Geology which Professor Geikie so ably fills.
    The Chairman, having then invited Professor Geikie to                          come
forward, placed         in his hands the Gold Medal                      and a bank
cheque,     adding,     as   from himself, that it gave him peculiar
pleasure to have been called on to perform this duty.

celebrated        Normal Solar Spectrum          Map, which      is taken as the
standard reference for "place."              The observations were          made in
Lisbon during the summers of 1877-8, with apparatus                    prepared     by
the author ; who aimed at including              everything visible, from the
extreme       red to the    extreme violet ends     of  the   spectrum,    so far as
that is        amenable     to the human eye after transmission through
glass.
    The author         also strove  to include only true solar lines,      with    the
least     possible     admission of such      as are   produced by the earth's
atmosphere.           Finally,  he compares    his so far purified solar result
against        upwards     of 5000    observations of laboratory workers in
chemistry, after reducing them to the same spectrum                      scale  ; and
 finds indications that the solar chemical elements              are incandescent
 in  a probably far higher temperature           than — probably twice       as high
 as— anything yet attained by man.
            2.  On another Method of Preparing Methylamine.
                           By R. Milner Morrison, D.Sc.
     On a former occasion           I  drew attention to methyl sulphate of
  ammonium         as a suitable material for the preparation of methylamine
  by heating      it with quicklime.      There is another and better method
  of arriving at the same result, the extreme           simplicity of which was
  probably      the cause of its being overlooked at the time.
     A   glance at the formula of methyl sulphate of ammonium shows
  that   it is an isomer of acid sulphate      of methylamine,      viz. : —
                 CNHtSO^.                                   CNH7SO4.

                 NH4S0*'                                          H S°*
     Methyl sulphate of ammonium.                 Acid sulphate of methylamine.
     Methyl sulphate of ammonium is an unstable salt, decomposable
  by a moderate       amount of heat, while acid sulphate of methylamine
  is a much more stable         body, hence it becomes      probable that      if  the
  unstable substance be heated the atoms in the molecules             of which it is
  composed      will tend to   arrange  themselves   in that order which is most
  stable   at the temperature      to which they are subjected,       and therefore
  that   in this case acid sulphate of methylamine will be produced.

276                      Proceedings          of the Royal Society
Such, in fact, is the          case.         A portion of dry methyl sulphate                  of
ammonium was heated by itself in a sealed tube to about 300° C
for about two hours, nearly the whole of the salt being converted                           into
acid sulphate of methylamine.
  When         the tube, after cooling, was examined,               it   was found that               a
very small portion of the salt had undergone                   a complete     decomposi
tion, some carbon          being set free.            On opening the tube a small
quantity       of gas was given off, which was inflammable, and                         smelt
somewhat        etherial, with a trace of sulphurous acid.                  The salt        had
been fused, and had solidified to a crystalline                     mass, and now pos
sessed a strongly acid reaction.
  This       salt, distilled with caustic potash, and the evolved gas collected
in hydrochloric acid, the solution, evaporated to dryness on the                       water-
bath, gave a hydrochlorate which, on heating                   with lime,     gave off an
inflammable gas in abundance,                   was deliquescent,    soluble in alcohol,
and when warm possessed the smell of methylamine hydrochlorate.
  Several portions of methyl sulphate of ammonium were                             heated to
different temperatures         and for different lengths of time, in order                   to
find out the most advantageous                  method of preparing the       substance.
  As     there     appears     to be some regularity         in   the relation between
the temperature          and time and the amount converted from one salt
into the other,      I intend          making further research in that direction                  ;
and for this reason            I   have for the present       contented      myself     with
only     a    platinum    estimation, for the purpose               of determining          the
amount of methylamine hydrochlorate present in the crude                             mixture
of methylamine hydrochlorate and ammonium chloride.                                 For     the
purpose       of this estimation         a   portion of the crude hydrochlorate,             as
obtained by evaporating the hydrochloric                   acid solution to         dryness,
was dissolved       in water       and precipitated with       chloride of         platinum.
The double chloride so obtained was washed, dried, and the platinnm
estimated       by ignition.
  The following are the percentages                   of platina found in the         double
salts obtained from four experiments under varying circumstances :—
  (a) 25 grammes of methyl sulphate of ammonium were                               heated to
         300° C. for 2 hours.
  (h) 25 grammes of the salt were heated to 300° C. for                        1    hour.

     The following             brief     statement                concerning           " Reh    "   is    chiefly
derived       from the Report of the Committee on Reh, November
1878:—
     Large      tracts   of country in the north-west of India have                                           from
time immemorial            been covered                 with      a       white alkaline efflorescence,
which renders them incapable of supporting any form of vegetable
life.     These tracts are called                 "   usar    "* plains, and            the white efflores
cence     "reh."t        The appearance                     of this reh on            the surface    is   owing
to the subsoil       water, which                is   impregnated with sodium salts, being
 sucked      up to the surface by capillary attraction and there evaporated
 by     the fierce heat of the                   Indian summer                 sun.      The reh         is   often
 very    irregularly distributed,                — bald       patches occurring            in   the midst of
 cultivation,       or cultivated            patches           surrounded             by reh, — and this
 capricious      distribution          has       rendered             a    right comprehension                of its

mode       of production difficult.                    It   seems certain, however,                      that       its
appearance            depends chiefly on the distance                      of the water-table                  from
the surface of the ground and upon the nature of the intervening                                                 soiL
   When reh               exists      in the soil it is         more        largely developed on                        a
surface where              the     water level is nearer the surface                      ;    while,     on the
other hand,           a   soil of a close texture, — a clay soil, for instance, —
may prevent the formation                      of reh by hindering the upward                            passage
of the water, even where                   the water-table is comparatively near the
surface.         Of       course      anything which affects the rapidity of evapora
tion must affect the rapidity with which                                   the   reh accumulates,                   so
that the cutting down of trees, and thus exposing the surface of                                                   the
soil to the unmitigated action of the sun's rays, has an injurious
effect and tends to promote the formation                             of   the efflorescence.                 Until
lately an equilibrium                   of reh distribution                was      established,           at all
events     approximately.                The great usar plains which                           have existed
from unknown                times       did not increase             in extent or              change         their
position    ;    but it would seem that by the introduction of the                                        canal-
irrigation system this equilibrium has been disturbed.                                         The Western
Jumna Canal — which runs from the Jumna, where it                                                    leaves the
hills, down as far as               Delhi — has        developed         large tracts           of   reh, land
which was formerly cultivated and fruitful being covered                                                with       it,
and the same process                    has begun            and    is   going on with alarming
rapidity on the Ganges                    and Eastern Jumna canals in the country
between         the   Jumna and           the Ganges.               The evil      is    of     great magni
tude, and         large      tracts     of fertile land are fast becoming waste                                and
unproductive, and the condition                             of the people and their                     cattle     is
deteriorating in consequence.                           Two     years       ago     a   committee              was
appointed by Government to discover the cause or causes                                                   of    the
evil, and suggest,               if   possible,    some remedy.              As the result              of their
deliberation,         it   is    established      beyond doubt that this new production
of reh   is     chiefly,    if     not solely, caused by the system of canal                              irriga
tion as at present carried                  out.       In     the    first instance, the level                     of
the salt-impregnatod subsoil water has been much raised, so as                                                to   be
more readily drawn up to the surface                           by capillary action and                        there
evaporated,           leaving the salts           it   held in solution as              a      crust on        the
surface.         There seems to be some difference of opinion amongst                                          the
members          of the committee,                as to whether              this    is       chiefly    due       to
percolation from the bottom and sides of the canals, which                                              are

higher    level     than    the   surrounding      land, or to the system of flush
irrigation, which is often so wastefully carried out as to swamp the
lands watered.           Moreover, in many cases the canals and their dis
tributaries have been so carelessly aligned as to interfere seriously
with the        surface     drainage.      The      canal   water,    itself   containing
more     or less of these           sodium salts in solution,            is   a new and
 inexhaustible        source    of reh, and though the process               in this  case
 may be alow,        it is sure, ultimately, to result        in   the    appearance     of
 reh and the consequent unproductiveness of the land.
     Various     remedies for this state of things have been suggested,
 some   of them very desperate, such as an entire remodelling of the
  canals, or an extensive system           of   deep drainage,     or the substitution
 of what is called         " lift " for " flush   "
                                                     irrigation, which would mean
  that every drop of water used             be    lifted from reservoirs          and  dis
  tributed over the land by manual labour.                     All    efforts   to reclaim
  land   once      infected    with   reh,   by cultivation      or otherwise, have
  proved abortive.
      Mr  J.   Wilson, M.A. Edin., Assistant Settlement Officer, having
  sent a   small sample of reh to Professor Wilson, with the request that
   it be analysed, the investigation            was     kindly intrusted       to mo, and
   I now   beg to lay before the Society the results of my analysis.

   From these results it will be seen that the portion of this sample
soluble in water, which        I suppose    to be the reh proper, is mainly       a
mixture     of sulphate of soda, carbonate of soda, and common                salt,
the sulphate being much the most abundant.                 I  hope soon to   have
an opportunity      of analysing     some more     samples   of reh, the results
of which analyses       I shall communicate to the Society.

5.  Proposed Theory of the Progressive Movement of Barometric
              Depressions.        By Robert Tennent, F.M.S.
   This paper is     a continuation and      a fuller explanation    of the   pre
vious one, in which it was attempted to show why barometric                    de
pressions,   or storms, mote forward.       In our present state  of knowledge,
exceptional cases iu such an investigation are always to be found,            and
the subject is consequently taken up in a general point of                  view.
It is attempted here to be shown, not how depressions always               move,
but how, under certain well-known circumstances, they may                 move.
   A depression of      a small diameter was shown to be found under              a
comparatively high atmosphere,          in which case it would tend to fill
up.    But when its diameter is        great, say of several hundred       miles,
and underneath the same real atmospheric height, it may then                    be
considered    as  existing under a comparatively low atmosphere,           whiih

may be represented by the thickness of a sheet of paper spread over
an ordinary globe.                 The difference              in the mechanical                     effects which
must then               take place are evidently of great importance.                                            In this
latter        case, the effect           of the earth's rotation                   will       be      fully intro
duced,        and the inflow of the winds to the low barometric centre will
here have           to pass over a great extent of resisting surface, the effect
of which was shown.                       Under these circumstances,                         a depression             will
not, as       in the former            case,    tend to fill up        ;    it will now              tend to open
out, and        in       one particular          direction, which                is that of progressive
movement.                It   does not move as a rigid aerial cavity forced onwards
by    high pressure in the rear, as it is by many supposed                                                to do, but
not being           a    rigid   aerial cavity, it can only advance,                          as     it    sometimes
does, at 70           miles an hour, as a circular atmospheric                               wave,        by opening
out     in front, which may be regarded as being lateral and horizontal
extension, and by                filling up in the             rear.       It    is difficult to conceive
how progress can take place in any other way.                                     This       mode of advance
was shown to take place                        only on a resisting surface, and not on                                  a
frictionless            surface, on which depressions                   could not advance at all                            ;
although the universally received opinion                                  is,   that   a    resisting surface
retards progressive               movement            instead     of facilitating              it.         Storms of
 the usual          diameter       move         in    direct    contact with the               surface           of the
earth, and          not over      a    mass of calm air resting upon it.                              Query, Can
 they move           through space         1      Conclusions were arrived at in                            a    former
 paper on the barometer,                   that its rite and           fall      was greatly due to the
 passage       of the air        over a resisting surface              ;    on    a     frictionless surface
 this        would be greatly diminished,                        and consequently much less
 difference         would        then be found to exist betwixt                               high and low-
 pressure,      which causes and accompanies                           storms     ;     but    if         this   is   not
 to     be   found,     it    Will then show one of the reasons why they do not
 move        over   a     frictionless surface, on which they cannot be opened
 out     by   the rotation of the earth.
      The     motive force which causes storms to move,                                 is   here supposed to

    The rise and fall of the thermometer                  is equal    both    above and
below its mean, but the extent of the rite and fall of the barometer ii
much <jreater below than above its mean.                  This was accounted for so
far by " lifting or fictitious pressure, which accompanies
                    "
                                                                               southerly
winds, which prevail when the barometer is below its mean.
    The second part of this paper is intended to show why                          storms
require   high pressure       to the right       of  the direction     in which         they
advance.      This   is represented       by  a diagram of a flat wheel, which               is
laid horizontally on the surface             of the ground      ; it circulates     round
its centre, which also moves forward               in  one direction.      It  is in this
                                                                                      '
way that     a depression      also moves, say,      in  an easterly direction.            Its
 winds have a circular rotatory movement                  round its low centre           in a
direction     opposite     to    that of the hands of           a  watch.     Let     their
circular rate of speed be at 30 miles per hour, and let the                      forward
movement       of the low centre          also   take place     at the   same     rate of
speed.      The consequence          of this will be that east winds              on the
north    segment      will    be at    rest — calm — and not          move    over        the
ground    ; at the same time they must necessarily                 form  a segment          of
the circular     rotation round the low centre.                If  thus at   rest,     they
must cause a collapse,         and  a  termination of the circular rotation                 of
the depression;        But they      do not do so.        To account for this,       these
east winds may be regarded             as being spare        winds, and     as such in
this way their circular rotation may be maintained.                    As  space winds
they   actually    move,      though not over the surface             by  which       their
speed is estimated,       and hence they may be said to blow                 when th-f
 do not blow.        West      winds     on the     south    segment,    having       thcir
 velocity regarded        as    being made        comparable      with   the mode in
 which east winds blow, when they are supposed to be at                       rest, may
 be said to blow won'        rapidly    than they really do blow, because their
speed is not merely           to   be   represented      by their circular      rotation
 round the low centre, but also by the additional speed which                          they
 acquire in the direction of the advancing low centre.                    Under      these
 circumstances,    /he relocity     of  ea.it and   west  winds are not     cunqmnibl'-
 as estimated     by   lloir    passage     over   the surface.      To render       thom
 comparatively equal,          they   must bo regarded          as being both        space
 winds and earth winds.

    East winds    consequently pass over a less extent of surface when
they are not      at rest, because they move           in  a direction  opposite
to that   of progress,     and   consequently do not require high pressure
to aid   them on their segment.           West winds, which have greater
velocity,   and pass over a much greater extent of surface, and in the
direction   of   progress,    require high pressure       on their segment.    It
is in this way that the point is accounted          for.    Storms do not move
against high pressure       in front,  except   in those    cases in which it is
 far distant.

 The Eight Hon. Lord Monckeiff                    of Tulliebole, President of
        the Society, occupied the Chair, and delivered the follow
       ing Opening Address            : —
 Gentlemen", —
           I  cannot,   of course, commence       the discharge    of the duties of
 President of this learned and celebrated            Society, without expressing
 my profound gratitude to the members for their unexpected                   kindness
 in elevating      me to this chair, and my intense           appreciation of the
 distinction     they have thereby conferred upon me.               It  is a position
 of which any man, however high his reputation or however great his
 attainments, could not fail to be proud.                To  mo your favour has
 laid me under the greater obligation, that             I am painfully      conscious
 that  I am     entirely without pretensions      to the special qualities which
 have generally determined         your choice.      I  am but a loiterer outeide
 the temple      of science, waiting for what it may please her priests to
 dispense to the crowd.         My incursions into the fields of            literature
 have been so rare,        so desultory,     and so clandestine, that            I   own
 myself more of       a trespasser   than one entitled to be there,             Jsever-
 theless, as fortunately for me your stamp has been impressed,                        it is
 not for me to gainsay so honourable and gratifying a dignity.                        The
 coin must pass current, whatever may be the intrinsic value of the
 metal.      It  may be, perhaps,     that in the course of     a life, not now          to
 be reckoned short, spent          in public and professional          labours       with
 various surroundings,        I  may, while     little space has been left for
 cultivating the proper attributes of this chair, have acquired                     some
 knowledge of detail, some acquaintance             with habit3     and springs of
 thought and action, which may be brought usefully to bear on the
 discharge     of my duties.      Be that    as  it  may,   I can only    assure you
 that  as  far   as  my ability may reach, or industry and attention can
 serve mo,     I shall  do my best not to discredit the appointment you
«have made.
    For   the rest, as regards the discharge        of my duty to-night,         I  must
 ask   you to make allowance for the suddenness                 with which it          has
 overtaken       me,  and for the numberless distractions               which        have
 abridged     even the short time       I have  had    for preparation.        I   regret

                       of Edinburgh,          Session 1879-80.                          317
 this the more that there are some topics                  on which     I should like to
 have    enlarged,     and which         might    have      been    appropriate to the
occasion, and not without interest.                 I  hope to have an opportunity
hereafter     of fulfilling      more    perfectly     a  duty which to-night must
remain    to   a large  extent unperformed.              I understand that my being
selected    for this   office to a certain degree is due to a desire on the
part of   the Society to vary for once the special qualifications which
have    hitherto been mainly looked for in your President, and to
indicate a desire to revert to the literary side of the Society,                    as was
contemplated in its original constitution.                   As   far as the absenco      of
any pretensions        as   a  physicist    is concerned,       I   no doubt may be a
fitting representative of the desire so indicated, although the transi
tion from the negative           to the positive is much more            doubtful.      But
I am    to a certain extent consoled, in the sense of my own deficiencies,
by   finding that     a professional position as a lawyer was once con
sidered    not without         its recommendations in the choice                 of your
members,       or even in the selection of your President               ; for I find that
the first meeting of the Society was held on tho                      23d day of      Juno
1783, when the         Right Hon. Thomas Miller of Barskiunuing, Lord
Justice-Clerk,      was chosen President of the meeting, and it was
resolved that the Lords            of Council     and     Session,   and the Barons of
Exchequer in Scotland, should be invited to a participation of the
 Society's labour, an invitation which,             I am glad to think, was largely
responded      to at tho       time,   and might with mutual advantage                   be
 more generally acted on now.
    The theme       which     I  should have chosen           for this address, had        I
 been   able to cast    it in anything of a systematic mould, would have
 been to   consider how far it might bo possible or expedient to widen
 or  strengthen the literary character               of this institution, and        if  so,
 in what direction, and towards what result this might be attempted.
 Times are greatly changed             since   the    Society was formed, nearly           a
 century ago.       The prosecution of physical science, and tho recording
 of its progress     from month to month, must always be its chief
 development      ; for physical        science    is necessarily      progressive,     and
 every   step    taken is a step in advance                  But with literature,         or
 mental science, or political or social economy,                or dialectics,   it is not
 so; and     if the   meeting       and  if this Society       were   to exchange       the
  weighty    authority    of its scientific transactions for the ephemeral

 318                  Proceedings       of the Boyal      Society
smartness      of   a literary    institute,  it would     lose both    in intrinsic
interest and importance, and in public estimation.                     Still  I  think
there is room for some good work to be done                 in relation to Scottish
literature, being cognate to the grave and solid character which is
and has always belonged to the transactions of the Society ; and it
had occurred to me, in searching for a suitable theme for my address
from this chair, that some interest might be created                   by tracing in
detail the rise and progress of English composition in Scotland.                     It
is a subject which has never been thoroughly                   investigated or ex
hausted.      We know          more   of Scottish literature in the sixteenth
Century than we do of that of the seventeenth.                The period     I should
wish particularly to have illustrated is that long, and, as regards our
owji literature, rather dreary and barren chasm between the union of
the crowns     in  1 603  and the union of the kingdoms in         1 707.    I should
like to   trace,   if it could     be done,    the gradual steps by which          our
Scottish writers ascended            from the strong, nervous, but Scottish
vernacular of the          15th century, until, in the persona             of Hume,
Robertson, and Adam              Smith   — the founders of this Society — or
among them, they became masters and models                   of the  art,   and gave
laws, and canons         of criticism,    to the authors south of the Tweed.
I have   always looked on this result           as a  very remarkable instance of
the tenacity and adaptability of the Scottish               character.     There   cau
be no doubt that as regarded            the arts and sciences, the more refined
pursuits of the intellect, and the inducements to cultivate the gentler
tenderness      of knowledge,         the   union    of the   crowns in the first
instance,    and the union of the kingdoms ultimately,                  were a deep
and severe        blow.      They    withdrew      money and patronage           from
Scottish enterprise in the markets of intellect as well as in those                 of
commerce     ;  and    I  incline to think that this cause, more than              the
troubles of the times, explains the lack of Scottish literature in                 the
first half of the seventeenth        century.    The union of the kingdoms         was
a second     and sudden discouragement              to Scottish literature.       Left
without either court or parliament, and forced to conform to English
models, authorship in Scotland became a very dreary affair.                  Scottish
language,    accent, phrases, and speech were the subject               of  perpetual
derision to their southern neighbours, and the old Scottish pride of
her authors could          ill brook, while they could not withstand,'             the
current     of contemptuous criticism             which assailed     them.      David

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                  319
Hume       speaks      with    great     bitterness of the stings and " arrows"
which galled him so much              in London,     compared      with     the deference
and   adulation which followed him in Paris.                    It has been said       that
the true      secret  of the leaning towards arbitrary power evinced by
his History, especially in its later revisals, was inspired by the fact
that James the First of England spoke broad Scotch, and that the
English were unpleasantly proud of their free constitution.                             But
the   uses      of adversity proved salutary.             The     Scotsmen       had their
revenge     ;   for whatever may        be thought of Hume's politics, his stylo
remains       to this day without          a rival, and the same brotherhood of
strong men who founded                 this Society, achieved         a   triumph in the
fields of literature which remains a lasting monument of their power.
    Such was the colour of my thoughts when                      I first became aware
 that  I  should have to-night to address              you for the first time from
 this chair, and such were the lines on which, had my time permitted,
 I should have endeavoured                to illustrate   the literary       side   of your
 escutcheon.        But    the mere sketch which          I have    now outlined must
 I fear satisfy you that the             task   could not be performed with any
 thing like success, without an amount of honest                    research      to which
 my   time has proved entirely inadequate.

    The   Kev. Professor Kelland.                By Professors Chrystal
                                    and Tait.
    Professor      Kelland     was the son of the Rev.        Philip Kelland,
 who, at   the time of the birth of his son, was rector of the parish of
 Dvmster,    in Somersetshire.       Afterwards    it would    appear   that he
 removed    to Landcross,    in Devonshire.      Though an Oxford man him
 self, he sent his son    Philip  to Queen's College, Cambridge, where he
 greatly distinguished himself among his contemporaries, and in 1834
 stood  at the head of the honour list as Senior Wrangler and First
 Smith's Prizeman.       Mr Kelland, who had taken orders in        the  Church
 of  England, became Tutor of Queen's College, and hold the post for

 322               Proceedings     of the Royal Society
the next three years.        In   1838    he was appointed to the         Chair of
Mathematics in the University of Edinburgh, as successor to Professor
Wallace.      He has been a Fellow of this Society ever since he came to
Edinburgh     ; and only last year was elected to its highest office.
   The   loss which this Society suffered       in  the death of its     President
has already     been   characterised    in fitting words by Sir Alexander
Grant (auto p. 208).       What    we are now called upon to do, is to give
a general    account   of his  services    alike to the University of        Edin
burgh and to science.
   Kelland    occupied   the Mathematical         Chair from the time of the
resignation of Professor Wallace in 1838           — a period including forty-
one complete     sessions.   During six months of each           year he gave at
least thirteen lectures in all per week to his three classes          ; and for at
least four sessions, during the illness of Professor Forbes, he conducted
the Natural Philosophy course also.          He   was, besides, for long periods
secretary of Senatus,    and  of the Board of Visitors of the Observatory,
and    was    constantly employed in conducting examinations for
various     public   bodies   and     institutions,    e.g.,   the   Colleges   of
Physicians and Surgeons,        the  Dick Bequest,       the   Edinburgh High
School, &c., and on several         important occasions        his services were
engaged by one of the Scottish Insurance Offices              with  a view to the
septennial investigation      of its affairs     from the actuarial point of
view.     In this connection    he made a tour in Canada and the           United
States, of which he published an account in a charming              little volume
called  "Transatlantic Sketches."          If we   add to this the labour en
tailed by his various published works and original scientific papers,
as  well as his constant contributions to educational publications, we
can easily see what an active life he spent.           To the very end of his
career his activity never seemed to flag.            His college duties grew
from year to year, partly in consequence of the great increase in the
number of students,      but mainly because of the enormous increase of
graduation.     And   he kept up, year after year, from 1869 at least, two
Mathematical Classes for the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Associa
tion.   Yet his teaching    was to the last as thorough as ever;           and no
better proof could be desired than the fact that three of the last four
awards    of the Ferguson Mathematical Scholarship,                which is open
to all the Scottish Universities, have been made             in favour of Edin
burgh students.

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                323
     As Sir A. Grant           has well said,      he came to know          the Scottish
Universities better even than do Scotsmen                    themselves.      To this     we
may      add that he knew also, as few have ever known them, the
characteristics and the wants of Scottish students.                        Our grief for
his loss     is at least tempered          by the fact that he died at his post
after an unusually           extended    term of active usefulness.          He who      has
in person         instructed, alike by clear           precept and noble example,
many thousands             of   the youth of a nation, cannot            fail  to have      a
happy      and lasting influence         on that nation's progress.           Philip Kel-
land was,       in    the very highest sense, a benefactor          to Scotland.
     In spite of all his hard week-day work,                 he did not shrink         from
 clerical    duty on Sundays, very often reading the service, or preach
ing,     in some of the Episcopal Churches in Edinburgh.                             In his
 sermons, as         in his    secular   addresses,     he was studiously quiet and
 simple,     avoiding       all mere popular arts of word-painting               ;  but he
 was    none the less effective in consequence.                No  one  in  the crowded
 Assembly        Hall     on the    22d   April   last,    when he appeared         for the
 last   time before the public, can forget the profound impression pro
 duced      on the whole audience            by the few but earnest and loving
 words      which      he then addressed      to the graduates.       A   fortnight later
 he was       followed      to his grave     by the majority of those who had
 vociferously        applauded his simple and touching eloquence.
      His earlier mathematical work              was very much influenced by his
  admiration        for Fourier and Cauchy.               The latter, indeed,       was his
  personal friend.          His Theory of Heat, and various            elaborate      papers
  in the     "Camb.        Phil    Trans." and the          "Phil.  Mag.," show how
  Kelland attempted to base the explanation                     of the phenomena           of
  heat     upon      the mutual       action of systems         of   particles exerting
  forces    on one another at a distance.                  The  analysis employed is
  of a     nature very similar to Cauchy's              ;  but we need not examine
   these   attempts closely,         for, though they show great mathematical
   ingenuity,      they are now known             to be based       upon an        unsound
   physical assumption.
       He was       much more successful when his physical assumptions
   were more accurate,          as in his investigations of      the motion of waves
    in canals, and      in the calculation of the intensity         of light which had
    passed   through a grating.           Another     real service    which ho did to
    physical science       consisted    in his having edited and reprinted the
          vol  x.                                                              2 Q

 now unfortunately, like its predecessor, entirely out of print.
     But his       forte unquestionably lay in pure mathematics,                                   and in that
department,             and others          closely allied to               it,   he has       enriched our
 " Transactions " with               several very excellent papers.
     An       idea of Professor Kelland's                  scientific activitywill be obtained
by looking             at the       list of       papers        under his name in the Royal
 Society's Catalogue of Scientific Memoirs.
     Several of his memoirs deal with physical optics.                                        Two of these
are especially interesting.                   They deal with the question of the aggre
gate      effect       of    interference.           In the first ("Trans. Camb. PhiL
Soc." vii.) he shows that when light falls on lens, part of which               a
iscovered and part uncovered,    the whole quantity of light on a
screen placed           in    the focus      is   to that which falls on the lens                         as   the
area of the uncovered               part of the glass            is   to the whole area of the glass.
Hence he infers that the whole quantity of light                                        is   not diminished
or increased by interference.                      In     the second            ("   Trans.    RS.E."        xv.),
starting fsom the principle thus established,                               he treats    a    very interest
ing point which arises in the application of Huyghens' principle in
the undulatory theory.                  In       forming the expression for the vibration
due to any element                  of an aperture               on    the surface            of   a   lens, we
multiply         the maximum intensity                     of vibration              by the area of the
element,         and to keep the dimension correct we must divide by                                            a
factor    D     whose dimension              is   the square of            a    line.    Kelland investi
gates     a   variety of cases for different forms of aperture, and finds in
each      case     that      D must         be    fA where        X    is   the wave-length             of     the
incident light, and             h   the distance from the lens of the screen placed
in its        focus.        The question was afterwards discussed                                  by Stokes
("Trans.         R.S.E."        xx.),       who     generalised             Kelland's         analysis,        and
showed         that the result may be deduced                              for an aperture of any
form.
     In   a    memoir read before the Royal                             Society of Edinburgh in
April     1839         ("Trans." xiv.) Kelland took up                            the subject of wave
motion.          He         discusses       the    case     of   a     canal         of finite depth            h,
adopting the hypothesis of parallel sections.                                   Assuming the motion

the first     of which    gives the velocity of transmission, the second the
height     of the   wave.
    In   the  latter part of the paper he applies his method to canals
having a      vertical section of any shape whatever, and deduces the
following      elegant formula—
                           "2 _    area of vertical section
                                     breadth ai surface
for the     velocity of propagation.         This  gives the result, for canabt of
triangular      section, that the velocity        of propagation is that in          a
rectangular canal        of half  the depth.      This conclusion is      tested    by
 means     of Scott-Russell's     observations, and is found to be          in   close
 agreement      with  fact.
    The same result was also arrived at independently by Green, who,
in point of fact, anticipated        Kelland in   the matter, for he gives     it in a
 note read     before the Cambridge Philosophical           Society on the 18th
 February 1839, whereas Kelland's             paper was read on the 1st April
 of the same       year.    Scott-Russell's    observations were      the   exciting
 eause    of both investigations, which have little in common                 beyond
this   particular result.
     In  a  memoir on General Differentiation           ("Trans. R.S.E." xiv.),
 read   December 1839,        Professor Kelland deals with one of the most
 abstruse    and difficult branches of analysis.          The process by which
 we extend      the meaning of the symbol         x"[ where  m is integral to the
 case   where m has any value whatever, is familiar            enough,     although
 it has    its difficulties   as every algebraist knows.        General differen
  tiation is a   problem of a similar kind but of a much higher order of
  difficulty.    Thus,
                      £'           (^)2'           (£)Uc-
   are  symbols which      have   for their effect to deduce      in   a particular

name of first, second, third, &c., differential                               co-efficients are given.
The corresponding problem here is to interpret the operating symbol,

whore /z may          have any value             whatever.               This interpretation             must
be so made           that it        shall include the particular meanings                            already
attached to the cases whore p is integral.                                   This   process of extension
has boon aptly called                 by De Morgan              a case        of the interpolation of
forms, and there are difficulties in connection                                with it very like      those
that arise in the solution of functional equations                                        or the inverse
method        of finite differences.                  The question                  was   first raised    by
Leibnitz, and was treated successively                               by Euler, Laplace, Fourier,
Liouville,        Greatheed,         Peacock, and Kelland.
   The laws of operation to                 be conserved              are —

  The only question is: — What fundamental functions are we to select
on which to base our calculus                    ?        It   appears         that different systems
arise according as we select our fundamental functions.                                           Peacock
starts      with of       :    Kelland, following                   Liouville and          others,    starts
with     e"* as    the ground function, and lays down the equation
as the      foundation of his system.
   By       means     of a definite integral he then deduces                                 the general
formula
                                    \dxj
                                                               in   a-+M
where       /w is     a       function like the gamma                        function,     satisfying the
equation

but unlike it not restricted to positive values of n.
  This formula                is,   then, applied in           a     variety of particular            cases,
and    is   shown to be perfectly general                       provided certain conventions
are adopted,         and from         it   are derived working formulae convenient
in different       cases.

to expansions            in fractional        powers of x.

which is    applied          to the solution           of   a        variety of problems.
     The   whole of           the    mathematical work in this memoir is of great
simplicity       and elegance, and for that reason alone it is well worth
the    attention of students of the higher mathematics.                                         It   has, more
over,   intrinsic value             as an    important contribution to the elucidation
of a    difficult branch of analysis.                       How         great         that importance may
be    it is impossible to estimate until the future of the method is more
certain       than   it can     at present           be said to bo                ;   but, in any     case, tho
work       will remain a lasting monument to the skill and ingenuity of
its author.
      Closely connected with the paper                           just mentioned is another                 on a
process       in the differential calculus and its application to the solution
of    differential equations.                 Nothing farther                need be said            regarding
it except       that it is characterized               by the same elegance and simplicity
that mark        the memoir on general differentiation.
      Perhaps the most              important of all Professor Kelland's                              scientific
papers is       his Memoir on the limits of our knowledge respecting                                        the
 Theory       of Parallels.            He    there     deals with             the subject now better
known as        absolute or non-Euclidean geometry.                                    It   would scarcely be
 possible to     convey        to those      who have not busied themselves with pan-
 geometry (or            the geometry of pure reason as one might venture to
 call   it,         to the geometry of experience which
              as opposed                                                                       is Euclid's)     a

 tion. Suffice             to say that he reasons out correctly, and perhaps even
 more      elegantly than        is   done    in     one of the last works on the subject,*
 the consequences             of denying Euclid's "parallel axiom," or what                               is   its
 equivalent, viz., the proposition that tho sum of the three angles of
 any    triangle     is   two right angles.                 It       can be shewn by moans of tho
 properties      of congruent figures, which, with all tho consequences                                        as

  328                 Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
 to the nature of space that follow              therefrom, are hereby assumed
 that — (1) The sum of the angles of any triangle can never                      exceed
 two right angles      ;   (2)  If the sum of the angles of any one triangle
 is two right angles,        then the sum of the angles          in every triangle is
 two right angles.          But independently of      the  theory of parallels, this
 is in substance      as  far  as we can go.      If  we assume that the 8um           of
 the angles of any triangle is less than two right angles, then we arrive
 at the conclusion that this sum depends on the area of the triangle,
 the defect from two right angles being less the less the area, and the
 same for all triangles       of the same area, consequently therefore propor
 tional to the area of the triangle.           The effect of this assumption on
 the theory     of parallels is very remarkable.            Defining parallels as
 straight lines in the same plane that do not intersect (this is not the
 definition adopted in recent books, such as that of Frischauf, above
 named, but that is a mere question of words), we find that there are
 an infinite number of straight lines passing through the same point
 all parallel to a given straight line       ;  that through one point on one
 of  a pair of parallels only       one straight can be drawn that makes the
alternate     angles    equal ; that parallel straight         lines are not       equi
distant   ;  that the locus of the         points equidistant          from   a  given
straight line is not a straight but a curved line           ;  that equal parallelo
grams on the same base cannot be between                  the same parallels, and
so on.      All  this, and much more, is shewn by Kelland to form part
of  a system     of geometry as logical     as   Euclid's.
    As far   as can   be gathered      from the memoir, and the form of the
demonstrations, all but the fundamental propositions (the mere idea
in fact) is Kelland's own work.            It is characteristic of the man that
he was     in  the habit of treating this subject        in his    class lectures.
    Clearness    in dealing with       the fundamental principles of mathe
matical science       was one      of the virtues of Kelland's thinking and
teaching.       His text-book        on Algebra     is distinguished       over other
text-books in present use by its attempts to give a rational                  account
of the first principles of the subject.            The same readiness to grasp
a new elementary         idea, and trace its consequences, is exemplified by
the fact that he took up Quaternions              with his    class   in the Univer
sity, and so late as 1873 published,            in conjunction        with Professor
Tait, an excellent elementary treatise               on   this    branch of mathe
matics.     (See the Preface to that work.)

       Alexander James Adie, Esq.                   By David Stevenson,
                                       M.I.C.E.
     Alexander James Adie, Civil Engineer,             son of the late Alexander
Adie,     F.RS.E,     the eminent optician, was born in Edinburgh                in
1808.       A  course of study at the High School, and afterwards at the
University of Edinburgh,            prepared him for entering on an appren
ticeship under       Mr James Jardine, Civil Engineer, with whom                 he
was     afterwards associated in carrying out various- works.
     In 1836 be became Resident Engineer of the Bolton, Chorley, and
Preston      Railway, and communicated some interesting papers to
the    Institution of Civil Engineers regarding that work, particularly
one     on Skew Bridges.
     On leaving      Lancashire       he removed    to Glasgow to take charge
 of some       of the colliery       railways   there,   and  ultimately    became
 engineer     and    manager      of the Edinburgh       and Glasgow Railway,
 which post he resigned         about 1863.
     Mr Adie made        a series  of important experiments on the expansion
 of stone     by heat, which he communicated to              the   Society   in his
 paper     entitled " The Expansion of Different Kinds of Stone from
 an   Increase   of Temperature, with      a Description of the Pyrometer used
 in   making the Experiments," which is published in .vol. xiii. of the
 Transactions.
     Mr Adie was elected           a  Member of tho Society in 1846.            He
 latterly retired      to reside    at  Rockville,  near   Linlithgow,   where he
 had an     opportunity of cultivating his       taste for horticulture    and the
  fine arts,  and of receiving visits from many who esteemed his friend
  ship,   and valued his accomplishments.
    John Blackwood, Esq.               By Principal Sir Alex. Grant, Bart.
      John Blackwood, who died on the 29th October last, was for a
   long  period one of the         most widely    known and higldy        esteemed
    worthies  of Scotland.      As    head of the last remaining of the great

 330                 Proceedings          of the Royal Society
Edinburgh publishing houses, he held an eminont and conspicuous
position ; his name was known and honoured all over the                           world    ;
the circle of his acquaintance included almost all the most                       distin
guished writers of the day, many of whom were his close and                          inti
mate    friends   ;  and    the chorus of regret           uttered by the       London
newspapers       on the occasion         of his death       showed how widely and
how much he had been respected.                   His life    was externally   unevent
ful.   He was born in 1818             ; was educated      at the   High School and
University of Edinburgh            ;  travelled for throe years under an accom
plished classical tutop upon the Continent                ; commenced      learning the
publishing      business     with Messrs Whitaker in London                   in   1839 ;
took charge       of a branch of Messrs Blackwood's                   in Pall Mall      in
1840;      returned to        Edinburgh        in  1845,      and became      editor    of
" Blackwood's Magazine           ;
                                    "
                                       and in 1850 became head of the pub
lishing firm in George             Street.      Happily married, and pursuing
with conscientious       diligence and great success the interesting duties
of his position, keenly enjoying both work and relaxation, entering
with equal zest into manly exercises and the intellectual pleasure of
literary and witty conversation,            to which he himself was no mean
contributor, ever unselfish and taking an interest in others, diffusing
much happiness        among      those who came           within his    range, he con
tinued to exhibit      till  three years ago, when his health began to                fail
him, a career of high usefulness            and a lot that was singularly blest.
Ho continued in harness to the last, and within a few hours of his
death was still reading the manuscripts of authors.                      He became a
Fellow of     the Royal Society of Edinburgh                in  1857.    He was never
a  contributor to the
                            " Proceedings " of        the Society.      This, however,
was only     in  accordance     with     the rule which he had laid down               for
himself, which was to abstain from authorship, in order to be able
to estimate     dispassionately and free from all feeling of rivalry the
productions of others.              Socrates    used    to   say  of himself     that in
matters of philosophy he performed the obstetric function                        for   the
 youth of Athens, helping into existence                  such   conceptions as were
worthy to live and come before               the world.       The same sort of func
tion John Blackwood performed for literature in this country.                          He
was singularly      fitted both by nature            and education for the duties
of his office.       His knowledge of            belles lettres, as well as     of  man
kind, was extensive,         and he had a remarkable sagacity             in discerning

ind foreseeing in the works of new writers, not only what was likely
to be     acceptable to the public, but what was essentially good in itself.
During his thirty-four years of editorship and his twenty-nine years
of    publishing,     he is said to have hardly ever made            a  mistake, while
he    frequently     accepted works which had been rejected by other pub
lishers, because he saw their merit, and the event                     proved him to
have      been right.      In  business    transactions he was at once prudent
and     liberal, and     always    exhibited the qualities of        a perfect    gentle
man.         The result    was a goodly and       brilliant galaxy of     great   names
 in   literature,   who were his clients, and whose immortal works were
first     brought     before   the   world    under his auspices.           The    Poyal
 Society      of Edinburgh,       one  of  whose   objects     is the encouragement
 of literature,     must ever honour one who has been                  bo  faithful and
 valuable      a servant and minister of the muses.                 And this Society,

       [James Clerk-Maxwell, born in 1831, was the only son of John
   Clerk-Maxwell        of Middlebie.         His grandfather, Captain James
   Clerk, was a cadet       of  the old Scottish family of        (Jerk of Penicuick,
   being a younger brother of          Sir John Clerk of Penicuick.              Captain
   James      Clerk had two sous and a daughter — the Right Hon. Sir
   George     Clerk of Penicuick, Hart., the above John Clerk-Maxwell,
   and    Isabella, who married James "VVedderburn,               Solicitor-f5eneral    of
   Scotland.       Sir  George     Clerk   succeeded     to the estate of Penicuick,
   and     the younger brother,       John,    to the estate      of Nether Corsock,
   part    of the estate of Middlebie.            This    estate had come into the
    family through      the   marriage    in  a former generation       of a cousin of
    the   Penicuicks with      a  Miss Maxwell.         Their daughter married Sir
    George     Clerk (grandfather of        the  present     baronet) and was Lady
    Clerk-Maxwell.         John Clerk        assumed     the name of Maxwell on
    succeeding to the property, which           by tho entail of Penicuick could
    not be    held by the owner of that estate.            John Clerk-Maxwell         was
    called to   the Scottish bar, but seldom         practised, and ho was a well-
    known member of this            Society.     He lost his wife soon after his.

his estates and the education of his sou.]
   When I first made Clerk-Maxwell's acquaintance                about thirty-five
years  ago, at the      Edinburgh Academy, he was              a year before    me,
being in the   fifth class while I was in the fourth.
   At  school he was at first regarded      as   shy and rather     dull;  he made
no friendships, and ho spent         his occasional    holidays in reading old
ballads, drawing curious         diagrams,    and making        rude mechanical
models.     His absorption in such pursuits, totally unintelligible to
his schoolfellows (who were then quite innocent of mathematics),                  of
course procured him a not very complimentary nickname, which                       I
know is still remembered        by many Fellows of this Society.             About
the middle of his school          career, however,      he    surprised his com
panions    by suddenly becoming one of the                 most brilliant among
them,   gaining high, and sometimes           the highest, prizes      for Scholar
ship,   Mathematics,       and English verse composition.               From this
time forward     I   became    very intimate with him, and we discussed
together,  with school-boy       enthusiasm,     numerous curious problems,
among which      I  remember     particularly the various plane sections of
a ring or tore, and the form of a cylindrical              mirror which should
show one his own image unperverted.                I still  possess   some of the
MSS. which      we exchanged       in 1846 and early in 1847. Those by
Maxwell     are   on    " The Conical Pendulum," " Descartes' Ovals,"
" Meloid   and   Apioid,"and "Trifocal Curves."             All  are drawn up in
strict geometrical      form and divided into consecutive             propositions.
The three latter are connected         with his first published        paper, com
municated by Forbes to this Society and printed in our " Proceed
ings," vol. ii., under the title
                                     " On the Description        of Oval Curves,
                                            "
and those having a plurality        of foci    (1846).
   At  the time when these papers were written               he had received no
instruction   in Mathematics beyond         a   few books of Euclid, and the
merest elements of Algebra.
   The winter of      1 847 found us together in the classes of Forbes and
Kelland,   where ho      highly distinguished himself.          With the former
ho was a particular favourite, being admitted to the free use of the
class apparatus    for original experiments.         He lingered       here behind
most of his former associates, having spent three years at the              Univer
sity of Edinburgh,       working (without      any assistance      or supervision/

with       physical and chemical apparatus,                             and devouring all sorts of
scientific       works in            the   library.*       During this period he wroto two
valuable         papers, which are                   published in our
                                                                        " Transactions," on
"The Theory               of Polling Curves," and "On the Equilibrium
of Elastic           Solids." Thus he brought to Cambridge in the autumn
of     1850 a mass of knowledge which                                was really immense                   for so
young a          man, but in           a state   of disorder appalling to bis methodical
private         tutor.      Though          that tutor was William Hopkins, the pupil
to     a   great      extent         took his own way               ; and       it    may   safely be said
that       no    high wrangler of                recent      years       ever        entered   the    Senate-
House         more       imperfectly         trained to produce                 "paying" work than
'lid       Clerk-Maxwell                   But by      sheer       strength of intellect,             though
with the          very minimum               of knowledge how to use it to advantage
under the            conditions         of the examination, he obtained the position
 if    Second Wrangler,                    and was         bracketed equal              with   the        Senior
 Wrangler in the higher ordeal of the Smith's Prizes.                                            His        name
 appears        in the Cambridge " Calendar                    "
                                                                   as   Maxwell of Trinity, but                   he
 was       originally entered at Peter-House, and kept his first term there,
 in that small           but most ancient foundation which has of late furnished
 Scotland         with     the       majority of the Professors of Mathematics and
 Natural         Philosophy           in her four universities.
       In 1856 he became Professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal
 College,        Aberdeen        ;   in 1860, Professor of Physics and Astronomy in
 King's College,           London.           He was successively                Scholar and Fellow of
 Trinity ; and was elected an Honorary Fellow                                        of Trinity when he
 finally became,           in    1871, Professor of Experimental                            Physics       in the
     University of Cambridge.                    There can be no doubt that the post to
  which he was            ultimately called was one for which he was in every
     way   pre-eminently             qualified   ;   and the Cavendish Laboratory, erected
     and   furnished under his supervision, remains                          as      remarkable       a    monu

to those who possess peculiarly ready mastery over symbols, whether
they try to understand the significance           of each step or no,     Maxwell
was not, and certainly never attempted             to be,  in the foremost     rank
of mathematicians.         He  was  slow in " writing out," and avoided            as
far as he could the intricacies of analysis.           He preferred always to
have before him a geometrical         or  physical representation of the pro
blem in which he was engaged,             and to take all his steps with the
aid of this     :   afterwards,    when necessary,       translating  them     into
symbols.      In    the comparative      paucity of symbols in many         of his
great papers, and in the way in which, when wanted, they seem                     to
grow full-blown        from pages of ordinary text, his writings resemble
much those of Sir William Thomson, which in early life               he had with
great wisdom chosen as a model.
    There can be no doubt that in this habit, of constructing            a mental
representation of every problem,           lay one of the chief    secrets   of his
 wonderful success as an investigator.            To this were added an extra
 ordinary power of penetration,        and an altogether unusual amount of
 patient determination.        The clearness of his mental vision was quite
 on a par with      that of Faraday    ;  and in this (the true) sense      of the
 word he was      a  mathematician of the highest order.
    But the rapidity of his thinking, which he could not control, was
 such as to destroy,      except for the very highest class of students,        the
 value of his lectures.       His books     and his written addresses (always
 gone over twice in       MS.)  are models of clear and precise exposition;
 but his extempore lectures exhibited, in a manner most aggravating
 to the listener, the extraordinary        fertility of his imagination.
     During his undergraduateship in Cambridge he developed the
 germs of his futuro great work on "Electricity and Magnetism"
 (1873) in the form of a paper "On Faraday's Lines of Force," which
 was ultimately printed in 1856 in the " Trans. of the Cam. Phil.
 Soc."    He showed me the MS. of the greater part of it in 1853.                 It
 is a paper    of great interest in itself, but extremely important               as
 indicating the first steps to such a splendid result.              His  idea of   a
 fluid, incompressible and without mass, but subject to              a species    of
 friction in space, was confessedly         adopted from the analogy pointed
 out by Thomson in 1843 between              the steady flow of heat and the
 phenomena     of statical electricity.
    In  recent years ho came to the conclusion that           all such  analogies,

depending        as they do on Laplace's equation,            were best symbolised
by the     quaternion notation with Hamilton's             v operator    ;  and in conse
quence,     in his work     on electricity, he gives the expressions             for all the
more     important physical quantities in their quaternion form, though
without employing the calculus itself in their establishment.                        I have
discussed     in another     place  (" Nature,"    vol. vii. p. 478) the various im
portant discoveries        in this   remarkable     work, which of itself is suffi
cient to secure        for its author    a foremost    place among         natural philo
sophers.        I may    here state that the main object of the work is to do
away     with " action     at a distance," so far at least as electrical and mag
netic forces are concerned,           and to explain these by means of stresses
and     motions of tho medium which                is required to account for the
phenomena of light.            Maxwell has shown that, on this hypothesis, tho
velocity of      light is  the ratio of the electro-magnetic          and electro-static
 units.      Since this       ratio, and the actual        velocity of light, can be
 determined       by absolutely independent           experiments,      the theory can
 be  put at once to an exceedingly severe preliminary                      test.    Neither
 quantity is yet fairly known within about                 2 or 3 per cent., and          the
 most     probable values of both certainly agree more closely than do tho
 separate      determinations of either.         There can now be little doubt
 that Maxwell's         theory of electrical phenomena             rests upon founda
 tions as secure as          those   of the undulatory theory of light.                  Hut
 the   life-long work of its creator has left it still in its infancy, and
 it will probably require for its proper               development tho services of
 whole generations of mathematicians.
     The next in point of date of Maxwell's                    greatest      works is his
  "Essay on the Stabilityof Saturn's Rings," which obtained the Adams'
  Prize    in  1859.     In this admirable investigation           he shows that         it is
  dynamically impossible that these rings can bo solid, and also that
  they cannot be continuous            liquid   masses   ;  the only other available
  hypothesis,      viz., that they consist        of multitudes of discrote             parts,
  each a     satellite, must therefore be the correct one.
      Another subject which            he   treated   with great success,            as  well
  from the experimental as from the theoretical                     point of view, was
   the    Perception      of Colour,      the   Primary      Colour     sensations,       and
   the    Nature     of Colour      Blindness.        His    earliest   paper      on these
   subjects bears date 1855, and the seventh                 has the date 1872.            He
   received     the Rumford        Medal     from    the    Royal Society in            1860,

 " For his      Researches    on    the     Composition     of Colours, and other
optical papers."        Though a triplicity about colour had long been
known or suspected,          which Young had (most probably correctly)
attributed      to the existence of three sensations, and Brewster had
erroneously* supposed           to   be objective,      Maxwell   was     the first to
make colour-sensation the subject of actual measurement.                    He proved
experimentally that any colour C (given in intensity of illumination
as  well as in character) may be expressed in terms of three arbitrarily
chosen standard colours, X, Y, Z, by the formula
                               C =    oX    +  bY   + cZ.
Hero a,    b, c are    numerical      coefficients,    which may be positive           or
negative    ;  the   sign = means         "  matches," + means
                                                                       " superposed,"
and    -  directs the term         to   be taken to the other side of the
equation.
    The   last    of   his greatest      investigations     bore    on the     Kinetic
Theory of Gases.           Originating with D. Bernoulli,           this theory was
advanced      by the successive labours of Herapath, Joule, and particu
larly of Clausius, to such an extent             as   to put its general      accuracy
beyond a doubt.           But by far         the  greatest    developments      it   has
received are due to Maxwell,            part of whose mathematical work has
recently been still further extended in some directions by Boltzmann.
In this iield Maxwell         appears      as an experimenter (on the laws of
gaseous     friction)    as  well    as a      mathematician.        His two      latest
papers    deal    with this branch of physics             ;  one   is an     extension
and simplification        of some of Boltzmann's chief results, the other
treats   of the kinetic      theory as applied to the motion of the radio
meter.
    He has written an admirable text-book of the " Theory of Heat,"
which has already gone through several editions, and a very excel
lent elementary treatise          on   " Matter      and Motion."        (See,   again,
"Nature,"       vol. xvi. p. 119.)        Even this, like his other and larger
works, is full of valuable matter,               worthy     of the most attentive
perusal    not of students alone but of the very foremost scientific
men.

ments by which Brewster's view was maintained, for the subjective              character
of the triplicity has not been absolutely demonstrated.

 Researches      of the Hon. Henry Cavendish."             This work    has appeared
 only   within    a month or two, and contains many singular and most
 unexpected       revelations as to the early progress            of tho science       of
 electricity.
     The works which we have mentioned would of themselves indicate
 extraordinary activity on the part of their author, but they form only
 a  fragment     of what he has published         ;  and when we add to this the
 further statement, that Maxwell was always ready to assist those who
 sought advice or instruction          from him, and that he has read                over
  the proof-sheets       of many works by his more           intimate     friends (en
  riching them by notes, always valuable and often of tho quaintest
  character), we may well wonder how he found time to do so much.
     Maxwell's early skill in versification developed            itself in later years
  into real   poetic talent.     But it always had      an object, and often veiled
  the  keenest     satire   under an air of charming innocence and naive
  admiration.       No living man      has shown a greater power of conden

title   " British Association, 1874," in November of that year.
    It  is to be hoped that these scattered        gems may be collected and
published, for they are of the very highest interest,               as the work
during leisure hours of one of the most piercing intellects of modern
times.     Every one of them contains evidence of close and              accurate
thought, and many are in the happiest form of epigram.
    I  cannot adequately      express in words the extent of the loss which
his early death has inflicted not merely on his personal friends, on
this Society, on the University of Cambridge, on the whole scientific
world, but also, and most especially,          on the cause of common sense,

of    true science, and of religion itself,       in  these days of much vain-

never     live in vain    ; and   in one sense at least they cannot die.          The

at   Lauriston House, Cheltenham, in the eighty -third year of his                age.
He was a        pupil of Sir Astley Cooper,      and entered     upon his profes
sion    sixty-two years ago       ; nor did he wholly relinquish       his practice
until 1878.         To him, during his practice in Canton              and    Macao,
belongs the merit of originating the first infirmary for the indigent
 Chinese,       which    was     called after   him    " Colledge' s Ophthalmic
 Hospital."        He   was also the founder of        the  Medical      Missionary
 Society     in China,    and continued to be president of that society             to
 the time      of his death   — a period of forty-two    years.    He laboured in
 Canton and Macao for more than twenty years, first under the Hon.
 East    India Company, and then under the Crown                as surgeon     to His
 Majesty's      Superintendents.        On the abolition     of the office he had
 held,     and    his consequent       return  to England,       deep    regret   was
 expressed       by the whole community, European and native, and                    a
 memorial       of his  services was addressed to Her Majesty the Queen in
 1838     by the Portuguese of the neighbouring settlement of Macao.
 l.ord    Palmerston, in recognition of his services and merit, thought
 it right to award him an annuity.            Dr Colledge took      the    degree of
  M.D.     in   1839,   and became      F.RC.P. of Edinburgh          in  1840, and
  F.R.S. of Edinburgh in 1844.              The last thirty-eight      years of his
  life were spent      in Cheltenham,      where   he won universal esteem by
  his courtesy and skill.

                           Professor    Piazzi    Smith.
    Elmslie     William Dallas,         the   second   son of  William Dallas
an underwriter at Llyod's, was born in London              on 27th June 1809.
He was educated at the Academy of Inverness, where he lived with
his aunt, Mrs Sweetland, widow of General Sweetland                 ; afterwards
for a short time he attended           classes at a commercial academy         in
London.
    In his twenty-second      year he decided to     follow art as a  profession,
and was admitted a- student of the Royal Academy in 1831.                     He
completed     his Academy studies in 1834.
    The next six years (1834-1840) were spent on the Continent.
 During this time he resided a winter in Munich, nine months in
Venice, and three years in Rome and its neighbourhood             ; he also spent
several weeks at Dresden and Florence, and visited many other Ger
man, Flemish, French,         and Italian cities.      Several portfolios filled
with highly-finished water-colour           copies of the most celebrated     pic
tures   in the galleries he visited, and also with original drawings,
sketches,    and etchings,    remain to testify the industry and skill with
 which during these six years the young artist pursued his studies.
    In   1838     (set. 29)  he exhibited      his first picture at the Royal
Academy — it represented the interior of           a Roman convent.
    Soon after his return to England in 1840, he was employed by
Herr Griiner       to assist in the  decoration of the garden pavilion          at
Buckingham Palace.
    In 1841-42       he sent some pictures to the Royal Scottish Academy,
which were well received and sold.             Li  consequence  of this success
he resolved to settle     in Edinburgh, and from      1842  until his death (i.e.,
from his thirty-third to his seventieth year) he continued to reside
there.      For  the next sixteen years (1842-58)         he was a regular con
tributor to the annual exhibitions of the Royal Scottish Academv.
 His chief pictures      were highly-studied interiors and mediaeval         sub
jects.    There were also several landscapes, notably some views of the
 Campagna       and its ruins.      His   last picture was exhibited    in 1858
 (set. 50).
    On    17th June 1846 he was appointed-assistant master of                 th»
architectural and ornamental class of the School of Design under

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                               341
the   Board    of Manufactures.          This appointment he held until 30th
September       1858, when he       was placed in retirement by the Treasury
in order to carry into effect the affiliation               of the school with the
Science    and    Art Department of South Kensington.                   His connection
with this school, therefore, extended              over  a period of twelve years
(at.  37-49).
    On 3d    March      1851 he was elected a        Fellow of    the Royal Society,
to  which he continued to belong until his death.
    On   16th     June 1859      (set.  50)   he married       Jane Fordyce,       eldest
daughter     of the late James Kose, W.S.               Soon after his marriage he
commenced the practice           of photography as a profession, and applied
the process      of carbon-printing, with great success, to the illustration
of books.
    In 1870       (ast.   61) his health, which had previously been very
good,   was severely shaken by blood poisoning from bichromate of
 potash used     in   the process of carbon printing.
    In  1872, when         smallpox was prevalent in Edinburgh,               he caught
 the  infection from one of his assistants, and had a very severe attack
 of that disease.        In the autumn of      1877, while on a      visit  to London,
 he  had a very serious attack         of typhoid    fever, and never thoroughly
 recovered    from the prostration of strength which followed the fever.
 The   long-continued cold of the winter of 1878-79 tried him greatly.
 An attack     of inflammation, brought         on by a cold caught         in January
 1879, was      the cause of his death, which took place at Dean-bank
 House    on the 26th day of that month.
    Such were the incidents           in the uneventful but by no means un
 worthy   life of Elmslie William Dallas.            As   regards pecuniary results
 it was   a life of unsuccessful effort          ;  but as regards the spirit          in
 which the work          of his life   was   done, and the intrinsic         value and
 perfection of that work,          E.   W. Dallas's       efforts   to   do   well   and
 thoroughly things worthy to be done, accomplished nrach that was
  admirable,   in   a manner that was most            instructive      and   exemplary
 to all who had opportunities of observing the wealth of earnest lucid
  thought   and the patient skilfulness of hand with which he worked
 out  his results.
     On   2d February,       the Sunday       following      his funeral,     the   Rev.
  John  M'Murtrie, speaking from           the pulpit of St Bernard's,         in which

342                       Proceedings         of the Royal Society
said   : — " His beautiful            features,   his grave      almost sad expression,         as
of one who had fought life's battle and was wearied, were                              familiar
to us all      ;  but most of us could only guess at the                   worth, the truth,
the goodness which lay under that reserved demeanour,                          for he shrank
from prominent positions, and had that low estimate of his capacity
for public           affairs   which      often characterises         the   very best.       But
whatever he undertook he earned out thoroughly.                              His was     a  pure
and chastened life             ;   its brightest side not seen            by the world, but
shining in his             own home for those who were dearest to him.                        In
severe       illnesses — of which he had several — he                      was    gentle    and
patient      ;   but   I  never knew how brave he was                till I saw  him face the
last enemy without fear, in lowly trust in his blessed Saviour."
    Professor Piazzi Smyth, who knew him well and had intercourse
with him more or less frequent for                          a period of upwards of thirty
years (from 1816             until his     death),    thus bears testimony to what he
terms      "  the high calibre of his character."
    E.    W. Dallas         was (the Professor says) undoubtedly a remarkable
man     :  gifted with a naiee simplicity of mind and thorough goodness
of heart,         as   well as with no uncertain abilities of head and hand.
Each singly of an admirable kind, and collectively very rarely found
combined            in   the     same individual.           Yet   so   modest    and retiring
withal,        was the       possessor     of   them,     that these rare abilities were
little known.
    The mere extent of his knowledge in the fine arts, and the great
number of his acquisitions in the exact sciences, were, to say the least
of them, very noticeable.                 P,ut still   more noticeable was the thorough
soundness           of his knowledge of every subject he had studied; so
that     I  find now, on looking back through the years that are gone,
this far higher commendation for him than any amount of local
success or of temporary celebrity                    ;  viz., that almost whatever            he
said,     or did, at any time, has stood                  :   having been proved by sub
sequent        experience         to be     true; and       I  have    never regretted any
moments           I   have    spent     in his    company,        either listening      to his
opinions or discussing his views.
    I first met him in his capacity                 as   a teacher     of the architectural
and ornamental class in the Trustees' School of Design, in the Royal
Institution.           The outlines to be copied              were  of  large size,  of  classi
cal severity, and yet not without poetical feeling; and he taught with

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              343
 (access,     both morning and           evening,   a class   of  between seventy     and
 eighty     youths.
    Equally       skilful was      he at home     in modelling exquisite ideal forms
in clay or      wax ; or in carving in       wood, some of Nature's choicest leaves
and flowers,         with    a delicacy of imitation which            made a charming
approach        to the beauty of the originals.
    At other times            he would      take   up his palette     and either paint
landscapes         from     notes     of former continental travel        ;  or produce
figures,     usually of      the genre kind, which testified to his possession           of
considerable         powers of imagination, and of a lively memory well
stored      with reminiscences of extensive               mediaeval    reading.     Here,
then,       we    have     at once      powers    of multifarious      work, extending
over      a very considerable          range of the fine arts ; enough of itself to
 have     fitted    out most successfully          for the battle of life, many an
aspirant       for fama           But   to  all these artistic faculties, Elmslie      W.
 Dallas      added mastery of not a few branches of hard science                      ; as
 thus—
     1.   He wrote     a book on applied Geometry for the use of the School
 of Design, showing              complete    knowledge of the latest continental
 developments         of the subject.*
     2.   He prepared papers on the optical mathematics of lenses.
     3.   He entered at one time with zeal and fervour into the casting,
  grinding,      and polishing of the specula of reflecting telescopes.
     4.   He    made    experiments in improving             and adapting compound
  microscopes to special subjects of minute anatomy.
     5.   He   possessed a considerable range of chemical knowledge,                  and
  made     many experiments, both on largo and small scale, in crystallo-
  genesis.
    *
        In a report upon this treatise submitted to the Board of Manufactures on
  17th   June 1860, the late Professor Kelland writes :— " Regarded as a book of
  reference, which shall contain all the more important solutions of the ordinary
  problems of Practical Geometry, this treatise deserves very high commendation.
  The constructions adopted by the author seem in all cases to have been well
  selected ; and the arrangement,           founded on a classification of results, is
  eminently adapted to afford facility of reference."
     The Professor, however,        reported that, considered as an educational treatise,
  he did not think its arrangement          suitable for the instruction of youth ; and
  the result has confirmed this judgment.            As a class-book, Mr Dallas's treatise
  has been superseded          in the School of Art by a much less elaborate and
  more elementary        little book compiled by Mr J. S. Rawle, Headmaster of
  the Nottingham Government School of Art.

microscopic infusoria.
      7.   Long      before he adopted photography as a profession, and 'when
very few persons            in this country knew anything                    about it, he had
become conversant            with    the then newly -born art           in all its chemical, as
well       as   its optical and mechanical details            with
                                                              ;   and he had prepared,
his own hands, special and instantaneous apparatus for applying it,
on the one hand to record                  sun-spots as shown by a telescope ; and
on the other hand, to picture microscopic images                              of his favourite
forms of navicular
   Now, how could any ordinary man occupy himself with all these
arts and sciences, without being more or less shallow in some, and
proving an undesirable leader or adviser in others of them 1
     It    would be impossible         !   and yet     so    conscientious a student and
thorough a worker was E. W. Dallas, that he possessed skill and
solid acquirements in them all.                     Without pretension or direct effort
on     his part, he was             looked up to, as rather a notable authority,
in all of them,             by many persons             who        prosecuted     only   one    or
other single subject out of the many with which our late Fellow-
was conversant.
     At                     Edinburgh Photographic Society, estab
            a meeting of the first
lished by the late Sir David Brewster, when a novel kind of land
scape lens, invented by that very original                        genius the late   Mr Sutton,
was laid on the table, how the members                       in   general were non-plussed            !
It    was a fluid-corrected, achromatic,                    globular lens with           "butter
fly diaphragm"              stop, and producing equal illumination                    and good
definition over three times as wide an azimuthal angle as had ever
before          been    obtained.     Presently       Elmslie    W. Dallas entered the
room and sat down in a quiet corner,                        when it was perfectly delight
ful    to me (a non-professional looking on) to see how several                      of the    best
men in the             room brought the lens to him, told him all their hopes,
fears, and difficulties about               it,   and then hung expectant on his words
as    though they would prove infallible                    —and      if   he 6poke at all, his
words,           on such    a   matter,     might be accepted              as in fallible.     For
although, not only when questioned privately but also in public,
he was          often sufficiently     discourseful, yet he could be silent when
he chose         ;   and would not let popular applause, or personal requests,
or hope of gain move him                     to give out          a   single opinion on any

                            of Edinburgh,               Session 1879-80.                                   345
subject,     further than           he himself            had examined into                it,   after his
own     thoroughgoing             manner,          and to the satisfaction of the special
ideal     aspirations         of his own             soul.     And herein             was        the    most
individual         trait of the man — the                   rare cast of mind which                    made
him   a   most worthy member                     of the Royal Society of Edinburgh                     ;   yet
caused      hia   worldly     success        in life,   to fall far below his intrinsic worth
and     high capacities.
    Gifted        by nature with             a   sensitive soul,    responsive         to the love of
abstract       truth and appreciative of ideal beauty                         ;   ever inclined             to
 be   generous beyond his means, and quite incapable,                                  amidst higher
surroundings,          of bestowing serious and                    concentrated           attention on
petty affairs,       he worked at his profession (photography) in                            a     manner
regardless         of cost   ;    and not so much for profit, as for the sake of
the     scientific     interest         he       involuntarily     felt   in overcoming diffi
culties in.       the practice of the art.                  That   he did, from such motives,
procure the         most marvellous lenses and the most elaborate apparatus                                  ;
that he       tried, with patient and often long-protracted and expensive
 experiments, every new method in photography, was to his honour as
a   lover    of science       ;   but was not to his advantage as                      a   man of very
 limited means,            whose income mainly depended on daily studio work
        more certain kind.                And,       more    untowardly still for his success
 of
 a
 in   securing an adequate income,                       this taste for perfection and power
 in   all the objective of his art, was accompanied                           by      a   curious inner
 subjective        state    of mind, — by           a   kind of inward psychical craving,
 perpetually urging him to desire,                          that his knowledgo of whatever
 he
      touched, should be           if    possible more than perfect               :   persuading him
 too,   that      in order    to know thoroughly any particular thing in nature,
 he   should not only know and handle the thing itself, but that to be
 quite certain        about       it,   he ought also to become similarly acquainted
 with     everything else existent which, though outwardly excessively
 lite, was not             in reality        the very thing itself        ;   and might in con
 sequence, at some time or other, possibly deceive the unwary.                                         Under
 the pure,        but exacting, domination of which idea, carried as                             it    was by
 him to an         inordinately high degree, he appeared at last to think that,
 m the conduct              of his scientific inquiries, his chief duty                           consisted
  rather     in finding and proving                  a   negative  ;   than in either establish
  ing any         positive result, or in securing opportunities for the most
    brilliant mercantile          success.         Had he been heir to            a   large fortune he

 346                   Proceedings     of the Royal      Society
 would have rendered        services      of the most invaluable kind to          the
 science   of the age he lived in       ;   for with his eminent skill, persever
 ance,   and    capacity    for    untiring labour, joined          then   to ample
 pecuniary resources, he would have followed up most exhaustively
 all the least inviting paths of thought and experiment.                 And when
 ever he had traced the objects of his investigation, step by step,             both
 back to their sources, and onward to their final outcome and practical
 application, according to his own high ideas of efficiency in research,
 — he would       have   been equally ready,         if the  result of his labours
 proved to be something good,               true, and workable, to present      it as
 a free gift to others ; but    if  the contrary, to keep all the disappoints
 ment to himself.        And no self-sacrifice in thought or work would
 ever have    weighed with him for a moment, if by such devotion he
 foresaw    that the road to future success, through any very difficult
 labyrinth,    would     be  made      safer and straighter for others.          But
 without    any adventitious aids of either fortune or favour, E.                 W.
 Dallas did, in fact, to      a very great extent, fulfil the noble part for
 which    he was     in  a manner designed,          and specially endowed, by
 nature.     And living     as he did, conscientiously, day by day such             a
life, his soul could not but be advancing               pari  passu, and maturing
 itself to the end of his appointed time here below.
    His own work is finished      ; but his rare example has, without doubt,
 even unknown        to  himself, kindled the spark of          progress   and self-
 improvement in many another mind that was around him; and his
 noble qualities, not less excelsior in aim, but more practically applied,
 may reappear in his own family, in another generation, as well as in
a different field of labour.*

 2d   December 1809.           He  was sprang from a family which had been
long settled     in Glasgow,      and whoso names are often mentioned in its
annals.      He    received    the whole of his early education           at the   High
School    of Glasgow, and afterwards at the University.                  Subsequently
he    prosecuted      his medical studies       in the     University      under such
eminent     teachers      as  Thomas Thomson and Graham in chemistry,
Jetfray   in anatomy, Burns in surgery, Bodham in physic, Hooker,
the   elder, in botany, &c.          After taking his degree of M.D. in 1830
he   spent some time in Paris and other continental cities.                  Returning
home, he      in  1833 became a Fellow of that ancient body, the Faculty
of   Physicians      and Surgeons     of Glasgow.       Ere long he succeeded in
establishing      himself in an extensive         practice,    and   ever since     then
down to      his  decease he continued to practise           in Glasgow with great
 acceptance.       It   may show the       estimation in which he was held by
 his   professional brethren of the Faculty that he was exceptionally
 elected   again and again       as its  President.     This estimation was still
 farther shown       in   1862 when he was elected its representative             in the
 General     Council of Medical           Education     and     Registration.       This
 honourable and responsible            office ho continued to hold for fifteen
 years,   when he resigned, much to the regret            as   well of his colleagues
  in the  council     as  of the fellows of the faculty.          In that council      he
 was    not a very frequent speaker       — for he did   not lay claim to oratorical
  gifts— but when he did speak what he said was terse and marked                       by
 shrewd     common sense and judiciousness,               so    that he was always
 hstened    to attentively by the council, amongst whom he was greatly
  esteemed.
      He made few contributions to medical literature.                 In   1862, how
  ever, he   published " Medical Statistics of Life Assurance, being                   an
  Inquiry into the causes of Death among                Members of the Scottish
   Amicable Assurance Society from 1826               till 1860."       In this work,
  which    was very carefully          prepared,   ho   gave an       analysis of the
   diseases  which had proved fatal to the assured             as compared     with   the
   general  mortality.       This  was a valuable contribution to the medical
   department of       life  assurance,    and was well        calculated    to aid the
   medical referees     of assurance    companies    in  the selection      of lives for
   assurance.

    Down to    the period of his last fatal attack of typhoid          fever,  by
which he was cut off on the 2d of October 1879 after a brief illness,
Dr Fleming continued to perform with wonted                 energy  and ability
his duties, professional and otherwise,        and may truly be said to have
died in harness.     His    loss was greatly regretted      by a large circle of
patients,   by whom he was regarded with esteem and affection, and
by the public of Glasgow generally.            In conclusion, it   may be   truly
said that the history of      Dr Fleming is that of       a career modest and
uneventful, but useful, honourable, and successful to the last.
               Arthur Hay, Marquis of Tweeddale.
                           By Robert Gray, Esq.
    Artiiur Hay,    9th Marquis of Tweeddale, F.R.S., and president
of  the Zoological Society     of London,     was born on the 9 th November
 1824.    He was the second son of his             father, the 8th Marquis,
who was      a distinguished      soldier, and the first agriculturalist       of
his time.      Having    in his   eighteenth    year obtained a commission
in  the Grenadier Guards,        Lord Arthur Hay,       as he was   then called,
on attaining the rank of Captain about               a year   afterwards, went
out to India as A.D.C. to his father, who was Commander-in-Chief
at Madras.      At the end of     a few years service      in this capacity he
was appointed     A.D.C. to     the  Governor-General Lord Hardinge, and
served under him in the Sutlej campaign            of 1845-46.      He  was pre
sent at the decisive       battle of Sobraon, and on the conclusion of
the Treaty, by which the         British  became possessors    of the hill terri
tory west of the Sutlej and Cashmere, he, with several of his brother
officers, visited this part of the Himalayas      — a journey which     afforded
him ample       opportunities for prosecuting his favourite study, and
making    a largo collection of the birds of the country.
    During his residence in India,           Lord Arthur Hay formed           the
acquaintance of the late Dr Jerdon,         a distinguished Eastern natural
ist, who was in the early part of his life Assistant-Surgeon             at Fort
St George.      Subsequently he was on terms of intimacy with               other
eminent naturalists    ;  but he does not appear to have published more

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                          349
than    two scientific papers previous to 1866.            These two appeared in
the   Madron        Journal,      one   in 1844-45 entitled "Descriptions of
some    supposed new or imperfectly described species of Birds," the
other     in 1847 entitled " Notice of the Habits of the Large Indian
Boa or Bock Snake."
    In 1862 Lord Arthur Hay assumed the title of Lord Walden on
the   death     of his  elder   brother Lord Gifford, and for the next four
years    of his life was almost entirely occupied with his military and
other    duties, as indeed he had been for many years previously.                He
was    present     with his regiment       at the various battles fought during
the   Crimean war, and passed through the whole of that memorable
campaign        with distinction.        He took part in the siege of Sebastopol,
and received,       among other honours, the medal and clasp for the war,
 the   Sardinian medal of valour, the Turkish war medal,                  and the
 fifth class    of the    order    of the Medjidio.       Ho was ultimately pro
 moted     in 1860     to a Colonelcy       in  the Grenadier Guards, but was
 placed     on half pay in 1863.          In  1866, after becoming a Lieutenant-
 Colonel of the 17th Lancers, ho finally retired from the army, and
 betook      himself   to scientific pursuits.       For the next    ten years he
 resided at      Chislehurst,     during which period he contributed a most
 important series of ornithological            papers   to the " Proceedings and
  Transactions of the Zoological Society," the "Annals of Natural
  History,"
                 " Rowley's Ornithological Miscellany," " The Ibis," and
  other    periodical magazines       — many of   these papers specially referring
  to the    birds of India and the Eastern Archipelago.
     Upon the death of Sir George Clerk in 1868, Lord Walden was
  elected     President of the Zoological Society of London         — an   office in
  which      he discharged his duties        in  the most efficient  manner until
  his death.
     Lord Walden succeeded to the peerage and estates on the death
  of his    father in 1876      ;  and at that time, having taken up his resi
   dence    at the   family seat, Yester, in Haddingtonshire,           he entered
   upon the     investigation of the avi-fauna of the Philippine Islands, at
   which     subject he worked with extraordinary zeal, the result being           a
   most valuable      series of papers, thirteen      in number, which    appeared
   in the    " Proceedings of       the  Zoological Society," the last of which
   was   finished but a day or two before the author's death.
      The papers      of greatest value written by       Lord Tweeddale   appeared

   350                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
   between 1867 and 1878.             Those relate almost exclusively to descrip
  tions,  with   figures, of new species of birds from various parts of the
  world, and are looked upon as the most important contributions                     to
  ornithological       science   that have    been   published dining the same
  period in this or any other country.            No   one, indeed, can     look upon
  the masterly work of          Lord Tweeddale without feeling that by his
  sudden and premature           death an irreparable loss has fallen upon the
  science to which        he was devoted,      and  that many years must pass
  before ornithologists cease to deplore his untimely removal.
     In   1877    Lord Tweeddale published            fifteen   separate   papers  on
 ornithological       subjects,    and  in the following      year about the same
 number — the fourteenth            and last having, as already mentioned,       been
  finished only     a  few days before his death.          His loss, therefore,  came
 upon the scientific world at a time when his writings were being
 regarded    with     a  peculiar interest, and when he himself was every
 where being recognised           as the most able   ornithologist of his day.
     Lord Tweeddale died          at Walden Cottage, Chislehurst, on the 29th
  December     1878.        His collections of birds, which      are of great value,
 being    the repository of a largo number of type species described in
 the papers referred to, together with his valuable library              of scientific
 works, are bequeathed to his nephew,                 Mr R. Wardlaw Ramsay,
 himself an ornithologist of considerable           note.
              Dr James M'Bain.               By Eobcrt Gray, Esq.
     D u James M'Bain          was born at Logie, in Forfarshire,      in November
 1807.      After having spent some years               at  the   parish school of
Kirriemuir, and about three years as                  an apprentice      to a local
surgeon, he entered           upon the study of medicine at the University
of Edinburgh         in 1823.       Three years later, namely, in March 1826,
he    passed    his examination         at  Surgeons'     Hall, and received his
diploma when little more than nineteen years of                   age.   About this
time he removed          to St Andrews, where he spent upwards             of twelve
months; and in the autumn of 1827 he was appointed assistant-
surgeon to     H.M.S. " Undaunted," just then            commissioned     to proceed
to  India with     the newly-appointed governor,         Lord William Bentinck.
During this and           a  subsequent    voyage  in the same ship in 1829,
to the     Azores and Cape           do Verde Islands,      Dr M'Bain had but

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.                        351
limited     opportunities      of cultivating      his taste for natural history
pursuits,     but such leisure       as   he enjoyed enabled           him to collect
various notes       which,     although not published at the time, became
useful to    him in after life.
   In 1832, Dr M'Bain, in the capacity of                 assistant-surgeon,    joined
the
     " Investigator," a surveying ship, under              the command of Captain
Thomas,     who    was at that time employed          in  a  survey of the Shetland
Islands.      This survey       was   completed     in   1834,     and  was followed
by a    survey of the Orkney Islands, during which                   Dr M'Bain      and
Captain Thomas prosecuted            a series   of successful      dredgings in deep
water    between the two groups             of islands, as well        as  along their
shores.     Much interesting information             and     material resulted    from
their   joint labours, extending          over   a  period of sixteen years, and
was    freely   communicated to Messrs Forbes and Ilanloy and Dr
Harvey,      who    were   then engaged in bringing              out their important
works on      Molluscous Animals and British Seaweeds.
   After settling       for some      years    at  Elie, in Fifeshire, and         sub
sequently at      Leith    and    Trinity, Dr M'Bain continued               to devote
his time      and attention to the investigation of the marine                   fauna
of the   Firth of Forth      ;  aud while engaged in this he was the friend
and   frequent companion of Dr Fleming, Frof. Goodsir,                    Dr StrethUl
Wright, and other naturalists, who often accompanied him                        in his
dredging excursions.           During    these years he took an active interest
in the   proceedings of the Boyal           Physical Society, of which society
he was     twice president, and contributed             many papers of interest,
which appeared         at intervals     from 1859 to the time of his death.
He also   contributed to a Topographical work by the Bev.                  W. Wood,
Elie,    entitled    the " East Neuk of Fife,"           an     important catalogue
of the    Mollusca     of the Firth of Forth,          embracing 344 species —
244     of which were collected by             himself   ;   and while he was in
the   midst of such        labours     his friends had reason to regret that
the state   of his health and retiring         modesty      prevented     him under
taking    some     independent work          in which        he   might have done
justice to   his powers.       He  had an extensive        knowledge of compara
tive anatomy,      having at one period of his life enjoyed the advantage
 of studying    under Professor Owen of London               — a training to which
much of      the thoroughness of his knowledge                 as  a naturalist   may
 perhaps be    attributed.

 352               Proceedings       of the Royal Society
    In private life Dr M'Bain          was much esteemed by a large circle
 of friends.    A  man    of extensive reading, amiable and unobtrusive
in  manner,    ho quietly prosecuted       his practical work as a naturalist
 uninfluenced by any of the various theories which are not                     fully
supported by facts.         One scientific fact, indeed,         to use his own
 words, was to him worth all the poetry in the world.                      He took
a great interest     in  the  scientific studies of young naturalists, and
was at all times ready to give them            the benefit of his counsel and
wide experience.        Many     such    students now mourn           his loss    in
distant lands.
   Dr M'Bain died, after       a painful illness of some months' duration,
at  Trinity,  near Edinburgh,      on 21st March 1879.
    Professor JAMES Nicol.             By Professor Archibald Geikie.
   1n   the death of Professor James         Nicol    the Society has to regret
the   loss  of one who served         to   link    the   present generation of
geologists   with   the   early leaders      of the    science  in this country.
Trained in this university under Jameson, he imbibed that love for
the mineralogical side of geology           which distinguished         his career.
His earliest scientific publication — an essay on the geology of his
native county of Peebles — was awarded a prize by the Highland
Society,    and was issued       in their " Transactions."           At   the  time
of its appearance very little had been added to the original observa
tions of Sir James Hall, communicated             to Hutton, and published in
the  "Theory of    the  Earth," regarding       the structure and constitution
of the so-called schistus or Jcillas, forming the uplands of the south
of Scotland.      Mr Nicol,     however,     continued to devote         himself to
the investigation of this subject.         Ho was the first to suggest that
these rocks should     be  paralleled  with   some of the " Silurian" forma
tions made known by the researches              of Murchison     ;  and in subse
quent communications to the Geological Society of London he
brought forward contributions to the unravelling of the complicated
geology of these Silurian uplands of Scotland.               At    an early period
of his life he published a small volume under the title of
                                                                           "  Guide
to the Geology of Scotland."             Though chiefly compiled from the
published memoirs of previous observers, it was a meritorious and
useful work, giving within a small compass a trustworthy digest of

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              353
all    that    was    known      at the     time upon the subject.            A   more
important      work    was his well-known        " Manual of Mineralogy       "
                                                                                which
has   long been a standard book            of reference.
    His papers giving promise            of much ability, he was appointed to
the   important office of Assistant Secretary of the Geological Society
of  London, where he came into intimate                 relations with the leading
geologists      of the day.      Afterwards he became Professor of Geology
at   Queen's College, Cork
                                   — an office ho      soon vacated     for the chair
of  natural     history in   the Aberdeen University,          in the    discharge   of
the    duties    of which     he has spent       the larger   part of his scientific
career.
    For the last fifteen years            he  published    scarcely any scientific
papers,     devoting his time principally          to the business   of the College,
in which he        took an active interest.         During   summer,     however, he
 was    in the habit     of making excursions into the Highland mountains,
 where     he renewed his acquaintance            with minerals and rocks, which
 retained     their interest for him to the last.          Retiring in disposition,
 and     latterly in somewhat          enfeebled     health,   he  allowed     himself
 almost     to drop out of the acquaintance          of his fellow geologists, who
 rarely    had an opportunity         of seeing hira save by visiting him at
 Aberdeen,       or joining him in one of his Highland                rambles.     His
 unfailing     kindliness    and    readiness   to help others     greatly endeared
 him to his students.
                    Dr John Smith.            By Dr Batty Tuke.
     Dr   John Smith      was born in the year 1798.           His father combined
 the    business of brassfounder and farmer, renting the                  Calton   Hill
 and a     few adjacent fields.        It  may bo interesting to place on record
 that    Dr Smith's father's mother was born in 1685, the last year of
 the reign       of Charles     the   Second.      He was educated        at Heriot's
 Hospital,     by the Governor of which institution he was recommended
 to  Dr    George Wood, son of the well-known Dr Alexander Wood, as
  an  apprentice.       He took the degree of Doctor of Medicine in the
  Edinburgh University         in  the year 1822, and became a FcUow of the
  Royal CoUege       of Physicians in 1833.           After graduation     he acted as
  Dr Wood's assistant,       and eventually succeeded to his practice, which
  included     the   management       of the Saughton HaU Asylum               for the

  354                 Proceedings of         the  Royal Society
  Insane.     Ho was also visiting          physician to the old Charity         Work
 house and     City Bedlam in       the Forrest Road.          Dr Smith     was elected
 President of the Royal College of Physicians                    in  1865.     He died
 February      4, 1879.      Dr Smith's contributions to the literature of
 medicine were not numerous,               but were marked by extreme               con
 scientiousness      of observation.       His  most important papers          are "An
 Account      of Dysentery       as   it  occurred     in   the  Edinburgh Charity
 Workhouse during the years 1832 and                1833," and " Cases of Mental
 Derangement terminating fatally, with the Appearances disclosed                     by
 Inspection," both published iu the Edinburgh                   Medical and Surgical
 Journal       Dr Smith       was best known          in his connection with the
 treatment     of insanity, and he gained           a   considerable reputation       in
 that special line of practice.          It   cannot    be said that he displayed
 any great originality, his character being chiefly marked by accuracy,
 conscientiousness,       and solidity, which qualities, however, added to
great gentleness       of disposition, procured him the respect and esteem
of    a largo   circle of friends, and the confidence             of his professional
 brethren.

                            Ward Richardson, F.R.S.
     Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan,                      Bart.,  of Wallington in
Northumberland, Nettlecombe in Somersetshire,                      Seaton   in Devon
shire, and Trevelyan         in Cornwall, is another of the Fellows whom
the Royal Society of Edinburgh              has lost during the past year.          The
late   Sir Walter     was a scholar of the most            refined taste and varied
learning.      His mind through all           the stages of his long and active
life was devoted         to the acquirement and            improvement of natural
knowledge.         He   was born on the         31st of March        1797, his father
being the fifth baronet of his line, and his mother a daughter of
Sir Thomas         Spencer    Wilmot, Bart.          Sir Walter      commenced       his
university studies       as an  undergraduate at Oxford when he was about
nineteen    years of age, and      in   1820 passed as Bachelor         of Arts.   Soon
after this ho visited the Faroe Islands, and wrote an account of
them, including        a record of their geology,           vegetation,   and climate.
He also formed          a  collection of plants, making            a  line herbarium,

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.                        355
which       he presented       in after   years   to   the    Botanical     Museum at
Kew.
    In 1835       Mr Trevelyan married Paulina, the oldest daughter of
the late      Rev. Dr Jermyn, who lived until the year 1866.
    After the      British Association for     the Advancement of Science had
been     founded in 1831, Mr Trevelyan took              a deep    interest in its pro
gress.       He    served on the local committee           of the Association when
it met       in Neweastle in the year 1838, and he was afterwards                       a
member        of the Council of that learned body.              At    the thirty-second
meeting       of the Association in the year        1 802,  he was elected one of the
Vice-Presidents,         his colleagues     being    Sir   C.  Lyell, Hugh Taylor,
 Isaac    Lowthian      Bell    (Mayor of Neweastle), Nicholas               Wood,   the
 Rev.    Temple Chevalier, and Mr (afterwards Sir William) Fairbairn.
     Sir Walter came into possession of his estates and title in the
 year    1846, aud from that time resided              principally at his beautiful
 estate    at  Wallington,      near to Cambo, Northumberland,             a mansion of
 gteat    historic note, and once the seat of a famous                  Jacobite, whose
 opinions      cost hiin his life — Sir John Fenwick.                   He   was elected
 Deputy-Lieutenant of the County in 1847, and in 1850 served the
  office  of High Sheriff.
      His time was much devoted            to  the    improvement of agriculture
 and to     the social amelioration of the condition             of the people.       He
  also   took a deep interest in public affairs, and as far back as 1853
  he became       the first President of the United Kingdom Alliance                  for
  the   suppression     of the sale of intoxicating liquors, which office he
  continued to hold        until his   death.
      In addition to his tastes for science, Sir Walter Trevelyan was                    a
  willing patron of the fine arts,            and collected     at    Wallington    some
  exquisite     artistic works, in addition to a perfect museum of natural
  history.      He    was  a   Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and a
  zealous     antitpiarian, and has left to the British Museum and the
  Society     of Antiquaries valuable legacies. Ho was a clear and concise
  writer,     and contributed several very useful papers on geological               and
  botanical      subjects.     He was also a thoughtful and collected public
   speaker,    who made every sentence ho spoke                 tell, and who never
   wasted a sentence       or,   it may almost be said, a word.
       In   1867    Sir Walter married, for        the second       time, Laura Capel,
   the    daughter     of Capel     Lofft, Esq., of Troston Hall, Suffolk, who
       vol. x.                                                                -i v

356                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
survived him only for a few days.                He had     no issue, and his       title
has descended       to his nephew,         Sir Alfred W. Trevelyan of Nettle-
comhe,     the    present    baronet.       Wallington he bequeathed to his
cousin,    Sir Charles Trevelyan, K.C.B.
    Sir Walter Trevelyan continued actively engaged in his various
pursuits until March 1879. He suffered a very short illness, having
been out a day or two before               his death, and was occupied, indeed,
with his     correspondence       on the morning of that day.            He suffered,
as   it seemed, from a cold, accompanied              with slight physical       depres
sion.     In   the course of March 23d he began suddenly to show signs
of exhaustion, and sank into death without                   any continued sign of
acute pain.       He   was   in  the eighty-third       year of his age at the time
of his death.
    The late baronet was elected              a  Fellow of the Royal Society           of
Edinburgh in the year 1822.
        Professor Heixrich           Wilhklm Dove.              By Alexander
                                    Buchan, M.A.
     Professor    Heinrich Wilhelm Dove               was born at Leignitz, Silesia,
 on October 6th 1803, and at the age                 of  eighteen    passed   from   the
 schools     of that town to the            universities of Breslau and Berlm,
 where for the next three years he devoted himself assiduously to the
 study of mathematics          and   physics.      In   1826 he took his degree        of
 Doctor of Philosophy, his thesis on the occasion                    being an inquiry
 regarding barometric changes            ;  and it is further significant of his
 future life-work that his first published memoir was a paper on certain
 meteorological     inquiries relative to winds — these two subjects holding
 a  first place in the great problem of weather- changes.
     In  the same year Dove entered on his public               life  as tutor, and in
  1828    as Professor      at  Konigsberg,       where    he  remained      till  1829,
 being then invited to Berlin          as   Supplementary Professor of Physics.
 His strikingly        clear-sighted,      bold,   and original      intellect    turned
 instinctively to that intricate group of questions                in the domain of
 physics which comprise the science of meteorology,                   and his success
 in these fields    as an  original explorer was so marked and rapid that
he soon       achieved    for himself       a   seat  in the Royal       Academy        of

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              357
Sciences, and sometime thereafter                was raised     to the distinguished
position      of the chair of physics in        the University      of Berlin.
    Among the scientific and fashionable circles of Berlin he took first
rank as a lecturer, the combined qualities of accurate                    science,  fine
imagination,       lucidity of   style, commanding presence, and the extent
over     which his utterances were heard, marking him out as the Arago
and      Brewster     of Germany.         Germany showered            on him in pro
fusion those honours and            offices which      it gracefully and gratefully
bestows       on learning and science       ;  and perhaps there is no learned or
scientific society of note that has not Dove's name enrolled among
its   honorary members.           After   a protracted and hopeless illness he
died      on   Friday April       4th 1879,        in   the seventy-sixth      year   of
bis age.
    In the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers the lists
under Dove specify 234 memoirs, written between the years 1827-
73.      These show him to have been             a successful    worker and investi
gator     in electricity,   optics,    crystallography, and in such practical
matters      as the metric systems of civilised            nations.    But it   was to
 meteorological       inquiries that he devoted           his full strength and the
whole      powers of his mind, and by his herculean, but well-directed
 labours,     he has written his name         in  large imperishable characters      on
the    records of science.
    His fame rests on the successful               inquiries he carried out with       a
view to      the discovery of the laws regulating atmospheric phenomena,
 which     apparently were under no law whatever.                   The work he will
 be   long best known by is his isothermals and isabnormals of tem
perature      for the globe, in which work one cannot sufficiently admire
 the     breadth    of view which        sustained and animated him              as  an
 explorer     during the long toilsome years spent in its preparation.
 Equally characterised        by breadth of view, and what really seemed a
 love    for the drudgery of detail even to profuseness,                   when such
 drudgery      appeared necessary or desirable in attaining his object, are
 various    works on winds, the manner of their veering, and their rela
 tions to     atmospheric pressure,       temperature,       humidity    and   rainfall,
 and the     important bearings of the results on the climatologies of the
 globe ;    on storms and their connections with the general circulation
 of the atmosphere       ; the  influence of the variations of temperature           on
  the   development     of plants   ; and the cold weather of May — to which

358               Proceedings        of the Royal Society
may be added       the valuable system          of meteorological observations
he gradually organised       for Germany, and the many             full discussions
of these which he published from year to year.
   It  is no ordinary praise to pass on his work to say that those
views ho propounded, which subsequent                   researches   are   likely   to
modify materially, are those he arrived at by methods of investiga
tions, necessarily    defective,     at   the   time.    Thus,    for instance,    in
inquiring into the law of storms, it was not in his power                    to work
from isobaric charts, seeing that the errors of the barometers                   and
their heights above the         sea were      only known in a very few         cases.
When     we consider    the condition        in which     he found man's know
ledge   of weather and        the   large   accessions     and developments         it
received   from his hand, the breadth of his views on all matters con
nected   with   the  science, and the well-directed patience,           rising into
high genius, with which his meteorological              researches   were pursued,
there can be but one opinion, that these give Dove claims which no
other meteorologist can compete with, to be styled " the father of
meteorology."
       Johann vox Lamont.                By Alexander Buchan, M.A.
   Johann von Lamont            was     a   Scotsman      by birth,   having been
born in Deeside on the Balmoral estate in 1805, of one of the oldest
of our Scottish families.         At   the age of seventeen       he left Scotland,
to which he never returned,         in the prosecution of his studies in         con
nection with the Roman Catholic Church.                    Whilst a faithful      and
zealous member of the clergy of that communion, it was to the Exact
Sciences he devoted       the  full   powers of his singularly energetic and
penetrating intellect.      His first contribution      to science was published
in 1829, in the twenty-fourth year of his             age,  the subject being the
Motions of Encke's Comet, and from that date to 1870 the Royal
Society's Catalogue      of Scientific Papers        enumerates     no fewer than
107, ranging widely over the domain of physics, and several of which
take their places as classics in the departments            of science with which
they deal.
   His   most extended      work is his " Hand-book of Magnetism," pub
lished   at   Leipsic in 1867 as one            of a   series of   works     forming
a general Encyclopedia of Physics, under the editorship of Karsten,

                                of Edinburgh,          Session 1879-80.                              359
and     in this department of knowledge                          he was one of the greatest
authorities.               In      meteorology        proper,     the     manner in          which     he
presented,       and       discussed     the facts of observation of the diurnal baro
metric         range, and the aqueous                  vapour of the atmosphere,               and the
theories he propounded therefrom,                        were eminently original, and                will,
we    believe, always continue to be read, however much they may be
modified        or     even overturned by future research.                       In   astronomy, Pro
fessor   Lamont's chief work was his Catalogues of Small Stars between
15°    north and 15° south of the equator, being supplementary to the
larger    work under this              head of Argelander and Bessel.                 As early as
1851      he demonstrated the existence                         of    a   decennial cycle in the
diurnal range of the magnetic declination, which was more recently
conclusively shown to correspond                         with        the cyclical frequency and
abundance             of the sun spots.
      He was appointed Director of the Bogenhausen                                    Observatory at
Munich           in    1835, and Professor of Astronomy                      in the University of
Munich in 1852.                     He died at Bogenhausen                early in the morning of
Wednesday              the 6th of August          in    the seventy-fourth year of his age.

      The following communications were read                                 :   —
  1.     On the Expansion of Cast Iron while Solidifying.  By                                         J.
          B. Hannay, F.B.S.E., F.C.S., and Robert Anderson.
      The fact that certain bodies                    expand on solidifying,           as   in the   case
 of water,        has long been well known,                      and      this property has been
 recognised           in   some of the metals, owing to their                filling    the mould      in
 which they are cast so as to reproduce                         the finest lines.           The fact of
 their so doing              is,   however,   only known qualitatively — no                    accurate
 measurements               having, so far       as    we are aware, been recorded.                  The
 property being of great interest to ironfounders, we have undertaken
a     series    of experiments to determine                     its real value — the materials
 being     put at our disposal by Messrs M'Dowall, Steven,                                   &   Co., to
 whom          we tender our best thanks.                  We used several methods, and

360                     Proceedings           of the Royal Society
will show         the reasons       for selecting      one as the most             reliable.           On
pouring iron into a sand mould there                      is,   at the moment         of solidifica
tion some overflow; but no matter how tightly the sand was rammed,
or to what temperature              the mould was heated, the overflow varied so
very much as to show that, as                a     method of measuring            the expansion,
pouring the iron into           a   sand mould was quite useless.                     The experi
ments       conducted in this way showed an expansion of from 0-8 to
4   "5   per cent., showing the method to be unreliable.
    We then tried pouring the metal into                          a    hollow sphere of iron
whose capacity has been accurately determined.                                  The sphere, how
ever, seemed to yield            in   some parts, so that the overflow did not
represent      accurately     the real expansion           ;     but by weighing the filled
sphere      and    the overflow, after we had arrived at an approximate
value for the liquid iron's density,                  a   more reliable estimate               of the
expansion was found.    This method                     gave results varying from                  4   to
5   per cent.      of expansion, but the results were always low.                                  The
method which gave not only the most concordant results, but which
would a      priori    be    likely   to yield the most            accurate       estimate of the
expansion,        was that of floating          a   solid sphere of iron in liquid iron
of the same composition.                The metal used was ordinary grey pig,
and was contained in            a   large    pot and brought to             a   temperature        near
its freezing point and spheres of metal dropped in.                             They were found
to sink at once when dropped                  in    cold, and they remained             under the
metal      till they   had acquired         a   temperature        just approaching           visible
red   ;   but at that temperature             they rose to the surface, and                  as they
gained more and more heat from the                      liquid     metal their line of flota
tion rose higher and higher.                    Sometimes,        if   dropped in suddenly,
the spheres did not float             until they had            begun to melt, but this was
owing to their having cemented themselves to the bottom of the                                     pot.
When dropped in cautiously, or suspended by                            a   wire, they sank only
for the space of 20 to 25 seconds, and rose to the surface when barely
red hot.       The spheres were allowed to remain in the liquid                             till   they
began to melt, and then withdrawn                     and cooled, when            a   well-defined
mark of the line of flotation was seen round the sphere.                              The    spheres

The first method          always yields the highest results owing                     to the
diameter     of the segment appearing larger than it really is                ;    this being
caused by the ridge of metal and scum which marks its flotation line.
The difference      between      the two is not very great, but we take the
value given by the last formula as the correct one.                     The amount by
this method        is 5-62   per cent, of expansion.           Further        experiments
were      tried by heating balls of iron to various temperatures                           and
immersing them in the liquid iron to find at what temperature                             they
ceased to sink      ;   but this method     fails for two reasons, — 1st,            the iron
freezes a quantity of metal on its exterior, thus increasing its volume                        ;
and 2d, it gains heat so rapidly that before equilibrium is established
its temperature         has risen several hundreds of degrees.
     The expansion obtained by the above method is rather under the
truth, because, although the sphere is just at its melting-point, the
liquid iron is of        necessity    considerably above      it,   so that    it   is   not at
its maximum density, which appeared                   to be very     little   if   any above
the mcltiug point.
     We find,   then, that    liquid    cast iron expands at least       5    -62 per cent,
of its volume on freezing.
2.    Researches        on Contact Electricity.           By C. G. Knott, Sc.D.
                        Communicated by Professor Tait.
                                        (Abstract.)
     In   these experiments the general method pursued was                          by   direct
contact and separation of two circular plane metal disks, the lower
one of which was insulated and connected                  to one pair         of   quadrants
of   a    Thomson quadrant electrometer.               The upper disk or plate                of
this condenser          arrangement     pressed during    contact on the lower               by
its own       weight,     and was       in connection with the other pair                     of
quadrants and with tho earth.                 The lower plate formed the upper
surface of     a   cylindrical flask, whose temperature             was determined           by

                         of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.
that of the       water contained within it.          In this way     contact experi
ments     with    surfaces    at different temperatures     were made and results
obtained.       In   the method     which gave most reliable results, tho upper
surface     was kept at the temperature of the air, while the temperature
of the    lower was allowed to vary as the water contained in the metal
flask cooled       through time.         The contact, effected by lowering the
upper plate upon the lower from a height of 5 inches,                      was  instan
taneous, so      that the temperature        of the upper surface did not change
during the operation           ; while immediately before       every such contact,
both    surfaces were carefully polished with emery paper and dusted,
and    their temperatures          carefidly observed.      The best results       were
 obtained     when both the surfaces            were  of the same metal,         as,  for
 example,     iron against iron.         When that      was the case there was, of
 course,    no electrification by contact and separation           when both plates
 were    at the same temperature.            When, however, the temperature            of
 tie lower      surface     was raised, a deflection on the electrometer           scale
 was   obtained, indicating a difference of electric potential at the sur
 face   of separation of these metal plates.          Thus it was found that iron
 Lot was      negative to iron cold, copper          hot negative     to copper     cold,
 zinc hot    negative to zinc cold, and the same seemed to hold for tin.
 Not only so, however,            but the difference of potential between,           say)
 the   two   iron    plates increased     apparently with     the difference    of tem
 perature      between them,         and increased      uniformly.        Curves    were
 drawn      out representing the variation of this potential difference              with
  the  temperature       of the lower plate     ; and the points entered clustered
 approximately round three straight lines representing the temperature-
  variations    for iron,     copper, and zinc respectively.        The tangents        of
  the  angles     of inclination     of these lines to the temperature         axis are
  given    in the following table : —

 material alteration of the surface produced            by this change of tempera
 ture — oxidation, for     example.       That this is the most probable view
 is borne out by known facts, and by certain results                  which     I myself
 obtained relating to the subject of contact             electricity.      Hankel long
 ago showed      that,   with    the great   majority of metals,           there was     a
 negative-growth in time — for example, iron recently polished or filed
 was electrically positive to iron which had               been left    for some time
 in the air.    This    was probably due       to oxidation       ; and it became       a
 question of interest to           compare    this    " time-variation " with the
 " temperature-variation       "
                                  discussed   above,       A  series of experiments
 were made very similar to those           described     above     and differing    only
 in this, that the lower surface was permitted to vary through time,
 without    any alteration in temperature.               The     curves obtained      by
 plotting the electrometer          deflections against      the time were          very
 similar to the ordinary curves of cooling —somewhat                    logarithmic in
appearance ; and        markedly dissimilar         to   the curves       showing    the
"temperature-variation"           of the same metals.          Further,      that metal
 varied  in time     fastest,    which was     the most      positive    :  aluminium,
zinc, iron, and copper being their order, taking                first that one whose
curve of time-variation was steepest.              This result accords well with
 the theory given by      J.   Brown, Esq.,     of   Belfast, in the " Philosophi
cal   Magazine"      (1878-79),      to the   effect that      the   position of the
metals in Yolta's contact series depends            mainly,     if not entirely, upon
their chemical affinity for air, the most positive being that which has
the greatest    affinity.     That the most positive (aluminium,                namely)
should also be that which varies             fastest    in time is extremely pro
 bable ; and   it  is also a plausible enough           hypothesis that the most
positive should also have the most rapid negative-growth with tem
perature.     Now,     as  far  as  these experiments go, this is really             the
case.    Zinc, iron, copper, arc in the order of magnitude for tempera
ture-variation, and also for time-variation           ;  and the same order holds
in Volta's   contact series beginning with the most positive.                  It would
thus appear that for any one of the metals zinc, iron, copper, and
(we may     add) tin, there      corresponds    a  definite surface        condition to
every   temperature     — a condition which        is permanent        even    after the
surface has cooled, which has the effect of making the surface electri
cally negative to its original self, and which no amount of polishing
can alter as long as the temperature             is kept constant.            Hence we

conclude that a chemically pure surface of these metals is impossible
for more       than a very few seconds after cleaning, even                 if for   so long.
     These experiments are to be repeated                with    the aid of an improved
method       of effecting contact.
       3.    On an Instrument for detecting Co;il-G;is in Mint's.
                             By Professor George Forbes.
     In 1877,        shortly after the        disastrous colliery explosion in the
Blantyre pit,         in which hundreds of lives         were lost,    Mr James Young,
F.R.S., of Kelly,             described     to me an instrument           which      he had
thought of        for determining what is the amount of fire-damp in any part
of a    mina        This was the first thing which directed my attention to
the    subject, and       I very soon saw that there was a principle            in  acoustics
 which might he most admirably adapted                     to the end    in   view, viz., to
 determine the quantity of fire-damp                (ormarsh gas) by the diminution
 in density of the mixed air and gas (for marsh gas is only about half
 the   density of air).          Mr Young and myself tested the principle the
 next day, and found it to bo one of extreme delicacy.                       I then, in the
 spring of 1878, communicated to this Society the principle which                             I
 proposed       to utilise in the form of         a  preliminary note.         I  have now
 the    honour of exhibiting the instrument, which has been completed
  and perfected,         partly by my own labours and partly by the appoint
  ment,     for the purpose, of a Committee of the British Association,
  consisting      of Professor W.       J.  Adams, Professor Ayrton, and myself.
  The form        of instrument finally         adopted     is one in which        a tuning-
  fork is set into vibration          by drawing through between the prongs                   a
  tight-fitting piece of metal.            Just under       the points of the prongs a
  tube
          1J inch diameter        is fixed.     The lower end of this tube is closed
  by a    tight-fitting     piston, whose position in the tube can be altered so
   as to   regulate     the length of the closed tube.
      It  is a well-known         principle in acoustics         that when a vibrating
  tuning-fork       is so held over a tube, the air in the tube will resound
   and   intensify the sound when the tube has                 a  certain definite length.
   Moreover, this length depends              on the kind of air or gas with which
   the tube     is filled, being longer for      a  heavy gas, and shorter for         a light
   gas, at   the    same pressure.         Now    a  mixture of air and marsh gas is
   lighter    than pure air in proportion           as the   dilution with marsh gas is

3m;                           Proceedings of                    the   Royal Society
increased.              Thus, according              as there         is a large or small percentage of
fire-damp          in     a mine, so          will    the length of tube                  which best resounds
to the tuning-fork                  be great or small.
    There are one or two small practical details which have given some
trouble, but which now render the instrument very perfect.
    1.   In order           to give to the hand great control over the lengthening
and shortening of the tube,                           a    rack has been attached                   to the piston,
which works in a pinion on whose axis there is a large disc with                                                        a
milled head             3   inches in diameter.                      This disc       has a glass face          with     a
graduated          scale round the circumference                          ;   so that a fixed index marks
with great precision the exact length of the tube.                                            The scale is thus
made so large that readings                          cau be made              in    the feeblest light.
    2.   In       order       that the instrument may be taken in advance                                        of    a
lam})    in places where gas is expected                               in largo quantities,           a   phospho-
rescent powder is placed in a cavity behind the graduated glass plate,
by which means readings                           can be token in the dark.
    3.   To       bo sure that the gas or air in the tube is the same as what
is to bo found in the particular part of the mine under examination,
I   have introduced, through the piston which works the pinion, a rod
at the upper end of which                            is a packed          disc fitting the tube tightly.
Previous           to taking a reading this                           disc     is,   by means        of   a   handle
attached to the rod, driven up to the open end of the tube, and in
being drawn back                    it   sucks in the air from the place under observa
tion.         It      is    thus, by       a      single turn of the handle, locked to the
piston which works the pinion, by                                 a   bayonet joint.
    4.   The temperature                   in   a    mine       is   generally very constant.                  But    to
prevent errors arising from variations in the temperature                                                 a   thermo
meter        is   attached         whose graduations are given in Itercentages                                 of tin-
damp, which                 are    to be subtracted               from the percentages                recorded        in
the circular scale.
    5.   To test the accuracy of the scale,                               I        have   a   circular trough         4
feet diameter and                  3   inches deep.               This    is   partially filled with water,
and      a   grating        is    placed      in     the water to stand upon.                       In the     centre
of the trough there                      is   a   hole with an inch metal                         tube projecting
upwards           4     inches.          To this          is   attached       an india-rubber         tube     2   feet
long, with            a    mouthpiece which can be firmly attached to the mouth
for breathing.                    .Sitting on the stool with the mouthpiece attached,
and the nose closed by spring pincers,                                  a     tin    cover    4   feet high and        3

hole       in this cover, with glass over                 it,   at which    a      light    is   held on the
outside.            Different quantities of marsh                 gas are then admitted under
the cover,          which mix with the air by
                            I                                     means       of   a   fan.       A   reading
is   taken      with      the instrument, and at the same time                       a     bottle of water
is   emptied and closed air-tight.                       The contents of the bottle are after
wards         analysed      ;   and thus we obtain the true percentages                          correspond-
in? to        different readings of the scale.
     In this way                find   it   possible     to measure        the      proportion of fire
damp to         about    J I    per cent.
I          have taken           the instrument           down several         fiery mines, both in
Yorkshire            and Lanarkshire, and have found                               most       accurate      and
                                                                           & it
consistent           in its indications.             Messrs Merry                Cunninghame, after
trying        it,   have adopted it.           It   is   extremely portable,               can be carried
in   a     large coat-pocket,          and    is   not likely to be injured, and causes no
trouble.            In   fact, in this, its latest form,                 it    seems to answer               all
retirements.                Variations in the pressure of the air do not affect it.
 I         ought to add that although choke-damp (i.e., carbonic acid gas)
is    not often found             in   company       with   fire-damp,        yet even when this              is
the case,           and in sufficient quantities to prevent the instrument from
indicating            the   presence        of fire-damp         (choke-damp being as much
heavier         than common air               as    fire-damp      is   lighter), its presence pre
vents the fire-damp                from being explosive             ;    and thus the indications
of      the    instrument can in all cases be relied upon for indicating
danger.

                                                   (Abstract.)
      The author            commenced          by stating that he had been led to make
 farther       investigations, on the subject of his hypothesis                            as to the      nature
 of        comets, by some             comparatively recent              criticism to which that
 hypothesis had been subjected.                   Its main features had been published
 more       than ten years ago                    "              "
                                            in the Proceedings of the Society (May
     17,
           1869)      and in the         first volume of " Nature."                        Of    course,    if   a
 critic       completely misstates                 an hypothesis, he has                 no difficulty        in
 refuting       it   ;   so that to such writers the author does not attempt to
 reply.         The other class of critics, including                   Mr Glaisher, and              the late

                       Proceedings      of the  Royal Society
I'rof.   Clerk-Maxwell,        while on the whole favourable to the theory,
pointed out the necessity for           a full dynamical investigation,         whose
results might bo compared with observation.                 The author's own. con
viction has all along been that the difficulty is not so much dynami
cal  as constructional       : — i.e., it lies mainly in obtaining         u   proper
conception of the problem to be treated in the case of any particular
comet, and not in the way of obtaining at least an approximate                   solu
tion    when      once  the     problem     is stated.     The    fact is that     the
hypothesis is so very general that almost anything could be explained
by it.      When two considerable           masses    of stone,    moving approxi
mately in the same orbit, impinge on one another with given velocities,
what is the amount of smashing — how many large fragments,                       how
many small, how much             mere dust,    will  be  produced — and in what
direction and with what relative velocity wUl each of these on the
average      be projected    ?    What amount of glowing            gas will be pro
duced    ?    Again, if there be many millions of such masses, forming               a
group in which all describe approximately elliptic orbits in something
like equal periods, but of various sizes and in any planes about their
common centre of inertia, the group it-self being subject to a sort of
tidal disturbance by the sun, at what part of the group will the
impacts mainly occur         1   Questions so entirely vague as these are not
yet ready for the application of mathematical methods.
    The main difficulty felt by the critics above named                 seems to be
with respect to the production of the tail of               a comet.     The hypo
thesis of course involves as an immediate consequence                 that extensive
regions of space all round the            nucleus    of the comet (but specially
extended in the plane of its orbit) are full of fragments large and
small, driven out at differeut times from the main ranks which (on
the    whole) become gradually extended along an arc of the orbit.
Rays or tails will thus be seen wherever a visual line can be drawn,
along and near to which there is an assemblage                 of particles fitted  to
give back      a  maximum of solar light.           And, if   the particles be not
very large, the mass in each cubic mile of space may be very small,
while      the   whole   has    considerable    brightness, and yet does          not
sensibly weaken tho light of           a star seen   through it.
    The author stated that he had investigated the form assumed by                   a
train of particles ejected at different times from the head of            a comet in
tho plane of its orbit     ;  always with the same relative velocity (so small

that the       square of its ratio to that of the comet may be neglected), and
in a   direction making                      a       given angle with the tangent to the orbit.                                      The
result is      that such particles will lie approximately on                                                     a semi-parabola,
the    vertex         being at the head of the comet.                                                "When        the ejection is
towards        regions outside the orbit, the parabola lies behind the head
of the comet ;              but         if   the ejection be inwards                                 the parabola precedes
the head.             This parabola diminishes in                                          parameter            as the curvature
of the       orbit increases.*                            There can be no doubt that hero we have                                      a
very       striking         resemblance,                     if       no more, to the                form usually assumed
by the       tails of comets                     ;    and for comets with many tails (like that of
1744)        we require                 only a greater                        number of definite directions of
maximum ejection.          Wlui this ejection is generally (though by no
means        always) outward, (for several comets have had two tails, of
which one        was turned towards the sun) we cannot attempt to explain
till we       know at what part of the group of masses the impacts are
most       likely to        take place.
      The present theory differs altogether from that of Olbers, I'essel,
and    others,        in assuming                         the fragments which form the tail to have
but httle        velocity relatively to the nucleus, while the received theory
assigns        them very rapid motion along the tail                                                       :   — Olbers     says as
much as a             million miles per                                day.          The one theory endeavours                        to
represent        the motion as                        a   result of the received law of gravity; the
other        introduces                 the hypothesis of                             a   solar      repulsive force often

      5.    Additional Observations on Fungus Disease of Salmon
             and other Fish.   By A. B. Stirling, Assistant-Curator
             in the Museum of Anatomy in the University of Edin
                burgh.              Communicated by Prof. Turner.
    In      a paper read to the                Society in June last,                   " Proceedings," June
1879, on the fungus disease affecting salmon                                           and other fish,         I    dis
cussed the various theories                        which were advocated, as to the                           cause    of
the disease           ;   the effects of the fungus upon the fish, the vegetative
and reproductive aspects of the fungus, and the belief that salt water
had a curative elicct upon salmon                                  arTectcd with         fungus disease, on
their reaching and remaining for some time in that element.
      I    also mentioned that at the instance of the Tweed Commissioners,
an experiment                   was    being conducted by G. H. List, Esq., to test
whether that belief was well founded.                                     I   will now        state the nature
and result of the experiment, and afterwards relate to the Society,
an account                of an epidemic of fungus, which occurred                                      at Ightham
Mote, in the county of Kent in 1874, and which appeared again in
a   virulent form               a    few weeks ago.
    The experiment referred to was conducted                                      as   follows      :   —A   wooden
cage,       largo enough              to allow     a   salmon to move about within                            it,    and
perforated with holes so                      as to     allow the water to flow freely through
it,       was      prepared.           It   was then moored in the tideway in the River
Tweed, below Berwick bridge, where the water                                            is   at   all times        more
or less salt, and was now ready to receive                                    a   fish for experiment.
      About         the        end    of    May        last   a     sea-trout      kelt was             captured      at
Eithermouth,                   three miles up the river, and                      within      the       influence      of
the        tide.          It    was placed         in    a     suitable vessel               and conveyed              to
Berwick, where                  it    was enclosed            in   the cage.        The fish        is    stated      by
Mr List            to have been affected                 with       a   sloughing sore on the top                      of
the head from the point                       of   the snout about two inches in length and

                            of Edinburgh,         Session 1879-80.                      371
the-    same    in    breadth.       This    sore had all the      characters   of a sore
produced         by    the fungus disease.
      The cage was visited at intervals, and the effects of the salt water
upon the          fish noted.        The cage with the fish was towed out to             sea
for two       hours      on each of six occasions.
      In  a  short      time, the sore upon the fish was observed to be healing.
The fish remained in the cage                 till the 2d or 3d of October,       when an
incident occurred by the breaking of one of the chains which held
the cage        in position.         This allowed      the cage to swing to one side,
and      nearer      to    the shore,    when upon the ebbing of the tide the
i.age     was left dry, which             occasioned      the  death  of the fish.       ( Jn
discovery        of   the accident,     the fish was sent to mo for examination.
I     received it on 4th October, after it had                   been confined in        the
 cage    for fully four months.              From the combined effects of imprison
 ment, and want of food, it had become very much shrunken, was very
 lean,    and had more the appearance of               a compressed eel   than the form
 of a    salmon.          The fish was very dark in colour, the scales were un
 injured, and the mucus covering was evenly thin and transparent,
 and     there was no fungus on any part of its body.                    All  the viscera
 were     healthy the         sores upon the head          were  healed,  and the skin
  grown over them.               A  slight sore on the under surface of the right
  lower     jaw, which         appeared to have been         caused  by friction     on the
  bottom or sides of the cage, was               in  a raw condition, but had not the
  least appearance           of an unhealed ulcer.         Fully one-third of    the lower
   1,order    of the upper lip, at          the   middle of the snout,     and the outer
  and     upper margin of the gums at the same part, were not quite
   healed,    and the roots of the teeth were exposed from the parts having
   been   ulcerated.
       The pectoral and caudal fins had been diseased, and some of their
   rays   broken      ;   both were now healed and covered             with membrane,
   and the     shortened rays had the appearance of growing again.                    I con
   sider   the result of the experiment to be so far satisfactory              ;  it  shows
   that   migratory Salmonida affected with an ulcer produced by fun
   gus disease, get        rid of it in salt water, even when confined and without
    food for a long period, and           I  infer from those facts, that had the fish
    experimented          upon been free in the ocean for an equal period of
    time,   it would       have recovered both health and condition.
       The removal of all           dead fish from the rivers has been universally
          vol. x.                                                             2 y

372                 Proceedings       of the Royal Society
advocated ; the removal and             killing of all        affected  fish ha3 been
recommended       by many.      On the other hand, the Tweed conservancy
hold the opinion that the capture              and removal of all fish affected
with fungus (not in         a dying     state)   to salt or tidal water was the
proper course to follow, and with this opinion                I fully concur.        There
is one point in this plan which              may     cause some disappointment.
Supposing it proved that salmon are cured of fungus disease in the
salt water, and that those so affected           in    the upper waters, were cap
tured    and conveyed      to the    tidal part of the river, only those fish
with the instinct of descending to the                  sea,  when captured, would
remain to be cured.         Those with the instinctive              desire   to ascend,
when captured,        would in all probability return to the fresh water.
Those instincts in the [salmon            are known          to be both strong and
certain, their sense of being diseased, and need of cure                " instinctively
                "
or otherwise      are unknown.
     I shall now give an account of the very remarkable epidemics
which occured       at Ightham      in Kent, the particulars of which were
kindly communicated          to me by     Dr W.       S. Church, Physician           to St
Bartholomew's Hospital, London.                They are of so much interest in
the history of the fungus disease, that             I   feel warranted      in bringing
them to the notice       of the Society.        Ightham        House dates from the
time of King John, and the fish ponds were probably constructed
 at the same time, to supply the house             with    fish.    The house is built
 in the form of     a square,   and surrounds a courtyard.               The house in
 its turn is surrounded on all sides          by a moat, the water in which is
 from   5 to 9 feet    in depth.     The present         arrangement      of the ponds,
 garden, &c., was probably made in the time of James                    L     The    house
 drains into the moat, and the drains issue into it by separate open
 ings from two sides of the square.             The stream which supplies               the
 ponds and moat is formed by the surface water of a small valley, but
 is principally   supplied by two very fine and strong springs, which
 come out of the     Kentish    limestone.       The stream is only about            a mile
 in length   before   it enters the upper pond, and there is at               all  times   a
  strong run of water in it.      It is perfectly     free from drainage contamin
  ation, and enters the upper pond perfectly pure.                     There      axe two
  cottages  and a small fold yard on the side of the stream, but                         no
  drains flow from them to tho water             ; the fold is in a ruinous            con
  dition, and is not in uso.

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.                           373
     The ponds are much larger than the square of the house and moat.
  The upper pond        is situated about 100 yards above              the moat, the
  greater  part of the space between them being occupied by                  a   bowling
 green.     This pond is shallow, and        has reedy banks,         with     flags and
  aquatic plants     growing on the margins        ;  a  strong current flows con
 stantly through      it  to the outlet, and the water leaves            it by    a stone
  channel   falling perpendicularly about        5 feet.
    Immediately       beyond the fall, the water divides and forms two
 open   streams, which supply          two small ponds or stews at               a  short
 distance     below, on the right and left sides of the fall.               The water
 leaves   the stews by conduits, which pass underground                   to the moat,
 and   enter it by two falls of between 3 and 4 feet each, which fall
 clear of the breastwork.          In addition     to the main stream,          through
 the  conduits there are two other strong feeders             of   the moat,       which
 flow into    it from springs    on opposite sides, and there is a continuous
 current flowing through it.          The water leaves the moat by culverts
 to the lower pond, and from the           lower pond by         a   fall, and flows
 through grass fields for a mile, where         it   enters another fish pond.
    No epidemic of fever or other zymotic disease is known to have
 taken place in the house, and only two cases of sickness
                                                                             (measles)
 during the last fifteen years.           The gardener,       his wife, and child,
 were the    only occupants of     the house during last winter, spring, and
summer, the       family being from      home.
    Several severe epidemics of fungus               have been observed in the
ponds and moat.            One occurred about the year 1850, but no par
ticulars have been preserved,         and mild ones may have passed without
much notice,        " Furred " fish, and     even a few dead ones, have been
often seen      by the   gardener.     In the spring of        1874    a   very severe
epidemic occurred, when         all the ponds and      the moat suffered heavily ;
nearly    all the fish died in the      moat, and the disease          was     very de
structive    in both the upper and lower         ponds.
   This attack     was inquired     into by  Dr Church, who satisfied himself
that the    fungus affecting the fish was Saprolegnia fcrax. The fish
consisted chiefly of roaeh, pike, and dace in the moat ; roach, perch,
and pike     in  the upper pond ; roach, dace, perch, pike, and gudgeon
in the lower pond.         The  roach, dace, and gudgeon suffered the most,
only the small pike and perch were            affected,    and none of the largo
 pike or perch were found dead, and not a single eel.

M74                Proceedings of         the  Royal Society
    Many of the fish looked, when in the water, as               if covered with       a
halo, remaining at the surface          nearly motionless, frequently putting
their mouths out of the water, and turning belly uppermost                   immedi
ately before    death.    On examination, the fungus was found to                    be
most   thickly  matted on the shoulders          just behind the head, clogging
up the gill openings,      on the      pectoral fins, and tail portion of the
body.     "Whenever    ulceration had taken place, it was seen to be due
to the fungus, as tho parts most           ulcerated    were those most densely
covered    with fungus.        Death was caused by suffocation              in every
instance.
    The last fungus epidemic which occured                 at Ightham moat and
ponds began in the latter end of October of the present year, and
continued to the middle of November.                   About eight      or ten days
after it had commenced,          and numbers of the fish were observed               to
be dying,    Pr  Church very kindly favoured me by sending                 a number
of specimens     that had died in the water, and also               a number      that
were affected    with the fungus but were still alive when taken from
the   water.    Dr Church informs           me that     in this    epidemic   it \vas
chiefly the fish in tho moat which were affected and died, and only
a  few in the lower pond were observed               to be affected     ; none were
found affected in the stews            and   upper pond,      although the stews
 were swarming with          fish.    As during     the epidemic of 1874, the
roach    and dace suffered       first and worst     ; the pike, perch, and eels
 have not been affected during this epidemic.
    The diseased    fish sent      to mo    by Dr Church were          roach,   17   in
 number;     7 were   dead when taken out           of the water, and        10 were
 alive when taken.      -They average        2 oz. in weight     each, and were all
 packed in fresh    grass  ;   those taken alive were put at the bottom of
 the box, with grass under and over            them, and the others at the top
 of the box were packed in         a  similar way.      The fish at the top of      the.
 box were overlying each other, and appeared as              if they  were enclosed
 in  a common     envelope      of fungus, and such was actually the             casi :
 the fungus having continued to grow vegetatively, had, as it were,
 woven the whole group in a web of fungus.                   The new growth        had
 a perceptible   pink tint, tho same as        I  had seen upon a grey ling        sent
 to me from the river Tweed last spring, and may possibly be the
 natural colour of the fungus when it grows in the air.                 I confirm    Dr
 Church's statement      that the fungus        was; S.  fernjc and identical with

                           of Edinburgh,        Session 1870-80.                         375
that found upon diseased               salmon from the Tweed and Solway rivers
during      the     epidemics       of 1878 and       1879.        I  observed that       the
majority       of the filaments of the fungus found upon the Ightham
fish were      spear-shaped, very few had clavate fruit heads, and I saw
none     with ripe        zoospores,    indicating that the reproductive power of
the fungus          was feeble, and was producing                only barren filaments,
which appears to be always the case when the epidemic has run its
course.
     Only four of the           ten specimens had any external                blemish    upon
them,     which consisted of slight ulceration upon                   one pectoral fin in
two, and        in the caudal fins of other two            ; several      of the rays were
 broken,      and portions of them were hanging by the filaments of the
fungus.          In  all the specimens        the fungus covered        the greater part of
 their bodies         ;  and the heads         of several,    including       the   eyes  and
 nostrils, were completely covered                 over.     In none of         the fish were
 the    gills   affected,     but five of them had tho opercular opening of the
 gills nearly closed up by the fungus.
      On opening the abdomen the viscera were seen to be white, firm
  in position,       and with      a  fair amount of fat upon the stomach                  and
  intestines.        The roe in the females was            firm and clear, and though
  very small,       it   was more advanced then the            milt in     the males.     Tho
  heart,     liver,     and    spleen    were   normal    in    size,   and not the least
  appearance         of extravasation       in any of the organs.           On opening the
   stomach and intestines             I  could not determine what the food of the
   fish  had been,         as  only   white glairy mucus in small quantity                 was
   found iu any of them.
       The blood was perfectly normal in all, and the subcutaneous tissue
   was   in no instance discoloured, even under                  the thickest      patches   of
   fungus, showing that up to the time the fish were captured no ulcera
   tion, or indication          of any, either on the head or scaled parts of the
   body, had taken place.                The seven specimens           preserved     and sub
    mitted to the Society will be found to be without a sore or an ulcer
   on   any part of them, which S. fcrax could claim                      as   a  pre-existing
   nidus upon which to plant itself.               I may notice here that there seems
   to be   two ways by which tho fungus causes death by suffocation.
    The first and quickest way is when the fungus gets seated                      within   the
    mouth and upon the             gills  at the same time, which           I  have observed
    occurs oftencr in the large fish than in the                small.      The second, and

  376                 Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 probably a slower way, is wben the fungus grows over and closes up
 the opercular openings        of the gills, which seems to be the way those
 specimens have been suffocated,             being shrouded while alive in fatal
 fungus, they have         died in their beauty,           with their silvery skins
 unbroken.
     There is one fact connected          with the Ightham          epidemic, namely,
 that the largo pike, perch, and eels were not affected by the fungus
 disease.     I  am unable to account for this immunity on physiological
 principles,     and   refer it to the         hypothesis       of the "struggle     for
 existence    and survival     of the fittest."       It  would be difficult to find
 anywhere a purer collection of water than the Ightham ponds.                      The
 main stream,        upper pond,      and     stews,    being virgin spring water,
 uncontaminated with any pollution, so that                  I am convinced     that S.
ferax can and does exist where no source of pollution is present, and
 exercises its destructive influence upon               the fish as is evidenced     by
 the numerous deaths        in  the epidemic of 1874 in the Ightham              upper
 pond.     Up     to the   present     time,    it  has generally     been held that
 fungus epidemic,       or, as  it has been called, salmon disease, was con
 fined   to and had its origin in rivers frequented                 by the migratory
 S'thnonidte.       At an early stage of the inquiry,          Sir Robert Christisnn
referred    to this, and    urged    that   if  possible    it should   be ascertained
 whether the disease had ever been observed in the head waters of
any salmon river above any impassable                 obstruction, either natural or
artificial.     The epidemic at Ightham             moat and ponds answers the
question Sir Robert desired             to be cleared        up, and proves    that   £
ferax is not confined to rivers frequented by salmon.
    In a former paper, I stated that the so-called salmon disease did
not depend        upon  a  pre-existing functional disorder in the fish.               I
 am   still of this opinion,      and    point to the fish from Ightham            as  a
 further proof that this is the         case.     I  also stated    my belief that    <S.
ferax existed       at all times    and probably in all waters, and that the
 presence of fish and S. ferax in the same water under certain climatic
 or other at present unknown influence,               seems all that is necessary to
 originate fungus epidemic.
    The epidemic at Ightham              in my opinion          does away    with   the
 theories of overcrowding, including overstocking.                   Overcrowding of
 salmon     in   a pool in    a  river is not analagous           to overcrowding of
 people in a room or in a prison cell, where               only  a certain amount of

     can     circulate.     Salmon crowded         in    a  pool in a river, through
which a stream of water flows freely, are in a condition                    similar to a
herd    of cattle crowded in         a pen or fold, in the open air on        a hill-side,
where      pure air is inexhaustible.         In like manner salmon crowded in
a   pool are    provided with       a continuous       supply of oxygen by the con
stant   flow of the river through the pool.
    As to overstocking,          my own opinion          as an    angler of fifty years'
experience, and as a net fisher for a           fifth of that time, is that      I   never
foand the       fish  too  plentiful anywhere      ;  and   I  do not think there ever
can be      too many, especially trout, grihe, and salmon, in any of our
rivers.       Very curiously,      those who advocated the theory          of overstock
ing as     the cause of the fungus disease, are in many instances the very
persons       who grumble        at the   scarcity     of the fish in question, and
propose       to increase their number by killing               them for eight or ten
days     longer      at the latter end of the season,              when the fish best
adapted       for breeding are entering the rivers. Regarding the food
 supply in overstocking, I quote the following statement cited by Sir
 Samuel Wilson of Ercildoune, Australia, in his work on the acclima
 tisation    of Californian salmon.          " It is stated by Mr Vincent Cooke
 of the     Oregon Packing Company, that out of 1)8,000 salmon caught
 in the     Columbia River in 1874, three only                 were   found with some
 trace  of food in their stomachs,          and those seemed to have quitted the
 salt  water very recently."
     The fact that the        house drains into the moat might be urged by
 some as       an argument that the water there is rendered foul by tho
 house     sewage, and that the pollution of the water may have had
  some    influence in developing the disease.                In reply to this it must
  be stated,     that, as  Dr Church points       out, a large body of water flows
  through      the'  moat   hourly, and so far from ordinary house drainage
  being prejudicial       to  fish, where tho water is frequently changed, the
  finest   fish, as the pike, perch, and eel, are to be caught in the neigh
  bourhood of the house drains.              But if it were proved that the house
  drainage mingling         with the water of        the   mont served as an exciting
  cause     for   the   development and propagation              of the fungus in the
  moat,    this could not      be advanced as a reason           for the appearanco      of
  the  disease     in the upper pond, which was fed by an uncontaminated
  stream.       Neither could diseased fish from the moat find their way to
   the upper pond so         as to   infect the fish there,       as there is not only a

378               Proceedings    of the Royal Society
clear fall of between  3  and  4 feet between    the moat and the       stows,
but one of about   5 feet between   the stews and the upper pond, thus
presonting obstacles    such as the fish living in these waters          could
not surmount.
   In conclusion,  I feel convinced that the so-called      salmon     disease
is the fungus itself, and that no structural disturbance       in  the fish is
necessary to cause fungus attack      ; that this appears    to me to have
been abundantly proved by the        sixty specimens     which   I have dis
sected and examined    ; that it is useless to look for more information
on the origin and cause of fungus epidemic,           from the   carcases   of
salmon or other fish affected with the fungus       ;  that the   origin and
cure or prevention of the plague must be sought for in the hfe history
of the plant, which is more the work of the botanist than         the anato
mist,

L The      Trigonometrical        Survey      of Palestine.      By Lieut.
                     Claude Reignier Conder, R.E.
   The survey which forms the subject of the present paper extends
over an area   of 6000 square miles, bounded by the Jordan on the
east, the Mediterranean     on the west, the river Leontes and the springs
of  Jordan near Dan      on the north, and the desert of Beershoba on
the south.    Within    these  limits a complete triangulation,    with two
hases each   about four miles long, has been extended, and the whole
of the   country mapped to the scale of one inch to the mile.            The
 work occupied five years in the field, and nearly         three years more
in preparing the results for publication.
   The trigonometrical     survey was first commenced      in October 1871,
 when   a party   consisting   of only     four Europeans    took the field.
 This expedition    was sent out by the Palestine       Exploration Fund,
 under  the auspices of which       society, Captain   Warren,    R.E., had
 previously  been    employed     in   his   adventurous    explorations   at
 Jerusalem during the years 1867 to 1870.
    The officer selected    for the command of the survey party          was
 Captain  Stewart,  RE.,   of the Ordnance Survey.        Unfortunately   the
    vol x.                                                       2 z

 380                 Proceedings of         the  Royal Society
expedition reached        Palestine in the most unhealthy              season   of the
year,  and their leader was invalided home                in January 1872.         The
two surveyors, Sergeant Black, R.E., and Corporal Armstrong,                     R.E.,
were   thus left under the care of Mr. C. F. Tyrwhitt Drake, who
had been attached to the expedition              as  linguist and archaologist.
   On the return of Captain Stewart, the Committee of the Palestine
Exploration      Fund honoured         mo    with   the offer   of the command       of
the survey party, and        I  reached     Jaffa  on the 8th of    July   1872.    In
the meantime        the   survey had been successfully started, and after
measuring      the first base     in   the plain of Sharon near         Ramleh, the
triangulation      was extended      first to Jerusalem       and then northwards
to Nablus      or Shechem,     the detail being at the same time filled             in
over an area of 500 square miles.
   The success of this part of the work was due not only to the zeal
and   skill of   the two non-commissioned officers,              but also in a great
measure     to the tact and       experience      of   Mr Tyrwhitt Drake, whose
knowledge of Syrian manners and language was invaluable.
   The method of conducting the survey was soon developed into                       a
routine which was preserved               throughout      the   course   of  the field
operations.       The camp having been fixed in               a convenient position
and as centrally       as  possible,    with reference       to the proposed    work,
the triangulation       was first extended.          The highest points within       a
radius of ten or twelve miles from camp, were visited, and at the
points selected cairns of stone seven to ten feet high were built up
and carefully whitewashed.              In  some cases the domes of the sacred
tombs    formed valuable stations,             and in the more        wooded parts
of the     country it was        necessary      to clear away the brushwood,
leaving    a  lofty  stack of branches         bound to a central pole marking
the instrumental station.
   The triangles thus constructed varied from five to fifteen miles side
according to the character of the country.                 Several very long lines
were also observed,         and from the ends of the bases astronomical
observations were taken to fix the meridian lines.                 The observations
as  calculated      at  Southampton          in  1877    showed an error        rarely
exceeding     thirty feet in the mile, which it is unnecessary             to remark
is not visible on paper to the one-inch scale.
   From tbe trigonometrical stations observations were also taken
to all prominent objects         within the field.        It   was found, however,

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1879-80.                      381
 that the effects      of mirage rendered these observations untrustworthy
at a   distance of more than about six miles from the station.                     The
sacred    tombs, solitary      trees, village towers,      and other conspicuous
landmarks        were fixed by       the   intersection of     the  various angular
directions      thus observed,      and   these served     as secondary points in
the   work which next followed.
    The trigonometrical        observations were calculated in camp and laid
down on rough sheets.            Tracings were then prepared for each of the
surveyors, and the district surrounding the camp subdivided.                      Each
surveyor, accompanied          by a local guide, then proceeded to fill in the
detail    of  the sheets with the aid of the prismatic compass and the
names     of the various features were carefully collected from the guides,
and    verified as far as possible by reference to independent witnesses.
    The detail which was shown may be seen on the lithographed
sheets.      It   includes towns and villages, ruined sites and isolated
buildings, springs,          wells, cisterns and aqueducts,           enclosures   and
 roads,   all the principal     isolated trees, and the cultivation or natural
 growth      of    the   country, rock-cut tombs,         vineyard      towers,   wino
 presses,   and other traces of ancient cultivation,             as  well  as  the dry
 torrent     beds     and    perennial     streams    which     form    the   natural,
 boundaries      of the ancient divisions of Palestine.
    Tha collection of the names was one of the most delicate and im
 portant parts of the work.            It is well known that the nomenclature
 of  Palestine, so far at least      as the sites  of towns and villages are con
 cerned,    has remained almost unchanged from a very remote period.
    The reasons        for this preservation of the Hebrew nomenclature
  will be mentioned later; but         it may be noted that one of the original
 objects   for which      the survey was undertaken, was that of collecting
 ancient names hitherto unknown, for the purpose                  of assisting in the
 identification      of biblical   sites,  especially in     those   districts of the
 country previously almost unexplored.
    In order to      secure the correct orthography of the nomenclature a
 native scribe was attached           to the party, and     in order    to secure the
 correct   application of the names it was made             a   rule only to inquire
 on  the very spot.         The site being thus ascertained,         the correct pro
 nunciation was obtained on the evening of the same day from the
 local  guide on the return of the surveyor, and was written down by
  the   scribe.      10,000 names        were   thus   collected    in 6000     square

 382               Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 miles,   and although       a large  proportion    of   these    are   of   little
value, the result of this systematic       examination of the nomenclatuie
has been the recovery       of about 150 ancient sites, which are newly
identified with places mentioned in the Bible, while a yet larger
number of names          connected   with   the   Byzantine    and Crusading
history of Palestine have also been recovered.
   The elevations of the trigonometrical stations above the sea were
obtained by vertical angles         with  the   theodolite, and checked by
moans     of measured     heights along the coast.       The error in       these
heights does not appear to exceed three or four feet on an average.
   Other elevations wore        observed    with aneroid     barometers,      and
checked      by readings   taken at bench marks or at trigonometrical
stations and by readings of the mercurial barometer in camp.                     A
line of levels had been run from Jaffa to the Dead Sea in 1864 by
Captain Wilson,      RE.,   and with this our trigonometrical observations
agreed very well.        The summer level of the Dead Sea was thus fixed
at   1292-5    feet below the Mediterranean,         the  surface   in summer
being about fifteen feet lower than in winter.
    In  1875 a second lino was run by the survey party from the Bay              of
Acre to the Sea of Galilee, a distance of about thirty miles, and the
level of this lake was thus fixed at 682'5 feet below the Mediter
ranean.      This  piece of work was carried out under a special grant
from tho British Association, former estimates             of the     depression
having ranged from 300 to 600 feet.
    By   means   of  these levels and of observations       to trigonometrical
stations    between    the two lakes and farther north, the          fall of   the
Jordan     was determined throughout the whole of its course.
   The rate at which the survey was carried on increased gradually
as   the   party became more accustomed          to  the country     and better
acquainted with the language and customs of the natives.               At first it
did not exceed fifty square miles in      a month, but after leaving Nablus
an average of 100 was obtained.         In  1873 this was increased      to 150,
and in 1874 to upwards of 200.           The party was strengthened in the
latter year, when an average of 270           square   miles per month was
attained, and kept up almost to the end of the survey.                 The most
rapid piece of work was the survey of the Desert of Judah.                    The
triangulation being very large and the detail less close than in the
cultivated districts, the survey of this desert was completed in ten

                         of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.                       383
days, the area being 330 square                 miles of very difficult       mountain
country.
    The representation          of the   hill features was of necessity less exact
than     might    be possible on the one-inch scale, but so far as the ridges
and     prominent features are concerned it is supposed to be accurate.
The      general slopes of the mountain sides were determined with a
pocket      level, and     separate sheets of    hill shading     were prepared and
carefully inked in before leaving the camp for a new district.
    The preceding           notes   will, it is hoped, give       some    idea of the
character       of the survey work.         The rapid rate of progress had many
advantages,        amongst which was the economical character of the work,
the     map costing in the field not more than one penny per acre of
ground surveyed.
     In addition      to the map      work many other kinds           of information
 were    supplied.       The ruins were explored, plans of all interesting
 places,    special surveys of towns and ruined cities, and notes                on the
 archaeology       of the land, were regularly          collected.    The geological
 structure      of the country      was   observed,  collections of fossils and of
 lithological specimens were made, birds were shot and stuffed, notes
 on    the    traditions,     manners,   and language of the peasantry were
 recorded.        Photographs of interesting places were also made, and               a
 regular      series of      meteorological observations        was   kept for three
 years.
      It  was also necessary      to study carefully the literature        of  the sub
 ject,   in order that intelligent explorations          might be attempted, and
  special observations taken         in connection with       the  numerous contro
  verted     sites of importance throughout            the   country.    The winter
  seasons     were employed in reducing to order the field observations,
  and in     preparing, by study of the literature, for the examination              of
  questions connected          with the topography of the district next           to be
  surveyed.
      The results of these explorations          are not as yet     fully published.
  The    lithographed sheets now on the table have been prepared at the
  Ordnance Survey           Office, Southampton, from MSS. worked                out in
  England after the return of the survey party.                An engraved      map to
   &  smaller scale     (f   inch per mile) is also in course of preparation,
   and the    proofs seem to promise that the finished work will be of
   excellent    execution.

    A  memoir has also been prepared by the survey officers to accom
pany each of the 26 sheets of the one-inch map, and this great collec
tion of notes is now going through the press under the editorship                 of
Col. Wilson, R.E., whose absence on special duty in Anatolia has,
however,    unfortunately delayed the publication.
    The memoir is divided into four sections.            The first descriptive
of the country, its natural features,        its towns and villages,          with
special   notes   on the ancient history       of the various sites.           The
second section      deals with  the archseology     of the sheet, every       ruin
being described, with accompanying plans and sketches.                 The   third
section    consists    of translated name indexes, giving the Arabic
lettering and the      connection of ancient with modern names.                The
fourth section includes notes on the ethnology of the sheets.             Special
papers    on the physical geography,       architecture, nomenclature, and
archeeology    of the various districts, on the geology of the country
and on the ethnological peculiarities      of the natives,    will, it  is hoped,
be added,    and the whole memoir        will probably     exceed 1000 pages
quarto of print,     with  more than 100 special plans and surveys.
   Some account       may now be desirable of the history of the under
taking, which        was  not free from vicissitudes, and         of the      most
interesting results of the exploration apart from the survey map
itself.
    Leaving the well-watered vale of Shechem on the 16th August
1872,    the  survey party proceeded        northwards, and in September
encamped     at  Jenin   on the south edge    of the great plain of Jezreel
or Esdraelon     — a plateau divided from the Jordan valley by the
ridge of Gilboa, and from the plain of Sharon by the spur which runs
north-west to the Carmel promontory.            In   this plain the second or
check base was measured, and a new triangulation extended from it
in a very satisfactory manner.        The hills round Nazareth were sur
veyed    during the autumn months, and the party wintered                   safely
in the German colony at Haifa        under the slope of Carmel.
    Several  instances    of molestation occurred during this campaign
to different members       of the party, the most serious being an assault
 on Sergeant    Black by the young men of         a  village, who were       firing
at a mark, but sent several bullets       in  an opposite     direction,    which
 fell at the sergeant's feet   as he was   taking angles.      These offenders
 were, however,      punished by fine and imprisonment.

     In   the early        spring of 1873 the expedition           turned south, and
commenced           to fill in the country lying between the sea-shore                and
the    mountains forming the back bone of Palestine, which had been
previously surveyed.              The plain of Sharon was thus visited during
the    most    healthy season, and         a pleasant time was spent        in  a district
previously but little known.
    Among the most interesting places visited was                  Athlit, the ancient
Castel     Pelegrino      —a    fortress of the Templars, held by tho Christians
to    within a few months of the fall of Acre in 1291, and one of the
best     preserved         examples     of crusading     architecture     in Palestine.
 On Carmel          the remains of an unknown             synagogue were explored          ;
 at Caesarea      the ancient temple built by Herod the Great in honour
 of    Augustus         was    discovered    though     not   completely       examined.
 The     identification      of Antipatris with the ruins of Ras el 'Ain was
 confirmed       by      the  survey operations     ;   and the great wood called
 Drumos        by Strabo was for the first time thoroughly explored,                     at
 the    north end of the Sharon plain and at tho foot of Carmel.
      The party rested           during the summer months on the heights of
 Anti-Lebanon above Damascus, and in October the ascent of Mount
  Hennon was accomplished and a night passed on the summit ; the
 latitude,     longitude, and elevation          of the    highest    peak,    9200 feet
 above      the Mediterranean,           being carefully     determined      by trigono
 metrical     and astronomical observations.
      l.eaving     tho Anti-Lebanon on 24th of September 1873 the party
  marched       to    Beirut,    and thence     down     the  whole coast       as far as
  Jaffa — the distance of           220 miles being accomplished        in   seven   days.
  The survey        was next extended southwards from the former limns
  —the       Judean bills round           Bethlehem      being    carefully    examined
  This part      of the work        was of great interest      in  consequence     of the
  number        of     biblical   sites  included     in the    district.      The   most
  valuable      discoveries were perhaps those of the rock Etam,                      in  a
  cleft   of which Samson hid from the Philistines, and of the probable
  site of     the     village Emmaus, sixty stadia from Jerusalem,                 at the
   present    ruin of Khamasa, south west of tho Holy City.
       East of Bethlehem            the  desert of  Judah     was next     entered,    and
   the survey        extended to the cliffs west of the Dead Sea.                 In this
   desert the name          Suk, applying to a mountain where the scape goat
    used to   be destroyed in later        Jewish times,    was found     still surviving

 at the distance from Jerusalem given           in the Talmudic writings.       The
 fatigue of the work was here much increased               by the great power of
 the sun,    in   a district   entirely bare of trees and composed of steep
 ridges of white marl with precipitous limestone gorges,                  the  only
 water obtainable being warm and brackish and at times very scanty
 in quantity.
     On the      15th of November          the  broad plains of Jericho        were
 reached, and a district of about 200 square miles north of              the Dead
 Sea was surveyed.           No  traces of the Cities of the     Plain were, how
 ever, found, and the conclusion resulting from a careful examination
 of the ground was that these towns probably stood east of the Dead
 Sea or higher up tho           Jordan valley, where fresh water would be
 found to supply them.            The plains of Jericho are deficient in water
 supply, and the         soil is so deeply impregnated with salt that it
 seems impossible         that it should ever have been cultivated within
 historic times.
     At Jericho      the expedition     suffered severely    from an epidemic of
 malarious fever,       which    so weakened      the   party as to render field
 work impossible during the winter.               Mr Tyrwhitt Drake narrowly
 escaped with his life, and only three members of the party of twenty-
 ii ve individuals remained unaffected.          The winter months were passed
 at Jerusalem,       and tho weather experienced was unusually severe,
 seven    falls of snow occurring in the hills, while the Jordan valley
 was Hooded and rendered           impassable.
     In  the end of February 1874 the expedition again took the field,
and the most difficult and dangerous part of the survey was, during
the next two months, carried through successfully.
     This task      consisted    in tho exploration of the Jordan valley
between       tho  plains of Jericho and tho Sea of Galilee —a district
entirely uncultivated         and inhabited     only by nomadic Arabs living
in    tents.    The supplies were         brought     down from     Jerusalem    or
Shechem,       a distance    often of two days' journey, and the party was
obliged to trust entirely to itself for defence,         as the  Turkish   govern
ment exercises but little control over the Bedawin.                The work was
interrupted by constant storms, and the oppression of the atmosphere
at a level      1000    feet  below the sea was found extremely trying.
The water supply was very uncertain,               and for ten    days  the party
were obliged to rely on the salt            springs of Wady Maleh.         During

the last      two weeks the power of the sun became so great that work
was     only possible in the early morning, for the party remained                         in
valley even        after the Arabs had retired to the hills.            The exhaustion
due to       this campaign         necessitated    a long rest for the whole party,
and the        expedition      experienced     a sad and serious      loss  in   the death
of    Mr Tyrwhitt Drake, who sank under                     a  second    attack of fever
brought on          by the malaria of      the valley and the toils and privations
of the     survey work.
     It  was    not until     the    5th October that the expedition was again
able    to take the field.          Lieutenant Kitchener,       RE.,   was appointed to
take the       place of    Mr Drake       as second officer for the party.          At this
time more         than half the survey (3500 square miles) had been com
pleted,      including all the country between Bethlehem and Nazareth,
 and     it was determined to complete                 the  southern portion of the
 work,      1200 square miles, before           attempting the survey of Galilee              :
 the   autumn of the year was consequently                     passed    in   the   hills of
 Hebron and the            desert     of Beersheba.       The season was unusually
 sickly,    and the mortality in the plains was in some villages not less
 than     50 per cent. of the native peasant               population.       In   the   high
 mountains the party were, however, comparatively safe, although it
 became        necessary     to   invalid    one    of the most valuable members
  (Sergeant      Black) during        the winter.      An attempt    was made to push
  the   work through the desert west of the Dead Sea about Christmas
  time,    but the expedition          was driven to shelter by         a succession       of
  violent gales which nearly wrecked the camp.
      In   the spring of 1875          a very light expedition      was     organised     for
  the   exploration of the desert.            The invalid members          of the party,
  including        Lieutenant      Kitchener,     remained in Jerusalem           with   the
  baggage,      and accompanied          by two corporals      I set out carrying only
  the barest necessaries,           with food and provender for two               days at a
   time.      The work      was pushed on with the greatest possible rapidity,
   and     as   before stated 330 square           miles were mapped          in ten days.
   The shores       of the Dead      Sea, here girt   with cliffs 4000   feet high, were
   visited,    and a special survey made of the famous fortress of Masada.
   The     Arab      tribes were found         in  a very disturbed        condition,       in
    consequence       of recent tribal conflicts, and this portion of the work
   was   perhaps the most adventurous episode                of the survey.

Philistia was       commenced      and carried successfully to the southern
limit of the     map at Gaza.       The site of Adullam and of the famous
cave of the same name was determined for the                   first time, the ruins
of Ascalon were examined, and the sites of Ekron, Gath,                       Ashdod,
and  Jamnia     surveyed.      The work was comparatively easy in this open
and cultivated district, and the total area surveyed was thus                  quickly
raised to 4500 square        milea
   After    a  month's rest at Jerusalem the party marched                northwards
in  July, and      the survey of Lower       Galilee was commenced, including
the   lino of levels from the Mediterranean, which necessitated                     an
encampment close to an unhealthy swamp north of Nazareth.
   The expedition then moved northwards to Safed, the intention
being to carry on the work until the winter in the mountains of
 Upper Galilee, leaving only the upper Jordan valley and the plain
of Phoenicia to be completed in the spring of 1876.
   Unfortunately       the work was for a time completely              stopped by a
combination of difficulties.         The party was attacked on the 10th of
July by       a mob of fanatics at Safed, and for a short time was in
considerable danger;         the prompt assistance          sent    by  the   Turkish
Governor rescued us just as resistance             began     to become no longer
possible,    but scarcely    a member     of the expedition escaped without
more or less serious injury.
   It   was    impossible    after this     to   carry on the work until the
assailants    had been punished, and the party consequently retreated
to Carmel.        The principal offenders were tried and imprisoned, and
a fine   of £270 was inflicted on the town.              At this time, however,
the   whole      expedition     succumbed       to   fever,     partly   due   to the
injuries    received,    and a serious       outbreak of cholera          throughout
Syria rendered it prudent to withdraw the party from the country.
   The members of the expedition continued to suffer from fever on
thoir return to England,           and the field       work       was   consequently
suspended      during 1876.       In  1877,    as my own health continued to
be unsatisfactory,        it  was   considered      best   to divide       the party.
Half of    the expedition was sent out under Lieutenant                Kitchener,    to
complete the 1300 square miles which remained                  to be surveyed;     thn
other half was retained under my direction, to work out in London
the results already obtained, representing four fifths                 of the whole
work.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                380
     The survey       of Upper Galileo          was    successfully and peacefully
carried    out   by Lieutenant Kitchener, and               as   the population of the
district was       chiefly composed        of Christians        and Jews no further
serious    difficulties   were encountered.          The most valuable discoveries
in this part      of Palestine     were    the various cromlechs           found by tho
survey     party, — the first undoubted           specimens       of rude stone monu
ments as      yet discovered west of Jordan.
     The construction       of a large scale map was not the only duty of
the    survey party.       Information was also expected on all antiquarian
and     scientific    questions which        it might      be possible to       examine.
Among these the principal               results connected         with the ethnology,
geology,      zoology,     physical    topography,        and architecture        may be
 briefly noticed, and a few words added in conclusion respecting                     some
 of the   biblical    sites discovered by the survey party.
      The great explorer,     Dr Robinson,       was one of the first writers who
 called   attention to the conservation of ancient names and traditions
 among      the Syrian peasantry.          Tho collection of 10,000 local names
 during the course of the survey, not only resulted                     in  the addition
 of many       new sites to those        already known, but served              to throw
 light on the reason          of tho preservation of ancient Hebrew names
 almost      unchanged in the modern nomenclature.                     The language of
 the    peasantry proves        to be much nearer            to Aramaic       or oven    to
  Hebrew than to the pure           Arabic     of Arabia proper.          Not only    does
  the    pronunciation       of various      letters     and words        reproduce    the
  Aramaic       sounds,    but   many words           in   common      use    among    the
  peasantry are of pure Aramaic origin,               and are not used, or even in
  some     cases not understood, by the townspeople who                       employ   the
  more    modern Arabic equivalents.
       As a single instance the word          Jurn     may be noted.         In Arabic it
   means a    trough, but among          the peasantry        it signifies   a threshing-
   floor, like the Hebrew Goran.            The Arabic word used by the towns
   folk and educated       classes to signify      a threshing-floor is       Nadir,   and
   it was not    until after   some time had         elapsed that we discovered        the
   meaning     attached by the peasantry         to the word        Jam.      Many other
   instances    might be quoted      ;  but the general         result seems to be that
    the  peasant language       in Palestino       is almost unchanged since            the
    times   of Jewish       domination.        The     preservation      of the    ancient
    nomenclature       is thus easily explained,            and     the explanation       is

    390                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
   confirmed by thu fact, that the ancient names are as a rule irretrievably
   lost in districts inhabited by the Bcdawin who immigrated at a late
   period from Arabia to the Syrian deserts.
       Not only     the language     but the customs, dress, and religion          of the
   peasantry     are extremely archaic.         The old worship of high places
   is  still  preserved     among the villagers, sacrifices        not in accordance
   with the doctrines of Islam             are offered   to local    divinities, lamps
  are lighted, votive offerings          suspended,      and solemn dances and
  processions      celebrated    at the innumerable        shrines which are      found
  on every high mountain and under every large tree.
      So close is the correspondence          between   the habits of the     peasantry
  and the description         of the habits of the indigenous population                in
  Jewish      times,   that the     Fellahin of Palestine may apparently be
  without improbability considered the descendants and representatives
 of the ancient Canaanite tribes.
      The Zoology of Palestine has been made a special study by the
  well-known explorer Canon Tristram, and we had no hope of being
 able to add       in any material     degree to his discoveries.         Fortunately,
 however,      we were able to determine the existence of a species             of deer
 not previously known            to inhabit     Palestine.     By   the natives    it is
 called      Yahm&r,     a  word identical with      the    Hebrew term rendered
 "fallow       deer"     in  the   Bible.     A  specimen     of the     Yahmur was
 brought to us by the Arabs of Carmel, and the skin and bones were
 sent by      Mr Tyrwhitt Drake          to the Museum         at Cambridge.        The
 animal was there pronounced indistinguishable                  from our European
 roebuck, and wo were thus able to ascertain                  the   actual species     of
 game which furnished the tables of Solomon with savoury venison.
      The Geology of Palestine            presents  features     of unique interest
 connected       with   the extraordinary depression of the           Jordan valley.
The country has never yet been thoroughly                     examined by a pro
fessional geologist,         and although        much has        been   done   by M.
L'Artct      and by Canon Tristram, much           still remains requiring skilled
judgment         to   explain.      Tho   attention    of the      survey   party     in
respect      of this question was         principally     devoted    to   the  general
structure of the country and the distribution of the main divisions
of the strata.
     The   hill country of Palestine        is formed by a steep anticlinal,        the
strata belonging         principally  to the period of the        Lower Chalk, and

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                               391
 including         soft    white      marls     and limestone        overlying    a   hard
 crystalline      dolomitic     limestone     of the Neocomian series.
      Batches      of nummulitic limestone belonging to the early Tertiary
beds are       found in Galilee, and on Ebal, Gerizim, and Olivet.                      On
the     western slopes of Lebanon and on the east side of the Jordan
valley the       Nubian     sandstone       belonging to the time of the Greensand
is found,      but this formation         never appears west of Jordan.
    The     dip of    the strata along the         Jordan valley     was very carefully
noted      during the prosecution of             the survey.      In  every case    a very
sudden contortion           of the strata was observable,           the dip being east
wards       or south      east,    and in places faults were found extending
north and          south.     It   was    clear   that the original      depression    had
taken      place after the Chalk period, and the basaltic outbreaks                 which
 surround the Sea of Galilee, and cover 500 square miles east of the
lake,     also belong apparently to the time of the first breakdown of
 the    chasm     in  the early Tertiary period.
      The appearance         of the sandstone          east of   the valley bottom is
 considered       by L'Ajtet      a conclusive proof of the fact, that the whole
 depression        is due to a fault running north and south for 150 miles,
 and     giving a fall of 3500 feet from the springs of Jordan to the
  bottom     of the Dead Sea.
      The remains of an ancient beach were                  discovered by the survey
  party    north of the plains of Jericho, and again south of the Sea of
  Galilee.      Near the Dead Sea other beaches arc visible at different
  levels,   and it is clearly evident that the present                 valley was once
  occupied     by a chain of great salt lakes, the surface of which           was about
  on the     same level with the Mediterranean, and which                     have at a
  comparatively         recent     geological      period   undergone      a process    of
  desiccation       until they      are  now only represented           by tho    smaller
  sheets    of water known as the lakes of Merom and Tiberias and the
  Dead      Sea, the extreme          saltness     of the latter being due         to the
  gradual     washing down of the chlorides from the basins                  now dry,    a
  process    which seems to promise             the final consolidation of the Sea

      The   questions connected with the climate and physical geography
   of  Palestine, its ancient      fertility, its   present desolation,   and the possi
   bility of  its future restoration, are of still higher interest, and the sur
   vey seems     to have thrown considerable            light on these subjects also.

 392                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
    The impression produced on first entering Palestine is that               of a
 barren country and of desolate ruins representing a former condition
 of prosperity. It must not, however, be supposed that the soil is
 wanting in fertility.       The luxuriant growth of weeds and wild
 bushes sufficiently attests the richness of the land.                 In those
 districts where the soil consists of porous chalk, and where the water
sinks down to the underlying impervious strata, the bareness of the
country is very remarkable.         In  the higher mountains, where the
 dolomitic   limestone is denuded, the western ridges are                thickly
 clothed    with copses of mastic and dwarf           oak      In Sharon and
 Lower Galilee extensive woods of oak still exist           ; and although      a
great destruction of forest (which existed        even as late as the    twelfth
 century) has      apparently   occurred   in  some    districts,   there   is  a
corresponding spread of the thickets in other parts of the country,
 where the sites     of ancient vineyards and orchards are found over
grown with thick copses.       .
    There does not appear to be any good foundation for the popular
 theory of   a great   diminution   in the rainfall of the country.          The
average fall is now about twenty inches in the year, and         all the famous
 springs noticed in the Bible are found still to yield          a good   supply.
 There are twelve considerable perennial streams in Palestine besides
 the  Jordan,    and   many districts, such   as  the Hebron      hills and the
lowlands of Galilee, are plentifully supplied with springs.               In the
chalk districts no change in the supply can apparently have taken
place   within historic    times, and   the great   number of cisterns and
tanks, many of which are certainly of immense                 antiquity,    gives
evidence that    it was necessary, even   in  the earliest historic period, to
provide    a large   amount of storage for rain water in the districts
not naturally supplied.
    The change      which has actually occurred in the climate and con
dition of the country seems to be less important than is sometimes
supposed,    and appears to be due principally       to depopulation and to
the decay of the ancient cultivation.         The malaria of the lowlands
is plainly   traceable   to the absence of proper drainage, and to the
destruction of the ancient works of irrigation, many of which date
Lack at least to the Christian     era.
    The swamps formed in the plain of Sharon are due to the filling
in of ancient rock-cut channels,      which once conducted the drainage

of the     mountains to the      sea, and   the miasma in many cases arises
from the      stagnation of water in the torrent beds, which might with
very    little difficulty be drained into the        sea.
    Throughout       Palestine, also, there are evidences           of an extensive
and    careful cultivation     now entirely abandoned, and of           a  population
which has       been estimated at not less than ten times the number of
the    present     inhabitants.     The    sides    of     the  hills  are   carefully
terraced,    though now often only growing thorns and thistles.               Ancient
wine presses        and rude     stone   orchard towers are encountered              in
every     direction, often on the sides of hills now entirely uncultivated.
The    ancient    ruined towns and villages, so thickly strewn over the
 country,     number more than ten times the present total of inhabited
 villages.      The population, which       does not exceed three         millions for
 all Syria,    is entirely inadequate for the cultivation of the country,
 and the     villages are thus found standing in tracts of plough land or
 orchards    surrounded on every side with waste ground or thick copse.
    The riches      of Palestine    appear    now as of old to bo principally
 agricultural.      The quality of     the corn, wine, and oil is not inferior
 to that    of even the south of      Italy, and it       can scarcely    bo doubted
 that,   should    any circumstances       lead    to the      development      of the
 natural     wealth of the country, Syria might become an important
 source    for the supply of the three products above mentioned.
     The restoration of the country to a condition of prosperity depends,
 in short,    not on any change in its climate, rainfall, or vegetation, but
 on the      establishment of a just government, the liberation of the
 native peasantry       from unjust taxation, violence, and oppression, and
 on the     establishment of a condition of security which might induce
 the    Jewish and other local capitalists to invest their money in
  the    cultivation and irrigation        of the land, in the development
  of its trade,   and in public works which are at present entirely non
  existent.
     The examination of the           ruined     sites    throughout     the   country
  formed one      of the most important occupations of the survey officers.
   A  note was made       of every ruin which could be found, and a sketch
  or plan    of every object of interest.      The hopes which were naturally
   entertained    of the discovery of remains         belonging to the Jewish or
   Phoenician    period were, however, doomed to disappointment, and the
   conclusion to    which it seems necessary to submit is that the Jews

  394                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 were not a people of great architectural genius.                 Large numbers       of
 Byzantine        and     Crusading     buildings    were    examined, and many
 structures previously          attributed to an earlier period were clearly
 proved during the course of the survey to belong to the late times
 of Christian domination in the country.
    With exception, indeed, of            the  rock-cut tombs and of the great
 walls of the Jerusalem Haram, not a single building was found
 which could be attributed to an origin earlier than the times of
 Herod the Great.            The walls of Masada, the aqueducts          of Csesarea,
 the colonnade         at Samaria,     and the great       building at Herodium,
 appear to be the work of this monarch                ; but the idea which       finds
 expression      in many books       on Palestine, that    all masonry with    a sunk
 channel or draft round the stones is of Jewish or Phoenician origin,
 was plainly disproved by the observations taken during                   the course
 of the survey.
    The ancient sepulchres            formed   a  study of the greatest      interest
 and   importance,        as  serving to indicate roughly         the date of ruins
 where      they occur.        Tho earliest Jewish        tombs with      Kokim      or
 narrow graves running in from the walls of the chamber, were found
 to have been superseded           about the time of Christ by another form
 of sepulchre,      in which     a rock-cut sarcophagus      was excavated at the
 side  of   the chamber,      while a cylindrical stone took the place of the
older hinged or sliding door.              The rock-cut tombs of the Christian
period,     fitted for the burial of two bodies — man and wife — are again
quite distinct in form, consisting of graves sunk in the flat rock and
covered      with   a great stone.      Dated inscriptions were found on many
of these tombs, with Christian emblems and leaden coffins.
    Some      light  has also   perhaps    been thrown      on the vexed question
of the length of the Jewish measure called Ameh or cubit, by the
careful measurements            of  the synagogues      and of the Temple build
ings at Jerusalem
    According to the Talmudists the cubit measured the length of                    48
barley corns,         which    by measurement         of barley corns in Palestine
 would represent         16  English inches very      closely.
    It  was found         that the pillars of the synagogues          had in many
cases     a   total height of 160 inches,          or   10   cubits  of  16   inches,
the    bases      being     16   inches    (1   cubit),   the   capitals   8   inches
(half   a  cubit).      In   1873  I  was so fortunate as to discover a part of

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1879-80.                         395
the    Haram     Wall at Jerusalem not previously examined, where
 buttresses   of ancient masonry are built at intervals. The interval
from    centre to centre was 160 inches or 10 cubits, and                 tho dimen-
tions   of many of      the great stones are    in  the    same way multiples of
a  unit of 16 inches, which it is thus natural to conclude represents
very   closely the length of the medium Jewish cubit.
    The  limits of    the present paper     will not allow of any          account   of
the   exploration     of Jerusalem.      The survey of that city had been
previously       executed     in  1864,    by    Col.    Wilson, R.E., and          the
excavations     of Captain Warren,       RE.,    had placed the topographical
controversies       on an    entirely new footing.          A certain amount of
additional information         was collected   by the survey party, including
 150   observations       of the rock-levels in tho city, which              have    an
important bearing on some of the disputed questions, but tho subject
is  too large to be further noticed in this paper.
    As has been        already stated, tho identification          of ancient sites,
especially those connected         with biblical history,        formed one of tho
 principal objects contemplated in undertaking tho Palestine survey.
 The results    in this field of    research have       been perhaps      more   satis
 factory   than could     have been expected.         About 170 now identifica
 tions have resulted from the survey, and             it is satisfactory to    bo able
 to  say that most of these have been well received by students of the
 subject, and pronounced valuable by good authorities.                   The number
 represents about two-fifths of the total of biblical sites now identified,
 the  remainder being tho results of the labours of the famous travellers
 Burckhardt, Robinson, Vandevelde, and others.
     Among     the    places   thus newly recovered,         or concerning which
 fresh information       has been collected by tho survey party, may                 be
 mentioned the royal Canaanite cities of Hazor and Debir, Adullam,
 Lachish, and Megiddo,         with the New Testament towns Emmaus and
  Salem.     New information       has also been collected        as to  Capernaum,
  which the survey officers are inclined          to place    at the   site proposed
  by  Dr Robinson, called Minieh, rather than at the traditional site of
  Tell HAm.       It would,   however,   be impossible to enter at length into
  the  various interesting questions connected with these sites.
      A single example       of a survey identification         may,    however,     be
  noticed   in conclusion of this        paper,    as being perhaps         the   most
  interesting result of the survey of Palestine, namely,             the recovery     of
     vol. x.                                                               3 n

the supposed               site    of the Bethabara of the New Testament, a place
where John the Baptist                          met our         Lord, and where it is supposed
that the baptism of Christ occurred.
     Siucc the fourth century A.D., the traditional site of Bethabara has
been always shown at the most southern ford of                                      Jordan,   due east      of
the present           Jericho.           This       spot     is annually visited        by crowds           of
devout       Russian              or Syrian             Christians,      and    the scene       of     their
immersion             in     the       river    is"1    extremely picturesque           and    has often
been described by travellers.                            There is not, however, any conclusive
evidence        that the site so pointed out is genuine                             ; the    name      Beth
abara does not survive                    in    the     vicinity, nor is the        place mentioned by
any writers before the fourth century.
     There      is,   moreover,          a     fatal difficulty in identifying              the true    and
the traditional site               ;    for   it   is   clear from the Scripture narrative that
Bethabara lay at not more                               than   a   day's    journey     from    Cana of
Galilee, which was situated north of Nazareth.                                  We     are thus limited
to   a        of about twenty miles from Cana (which
         distance                                        probably the                   is
present village called Kefr Kenna), whereas the traditional site   no                                  is
less than eighty miles from Cana,                            a   distance representing three days'
journey rather than                    one.
     The name              Bethabara           is   a    compound of Beth             "a     house"     and
Abara "      a   passage
                                   "
                                       or ford.         The village stood beyond Jordan, and
apparently took its name from                            a   neighbouring ford of the river.
     The fords of Jordan were carefully examined during the course
of the survey in the Jordan valley.                                No    less than forty fords were
found between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, of which only
six are marked on former maps.                                   Their     names,    which    are mainly
descriptive, were                  obtained, and care taken to ascertain                        as far as
possible the exact                 positions.            Some      of the fords are only passable
in summer or autumn, but others, to which the main roads lead,                                          are
practicable       at all times except during heavy floods.
     Among the fords, one and one only was found having the name
'Abarah, identical in form and in meaning with the name of                                              the
ford whence                Bethabara took its title.                    This   passage of the river,
discovered        by Sergeant                 Black in the ordinary             course of the survey
work,      is   situated about twelve miles south of the Sea of Galilee,
at the place where one of the main roads from Lower Galilee crosses
over into the district of Bathania or Bashan,

                       of Edinburgh, Session 18/9-80.                               397
    The name        thus   recovered    is not a mere          deseriptivo    title   in
common use        among the Arabs.         No other ford       is so called as far as
could be      ascertained by careful questioning, and the word 'Abarah
does   not occur again among the           10,000 names collected within the
limits of the survey.
    The distance from the ford 'Abarah to the probable site of Cana of
Galilee is   about twenty-two English miles, the road being the shortest
and easiest     leading from that town        to any part of      Jordan.     There is
thus a   possibility of journeying         in   a   single day between the two
places,   which, as before mentioned, agrees with the account given of
Bethabara      in the    gospel narrative, but which          is not in accordance
with the    position of    the traditional    site near Jericho.
    This discovery is a fair sample of the             biblical results     due to the
survey.      The discoveries of similar character connected with tho
Byzantine       and    Crusading     history     of    the   country    are   not   less
 numerous      or interesting   ; but  I  hope     that what has now been said
 may    serve to     show the aims       of the work,         and that — when the
 difficulties    connected    with its execution are borne in mind — tho
 results   may be considered adequate             for tho time and money ex
 pended on      the survey.
    In conclusion,       I would venture to say that the succoss of the
 work   should have a peculiar interest for Scotsmen, for although the
 leaders   could not claim Scotch descent, it is to the zeal and faithful
 ness  of the two sergeants,      Black and Armstrong, that            tho thorough
 ness  and accuracy of the survey are in great measure                due, and both
 these   non-commissioned officers,        as  well as others of the staff, were
 natives   of the north side of the border.
   2.   On Alinding's System of Forces.                  By Professor Chrystal.
                                    (Abstract.)
     Minding has proved a remarkable theorem concerning a variable
  system of forces     defined as follows,     the points of application of the
  different forces,   and their magnitudes are given, while the directions
  are such    that a pencil of rays through any given point parallel to
  them moves      as a rigid body.
      Besides   Minding's original investigation,         several  others have been

398                Proceedings of         the  Royal Society
given since.   The last of these, due to Professor Tait, rests on purely
quaternion methods,       and is so elegant and concise that             I  was led      to
reinvestigate the whole subject by ordinary methods in the                           hope
that the analysis might have some points of interest.                   Two      methods
of arriving  at Mindiug's         result are given, and a variety of other
conclusions are arrived at by means of the second method sufficient
to indicate the course of a       full investigation of      the complex formed
by the central axes, and of the congruency formed by the single
resultants of Mindiug's       system.
                                   First Method.
   The components       of force and couple         are found     in terms of the
Rodrigues co-ordinates \fiv, which determines the position                        of the
rigid pencil representing the direction of the forces.
   The equations to the single resultant are then found in terms of
two constants   ;/ and h, and the parameters Xpv.
   Equations are then deduced for the values of Xpy corresponding
to a ray passing    through     a  point x;/z.    Eliminating     p.   and  v a   biqua
dratic is found for       X.      The   system     of resultant      rays     therefore
forms  a congruency of the fourth order.
   This biquadratic     becomes      wholly indeterminate for           points on the
real focal conies of the ellipsoid

   Some farther discussion leads to the conclusion that the resultant
rays of Mindiug's      system is identical        with the     congruency        of rays
that intersect the two focal conies of (A).

determine a congruency       with which they         are identical.

   The equations to Pliicker's           complex cone          and equatorial and
meridian     surfaces are given, and various loci connected                    with the
complex are discussed.
   A method of exploring the complex by                 means     of central radii is
then   given.
   It is found that    the stretch on any radius that is intersected                   by
rays   of the complex perpendicular             to  that radius is in             general
finite.
   An equation for       the   distances    of the ends of this stretch from
the  origin is found, and expressions         for the direction cosines given
for the extreme rays which are at right angles to one another.
   Various     results concerning       the   lengths       of perpendiculars         are
given ; among      them that the sum of the squares                   of the perpen
diculars    on three rays mutually          at right angles         to each other is
constant.
   The solid locus of the feet of the perpendiculars                    on the central
axis generally is found      to be the space between               the sheets of the

 theorem is shown to hold when           /=  0.    (It    is not true when         ff  0).
 The equation to the surface locus of the feet of the perpendiculars
 on the rays    of resultant  is found, and so far as mere inspection goes
 is of the twelfth     degree.     In conclusion,       the equations of various
 other  loci connected with the congruency             are given, or indicated to

               3.    Mathematical Notes.             By Professor Tait.
                        (a.)  On a Problem in Arrangements.
    While making             some   algebraic     problems      last     summer       for an
examination,         I  devised the   following question : —
    "A    schoolmaster went mad, and amused                     himself by arranging
the boys.         He turned       the dux boy down one place, the new dux
two places, the next three, and so on                   till every       boy's   place bad
been altered at least once.             Then he began again, and               so on ;     till,
after 306 turnings down, all the boys got back to their original
places.      This disgusted him, and           he kicked one boy out.               Then he
was amazed         to find that he had to operate              1120 times before all
got back to their            original  places.     How many boys             were in the
class?"
    It  is clear that one of the factors               of the number of turnings
down is     (n-      1), where n is the number of boys               in the    class.     The
factors of 306 aro 18 and 17, and those of 1120 are 7, 10,                           and    16.
If   we try 17 as the original value of             n-   1, 16   will    be the value for
one boy less       :  from which it appears by         a  tentative process that           the
class consisted         of 18 boys.       But it    is interesting to examine the
nature    of the question more            closely.     It   is  intimately       connected
with one of the problems suggested in my paper on                      " Knots     "
                                                                                      (Trans.
R.S.E., 1876-77,           § 5).   If we know the arrangement               of the    boys
                                                                                            —
after one of them has for the first time been turned to the foot of
the    class,   the     processes   given    in that     paper     lead     easily    to the
complete      solution.
   Now it is        easy to see that the particular           arrangement        just    men
tioned can be found diagrammatically as follows                    : —

Put the double of the middle number to the right of                                                         it,   and the
next lower          number to the left.                       Thus

Continue        in this way, and                    arrange these groups                       in successive order,
leaving       out the final           1   from each.                We thus                 have the series
                                                                                  10,3, 11,

Strike off the           first   n    -   1    of these numbers                         (n   being the number of
boys),       and the next             n   represent            the arrangement                     of the class after
all have been            displaced         :    the numbers designating the several boys
by    their original places.                        Hence we have the key for translating
the    series into the successive                       derangements.
  Another curious mode of getting this series                                                 is   to begin with               1,
then    prefix      1,   and insert            2,   as    below —   :
                                                         1    2     I.
Again prefix          1,   and insert           2,       3,   4,   then
                                               1    2    1    3     2    4        1,
and so on        indefinitely.
  It     is   worthy of remark that this series gives the integral of the
equation
                                                   utz         =         ux

above series by each particular                      integer.             This, however, is obvious
when we consider that the sum of (n                             +    1) terms of any one of these
series is of the form
                                         (2r     +    1)2*

and that this expression                 can be made                 to equal any given               positive
integer by one definite pair (and one only) of values of                                      *-   and n.
   Thus we see that we may write
                                        "« =    iO     +    x    +        !)<

highest power of            2   that    it   contains.
  The numbers of operations,                         for classes of different numbers of

The calculation of the numerical value of any particular                                              term     is
easy, but       I    have   not attempted              to express the general law                       of   this
very curious series.                It       seems,    however, to be well worthy                              of
attention, especially from the point of view of the expressions                                               for

           3.   Remarks on Mr Crookes's Becent Experiments.
                            By Professor George Forbes.
     The author explained that he was glad to be able to bring before
  the   Society some apparatus          illustrative  of Dr Crookes's splendid
  researches     on what he calls radiant viatler.         This  he was able to do
  by the     skill of Mr Giiningham, who            had  prepared    some splendid
  vacuum       tubes for him lately.          He valued tbose      researches   very
  highly, because they brought most conclusive evidence                to bear upon
  the truth      of    tbe kinetic  theory of gases    ; because   they gave us     a
  clear   insigbt into the action of the electric current and discharge              ;
   because    they promise to help us in forming         a  notion of what electri
   city really    is ;   and because wo may also hope from these researches
   to get some      knowledge of the nature of molecules.
      It   is now generally conceded           that  a gas   consists of detached
   molecules,      moving about with great rapidity, and rebounding from
    each  other and from the sides of the containing vessel, with perfect
    elasticity;    Clausius and Maxwell have           shown that at any given
    pressure the       molecules  on an average can travel over only a certain

                      Proceedings       of the Royal Society
distance    without experiencing         a collision.    In  the case  of hydrogen,
at atmospheric pressure,          this distance,    called the mean free /xifA of
a molecule, is the ^yg^nr^ Par*i of an inch.                If the hydrogen in a
tube at atmospheric pressure be gradually removed by an air-pump
until only     a  small fraction of that quantity of gas remains in the
tube, then each molecule can on an average traverse a distance much
greater   without having        a collision with     another molecule.       During
the tune of passing over this space their vibrations are                more or less
given off to the other.          Thus they soon cease to be luminous, even
if incandescent when they last collided with                   a molecule.     These
facts   explain the action of the radiometer.*               They also explain the
fact observed in very high vacua, that there is no luminosity                  round
the negative      pole+ of a vacuum tube           (highly exhausted) when two
poles inside     it  are connected     with the   poles of an induction coil.
    [The first experiment was here shown, when it was seen that in a
very perfect vacuum no light was seen in the tube except a phos
phorescence       of the glass tube, due to the impulse of the molecules of
gas upon it.         When water-vapour          was admitted by heating a sub
sidiary bulb containing caustic            potash,    the ordinary phenomena of
vacuum tubes were gradually developed.]
    The impact of these molecules          on German glass or other phosphor
escent substance        produces    intense phosphorescent light.          [This was
shown by placing in these vacuum tubes phosphorescent sulphides
and rubies, and by directing the discharge               upon German glass.]
    When the electric density of           a  considerable portion of the nega
tive electrode is uniform, we should be led to expect that the mole
cules of gas which strike it should be driven off perpendicular to the
surface,    that being the direction            in which      the  repulsive  action
between      the    electrified electrode    and the similarly electrified mole
cules    should take       place.     This  is exactly what happens.          If  the
negative    electrode     be a circular disc, the molecules        are driven off to
the opposite       side of the tube or bulb.           This direction depends in
 no way upon the position of the positive pole.                   In this   case the
 author remarked on the existence of a black mark in the centre of
   *
     See  Tait and Dewar, Nature, 1875. But also see Clerk Maxwell, R.S. , 1S79.
   tThe    molecules of gas certainly fly off from the negative pole in obedience
 to the above laws.        At  present  we know little about     what happens at the
 positive pole.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                             407
the   luminous phosphorescent patch produced on the glass by the
molecular bombardment.            When this    is seen   it is due to a stream of
blue   light from    the centre   of the  negative    disc.    This stream is not
deflected by a magnet         as is the stream producing phosphorescence.
Since the molecules are driven off perpendicular to the surface of
the negative      electrode,   any object placed     in their path shields the
phosphorescent       glass   from the molecular bombardment, and thus
a   shadow of the object is thrown on the glass.                The author drew
attention     to the fact that there was no penumbra to this shadow.
Considerable      heat is developed       on the glass      or any other object
exposed to this molecular bombardment.                If   the negative   electrode
be a concave      part of a sphere, the molecules        are concentrated      at the
centre     of the sphere,     and produce     there    sufficient heat      to  melt
platinum.
     We know from the experiments of Rowland that a body charged
 with electricity, when        in motion,  acts like an electric     current.      So
 here these charged       molecules in motion are deflected by        a magnet     as
a   current would be.        But they   do not yield      to the electromagnetic
 force so    much as    a perfectly flexible linear conductor would do.
     The author showed that the stream of molecules,              when falling on
 glass,   could be reflected on to a piece of mica covered with              a phos
 phorescent      powder   ;  but  he  has   not   yet been able to determine
 whether they are reflected        according to the laws of the reflection of
 light.     He also drew attention to certain      small black spots which he
 has   occasionally noticed on the phosphorescing glass which move
 over   it like bubbles, disappear,     and are succeeded       by others.
     He suggested      that efforts   should    bo made       to determine what
 happens to molecules        at the positive pole — also     to discover by what
  means the    negatively electrified particles, after having been projected
  along    the length    of a tube,  find their way back again,          if  not by
  regular reflection.

   Professor      Turner     reported    that in accordance        with the remit
made by the        Society at last Ordinary Meeting, the Council recom
mended the following changes in the Laws of the Society: —
   " That Law        XVII      be   cancelled,    and the following       Law     be
established    in its place   :—
                                  LAW XVIL
   " That there shall        be formed a Council consisting, first,        of such
gentlemen      as may have filled the office of President, and, secondly
of the     following     to be annually        elected,  viz.,   a  President,   six
Vice-Presidents      (two at least of whom shall be resident), twelve
Ordinary       Fellows     as    Councillors,      a General Secretary,         two
Secretaries     to the Ordinary       Meetings, a Treasurer, and a Curator
of the Museum and Library."
   That tho following addition be made to Law                XV. : —
   " The Council shall         have   power to regulate the private business
of the Society.       At any Meeting of        the Council the Chairman shall
have a casting as well as a deliberative vote."
   Professor     Turner    moved, and      Mr Sang     seconded the adoption of
these recommendations,         which were agreed to.
   The following       Minute, prepared       by the Committee appointed for
the purpose       by tho Society at the General Statutory Meeting, was
read and approved        December      1, 1879.     The Secretary was directed
to send an extract to       Dr Balfour: —
   " The Members of         the Royal Society of Edinburgh           most cordially
unite with tho         Council     in acknowledging        the long and valued
services    of  Dr Balfour      as General Secretary of the Society;           they
desire, as a body, to express how deeply they regret the loss of these
services;    and    whilst sympathising with him in the circumstances
which have led to the resignation of the office he has so long held
in tho Society, they would cherish the hope that he may enjoy in
his retirement that serene repose which the consciousness                of a well-
spent   life is fitted  to insure."
                The following letter in reply was        note  read  :—

      L On    the Distribution of Temperature under the Ice in
                     Frozen Lakes.        By John Aitken.
     In January and February         1879  Mr J. Y. Buchanan        communicated
 to  this society two papers, on the distribution of temperature under
 the ice in Linlithgow Loch,              In these papers he gives a most
 interesting    and valuable series of temperature         observations made by
 him, of the water, at different points, and at different depths, in the
 l'wh   while it  was covered     with ice.    He also gives the temperatures
 as   taken    by him under similar         circumstances in Loch          Lomond.
  These observations by       Mr Buchanan     disclose a somewhat unexpected
  thermal condition of the water.
      As water attains its maximum density at a temperature                 of 39  2°
  Fahr.,  it  has   generally been supposed         that water in lakes        ought
  never   to fall below this        temperature,     except     near   the   surface.
  Because when the water is cooled below 39-2°               it will float  over  the
  hotter and     denser    water, and tend to keep        the   surface, while    the
  latter water    will tend    to keep   the bottom, and       radiation and con
  duction   will only    enable a lower temperature       than 39-2° to penetrate
  below the     surface,   very slowly, and to a very small depth.             These
  theoretical expectations are, however, entirely upset by           Mr Buchanan's
   temperature    observations.      He found that the greater          part of the

 -414                  Proceedings     of the Royal      Society
 colder and lighter overlying water.                After  some    hours even this
 surface current became so weak as not to be noticeable.
    Convection currents being thus shown to be incapable of lowering
 the mean temperature           of the water in lakes below 39 -2°,             I  shall
 now call attention to        a cause   which, though not existing and not
 recognised    in our laboratories,      is yet in constant action in nature,
 and is quite sufficient to account          for the thermal disturbance under
 consideration.       The    great vertical      distributor    of temperature in
 lakes  is in all probability the winds which are               constantly blowing
 over them.      Previous to the freezing of the surface the winds were
 iu constant action, producing currents in the water, which gave rise
 to the peculiar distribution       of temperature       we find after the lake        is
 covered with ice.       I  have shown      in  a previous paper* that the great
 wind-driven     currents of the ocean have but little influence on the
 vertical distribution of temperature          of the oceanic     waters.     The cir
 cumstances are, however,         quite different in lakes.       In   the ocean the
 wind only affects one part of the surface of the water, and gives rise
 to a circulation the greater part of which is horizontal, the return
 current coming back at         a  part of the ocean unaffected by the wind.
 But in a lake the wind blows in the same direction all over the lake,
and the return current cannot come back on the surface,                   it is  there
fore compelled      to sink and return underneath         the surface wind-driven
 current.    The cold surface water is thus compelled to sink and carry
its low temperature       into the depths of the laka           When we consider
that water of a few degrees above and of a few degrees below 39'2'
will   have almost the same density, we               will  see  that difference of
density will oppose but little resistance to these wind-driven currents.
 And under almost all circumstances               the  "head" produced by the
wind will be greater than that due to difference of density.
    The temperatures       as given by    Mr Buchanan,       so far as they go, are
entirely in support of this wind theory.               For   instance,   Linlithgow
Loch is much smaller and better sheltered              from the wind than Loch
Lomond, and we find the mean temperature                  of Linlithgow is higher
than   Lomond, which we would quite expect, as it will have a less
wind-driven circulation.          Again,   as  Linlithgow Loch is smaller than
Loch Lomond, the wind-driven surface currents will not be so deep,
nor the return currents so near the bottom.                  We would therefore

 expect      the water      at the bottom of    Linlithgow Loch to      be warmer
 than the      water     at the bottom of Loch Lomond, which we find to be
the case.
      [A'tils'Z    February 24, 1880. — It is scarcely necessary to say that
the explanation here given of the descent of the cold water into the
depths of lakes in winter, applies to the converse process which takes
place on      the approach of      summer.     If the  distribution of temperature
in lakes depended on currents            due to difference of temperature     alone,
the water        in   the depths of lakes would never rise above 39-2°,       as the
sun's     rays are robbed of their heating effect by a small depth of water,
— and it is principally by the wind-driven currents that the hotter and
lighter surface water is caused to sink into the depths of the lake].
 2.    Remarks on the Aborigines of the Andaman Islands. By
          Surgeon E. S. Brander, M.B., CM., H.M. Bengal Medical
          Staff, Second        Medical    Officer, Tort     Blair and Nicobars.
          (Plate XV.)
       I  propose making a few brief observations              on the relations in
  which we stand to the aborigines of the Andaman                    Islands, their
  place     in the     economy    of this convict settlement,      and their more
  noticeable habits and customs.            In  the consideration of the latter,
  1   shall only state such information        as  I have   obtained myself from
  conversation with, and personal           observation on the manners of tho
  natives.        Detailed monographs      on their ethnology, &c., have       been
  written already by several observers, and are to be found in tho
   " Transactions of the
                                Anthropological Society," &c.
        When the British Government first acquired possession of these
   islands,    the aborigines, due perhaps        to previous bad treatment       at
   the   hands of Europeans, presented a decidedly hostile aspect.              Any
   attempt      to land from ships was met by determined             resistance   on
   their part, and for some years          this condition of things remained.
   It    was shortly after the      Mutiny that Government first decided to
   use these      islands as a   convict settlement, deeming it a safe measure
    to  get the imprisoned mutineers       safely out of the country altogether.
    By   the time the convict settlement       was first established,    the Anda-
    manese    had ceased any hostile efforts, but had entirely fled into the
    jungle, where they refused to accede to any friendly overtures.              By

416                         Proceedings of the Royal Society
the judicious              leaving of presents           for   them,       and by the habitual
kindness of reception shown to any of their number venturing into
the settlement,             this timidity was gradually overcome.                       At that time
a zealous       and devoted servant of the Government,                          Mr      J.   Homfray,
voluntarily went into the jungle and lived amongst these savages as
one of themselves.                Ignoring       the discomforts of the position                      and
thoroughly ingratiating himself with them, he remained in their
midst until he acquired                  a   fluent knowledge of their imperfect but
difficult dialect.            By this    means he established in them a confidence
and       friendly         feeling towards the
                                               " strange                   white people."             The
policy of this course was soon apparent.                        These islands were destined
to be a great convict settlement,                     and the co-operation              and friendli
ness of the aborigines with the                      British Government would at                     once
strengthen the hands of the latter                      in   the management             of the      place,
by rendering escapes practicably impossible.
     At    the present time        all   the tribes in the             neighbourhood of Port
Blair      are on most          friendly relationship with the Executive                            here.
One       of the settlement         officers      has    it,   as    his special duty, to look
after them.           On one of the islands here, called Viper Island, there                            is
a   " Home       "
                     for the reception         of such healthy members of the jungle
tribes     as   like to come in.             Here they are well housed and fed.                        In
exchange         they make         bows,       spears,       and various rude ornaments,
spear and store up turtle, &c., and by the sale of these augment                                      the
Government grant allowed for their support.                                There   is   also   a   school
for Andamanese children on Boss Island (the chief station here),
where they are taught to read, write, and speak English and
Hindostani, together with the elements                          of arithmetic, &c., and the
girls in addition, needlework.                   Besides this there are the Andamanese
Hospital and the Convalescent House on Viper Island, which were
under my direction                when       I   was     in the       capacity of Additional
Medical         Officer.       While in        the    latter function,       I     resided         mysclf
on    Viper Island, and           so had considerable               opportunities of observing
the    Andamanese             both in hospital and in their normal condition.
Since my promotion to the duties of Second Medical Officer, their
medical charge has unfortunately left my hands.
     Finally,        the    Andamanese at present                   most    efficiently fulfil the
function of always having 20 to 50 armed men ready on the shortest
notice, to scour             the jungle and          recover, dead or alive, any escaped

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                               417
convicts.         For       each convict so recovered              Government pays them five
rupees.         In    the great majority of cases the runaways                              are easily re
captured        'without        any resistance,           heing generally               exhausted         from
exposure and want of food.                        Cases, however, have                  occurred where
the escaped convicts have shown fight on being overtaken, and when
the  Andamanese have had to use their bows and arrows (of which                                                 I
shall speak after) with rapidly fatal effect.
  Such then, briefly, is the                    present     relation in which these people
stand       to us,          and their general             function         in the community.                    I
may add          that yearly they are becoming more                                tractable.           Tribes
from remoter            parts of these islands are voluntarily sending in mes
sengers ;       these       are always well          treated, and           take     away with           them
useful     presents and           a   good opinion of their entertainers.                           In   time,
then, we may hope to stand in a friendly relation to all these tribes,
though         some     still   remain     who refuse any attempts at conciliation.
   I will       not make any detailed remarks on the structural or other
affinities      of   these people.             These have been treated of                in    the detailed
monographs             to which        I   before    referred      ;   I    will    therefore       at once
proceed        to my personal experiences.                       One physiognomical fact has
appeared         to me very noticeable,                 however,       and       that    is,   the remark
able    diversity of the facial type.                      Some faces seem to resemble                        the
Negraic, some the Malayan, and some even the Aryan in character.                                               A
reference       to the accompanying photo-lithographic illustration (fig.                                      1)
will help to render this clearer.                       Thus the "characteristic," i.e., the
most       frequent, type of Andaman face would seem to be of                                   a   modified
Negraic variety.             I    may add, however, that               I     have       noticed less dis
similarity to exist between the women's faces than the men's.                                            As   an
example         of   the variety of facial character                   observable,      I      would point
out the man's               face seen in profile          in    fig.   1,   with its comparatively
straight       nose and         compressed        lips,    as   distinguished            from the man's
 face (seen          full   face) next to him with the flat nose and thick pro
tuberant        lips.       When number of these people are seen together
                                      a
 this   peculiarity becomes very noticeable.
      In   size these people are           remarkably small, and            I      append some tables
 of   measurements           I   have made.             From these          it   will   appear      that the
 average        man does not exceed                 4    feet    10 mches          in height, with              a
 weight        of about 101 lbs.           ;   and the average woman,                   4   feet    6   inches,
 with      a   weight of about             98 lbs.        From the figures               in the table,        I

lowest height,     4 feet  7§ inches, giving a mean of 4 feet 10-43 inches
for men's height.

   Among the women the tallest was 4 feet              9  inches, and the shortest
4 feet 3 1  inches; giving     a mean    height for them of     4 feet   6-03 inches.
The heaviest      woman weighed 126             lbs., and the lightest 85 lbs.,
giving a mean weight for these of 98-6 lbs.
   The men are somewhat             athletic and symmetrical in build, with
fairly good chests and general muscular development.
   The women        are very ungainly      ; they undergo large development
about   the hips and abdomen.              The latter becomes in any woman
after 18 years of age very protuberant.                This condition,       I  should
think,   is induced partly by the complete                absence   of any proper
abdominal support during the period of pregnancy, and is partly                     due
to the distension their stomachs undergo habitually after food.                   From
childhood they cram their stomachs                with   an immense       amount of
bulky food in      a  short period, and they do        literally " swell visibly        "
after their meals.      This distended abdominal condition is              noticeable
in children of both sexes, but          as the    lads grow up they take           more
exercise,   and their     abdominal       as  well as other muscles            become

firmer,    and restrain the mechanical distension of the belly.                With the
women       it is different     ; these   latter influences    do not exist, and when
the     child-bearing       period comes the abdominal enlargement               is aug
mented.         The women          also undergo      exertional     enlargement   in  the
gluteal     region, the appearance of which is enhanced by their custom
of    attaching branches           of twigs to their waist-bauds, so as to hang
over     this region.         This largo development of abdomen, hip, and
buttock, added to a very
                                         " waddling " style of gait, gives these
women        in progression        a most grotesque        appearance.     They mostly
possess      considerable mammary development, and the glands in many
instances       seem to be      in  a  chronic state of functional activity.        This
 may be       due to the late period to which they suckle their young
 (even to      three and four years), or to another purpose to which the
 milk is applied, and to which               I shall  afterwards advert.
      The Andamanese             are strictly monogamous.          The men marry at
 about     eighteen years of        age, and the women        at any age after twelve,
 generally about thirteen or fourteen years.                  The number of children
 born to each         pair is two or three, seldom           more   ; with  the women,
 irom seventeen           to twenty-five would seem to be the most               fruitful
 period,     and   it  is remarkable how aged the women become                in appear
  ance    after having         had one or two children.            Labour    with   these
  women      is a very simple business.          They do their usual work until the
  actual commencement              of the pains, aud resume it very shortly after
  it is over.       Two hours       seems to be a fair allowance of time for an
  Andamanese woman to be delivered in.
       The   thinking      powers of these people         is not so much deficient as
  it is  limited by their imperfect dialect.              Thus, they have no concep
   tion of    number beyond live, which they count by the fingers of one
   hand successively         touching the nose.         As   a result they cannot ex
   press   periods of time, and thus none of them know their own age.
   The latter      can only be guessed           at by their physical       development
   and comparison          with   others   of known    age.     Their ideas and dialect,
   in the crude state, are very imperfect.               They can only reason about,
    and express ideas       on the most tangible objects.          Hence it is a matter
    o£  considerable difficulty to obtain their ideas on anything else, even
    by the aid     of a fluent interpreter.           Their   ideas   on things abstract
    are  probably none, or are impossible to get at.              On the above subject

recently arrived from a remote part of the jungle, and having had
no previous intercourse        with white     people.   The Andamanese resi
dent here are of no use for the purpose of ascertaining their primitive
mental    condition.      They all have — especially     the lads at school —
undergone     such   a considerable    mental enlargement, as     I will instance
in   the case   of   a boy presently.      The following     brief statement   of
their views on some abstract           ideas  I obtained from a new arrival.
Apparently some have no, and others the vaguest, conception of a
deity or of departed        spirits.    By Pulloga they     express   the power
which seems to have arranged             natural objects   as they now stand.
They have a dim idea that some evil spirit or influence (no word to
express that abstraction) sends disease among them, and that the
latter is especially    likely if they    go into water after having rubbed
on turtle fat   !    They have a vague fear of going about in the jungle
when it is dark.        This would     seem to point to their recognition      of
some malign influence        which is then liable to assail them.          My in
formants could specialise         no further    on these matters, either from
never    having thought about          the subject at all, or from want of
words to answer such unusual inquiries.
    In their dialect identical      sounds would seem to have their mean
ing altered     by the tone or key in which they are uttered.                 The
result is that when speaking rapidly and consecutively, the voice
modulates     up and down in a manner not unlike a person speaking
rapidly while humming a chant of three or four notes.               The dialects
of these islands are remarkable from their variety.               The following
are some   :—
               (1.)  Bqjengijida, or South Andaman (spoken here).
               (2. ) Balawada,  or Andaman Archipelago.
               (3.)  Bdjigiabda,  or South Middle Andaman.
               (4.) Akiikolda, or East Middle Andaman.
               (5.) Awkofawaida, or West Middle Andaman.
               (6. ) Akakede, or Interview Island.
    Some   of these are widely different,        and the tribes living within
twenty miles can often barely understand each other,                 those   more
remote being quite mutually unintelligible.
    They are conservative        in their   language,  and generally prefer to
invent a new word for a previously unnamed object than to borrow
it.    A certain    number of English        and  Hindostani    words are now

     As an instance of their inventive powers for new names for new
objects,     I may    give —
                            Birmal&kabaugda,        a steam-boat.
When asked the name of any, to them, strange objects, thoy readily
extemporise one, as the other day when they were shown a thermo
meter      and at    once gave      it   a name !       Doubtless,     if  the namo they
gave     could    be analysed,     it would      be found to mean            " glass-stick,"
glittering ball, or some such tangible name, as they could form no
approximate conception or idea of measuring heat.
     As   I   before mentioned,        these people       are not deficient in brain
power;       it rather lies dormant and              unused     in their savage state.
When       I  had charge of the Andamanese Hospital, there was a patient
in it called       Jerry,  an Andaman          lad of twelve, who had been con
verted to Christianity         and educated in tho Ross school.                   He  was of
pure Andaman parentage,              and had not attained the age of puberty,
 yet he     could read English and Oordoo (Hindustani) fluently, as well
 as   speak and write in both of these languages, — retaining also a
 knowledge       of his Andaman language,             — and   had a fair knowledge of
 arithmetic.        A number of        these lads are being so educated, and tho
 intelligence     they display when the latter is developed is considerable.
     By disposition      thase people are generous and affable, always merry
 and     laughing.      When     one      receives    a present     of tobacco, &c., he
 always shares       it equally with his         friends.     The same is done with
 the proceeds      of the chase.       The men and women never work together.
 The men do little more than hunt pig, spear                      turtle, and catch fish.
 The women do all the romaining work of the community, including
  the   bringing of firewood,          and    water,    making and keeping up the
 fires,   &c.    The latter are also the barbers of the community, and it
  is in this capacity that their milk subserves                 the other      use  I before
 adverted      to, viz., the function         of shaving soap        !    It  may be seen
  from the figures      that these people all shave the head.                   When this
  process    requires performing, tho person to be shaved sits before the
  female barber, the latter then compresses                 her breast with the hand,
  and   directing the nipple over the part to be shaved, emits a jet of
   milk.     This fluid is rubbed in with the             finger, and then the surface
  very cleanly shaved with a piece of broken glass or shell                     !

     Their diet          consists   mostly of pig and turtle flesh, together with
various edible roots, Jack fruit, plantains, mangoes, &c.                                  Those in
Hospital or in the Convalescent House have                          a    regular daily ration      of
curry and rice, properly cooked.                     They also consume a large               amount
of sugar-cane, which they are very fond                        of chewing.           I   have seen   a
comparatively small child chew out the sugar from                                a   yard of    cane
of an inch thick, with the result of visible distension of its                              stomach
at the conclusion             of the meal
     The men are good hunters and marksmen with the bow and                                   arrow.
     In   spearing          turtle they use a barbed arrow with removable                      head.
This      comes out from the arrow shaft, but is attached by means of                                a
strong cord to the boat containing                    the hunters        ;   thus the turtles     are
secured alive and stored up in tanks.                         A similar plan is          adopted in
shooting pigs.               They are very skilful at shooting fish under                     water,
they      seem intuitively           to have       calculated      with great accuracy            the
difference of direction to bo allowed from oblique aqueous refraction,
and,      I    am told, shoot        fish in this manner             at a distance         of thirty
yards, with threo-pronged               barbed arrows.
     Their       bows       are double curve bows of great strength.                       The bow
strings         are    made      by the women,             out of the fibrous portion of
certain jungle sapplings.                   This   is obtained by picking off the outer
bark          and     scraping      it with    a shell,      which       separates       the fibrous
portion, and the latter is subsequently made into cord by twisting
between             the hands.       Their arrows          are long and          with      variously-
shaped heads, according to the use to which they are applied; some
are seen in the plate (figs. 2 and                   3).   I   have seen some arrows used
in war, with such broad heads that they would completely disembowel
an    enemy         if   striking    in the abdomen.              They are not apparendy
acquainted            with any substance for poisoning their shafts.
     In       personal      adornment they are very curious,                   and their      decora
tions seem, according to our ideas, very grotesque.
     The men, when out hunting, &a, in the jungle wear little or                                     no
appendage.               They paint and wear more ornaments                       when returned
and living in their community, and of course most of all in                                   connec
tion with             any    "nautch"        or public ceremony.                The women          are
always more adorned.                  They, however, occasionally put on                    bracelets
and anklets, consisting of simple bands                           with    a   number of        curled
leafy         appendages         attached     thereto,       In   fig.   4    may    be seen cer

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              423
tain    necklaces     worn     by the women          mostly.     These     consist    of
the   bones     of their    departed     friends.     The bones      most    generally
used    for   this   decorative     purpose    are   the metacarpal,       metatarsal,
and    the larger     phalanges      of hand and foot.         I  have    seen a few
necklaces      in   use where      the   vertebrae    are used    for this purpose.
When the former          class of bones are used they detach            the articular
extremities,     and connect the medullary cavities by string as seen in
the figure.
    Another curious decoration           is the attaching of a skull round the
neck by      string, and allowing it to hang down the back.                    This    is
 only done     with   the skulls of chiefs or others who were of importance
 during   their lifetime, and is generally reckoned           a  mark of esteem to
 the  memory of the person whose skull is so used (fig. 3).
     Tatooing     the body is much practised           by them, and is generally
 performed      about the period of adolescence.              It   is performed       by
 cutting    the   skin with      sharp pieces of shell or glass, then washing
 the cut    surface with water, then heating the same over a fire, until              —
 I  should imagine — it becomes painfully hot, and                finally rubbing in
 a  mixture of red clay and turtle fat.             "When quite healed, the cuts
  merely present       the   appearance      of so many cicatrices,        no especial
  coloration    being retained by them.           They also paint their bodies a
  great  deal, and often in the most           fantastic  patterns,   one side white
  checks,    other side red       stripes,   &c.    The colours     mostly used are
  white, red,    and a kind of yellow.           The former painted all over the
  face   as  well   as body, indicates that the          person    so  adorned     is in
  mourning      for  the recent     decease    of  some near relative.        The red
  paint is made        by mixing      a red (iron oxide) clay found here with
  turtle fat,   and the yellow seems to be a mixture of this with the
   white, together      with    some coloured       sap from one of         the jungle
   bees.    The paint is applied in all sorts of ways, a favourite one
   with the    women being to paint the face white, with eyebrows                    and
   nose red !
      As   I   before   mentioned, they are a happy and joyous people,
   always    in exuberant spirits. They are very fond of singing and
   dancing.      When they perform a regular national dance the men are
   the   dancers, the     women      and children      forming the accompanying
    "hand and chorus."          The latter all sit in one place, and sing in

  This chant                     is accompanied            by the rhythmical clapping of                          hande
and beating of a resonant piece of wood, of which                                          I     have indicated
the time in the separate notes                              above.        This rhythmical                clapping         is
kept up all through the performance,                                   even when the singing stops.
The dancers                     form in Indian             file,   the body slightly              bent and the
arms overhead,                      with        the hands joined       like in   the position for diving.
They then dance forward, one at                                    a time,     with    a peculiar tripping
step, giving the ground at every second pace a peculiar kind of back
kick.      The words of the chant are first given out solo by the                                             leading
dancer,         and then taken up by the women's                                     chorus,         and repeated
over and over again.                              They extemporise           the words on any                 passing
subject.         Thus at one dance, at which                           I was   present,    I was         the subject
of their lay.                    The words they sang, broadly translated,                                having          the

       W. W. J. Nicol, M.A.           Communicated by Professor Crum
       Brown.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The author, after referring to the paper by Pfankuch,* who obtained
by the action    of sulphide of   potassium    upon chloroform      a crystalline
substance which he held to be a         compound of sulphide of potassium
and   sulphoform, and to the paper by Bouchardatt on sulphoform,
gives  a detailed account of his own investigation.
    The products formed when chloroform acts on an alcoholic solution
of sulphide of potassium       (prepared    by dissolving caustic      potash   in
alcohol, saturating one-half with sulphuretted hydrogen and then add
ing the other half) arc sulphydrate of potassium             and thioformiate   of
},ota»fium    (HCOSK,     analogous    in constitution    to thiacotate).     The
action    is probably as foUows:— HCC13 + 2K2S               = 3KC1 + HCSSK,
and HCSSK + H20« HCOSK + H2S, this sulphuretted                         hydrogen
forming sulphydrate with the sulphide of potassium.
    Thioformiate    of potassium    is converted  into formiate by oxide of
 mercury.      The silver salt blackens owing to formation of sulphide
 of silver, slowly at ordinary temperatures,      rapidly on heating.
    The   free acid could not be prepared, its aqueous solution (prepared
 by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen on the lead salt suspended
 in water) rapidly decomposes, yielding formic acid.

     The following Communications were read                   :   —
1.    On the Geology of the Rocky Mountains.                          By Professor
          Geikie.
2.    On Comets.            By Professor Forbes.
     The author commenced           by stating that although these researches
lead him to believe in the existence of two planets revolving in orbits
external to that of Neptune, and although there was a great deal of
evidence to show that ho had actually determined the elements                       of
the orbits, yet the latter point, being dependent on a coincidence                  of
probabilities only, cannot be considered a certainty until the planets
are observed.
     The author accepts the theory of cometary orbits which supposes
that these bodies, wandering through space, are attracted by the sun
into the solar system         so as to pursue   parabolic orbits, and that some
of these, in passing a planet, may have their velocity diminished, in
which      case       they will afterwards describe      an ellipse in a definite
period.
     It   has   long been      known that the greatest distances          (aphelion
distances)        to which    comets recede from the sun are grouped              into
classes.        Thus there is a large class of comets whose aphelion dis
tance is about the same as the distance              of Jupiter from the sun, and
another large class with aphelion distance equal to Neptune's distance.
The author has noticed that of the other periodic comets there is                    a
large group of aphelion distances          100 times as far from the sun as
the earth       is,   and another about 300 times.       The rest of space   is   very
free from aphelion distances.           This    is   shown by the accompa^lng
table.
     At   the   British Association in    1879 Professor Newton of America
proved some important propositions with respect to the introduction

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                     427
of planets         into    the solar      system.      In  answer     to a question he said
 that    his theory explained why the aphelion distance of                            a comot is
generally        about     the same as the distance of the planet which rendered
its orhit       elliptic.        The author then publicly stated that there could be
no longer a         doubt that two planets exist beyond the orbit of Neptune,
one about          100 times, the other about 300 times the distance of the
earth      from the sun, with periods                 of revolution of about 1000 and
5000       years respectively.
     If   this be the           case,  the aphelion positions of a majority of the
comets        in each group would probably lie in                 one plane, which would
be    the plane of the planet's orbit.                 The analogy of the Jupiter group
rwraires        this  ;  for although the orbits of the comets connected with
Jupiter have every degree of inclination to the ecliptic, the aphelia
of most        of them      are not far distant from the plane of               Jupiter's orbit.
Some,        of course, might be expected to have been deflected from their
»ri;,nnal       orbits     slightly     by planetary perturbations, especially                those
 which had been a long time                    in the solar system.
     The author          calculated      out the seven aphelion positions of comets
 which are          grouped        at a distance = 100,         determining their latitude
 and     longitude.
      The author presented              to himself the following         problems: — 1. Are
 there a       fair number of          these aphelion positions lying in one plane
 passing through              the sun?        2.  Determine the position of the nodes
 and     inclination of this orbit.               3. Is it  possible    to imagine     a planet,
 moving         with    tolerable      uniformity, to occupy in the course of a few
 revolutions          the aphelion positions exactly at                 the aphelion dates         1
  4-   Is the velocity which we must for this reason assume about the
  same      as  that of    a   planet whose distance = 100          1    What     is the present
  position of the planet             1   The seven comets of this group are             : —

    On marking upon a celestial globe the aphelion positions,                          it was
immediately seen that four of them lay exactly upon a great circle,
cutting the ecliptic at an angle of 53° and at the longitude 250'.
This is    the plane of the orbit of the supposed             planet.       It   is remark
able that     none of the four aphelion distances             of the comets marked
above     L, II., IV., VII.,       diverge    from this plane by more than 2 or
 3 degrees.
    The longitudes of these four aphelion distances                  measured        on this
plane of the        hypothetical planet were then calculated              ;   their values
 measured     from^)        are given    in column       L  above.     It   is evidently
impossible to suppose             that the hypothetical         planet could         in one
revolution, either by direct or retrograde                motion, have passed            each
of the aphelion positions at the aphelion times.                   It  was a matter         of
some labour to determine whether this could happen                      even      in  2  or  3
revolutions, and a large number of hypotheses                were tried.       Eventually
one was found agreeing             well with facts, but involving            suppositions
as to   previous apparitions of comets.              According to this theory cornet
IV.   was introduced           into the system in 409 a.d., comet               L in     96S,
 comet    VII.    in   1608, and comet       II. in 1655.      These are dates         when
 the comets reached their           aphelion.       A planet   moving at the rate of
 2 '788 years      to   1°, or 997 years to a revolution, would,              if it was     S3
ahead of the comet          IV. in   409 A.D., be 9° behind comet           I. in 968,      6°
behind comet           VII.   in  1608, and      8°  ahead of comet        VI.    in 1651.
 These are all very close, provided we have evidence                  that comets         IV.
and    I. have     been seen so often         before.     Comet   I.  ought from the
 known period to have been visible in the years 1490 and                      1 140.      The
 comet of the previous date has always been suspected to be the same
 as comet    l.     The comets which were seen about 1140 are so vaguely
 described    that they cannot bo identified.
     Comet    IV.    ought to have been seen in 1861, 1446, 1031, 616 A.D.,
 comets were seen in 1861, 1444,                1032, 617 a.d.
     All apparitions previous         to 1861 were seen about        July, and in        each
case the star       ft Leonis is mentioned as being close to the comet.                     It
 remained only        to  see  if the orbit of the comet IV. which appeared in
 1861 suits these conditions.             The author converted         the heliocentric
 elements of the comet's position           just    before reaching the ecliptic         into
 geocentric     elements on the supposition of the earth being in its                   July
 position.      The result is that the comet would be seen to pass within

a degree     of (i Leonis.        The path would cut the ecliptic with geo
centric   longitude      = 170°.
    This   will be conclusive       evidence     to all that these four comets are
identical,   and this in itself is an interesting deduction from the
present research.
    The eccentricity and         longitude of perihelion of the plane of the
planet's    orbit    can   be estimated      by noticing the different aphelion
distances    at different longitudes.           This   gives  us -08 as the eccen
tricity and    -sr about 290.°
    The   period of the supposed            planet   gives   a mean     distance = 98,
which agrees       with what goes before.
    The elements of the planet for            July  18S0 are consequently —

Its present      longitude     measured      from   12  up   to the node and then
dung the planet's orbit is 185J.
     [Additional      Note, 'Slst   March       1880. — Another       calculation  was
 made on the        supposition of the planet being on the plane of the
echptic,    and affecting       the  comets      when nearest       to their aphelion
 positions.      This   gives its present longitude = 184         .
     This hypothesis is strongly supported by the fact that the author
 lias  computed      the   position of Neptune by its intluence on comets
 correct   within     2°, although previously ignorant of its position.]
     From the      six comets whose aphelion distance is about 300 times
 the   distance of the earth from the sun, the elements of the perturbing
 planet have      roughly been calculated.          This   gives —

the planet 100 years ago, was a star             "11 Vulpecuhe," which Baily
reported missing.        The hest orbit to suit the position of that star is —
                                   n = 262°
                                    i«55°.
 If  this be the true orbit the present position must be slightly altered.
     Those comets which have been in the solar system for an enor
 mous time      would have their orbits probably deflected, and would
 not therefore     appear in these calculations.
  3.   Note on the Velocity of Gaseous Particles at the Negative
               Pole of  a Vacuum Tube.            By Professor Tait.
    The recent exhibition by Professor G. Forbes of some of the latest
of Mr Crookes' experiments,          together with what         I  had read or heard
about     their explanation, led me to infer that               I    might determine
directly the velocity of the luminous particles near the negative pole
 (and perhaps      at other parts) of a vacuum           tube by means of obser
 vations     of the spectrum    made     in directions perpendicular            to, and
 parallel to, the lines of motion of the incandescent                particles of  gas.
     I  made the attempt on some charcoal-bromine vacuum tubes,                       for
 which    I  have to thank Professor Dewar, but             I found     the light to be
 so   feeble   that it was impossible to employ an eight-prism spectro
 scope.      A  one-prism   spectroscope,    when the spectra taken in and
 perpendicular to the direction of motion of the particles were placvd
 side by side, showed       merely that the velocity could not amount to
 anything like 90 miles per second.              There did seem to be a very
 slight shifting of the former spectrum             towards the violet, but this
 appearance      was probably due to the           fact that     its  light had     been
 weakened       by two reflections,     while     that of the other was taken
 direct.
     It was evident that one cause at least            of the failure is the great
 loss of   light by multiplied     reflections   when     a  powerful spectroscope
 is employed.        Thus   I was driven       to try the only other available
 method      with   which   I was    acquainted, and          which indeed       I   had
 employed      for more than ten years as an occasional part of the routine
 work in the physical laboratory.          This   method depends upon rotation
 (by quartz) of the plane of polarisation, combined                 (when necessary)

with     sufficient prism dispersion just to separate the various bright
lines of the source              from one another.
     My former assistant,                  Professor D. H. Marshall, made for me, in
1870,       a series      of careful measurements                     of the change         of plane of
polarisation          of the lines C             and    F of hydrogen by this           method,     using
a   vacuum tube             with      a narrow bore,             no slit, and        a prism   of small
angle.          It was found         to give fair but not excellent results.                   Although
no greater       thickness of quartz was employed than the plates supplied
along       with Duboscq's saccharimeter,                      the    planes of polarisation of C
and     F   were separated            by the thickest of them upwards of 130°                       ;   but
the    determination of the exact point of extinction is not easy.                                       In
measuring         with practically                homogeneous         light, like that of       a   spirit-
lamp     with chloride of sodium or of lithium, the prismatic dispersion
»as,     of course,        not required.               The great merit of the rotatory polari
sation process            consists        in   the fact that there is scarcely any additional
loss    of light      incurred by using a foot or two of quartz                             instead of a
few      millimetres, and thus in proportion increasing the amount                                        of
rotatory        displacement          ;    while the thicker the quartz                the less is the
inevitable         percentage             error of observation.               Also the      position of
each     bright line is determined                     in   terms of a standard quartz-rotation,
and     needs no comparison                     spectrum.       It    remains      to be seen whether,
on     trial,   it may      be found possible                 to have       a great length of quartz
cut    with sufficient accuracy, and whether the bright lines are narrow
enough          for this        mode           of observation.          I   have    ordered    a    6-inch
cylinder of quartz,              and           hope soon      to have       observations      made with
it.      Meanwhile         it    seems          likely that this combination of polarising
and      analysing        prisms,         with    a    quartz plate, and        a   small direct vision
spectroscope       (with very wide slit), may be well adapted for measure
 ments       of position of the bright lines in the spectra of auroras, comets,
 and nebulae,           where       it     is    not easy to employ either              a   comparison
 spectrum        or   a   wire micrometer.

tutie must       be vertical with its closed end up, and the part of it
occupied        by    the       manometric              water-column              must be kept at                      a
nearly       enough definite temperature                         by a surrounding glass jacket-
tube     of     ice-water.                This    glass      jacket-tube          is        wide     enough           to
allow    little lumps of                  ice to be dropped into                 it from its upper              end,
which is open.                  By aid of             an india-rubber            tube        connected         with
its lower      end, and         a    little movable cistern,                as   shown in the draw
ing, the      level of      the water            in    the jacket is kept from a few inchw
above to a      quarter of an inch below that of the interior manoir.i trie
column.         Thus, by dropping in lumps of                               ice so as always to keep
some     unmelted          ice floating in the water of the jacket,                                 it   is easy to
keep the       temperature of the top of the manometric water-column
exactly at the freezing                   temperature.             As   we shall see presently, tho
manometric water below its free surface                                 may be at any temperature
from     freezing to 10° C. above                       freezing without                more       than       4'ff   per
cent.    of hydrostatic               error.      The temperature                 in the vapour-space
above the       liquid column               may be either freezing                 or anything higher.
It   ought not to be lower than freezing, because,                               if    it    were so, vapour
would condense             as    hoar frost on the glass, and evaporation from the
top of the       liquid column would                        either cryophoruswiso                        freeze the
hquid there,         or cool         it   below the freezing point.
     The chief        object of keeping tho top of the manometric column
exactly at the             freezing-point              is   to render perfectly                    definite and
constant       the steam-pressure                in   the space above it.
  A     second object           of considerable importance when                              the bore of the
tube     is   so small          as    one      millimetre,         is   to give constancy to the
capillary tension               of the surface              of   the    water.         The elevation by
capillary attraction of ice-cold                        water      in   a   tube of one              millimetre
bore     is   about   7     millims.             The constancy           of temperature                   provided
 by    the    surrounding             iced water            will    be      more       than sufficient to
prevent       any perceptible error due to inequality of this effect.                                                To
avoid error      from capillary attraction the bore of the tube ought to bo
very     uniform,     ifit      is   so small as one millimetre.                       If   it   be three    milli
metres or more,         a       very rough approach to uniformity would suffice.
     A   third object of the ised-water jacket, and one of much more
 importance       than the second,                is    to give accuracy               to tho hydrostatic
 measurement          by keeping the density of the water throughout the
 long vertical       branch detiuite and constant.                          But the density of water

 434                Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
 at tho   freezing point is only      ^    per cent. less than         the  maximum
 density, and is the same as the density at                 8°  C.  ;   and therefore
 when    j1^  per cent.     is an admissible error on our             ther-|j
 mometric pressure,        the   density will be nearly enough
 constant with any temperature          from 0° to 10° C. through
 out the column.          But on     account of the        first object
 mentioned    above, the very top of the water-column must bo
 kept with exceeding exactness at the freezing temperature.

jacket not shown in the drawing, to keep it very accurately at some

 definite    temperature so that the density of the mercury may be
 accurately     known.
    The simple form of steam thermometer                     represented         with figured
 dimensions      in    the first diagram     will  be   very convenient for practical
use    for temperatures from freezing to 60°.                 Through this range the
pressure     of vapour of water, reckoned in terms of the balancing
column      of water of maximum density, increases from 6^ to 202 4
centimetres      ;   and for this, therefore,       a tube    of   a  little more than          2
metres     will    suffice.     From 60° to 140° the pressure of steam now
reckoned      in   terms of the length         of a   balancing column of mercury
at 0°    increases from 14-88 to 271           -8 centimetres      ;  and for this a tube
of   280 centimetres           may be provided.          For higher          temperatures       a
longer column, or several columns, as                in  the multiple manometer,              or
an accurate      air pressure-gauge,        or some other means, such as a very
accurate      instrument         constructed on the          principle        of     Bourdon's
metallic     pressure-gauge,        may be employed,          so   as    to allow us        still
to use     water and vapour of water as thermometric substance.
                         Hiyh-pressure Steam          Thermometer.
    At 230'     C,     the   superior limit of Regnault's high-pressure                   steam
experiments,        the    pressure   is 27 '53 atmos, but there is no need for
limiting our steam thermometer to this temperature                              and pressure.
 Suitable means          can easily be found for measuring               with all needful
 accuracy much higher pressures               than 27 atmos.             But at       so high  a
 temperature        as    140°,   vapour of mercury measured                     by a water
 column, as      shown in the          diagram     (fig.  3), becomes           available for
 purposes for        which      one  millimetre     to   the    degree       is   a sufficient
 sensibility.       The mercury-steam-pressure           thermometer,           with pressure
 measured      by water-column, of dimensions shown in the drawing,
 serves   from 140° to 280°           C,  and   will   have very ample              sensibility
 through     the upper half of             its scale.      At     280°       its    sensibility
 will be about          4|    centimetres    to the degree       !     For      temperatures
 above     280° sufficient sensibility for most             purposes        is obtained by
 substituting       mercury for water in that              simplest        form of steam
 thermometer         shown in fig.     1, in which the pressure of the steam is
 measured      by a column of the liquid itself kept at a definite tempera
 ture.     When       the   liquid  is mercury    there    is no virtue         in   the parti-
        vou x.                                                                     3 o

accurate     way of keeping            the    mercury at a
definite temperature.            As the     pressure of mer
cury     steam      is   at   all ordinary atmospheric
temperatures quite imperceptible to the hydro
 static test when mercury itself is the balancing
 liquid,    that which was the chief reason for
 fixing the temperature at the interface between
 liquid and vapour           at the   top of the pressure-
 measuring column when the balancing liquid
 was water, has no weight in the present case
                                                                                   i

 but, on the other hand, a much more precise
 definiteness       than     the   ten     degrees      latitude

  is now necessary.            In   fact,   a change         of temperature         of 2-2* in
  mercury at any atmospheric temperature                       produces     about the same
  proportionate         change    of density       as    is produced         in   water    by   a
   change of temperature           from 0° to          10°, that       is to    say, about ¥\y
   per   cent. ;   but    there   is no difficulty          in keeping, by means of a
   water jacket, the mercury column constant to some definite tem
   perature      within      a  vastly     smaller      margin       of    error    than    2 "2°,
   especially if       wo    choose     for   the    definite temperature            something
   near the atmospheric           temperature       at the      time, or the temperature
   of whatever abundant water supply                        may     be   available.      If   the
   glass    tube    for the      pressure-measuring            mercury      column      be   838
   centimeters       long, the simple mercury-steam                   thermometer may be
   used    up to 520°        C,  the highest temperature              reached     by Regnault

     thermometric           sensibility           for temperatures                more than two or threo
     degrees       below        the        freezing-point.                 Hence,         to    make           a    steam
     thermometer for such temperatures                                some other substance               than water
     should       be taken,       and       none           seems better adapted                 for the purpose
     than     sulphurous          acid, which,                in the       apparatus           represented           with

438                     Proceedings        of the Royal     Society
figured dimensions in the accompanying diagram (fig. 4), makes an
admirably        convenient and sensitive thermometer for temperatures
from + 20° to something far below                    - 30°,   as   we    see  from     the
results of Regnault's measurements.
     To sum up, we have, in the preceding description and drawings,
a complete series of steam-pressure                  thermometers, of sulphurous
acid, of water, and of mercury, adapted                  to  give absolutely definite
and highly sensitive thermometric indications                    throughout the wide
range     from something much below                  -  30° to considerably         above
 520° of the centigrade           scale.     The graduation of the scales of these
thermometers           to   show absolute temperature is to be                 made by
calculation from the           thermodynamic formula —
 where    t denotes        the absolute      temperature    corresponding to steam-
 pressure    p  ;   p0 to the absolute        temperature    corresponding to steam-
 pressure pg      ;  k the latent heat of the steam            per unit mass      ; p the
 density of the steam           ; and    a  the ratio of the density of the steam
 to the density of the          liquid in    contact  with it.     When    the requisite
 experimental data, that is to say, the values of               <r and  p<c for different
  values of    p    throughout the range for which           each substance      is to be
  used   as thermometric           fluid are available, the graduation             of the
 scales of these thermometers                to show absolute      temperature can be
 performed in practice by calculation from the formula.                         Hitherto
  these requisites have not been all given by direct experiment for any
  one  of  the three substances          with sufficient    accuracy   for our thermo
  metric purpose         through any range whatever.             Water,     naturally, is
  the one for which the nearest approach               to the requisite information
  has been     obtained.        For it Regnault's experiments have given, no
  doubt with great          accuracy, the values of p and of k for all tempera
  tures  reckoned by his normal                 air thermometer,      which     we now
  regard    merely      as   an arbitrary      scale of temperature,       through    the
  range from        - 30°   to + 230°.       If he, or any other experimenter, had
 given us with similar accuracy through the same range the values of
 l< and  <r  for temperatures         reckoned on the same arbitrary scale, we
 should have all the data from experiment required for the graduation
 of our water-steam           thermometer to absolute thermodynamic                 scale.

The arbitrary constant of integration,                                 /0,   is    truly arbitrary.         It will
be       convenient to give          it      such   a   value that the difference of values of
t   between the freezing-point of water and the temperature                                             for which
p    is    equal to one atmo shall be 100, as this makes                                       it   agree with the
centigrade scale in respect                       to the difference                   between        the numbers
measuring the               temperatures               which       on         the        centigrade     scale    are
marked          0- and          100°.         Indirectly,          by means                of experiments on
hydrogen gas, this assignation                       of the arbitrary constant of integration
would give 273 for the absolute temperature                                         0J    C,   and 373 for that
of 100°         C,   as   is   proved in          p.    56 of the article on                    " Heat," in      the
Encydopaedia Britannica.                            Meantime, as said above, we have not

we have,         from experiments on air and on hydrogen and other                                          gases,
data which allow us to graduate                           indirectly any continuous intrinsic
thermoscope               according to the absolute                          scale.        By thus indirectly
graduating           the water-steam                thermometer,               we learn the density of
steam at         different temperatures                  with more probable accuracy than
it       has hitherto       been     made           known        by any direct experiments on
water-steam itself.
         Merely viewed          as   a   continuous intrinsic thermoscope,                              the steam-
thermometer,              in one or other of the forms described                                    above to suit
different parts of the entire range from the lowest temperatures                                                  to
temperatures              somewhat above                520°,      is        no     doubt superior in the
conditions requisite for accuracy                        to every other thermoscope                        of any
    of   the different      kinds hitherto in                use   ;    and        it    may be trusted more
surely         for accuracy          than any other as                       a     thermometric standard
when once            it   has been           graduated        according to the absolute                     scale,
whether by practical experiments on steam, or indirectly by experi
ments on         air or other            gases.         In   fact,           the    use of steam-pressure
measured         in definite units of pressure,                         as    a     thennoscopic effect, in
the steam         thermometer             is      simply     a   continuous extension to every
temperature, of the principle already practically adopted for fixing
the temperature             which        is      called 100° on the centigrade                         scale; and

440                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
it   stands      on    precisely the same theoretical              footing     as    an air
thermometer,           or a mercury-in-glass thermometer,                or   an     alcohol
thermometer,         or a methyl-butyrate thermometer,                in respect to the
graduation of its scale according to absolute temperature.                        Any     one
intrinsic       thermoscope        may     be so graduated ideally           by thermo
dynamic experiments on the substance itself without the aid of any
other thermometer           or any other thermometric substance                 ;  but the
steam-pressure          thermometer has the great practical advantage over
all others,      except    the air thermometer,          that these experiments            are
easily realisable with great accuracy instead of being, though ideally
possible,      hardly to be considered possible               as a practical     means      of
attaining to thermodynamic thermometry.                       In  fact, for water-steam
it    is   only   the     most    easily obtained        of experimental         data, the
measurement          of the density of the steam at different pressures, that
has      not   already been         actually     obtained      by   direct experiment.
Whether         or not      when this lacuna has been filled up by direct
experiments,          the   data    from    water-steam       alone    may    yield more
accurate thermodynamic thermometry than we have at present                             from
the hydrogen or nitrogen gas thermometer,                      — to  be described       in  a
subsequent         communication          to   the Royal Society (Proceedings,

 once we have           the means,      directly   from itself, or indirectly          from
 comparison with            hydrogen      or nitrogen        or air thermometers,          of
 graduating once for all a sulphurous acid steam thermometer, water-
 steam      thermometer,        or mercury-steam        thermometer,       that is to say,
 when once we have            a  table of the absolute thermodynamic tempera
 tures corresponding to the different steam pressures of the substances
 sulphurous         acid,    water,    and   mercury,      we    have    a   much      more
accurate and more easily reproducible standard than either the air
or gas thermometer            of any form, or the mercury thermometer,                     or
any      liquid     thermometer       can   give.     In   fact,  the   series    of  steam
 thermometers         for the whole range from the lowest temperatures                   can
 be reproduced with the greatest               ease  in any part of the world by            a
person commencing with                no other material than a piece of sulphur
and      air to burn it in,1 some pure water, some pure mercury, and
    1                                                            of preparing sulphurous
       Practically,    the best   ordinary chemical     means

                    2.  On a Sulphurous Acid Cryophorus.
                                By Sir W. Thomson.
                                      (Alstrad.)
    The instrument          exhibited   to the Royal Society consisted of a
U-shaped glass tube stopped              at both ends, containing           sulphurous
acid    liquid    and steam.        The process         by which      the   sulphurous
acid    is freed from air, which was partially               exhibited to the Royal
Society, is as      follows : —
    Begin with      a glass    U tube open     at both ends, and attach to each
a   small convenient, very fine, and perfectly gas-tight,                     stop-cock.
Placing      it with     the   bend  down in       a freezing     mixture,     condense
pure well-dried sulphurous acid gas direct into it from the generator
till it  is full nearly     to the tops of the two branches.            Then close the
stop-cock,      detach    from the generator, and remove from the freezing
mixture.         Holding it still with     the bend down, apply gentle heat to
the bend, by a warm hand or by aid of a spiriHamp,                    so as to  produce
boiling, the bubbles rising up in either one or the other of the two
brandies.        After doing this for        some time       let the bend cool, and
apply gentle       heat to the surface of the            liquid in that    one   of   the
branches      into which the bubbles passed.              With   great care now open
very slightly the stop-cock at the top of this branch,                 until  the liquid
is up to very near the top of the tube, and close the stop-cock before
it begins to blow out.           Repeat the process several times, causing the
bubbles sometimes            to rise up one branch, and sometimes up the
other.      After this      has been    done two or three           dozen   times,   it is
quite certain that only a very infinitesimal amount of air can have
remained       in the apparatus.      When      satisfied that this is the case, sink
the bend once more into a freezing mixture, and                    with  a convenient
blow-pipe and flame melt the glass tube below each stop-cock so                     as to
hermetically seal the two ends of the             U    tube, and detach them from
the stop-cocks.         This   completes    the construction of the sulphurous
acid cryophorus.
   The instrument,          if turned with     the bend up and the two sealed
ends    down, may be used as             a   cryophorus presenting interesting
peculiarities.
   The most interesting qualities are those which it presente when

held     with the bend down.                                   In this position it constitutes                                 a    differ
ential      thermometer of exceedingly high sensibility, founded on the
difference       of sulphurous acid steam-pressure due to difference of
pressure       in the two branches.   One very remarkable and interesting
feature       is the exceeding sluggishness with which the liquid finds
its level        in the two                     branches               when the external temperature                                      is
absolutely           uniform all round.                             In this        respect               it   presents             a most
remarkable                contrast          with          a   U    tube,      in other respects similar, but
occupied         by water              and water-steam                     instead of sulphurous acid and
sulphurous-acid-steam.                               If the        U   tube of water be suddenly inclined
10 or      20 degrees to the vertical in the plane of the two branches,
the   water oscillates before it settles with the free surfaces in the two
branches at               the     same level.                  When        the same is done to the                                 U   tube
of   sulphurous acid, it                        seems         to take no notice of gravity                            ;   but in the
course      of several minutes it is seen that the liquid is sinking slowly
in one        branch and rising in                              the      other towards identity of level.
The reason                is obvious.

      This is a case of fluid motion, in which the stream lines are ap

 Hence,    and by (6),     and (26), and (25), and (23), the condition

  Eliminating C/C from this by (27) we get an equation to determine

     A very interesting Sub-case is that of a =        oo ,   which, by (27), makes
  C=  0; and therefore, by (33), gives

    Whether in Case         II.  or Sub-case   II.  we  see  that the disturbance
consists of an undulation travelling round the cylinder               with angular
 velocity
or of two such undulations superimposed                on one another,    travelling
round the cylinder with angular velocities greater                 than and (alge
braically) less than the angular velocity of the mass of the               liquid at
its free surfaces by equal differences.            The propagation of the wave
of greater velocity is in the same direction as that in which the
liquid revolves      ;  the    propagation of the other is in the contrary
direction when       N>     i2 (as it certainly is in   some cases).
    If the free surface be started in motion with one or other           of the two
principal angular velocities (34), or linear velocities             ao, (l ±
and the    liquid   be then left to itself,      it will perform   the simple    har
 monic undulatory movement             represented    by (6), (26), (23).     But if
the free surface be displaced to the corrugated form (30) and then
left free either at rest or with any other distribution                  of normal
velocity than either of those, the corrugation will,               as it were,  split
into two sets of waves travelling with the two different velocities
   The    case    i=0     is clearly exceptional,      and can present       no   un
dulations      travelling     round    the cylinder.       It will   be  considered
later.
   The    case    i=1     is   particularly   important and interesting.           To
evaluate    N"  for it remark that

diminished from +               1    to 0.       Hence (50), regarded as                a transcendental

coming nearer and nearer down to the roots                      of J0, the greater they
are.      They     are easily calculated by aid of Hansen's Tables of Bessel's
functions        J0 and    J,  (which is equal to J'0) from q = 0 to q = 20.*
When ma is a small fraction of unity, the second member of (53) is
a large number, and even the smallest root exceeds by but a small
fraction       the first root of J0('y)         = 0,  which, according to Hansen's
Table, is 2 -4049, or approximately enough for the present 2-4.                           In
every case        in which     q is   very large in comparison        with   ma, whether
ma is      small or not, (54) gives

 Now going back to (6) we see that the summation                        of two solutions
 to   constitute waves propagated along the length of the column, gives
                  r =  - I sin   (nt

 The     velocity of propagation of these waves is njm.                    Hence when       q
  is large   in comparison with            ma, the velocity of longitudinal           waves
  is 2wajq,      or 2jq of the translational velocity of the surface of the
  core    in its circular orbit.          This is 1j1%         or £ of  the translational
  Telocity,     in the   case  of ma small, and the mode corresponding to the
  smallest    root of (53).        A full examination of         the internal motion of
  the core, as expressed         by (55), (13), (48), (15) is most interesting and

     Compare          this result with (43) above.             The fact that, as in (43),
      - 7i   is positive in (61), shows that in this case also the direction in
     which the disturbance travels round the cylinder is retrograde                                (or
     opposite to that of the translation of fluid in the undisturbed vortex)                          ;
    and,       as  is to be expected,        the    values     of   -n      are approximate!y
     equal     in   the two eases, when ma is small enough                    ;  but it is smaller
     by a relatively small difference            in (60) than in (43), as is also to                be
     expected.
         The     case   of ma small and      i >1    has a particularly simple approxi
     mate solution for the smallest </-root of the transcendental (50).                        With
     any value of / instead of unity we            still  have (58),       as a   first approxima
     tion for      q small.    Eliminating     q-j<u2a2 between          this and (52) we still
     find X=            but instead of n = 0 by (51), we now have » = (i - l)a.
     Thus is proved the solution for waves of deformation of sectional
     figure travelling round a cylindrical            vortex, announced thirteen               years

4 The Structure of the Comb-like Branchial Appendages and
        the Teeth of the Basking                  Shark (Selache maxima).               By
        Professor Turner, M.B., F.R.S.
    Attention      was    drawn to the statements             made on the position of
peculiar comb-liko fringes on the branchiae                   of the basking shark by
Gunnerus,        Pennant, Low, Mitchell, Foulis, Brito Capello, Cornish,
Steenstrup,       Pavesi, P. & TI. Gervais, Percival Wright, and Allman,
and     to   the    structure of these          fringes     by Hannover         and MM.
Gervais.       The author       then    proceeded      to give a detailed     description
of the    structure of the plates forming these fringes from                  a specimen
presented      to him by the Rev. M. Harvey of St. John's, Newfound
land,    the   general summary of which is                as  follows  :  the whole peri
 phery    of a plate consisted       of  a   hard unvascular dentine, the tubes in
 which were         very distinctive      ;   in a considerable       part of the shaft
 these   tubes arose from        a single central pulp cavity, but in the semi
 lunar    attached base of the plate             the   single central cavity did not
 exist,   but was replaced         by   a set     of anastomosing        vascular canals,
  which    collectively represented         a  pulp cavity, and which gave origin
 to   numerous characteristic       dentine tubes.         It was   suggested that these
  plates  were developed in the mucous membrane                   covering the branchial
  after the   manner of teeth.           Although       these plates     act, like whale
  bone   plates, to separate from the water the small organisms                  on which
  ttiia shark lives, they were shown to be essentially different                  in struc
  ture and    mode of origin, the matrix of whalebone being a cornifica-
  tion of the    ephithelium of the palate derived from the epiblast, whilst
  the   matrix   in  the shark's branchial plates is a calcification of dermal
  or   sub-epithelial    structure, and therefore derived from the mosoblast.
  Reference      was    made    to  the observations           of Andrew       Smith     on
   BJiimfon,    in which     an apparatus having a similar office, but probably
  a different   structure, was seen in that shark            ; and to the    observations
   of VanBeneden       on a comb-like fringe found fossilised in the Antwerp
   Crag.
       The structure of the small conical teeth of the basking shark was
   then   described     from   a specimen         also  presented     by the Rev. M.
   Harvey.     They were shown to have an external layer of hard lin
   gular dentine,        covering   an extensive core in which relatively large

458                  Proceedings         of the Royal Society
vascular canals anastomosed to form              a   network.      From   these canals
numerous dentine tubes arose.                Both the core of the tooth and the
anastomosing canals with their dentine tubes in the semi-lunar base
of a comb-plate were examples of vaso-dentine.                   These plates in the
basking shark may       be regarded as an example           of excessively developed
branchial teeth,      a development which is co-related               with   the   email
size and simple form of the maxillary and mandibular teeth,                   with the
non-predaceous       habits of the fish, and with the particular nature of
the food on which        it lives.

                                                                   " Challenger   "

 pedition     wore    entrusted to mo for             description    by Sir Wyvillo
 Thomson.
    The    entire collection       comprises      from 150      to   200 species, the
majority of which are new to science.
    As yet only      some of the more           abnormal Synascid i<e and about
 half   the   Ascidhe     simpliees       have   been    carefully examined.          The
present paper is the preliminary report on the Ascidiad.e,                      the first
family of the Ascidice simpliees.
    The     family    Ascidiam;        is   synonymous       with    Savigny's     genus
 Phallusia,     or Forbes' Ascidia,         and includes those simple ascidians
which      are,   as a rule,    externally      characterised      by an eight-lobed
branchial and a six-lobed atrial aperture, as distinguished from                      two
 other families — the Cynthiad,£, with both                apertures   four-lobed,    and
 the  MolguliDjE, having the branchial six- and the atrial four-lobed.
    This point,     the   number of lobes round the apertures,                though     a
 most    important diagnostic, does not hold good for all Ascidiad^
 without     exception.      Indeed, any one of the characters of the               three
 families,   if employed singly, will          be found, while sufficing in the

example,           Axcitlia involuta              has the entire body encrusted                      with sand
grains and          shells,   a   condition characteristic ; simple       of the   Molgulidjj
unbranched tentacles, an important character in the Ascidiad.t; are
also    found       in Styela (Cynthiad.e); lastly,                        the papillated            branchial
sac     of the       A.suidiad.e          can      no longer be considered                  an       essential,

  The more              important             characteristics           of the AsciDiADyE              are the

anterior       end wide, posterior          much   narrower, forming          a short    stalk
turned        ventrally and attached to a fragment of nullipore by the
extremity of its right side.             Apertures at the anterior end, inconspicu

Surface smooth but mamillated, very strongly on the anterior                      half,
and especially near the branchial aperture            where a few more         sharply
cut papillae are visible.      Colour light smoky brown, rather deeper               in
tint at the anterior end.        Length,    8 cm ;   breadth,     4 cm.
   Test cartilaginous, thickish, of a light greyish-brown colour              through
out.    Vascular    trunks enter the test on the left side about                  half
way down, and large vessels ramify on the inner surface.
   Mantle moderately      muscular.
   Branchial    sac plicated longitudinally;        the transverse vessels      divide
the grooves     into   rows of      pouches,     which     are    rather   irregularly
placed, and have no relation to the internal longitudinal bars.                 Trans
verse vessels all nearly of one size ; meshes transversely oblong, con
taining each eight to ten stigmata             ; papillee    large   and irregularly
shaped, no intermediate smaller ones.
   Dorsal lamina ribbed transversely, and strongly pectinated at the
margin,    a rib running out to the apex of each tooth.
   Tentacles    numerous,    filiform, sixty-two       large   ones and about      the
same number of very minute intermediate ones..                     These last are so
small   as to be  easily overlooked     ;  usually one is placed between each
pair of large tentacles, but in some spaces there appears to be none.
   Olfactory tubercle large, irregularly oval in outline.
   One specimen,       in excellent     condition, from Station            162 (Bass'
Straits), 38 to 40 fathoms.
   This   species agrees   in   the thickness of its test with the next two
species, and in the structure of the branchial sac with these and some
others.     The difference of size in the tentacles, the condition of the
dorsal   lamina, the transversely oblong meshes, and the absence                     of
intermediate    papillee are all important characters.

Apertures not distant, depressed.                Surface smooth, mainillated.
Colour dark earthy-brown.           Length probably about 10 cm.            ;  breadth

     Mantle      thick    on the right (branchial) side of the body, and on the
tubes,     but not very muscular             ;  membranous      on the large distended
left    (visceral) side.         Tubes long and rather narrow.
     Branchial sac long and narrow, pointed at the posterior                              end  ;
plicated      longitudinally,         the internal      longitudinal bars being placed
on     the ridges.         Meshes transversely oblong, each containing about
six stigmata.            Papillae all of one size, irregular in shape, often cleft
or    lobed.
      Dorsal lamina ribbed transversely, and bearing small teeth on its
 free    margin.
      Tentacles      filiform, slender, alternately large and small; probably
 30 to     35   in number.
      Two specimens from Station 162 (Bass' Straits), 38 to 40 fathoms.
      In both specimens             almost     the whole of the test           is gone, which
  makes     it impossible         to give the external characters            with certainty.
  The    branchial aperture           also is damaged        in both to such an extent
  that the     exact number of tentacles and the nature of the olfactory
  tubercle     cannot      bo determined.          This   species is closely allied to the
  last.

       External appearance.           — Shape,     as  far  as can be made         out, irregu
   larly   oblong, the right side being larger than the left.                        Probably
   attached      by     the   posterior part of the            ventral    edge.      Branchial
   aperture     terminal, on        a large    irregularly rounded projection turned
   towards     the left side.        Atrial    aperture    on the dorsal       edge, also on a
   large    projection, situated more              than one-third of the way down.
    Lobes of apertures         irregular but prominent.            Surface very irregular
   and    almost    covered      by Polyzoa, Hydroida, Alga,             ifcc.     Colour of   a
    warm    yellowish-grey where the test itself is seen.                  Length about       12
    cm.;   breadth,      5 to 7 cm.
        Test  cartilaginous, very thick (2 mm. to 4 cm.) and solid, white in
    mass    with a hyaline tint where thin, yellowish-grey on the external
    surface.      Large vessels ramify in the inner layer           ;  the vascular trunks
    probably      enter    the test at the        base   of the right side towards the
     ventral edge.
        Mantle strongly         muscular over the right side and on the tubes,

  4fi4               Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 membranous      on the left side which is large and projecting.              Tulvs
 very long and diverging at more than a right angle.
     Branchial   sac very thick, coarse, and opaque, of a brown colour.
 Plicated longitudinally,      and    the grooves divided      into pouches as in
 the last two species.        On the external aspect the wide transverse
 vessels are connected     by equally wide irregularly placed longitudinal
 vessels,  thus forming      a   network of quadrangular meshes,           each   of
 which contains about four rows of stigmata.              Meshes on the internal
 surface   much    elongated      transversely,   each     containing  15    to   20
 stigmata.     Papillae  at the corners, no smaller intermediate       ones.
     Dorsal lamina wide, strongly ribbed transversely, but not pecti
 nated.
     Tentacles long and stout, about 60 in number, large and small nut
 alternating.
     Olfactory tubercle heart-shaped,       3h mm. long.
    Two specimens from Simon's Bay, 10 to 20 fathoms.
     In both, half    the test has     been cut away     ;  the ventral edge, the
 posterior  end, and part of each side is wanting.
     This species and the two preceding         are allied forms.     They    agree
 in the great thickness and solidity of the test, in the transversely
elongated meshes of the branchial sac, and             in the absence of small
intermediate papilhe.         They also possess that minute longitudinal
plication of the stigmatic part of the branchial           sac which is found in
two other new species (Ascidia pyrifurmis and Ascidia tranMucida),
and on account of which Verrill proposed to separate Ascidia <-<<m-
planata under the generic title of Ascidiopsis.             This structure, how
ever, is also to be seen in Ascidia mentula, Ascidia sordida, and several
other species, some of which differ from each other in important points.
On account of this,      I think it unadvisable     to use the plication of the
branchial    sac  as a   characteristic in breaking up Ascidia.            If   any
division of the genus is necessary, the three species just described
form   a  very natural section characterised        by the several      points of
resemblance     mentioned    above, and worthy of being separated,          not on
account    of the    similarity in structure of their branchial          sacs, but
because of the remarkable thickness and solidity of their teste sug
gesting    Pachychlama       (iro^i's and    xXoZva) as     an   appropriate   sub-
generic name.

of which       the apex is inclined ventrally and to the right.                     Atrial
aperture     to   the right of or on the dorsal edge, and               about one-third

 ventral edge, and a little in front of the middle.                  Both apertures
 rather depressed and concealed.            Surface very irregular, grooved and
 mamillated      ;  Synascidice,   annelide-tubes, &c., adhering to it.        Colour
 light yellowish-grey,         not opaque, rather hyaline at the edges, and
 showing everywhere numerous blood-vessels                   ramifying near the
 surface.     The terminal twigs of the vessels with their swollen ends
 are a prominent feature.           Length,   9 cm. ; bread th, 5 '6 cm.
     Tent solid looking, varies      in thickness from    less than -5 mm. on the
 right side behind the middle to             1 -5 cm. on the left side near the
 place of attachment.           Apertures lobed indistinctly     ;  vascular trunks
 enter   on    the left    side   near the ventral    edge and branch usually
 dichotomously,        the terminal twigs ending        in swollen knobs.          The
 test shows no bladder cells.          It contains the small spherical fusiform
 and stellate cells, and many minute granules.            Cr3'stals or concretions
are also present,       generally in the form of short rods and crosses.
    One specimen, the test only, from Royal Sound, Kerguelen Island,

    It  may be considered        a somewhat     doubtful proceeding to describe
an ascidiau from the test alone, and certainly            in most    eises it would
not be proper.            Still this   specimen    possessed such well-marked
characteristics      that  I  was tempted    to give it a name.       I believe that
the test is distinct        from that of all known species, and that when
other specimens are found they will be easily recognised.                   It differs
from Ascidia arachnoidea in the general               shape and the position of
the apertures.

   Three specimens     :  one in good condition from Station 311 (West
end of Strait of Magellan),          245 fathoms     ;  and two, one of them
damaged,     from Station 320 (off the coast of Buenos Ayres), 600
fathoms.      The two latter are slightly smaller than the dimensions
given above.
   This   species   somewhat      resembles   Aseidia      virginea, but is       un
doubtedly distinct from it.         That species differs from the present one
chiefly in its greater length, its (slightly) greater number of tentacles,
the absence      of intermediate papillae,      and    in  the   condition of the
dorsal lamina — all good characters.

narrow,    posterior broad and rounded.            Attached       by   a  small area
near the posterior    end of the left side.       Branchial aperture terminal,
placed   on    a  long    somewhat      conical projection        turned    dorsally.
Sides of this projection channelled by eight grooves                 leading down
from between       the lobes of the aperture.          A strong     elevated   ridge
extending from the base of the projection along the anterior part of
the   dorsal    edge.    Atrial   aperture  sessile,    placed    at the posterior
extremity of this ridge, being more than half-way from the anterior

       Reproductive organs forming a large rounded mass on the right
    side  of the intestinal loop at the ventral end.                    The ovary occupies
    the centre,    and the spermatic        vesicles      are arranged       round the peri
    phery.     The oviduct and vas deferens                 emerge from the dorsal and
     posterior end of the mass, and             course along the superior (anterior)
     margin of the intestine to their termination.

It   has affinities   with Ascidia and Corella.               The latter it resembles
in   the  position of the viscera            and in the shape         and relative size
of the      intestine   ;  the     branchial     sac   on   the    other hand     differs
greatly from that of Corella, and exhibits                      the  simpler structure
found in      Aseidia - ; while      the membranes      hanging from the transverse
vessels aud the languets           replacing the dorsal lamina are exactly lite

           6. On some Applications of Rotatory Polarization.
                                          By Professor Tait.
  Since last meeting                  of the Society            I
                                                           found that Broch (in
                                                                     have
Dove's         Repertorium)          employed the combination of prism, Nicols,
and quartz plate, for the purpose of measuring                               the rotatory power of
quartz       for different          wave-lengths.           I   do not find, however, that he
suggests its use for the determination of wave-lengths according to
one      definite standard.               Nor   does he seem to have used great thick
nesses     of quarts, which               is essential      to accuracy       in    the application           I
have      proposed.           In    the Annates de Ghimie, 1846, there is a transla
tion of a part of Broch's paper, with                           the    remark that the process,
which he called a new one, was due to Fizcau and Foucault.                                             Their
paper,       however, refers to quartz cut parallel to the axis                                ;   but it in
troduces the question, very                     important so far             as    my object is con
cerned,        of    the interference         of two polarized rays after one has been
retarded more               than the other by very many                       wave-lengths.            It    is
quite      possible that this consideration, which                            I    had for the          time
forgotten,           may be found             fatal    to       my    method        when very great
thicknesses           of quartz        are employed             on the      bright lines given by
glowing gases, for the purpose of estimating the velocity of the                                       indi
vidual particles.              It will       not all'eet the method                 as applied to the
spectra        of auroras, comets, &e.
     Prof.      Niven (Phil. Mag.               1878)       speaks         of rotation of plane              of
polarization as the most delicate                     test of change of wave-length.                    It   is
so    in theory, but in practice it cannot be compared to a train of prisms.
     I   have       within    the last       fortnight       operated        with pieces of quartz
 from      4    to    8    inches     in length,         and        have    found that the sharp
 ness     of extinction            of the red line of lithium                 is greater           than that
 of the green             line of thallium.           The breadth of the latter must of
 course come more             into play.        The range of uncertainty for the orange
 sodium        line is very much              greater       still      This       was to be expected
 from its       being double.              With thick           plates      of quartz it cannot be
 extinguished at all.                In   fact, in order to extinguish               it,   a   plate would
 be                                                                         of rotation for the two
      required which would make the difference
 constituents one or more semi-circumferences.                                The least thickness
 of   quartz for such         a     purpose     would       be somewhere           about 13 feet, and
 about 500           successive       oscillations       of the luminous particles                    would

474                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
have to be strictly periodic.         The experiment would be well worth
trying, but it would involve great difficulties         as well as considerable
expense    ;  and it might fail altogether      on another    account, viz., the
breadth of the     individual sodium lines.
    I find it advantageous      to replace the second Nicol by a double-
image prism, and to take the reading when the two images                   of the
slit are equally bright.

                           Reignier Conder, R.E.
   The subject on which       I   have  the honour      of addressing you thi*
evening is one far more       complicated and difficult than that of the
paper     which  I  read to the Royal      Society of Edinburgh some short
time since.      We have to deal, not with the surface of         a country and
the position of places of which the          ancient names are still extant,
but with     a ruined city, buried to a depth of from 30 to 50 feet in
rubbish on which modern buildings            having been erected, and with

a    topography            in which     there    is scarcely         a   single important                  point
which has           not     been controverted by one or more well-known writers.
     The topography of Jerusalem has, moreover, formed the subject of
works        of every century from              the age of Josephus to the present time,
and can           only     be rightly      understood after the study of about one
hundred           standard accounts of the city in all                   ages.     ltuins, when dis
covered,          must      not rashly be assumed to l»elong to                    a   period of great
antiquity, since we know that even after the time of Herod the Great,
magnificent               buildings were erected by Hadrian, by Constantine, by
Justinian,           by     the    early Khalifs, and by the                 Latin kings,             as    well
as    by the Moslem rulers of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
centuries.
     Many relics which were at first thought to belong to the pre-Christian
history          of Jerusalem, have been shown, after careful examination by
experienced            architects, to be remains of the work of the later builders
above        cited.        The subject of this paper must be confined,                            therefore,
to an        account of recent discoveries, and to an attempt at showing the
bearing           of such discoveries           on the       points of most general interest.
The         restoration         of the ancient topography has,                   I take     it,   but small
    interest      in itself except for      a   limited circle; but the questions which
    have     given        importance to the study are,               I    believe, very generally
    understood       ;    and the controversies          on Jerusalem topography appear
    to   gather     round two principal centres of interest                      — namely,        the posi
    tion    of   the site of Calvary and the             Holy Sepulchre,            and the position
    and the       monuments of the Temple enclosure.                              It   is   proposed          to
    show     in   what degree recent explorations have thrown light on these
    two     central questions.
      A     new era        in   the history     of Jerusalem research                  dates from the
    execution        of    the    Ordnance Survey in 1864.                   This survey, under
    taken  partly at the expense of the Baroness Burdett Coutts (for the
    purpose of reporting on the water supply of the city), was executed
     by    Captain (now   Lieutenant-Colonel) C. W. Wilson, B.E., with                                         a
    staff    of   non-commissioned officers from the Royal Engineers and
    was     published           by the Ordnance Survey Office at                       Southampton.
    The     survey includes         a   map to the scale t^Yo- of the °ity itself, with
    a    smaller map        of the envirous      itfoTixt,    anu"   with   a    plan of the Temple
    enclosure               as well as     a    number of special                plans, of the             Holy
     Sepulchre        Church        and other important                  buildings.         The           actual

 478                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
 south.     The north face of the scarped block rises above an artificial
 trench,   50 feet deep and 140 feet wide, separating         the Haram enclo
 sure from the    hill to the north.
     The existence of a great viaduct at the south-west        angle (identified
 with   a bridge mentioned by Josephus) has already been mentioned.
 At   the south-east angle, Colonel Warren made two further discoveries,
 both of which are of the highest value.
     The great rampart wall here rises 160 feet from the rock founda
 tion, of which height, however,         only the upper half is at present
 visible above the surface.      The ancient masonry is here           found      ex
 tending from the foundation almost             to the top of the      Wall, and
 Colonel Warren found on the six lowest courses Phoenician letters,
 painted with a red pigment,      which appear to have been intended to
 denote by a letter or numeral the course for which each stone                  was
 designed,   beginning with the foundation course.
    The second, and yet more important, discovery made by Colonel
 Warren     at this   point was that of a great rampart wall extending
 southwards from the Temple wall at the south-east                corner.      The
 two    walls abut together   with   a  straight joint, which extends from
 top to bottom without any bonding stones, indicating that they were
 probably built at different periods.        The newly discovered wall was
 traced southwards for nearly 800          feet, and although     it is nowhere
 visible above the surface,      was found       to be standing beneath        the
 rubbish to     a total height of about 70 feet.           A   great  projecting
 tower was explored along the course of this wall, 400 feet south
 west of the Haram corner,      and there can be no reasonable ground
for doubting      that Colonel Warren        was    right in identifying      this
magnificent    fortification with the city wall which Josephus mentions
as   protecting Ophel, while      the great projecting tower answers             in
 position to the   " tower that lieth out " mentioned in           the Book      of
 Nehemiah also in connection with the Ophel wall.
    The masonry of which the Sanctuary walls are composed may be
divided into three principal varieties, belonging to distinct epochs of
the history of the structure.         First   come the magnificent drafted
stones, of gigantic proportions, forming the foundation of the               wall
and extending upwards generally higher than the present                  surface.
It  is undisputed that this masonry         belongs    to the period     prior  to
the great destruction of Jerusalem         by Titus.      In the second place,

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                             479
there is     a distinct style above the drafted masonry, consisting of
stones    of large and remarkably          square proportions without any draft.
These stones are recognised by architects                as belonging to the early
Byzantine         period.     In   the   third   place,   there    is a   patchwork     of
smaller masonry, forming the upper part of the ramparts,                        and com
posed     of Crusading, Saracenic, and Arab restorations, dating from
the twelfth century to the present time.
     It is with the two first classes of the masonry that we are at
present concerned, and more especially with the drafted style.
     The    average      height of a course of the drafted stones is about
3 feet 6 inches.            The blocks vary considerably in length, the longest
as    yet known being 38 feet           9  inches and the second longest 23 feet
 8   inches.       The draft or sunk channel surrounding the four edges of
 the face of each stone is about              3  inches wide.        The faces     within
 this channel are generally dressed smooth, and project about half an
 inch    in the best    preserved    specimens;     but in the lower courses, where
  the stones were never exposed to view, the boss or raised face                   within
  the marginal       draft is left undressed, and projects in some               cases  as
  much as 18 inches.            The rampart walls are built with             a  batter or
   sloping face, and the draft allowed of great precision in the alignment
  of the stones even when the boss was left rough, the batter being
   obtained by setting back each course about                 2   inches from the face
   of the course on which it stood, the measurement                  being   taken from
   the face   of   the marginal draft.
       Beyond      the   fact that this magnificent masonry             belongs to the
   ancient    Jewish Temple,           no definite conclusion         has   as yet been
    generally accepted        respecting its date.         Colonel    Warren     has dis
    tinguished different classes of the masonry according to the finish
    of the stones, and refers these to different periods of construction.
    He attributes the stones at the foot of the east wall, close to the south
    east angle,    to the time of Solomon, while the unfinished masonry                 on
    the south-west he         refers  to   Herod     the   Great.     The    well-known
    French explorer and architect, the Due du Vogue, is of opinion, on
    the other hand, that the          whole of the drafted masonry             at present
    existing    is   attributable    to   the   time    of  Herod      the   Great,    and
    although Colonel Warren's conclusions are generally well worthy of
    attention and singularly shrewd, there appear to me in this case to
    be  many indications favouring the opposite view.

480                          Proceeding a            of the Royal Society
  It is        indisputable that the presence of Phoenician masons' marks                                 at
the foot of the great wall is proof of the antiquity of the                                   structure ;
but there are good reasons for doubting whether Solomon's Temple
enclosure         can have extended                  so far south, while           it is   certain      that
similar characters would have been employed by native masons                                              in
the time of Herod the Great.
  The masonry of the east wall of the Sanctuary towards the north is,
moreover,          of    a   somewhat different character and material from that
of the south-east angle, and is attributed by Colonel Warren to                                    a   later
epoch      ;   yet, on this masonry also, red paint letters similar to those                            pre
viously mentioned were found on the foundation stones of the                                           wall.
  There          is,   moreover,     an indication of great value as to the date                   of the
masonry yet to be noticed.                          The dressing of the stones          is   distinctive,
and has not            as yet been       found elsewhere in Syria.                  An eight-toothed
chisel was driven along the draft, and again used at right angles                                         to
its former direction, thus producing                        a   regular criss-cross pattern on the
surface of the stone.                    This       dressing     is   found on each of the three
ancient walls of the Haram, and on masonry of various degrees of
finish, seeming to indicate                     a   common       period of execution for all the
varieties        of masonry,         for    it      would be    a     bold assumption to suppose
that the masons of Solomon used                         a   chisel of exactly the same dimen
sions and number of teeth employed by Herod's masons, considering
that   a   lapse of time equal to that which separates the reigns of                              Alfred
and Victoria occurred                 between the two building epochs                      in   question.
The criss-cross dressing                   is   found on the voussoirs of the Tyropceon
Bridge, which,               as before     explained, has been found leading westwards
from the Sanctuary wall, and which                               is    plainly attributable        to the
Herodian period, to which                       it    would therefore seem all the masonry
similarly dressed              is   most naturally assigned.
   The second type of masonry                           above the drafted stones                has been
attributed to Justinian by the same architectural authority                                          above
quoted, the Due du Vogue.                             Justinian        is   known to have erected
splendid buildings                  on this site, and             is   the only      builder     between
Herod and Omar who                         is   historically      recorded     to have       constructed
anything           on        this   side    of Jerusalem.               The    architectural      details
accompanying the large smooth                           masonry        in question     are, moreover,
identical         in character           with the style which                 is   found throughout
Syria in buildings of the fifth and sixth centuries,                                A.D.

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.                        481
     Next in    importance     to the exploration of the Sanctuary ramparts
must     be  ranked that of the         subterranean      passages and chambers
within the        enclosure,     which    were   most    carefully examined by
Colonels     Wilson     and   Warren, and the most important of which                  I
have also frequently         visited.
    Two great      passages lead from the         two ancient gateways          in the
southern walls       ; two others lead from similar entrances on the west.
The first two portals are each double,               with    an internal vestibule
supported on pillars.          The western gates are single, and the passages
are    half the width of the former two.             The gateways       in each    case
are ancient,     with   massive lintels above, having marginal drafts round
the edges.       The masonry of the passages, however,              is in every    case
of more modern character,             apparently belonging to the period              of
restoration under Justinian.
     In   addition to these vaults,       there  are no less than         thirty  large
cisterns within the area, the aggregate capacity of which is calculated
at about ten      million  gallons.    Most of these great tanks are rock-cut,
 and some, which are closed at the ends with masonry                   and cemented
 inside, seem       originally    to have    been    passages like       those   above
 mentioned, but have been subsequently utilised                as cisterns.
     The measurements        taken in the mouths and roofs of these cisterns
 have served to define generally the original rock surface of the ridge
 enclosed     within    the   ramparts    of the    Sanctuary-   — a narrow spur
 running north and south with steep western slopes and more gradual
 eastern declivities.       The rock at the north-west angle of the enclosure,
  standing    40 feet above the inner court, dominates                 the whole en
  closure ; but the ridge       rises gradually    to a point near the centre of
  the   Sanctuary, where      a  rough rock surface is exposed beneath              the
  beautiful " Dome of
                                        "
                            the Bock,      at a level about 20 feet higher than
  that of the average surface          of the enclosure.        The broadest        and
  flattest part of the ridge is found        in  the immediate neighbourhood
  of this rock, which forms the top of the             hill included in      the area.
  The level of the crest falls gradually southwards towards                the tongue
  of  land called Ophel, south of the Sanctuary            ;  and the lowest point
  of  rock within the area is at the south-east angle, where the founda.
  tion of the wall is 160 feet below the top of the Sakhrah, or sacred
  rock visible in the Dome of the Rock.
     Such, briefly described, are the leading facts recovered with regard

 4S2                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
 to the Sanctuary at Jerusalem, so far as they have              reference     to the
 Jewish Temple.         Briefly ennumerated      they are   as   follows : — Fint,
The existence of ramparts of gigantic masonry plainly attributable                   to
 the  Jewish period and probably            to the   age  of Herod       the Great.
 Secondly,  The recovery of a rock citadel with an outer fosse at                  the
 north-west angle    ;  of an ancient viaduct of the Herodian period                 at
 the south west-angle       ; and of the great Ophel wall abutting on              the
 Sanctuary at the south east-angle.           Thirdly, The      existence of two
 southern gateways of the Jewish period and of two western portals,
 in addition to the entrance over the bridge and other             passages    in the
 interior of the  area.      Fourthly, The determination of the rock-levels
 throughout the    area,   and the fact that the Sacred Rock occupies the
 culminating point of the broadest part of the Temple ridge.
    These facts have all more or less important          bearings     on the great
question of the restoration of the Temple enclosure,              which is    one    of
the most    important subjects        of controversy in the topography               of
Jerusalem.      Authorities are at present divided into two parties, the
largest of which recognises in the present           Sanctuary enclosure,         as a
 whole,  the area of the      Jewish Temple     as restored    by Herod     ;   while
the smaller party, following the teaching of            Mr James        Fergusson,
supposes that Herod's Temple occupied             only a square       of 600 feet
side in the south-west portion of the area.
    The reason for this last assumption is the statement                  given     by
Josephus,    that Herod's Temple enclosure            measured       a furlong on
either side — approximately         600 feet  ;  and until it had been          ascer
tained that the eastern wall, and the northern and eastern parts of
the west and south walls of the Sanctuary (wherever examined) were
of antiquity equal to that of the ramparts            towards the south-west
part of the area, such a theory had many points            in its favour.         The
recovery   of the great Ophel wall has, however,             proved to be the
most    important of the many valuable discoveries             made by Colonel
Warren, because Josephus           has clearly stated    that the Ophel wall
joined tho east wall of Herod's Temple, just              as   the   rampart now
found joins the east wall of the present Haram.              The existence of         a
rock citadel and fosse on the north-west answers also exactly to                   the
account which      Josephus gives        of the citadel of Antonia,           which
dominated tho Temple            courts ;  and   three  angles     of the ancient
enclosure    are  thus     identified    with corresponding        angles   of     the

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                            483
modern area, through the recovery                    of remains of a citadel, a bridge,
and a    city wall,     described       by Josephus.
     The recovery of the north-east angle                   is,   however, not        as   yet com
plete,   although Colonel Warren               has been able to throw light on this
question also.         The north wall of the present enclosure                        is   generally
acknowledged to be later than the other three, and consists                                    of very
inferior masonry.             The east wall has, moreover, been proved to run
northwards without any break beneath                        the surface,          beyond the pre
sent north-east        angle    of the enclosure        ;    but, as already mentioned,
this part of the east wall             is   of inferior material and               finish though
marked       as ancient by the existence of the ancient red paint letters.
It   seems probable that this wall formed part of the                             rampart erected
by Agrippa about 44 a.d. on the north side of Jerusalem, which
wall joined the east rampart of the Temple enclosure. There are
indications, which            cannot now be given at length, tending to show
that the     old north-east         angle of Herod's enclosure was situated about
where      the Golden Gate            (an edifice of the Byzantine                  period)       now
stands, and that an area of about                2i   acres in the north-east                  portion
of    the present enclosure            was included          within the boundaries                at   a
period later than that of Herod's Temple.
     The above remarks              apply exclusively to the Second                     Temple         as
restored     by Herod       the Great.        Although       it    is   certain that the         Holy
House      itself and      the altar occupied         the same spot               in the time of
Herod on       which they       were first reared       by Solomon, the extent and
 position    of the surrounding         courts as they existed              in Solomon's         time
are as    yet entirely unknown, no certain remains of that period having
 Wen      recovered,       and no definite accounts                  of their measurements
 being    extant.      We know that            great alterations were effected                     by
 Herod   ;   that ho increased          the area (Josephus               says in one passage
 that he     doubled    it)   and    that he took away ancient foundations and
 laid others.       Considering the lapse of twenty -nine centuries,                           and the
 alterations     deliberately effected          at    the     late      period,    it   seems im
 probable that we should succeed in restoring the Temple of Solomon,
 though there        seems no reason           why the main features                    of that of
 Herod       should not be recovered             with certainty, in               the process          of
 explorations,      which are still both necessary and possible.
     A   second objection to the proposed                   restriction of the Herodian
 Temple      within    a   square of 600        feet side         in the south-west            portion
     vol. x.                                                                          3    N

 484                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 of the existing area, arises when the levels of the rock surface are
 carefully studied.
    The Temple enclosure consisted of three principal courts, rising in
 successive     steps  towards the great fane which stood, as Josephus
 states, on the top of the      hill.    In order    to fit such  a  building to      the
 ground, within the present           area,  it is   necessary   to start   with the
 assumption that the culminating point is to be found in the Holy
 Rock — the present top of the Sanctuary             Hill.    If we place    the Holy
 House over this rock, the levels of the various courts agree exactly
 with the ascertained levels of the rock as at present remaining                 ;   but
 if  we were to place       the   Holy House further          south-west    it would
 have stood,      not on the top, but half way down the steep western
 slope of the mountain.         The lowest court would be found to occupy
 the highest part of the         hill ;  and foundations       varying from 50 to
 90 feet in depth would become necessary on the supposition that the
 great edifice was     built  up from the rock.
    The restoration of Herod's Temple on the supposition that the
 central    fane   stood  above     the   sacred   rock, called     es  Sakhrah,       in
 the middle of the present           Dome of the Rock, has occupied my                at
 tention for more than seven years past            ;  and the indications which
 confirm this restoration are perhaps sufficiently interesting to claim
 a detailed enumeration.
    In  tin' first place, The rock in     question has been regarded        by Jews,
 Christians, and Moslems, for at least fifteen centuries               as the site    of
tin!  Holy of Holies.       Wo    learn from the Talmud that a stone or rock
 called
         " Foundation     "
                             formed the floor of the most holy place,              and
that it   was regarded as the foundation             of  the whole earth.       From
early Christian writers wo gather that this sacred rock was venerated
by the Jews in the fourth century, and the description then given
tallies with the present       Sakhrah.        The traditions of the Crusaders
and the Arabs reproduce those of the Jews in regarding the present
Sakhrah as the foundation stone of the world, and thus serve                          to
connect the present sacred rock          with that    on which the Temple stood.
    Secondly,    The Temple faced eastwards,           and its door, according        to
the Talmud, was directly          opposite    the summit of Olivet.            A   line
drawn due east through the Sakhrah rock will be found,                  if produced,
to strike the top of Olivet, which            would not be the case were            the
Holy House        placed further south.

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                                485
     Thirdly, The levels of                    the various courts              can easily be deduced
fruin the       Talmudie             account       of   the Temple;          and   as   the floor      of the
Temple        is fixed         at the       level of the Holy Rock, the levels of the
surrounding               areas       may    be compared                with   those     of the present
enclosure.               In   every case       the result is satisfactory                  The Court of
the    Priests           ought, on the present                theory, to have been 2432 feet
above       the Mediterranean, and                      an observation of the rock at exactly
that    level has          been obtained           within its      area, the level being only a foot
beneath the present flat surface of the court round the dome of the
rock.         The Court of            the Women should have a level 2429, and                                it is
almost       certain that            the rock is nowhere above (nor very much below)
that    level within its             precincts.           The Court of the Gentiles should be
2411        above the         sea,    which is the average level of the present surface
outside       the platform or court round                     the Dome of the Rock.                   Several
other exact results might be given, but the preceding                                      will      be suffi
cient to show how well the ancient Temple may                                           be fitted      to the
ground surrounding the Holy Rock.
   Fourthly, There were no                         cisterns    within        the limits     of the inner
 courts of the Temple ; and                        none    of the great cisterns which exist
 in so many other parts of the Sanctuary enclosure                                      come   within        the
 limits of the courts according to the                         present restoration.
      Fifthly, A          subterranean         gallery leading to              a subterranean           bath
 house ran northwards from the great gate Moked                                     on the north-west
 side       of the Priests' Court              ;    and such        a    gallery with an adjoining
 vaulted chamber is found in exactly the required position according
 to the      present restoration.*
       It should         be noted that the arrangement                       of the courts which has
 been       followed is that given in the Talmud, which agrees fully with
 the        more        general      account of Josephus                 ;   and that the            cubit     is
 assumed           to have been about               16 inches in length, — a determination
 which, as          I    had occasion to notice in a former paper, is based from
 a     comparison of                 Talmudic           accounts     with existing          monuments,
 especially the Galilean synagogues                           and    the masonry         of the rampart
 walls       of the Sanctuary above described.
       If    the above views should be found tenable, discoveries                                      of the
      * The identification
                        of these vaults with the passages mentioned in the
 Talmud, is due to Colonel Warren, whose plan of the Temple        however,                    is,
 somewhat different from that proposed in this paper.

486                    Proceedings     of the Royal Society
highest interest may perhaps            still await us.    It is known that the
pavement      of  the   platform round the Dome of the Rock is partly
supported on vaults as yet unexplored, and that there are rocky
scarps   still   to be examined        in other parts of     the    same   area.     It
seems quite possible        that the rocky foundations of Herod's Temple
may   still lie hidden      beneath the modern pavement         ;  and the progress
of exploration during the last twenty years has been so steady and
rapid, that it is perhaps not unreasonable to hope that the secrets of
this hidden portion of the sacred area may yet be unfolded, and
the position of the       Holy House and the Court of the Priests fixed by
the   actual    recovery of the foundations at present covered by a
modern pavement.
   While residing        at Jerusalem     I entered  every chamber and cistern
which could be reached in the immediate vicinity of the                        Holy
Rock.       I  was    fortunate in the discovery of           a   rock scarp pre
viously unnoticed, but there is no doubt that substructures remain
still to be explored especially towards the east of the present plat
form.
   Such seems to be the general result of the successive explorations
of the High Sanctuary at Jerusalem, so far as Jewish antiquities
arc concerned.        It  is now proposed to consider the results of explora
tion in the city itself, in special           connection with the question of
the true sites of Calvary and the            Holy Sepulchre.
   The first requisite for         a  satisfactory restoration of the ancient
topography of the city is a clear             understanding of the natural       site
ou which      it was built.       The hills and valleys have been rendered
almost indistinguishable         through the accumulation of rubbish          ; a;id
modern explorers have             therefore    agreed   that the first and     most
important object to bo kept in view is the determination of                      the
level of the rock-surface in all parts of the city.
   The Ordnance Survey of Colonel Wilson not only gave the                    means
of easily determining such levels by reference to fixed bench                 marks
above the surface,        but also laid the foundation of the inquiry             by
marking the rock wherever it occurred on the surface.                  The  number
of observations added by Colonel Warren and by others, including
my own measurements,            has given a total of 265 observations within
an area    of about      250 acres occupied       by the ancient city     ; and we
are thus able       to run contours        and draw sections which         approxi

niak-ly determine             the original surface         within very narrow limits of
error, and        which render         the relative positions and elevations of the
principal     features as certain            and    definite      as    is necessary     for anti
quarian     purposes.
  The most important discovery resulting from these researches is
that   of the      great valley which         occurs      in the very heart of the city,
having its head not far from the Jaffa Gate.                             The rock appears in
the    Church of        the    Holy Sepulchre in two               places at a level 10 feet
above       the    floor,    but just south of the church there are vaults                        18
feet deep.
   The rock is also known in many places along the top of the                                    hill
called Zion by               the    modern    Christians,         but     between      these    two
eminences  it is            never visible     on the       surface,       which is somewhat
depressed.
      Dr Robinson             pointed out that there              was     apparently     a    valley
 separating       the southern         hill from that       on which the Church of the
 Holy Sepulchre              stands.      Yet this       was     so little   capable     of proof
 before the levels of the Ordnance Survey had been taken, that Canon
 Williams did not             hestitate   to affirm that no such valley existed.
       In 1872     the excavations         on the site of the Hospital of                St John
 resulted      in the discovery of magnificent vaults, 50 feet deep and
 200     feet long, which formed              vast reservoirs           for the supply of the
 Hospital.         These were cleared out to the bottom, and the rock was
  found at a level 60 feet below the top of the                           Holy Sepulchre hill
  and traced       all along the vaults.
       In   1876 another vault was found further east, measuring                             120 feet
  north and south.                 The rock floor was found to fall rapidly south
  wards, and the slope                 of the north bank of the great valley was
  thus defined over a considerable                 section.        In    1870 Colonel Warren
  had made         observations which define the position of the south bank,
  and    the number of observations                in and near the valley now number
  about     thirty in all.          The general      result      is,   that its course   is    traced
  eastwards        to the Haram, where              it   joins   a     narrower valley running
  north and south from the Damascus                            Gate.     The newly recovered
  valley    is    60 feet deep and 600 feet wide north and south.
       The existence or non-existence               of this important natural feature
  used      to form one of the favourite subjects of Jerusalem research.
  Those       who, following            Dr Robinson, continued                to   believe     in its

 488                   Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 existenc<:   were stigmatised       as TyropvoniMs,      from the theory that
 this was the course taken hy the valley which Josephus                   calls the
 Tyropwon.       But not     even the party which       now proves to be right
 was prepared      for the great width and depth of the valley.
    Having     thus recovered       the most important of the lost physical
 features of the site, we are better able than of old to understand the
 description given by Josephus, which is almost too well known to
need    repetition.     Josephus      speaks   of three   hills and two valleys
within Jerusalem.          First,   of the groat square hill, on which the
upper city stood in his time          ;  which he identifies with the citadel
of David's time,        called   in the Bible      the "stronghold of       Zion."
 The lower city occupied          the slope of Akra — a hill less elevated
than the former, having         a   gibbous or bulging shape, and divided
by the Tyropceon valley from the first mentioned hill of the upper
city.     Another valley separated         Akra from    a third   and lower   hill,
which was called         Bezetha,    and which was situated north of the
Temple hill, with an artificial trench cutting it off from the Antonia
citadel.
    All  these features are recovered.         The elevations all prove     to be
relatively those described by Josephus, the shapes of the hills, the
dividing valleys, even the artificial rock-cut trench, are found cor
rectly to describe existing featurea
    The large square hill, which Josephus incidentally identifies with
Sion, is that now called by the same name.               The flat plateau on the
summit is 2530 feet above the Mediterranean.                 North of the    great
dividing valley      a spur,  40 feet lower than Sion, is found bulging out
eastwards.      It  is divided from the hill north of the Temple by               a
second     valley which joins the first         ; and  the   positions of Akra,
Bezetha,    the Upper City, and the Tyropreon, are in the opinion of
Colonel Warren, and         I  may be perhaps permitted to add        in my   own
opinion also, now defined          in the relative positions indicated      some
forty years since by Dr Robinson.
   The course of the ancient walls which surrounded Jerusalem                    is
carefully described by Josephus.              On the south-east and west       the
city was defended by deep valleys, but on the north there were three
consecutive lines of defence            at the time of the great siege.       The
remains of these ancient fortifications seem, however, for the               most
part to have disappeared,         and the only traces which we may con

fidentlv expect to recover                are the rocky scarps          which formed the
base   of the walls in various             parts.
  The modern             walls of Jerusalem are partly composed of ancient
drafted masonry, which              is,   however,    not in situ, and there seems good
reason to suppose that the materials of which the present fortifications
are    composed were taken from the ancient walls.                                The ramparts
have been destroyed             and rebuilt seven times since the siege of Titus,
and the disappearance of all traces of the ancient third wall                            is    most
easily explained, on the supposition that its stones have been removed,
since there        is   no great accumulation of rubbish to hide any remains
which might exist north of the city.
      Even within           half century many relics of
                         the last                                             the ancient city
have      been lost for ever.  Dr IJobinson speaks of                            the remains     of
towers north-west of the city, which have now entirely disappeared
beneath modern buildings.                    There can be little doubt that these
represented the course of the third wall, arid the careful measurements
and angular         observations of Dr Robinson                    are thus of the highest
value.        In   1864 other remains were noted, during the execution of
the Ordnance Survey, of ancient masonry, which hassince been broken
 up by the peasantry.               The accumulation of rubbish in Jerusalem
 has    in fact been of the greatest                service to antiquarians, and where
 no rubbish exists the ancient buildings have been entirely destroyed.
      The first wall of Jerusalem                   defended       the upper city.        At     the
 north-west        angle was    a   fortress   with     three famous towers, Hippicus,
 Pbasaelus,        and Mariamne, which stood on solid bases and protected
 Herod's palace.
      There can be little doubt that the present                       citadel south of the
 Jaffa Gate marks the site of this fortress.                          The great tower now
 called    David's Tower has been proved to stand on                         a   solid base.     Its
 dimensions are almost exactly those given by Josephus for Phasaelus,
 and    it   resembles     that tower also in having an outer platform with                          a
 battlemented           wall.   The north-west tower of the citadel may mark
 the site     of Hippicus, but            the present    structure      is   rather larger than
 the    tower which Josephus describes                  as   the corner tower of the first
 wall on the north-west.
       The modern citadel           is    surrounded by        a   fosse, and east of this           is
 the    market place standing on arches, the rock being 30 feet below
 the surface       of the street.

490                  Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
   The vaults are entered         by a door from the fosse, but this is now
built    up.    The examination of these vaults would                 be   an under
taking of the greatest         interest   as   tending to throw light          on the
course of the first wall.
    From the corner tower Hippicus the wall ran east to the Temple.
The rock levels now obtained show the existence of                    a  precipice or
scarp    running eastwards        from the vicinity of the citadel          ;  and on
this line, also, the foundations          of two ancient towers           have    been
discovered,     which seem to have formed part of the north face of
the wall.
   The south-west angle of the ancient city is now recovered in                        a
satisfactory manner.         A   rocky scarp, which         had long been observ
able,   was thoroughly       explored in       1874    by an English        engineer,
Mr.   Henry      Maudslay.      During my        stay   in   Jerusalem     I  made a
careful survey of the remains            discovered.       The rock was found to
have    been worked to a vertical face to a height of 50 feet for a
distance    of 150 yards.       At either    end  of this   scarp was a projecting
rock buttress, the base of a tower 40 feet square.                 A flight of   rock-
cut steps led up to         each    tower from the         fort of the scarp, and
numerous      cisterns   were   excavated     in the rock on the top of the
tower    bases.
   It  is interesting to note that this arrangement             agrees exactly with
the description which Josephus             gives   of the towers along the wall
of the ancient city.
   The rock scarp        is found     to  continue beyond the towers             both
northwards and eastwards.             The towers stand in the precincts             of
the Protestant cemetery and bishop's school, and                 Mr Maudslay       was
unable to obtain leave to continue his researches beyond the limits
of this property.        There can be little doubt that one of the               most
useful and interesting researches remaining to be undertaken,                     con
sists in the following      out    of this discovery, and the further tracing
of the ancient wall foundation.
   The manner        in which     the first wall    joins   the Temple enclosure
at the south-east      angle has already      been described.        It is not,  how
ever, as yet known         exactly where      the   wall crossed the Tyropceon
valley.      The account given in the Book of Nehemiah and that                     of
Josephus are both too indefinite to be clearly understood without
the aid of explorations along the line.              A careful tracing     eastwards

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              491
 of the scarp already recovered              might, however,       probably result in
the settlement       of this   question.
     The second wall          is   very briefly      described      by Josephus.      It
started from a certain gate in the first wall called Gennath, which,
appears     to have been at no great distance from the tower Hippicus
and    it ran thence in a         curve to Antonia, enclosing the lower city.
The gate Gennath has not yet been found, and this also is one of
 the great future objects of research.               No certain relics of this wall
indeed      have been      as    yet recovered,       for   the   remains   of drafted
masonry which Canon Williams found east of the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre          have been       very    carefully examined,     and prove to
have belonged to a building which                the Due du Vogue has shown to
have been part of the ancient Basilica of Constantino,                    built in  335
 A.D.   over the supposed         site of the     Holy    Sepulchre.    The northern
 scarp   of the rock-cut      fosse which separated          the tower Antonia from
 the northern       hill of   Bezetha     has been traced        westwards    for some
 distance.      It  seems very probably to have formed the counterscarp
 of a ditch      outside   the     second    wall.    Colonel Warren       also found
 remains     of a rocky scarp facing northwards within (or south of)
 the line of the above mentioned counterscarp, but this investigation
 is as yet incomplete, and a shaft is much needed within the precincts
 of an open plot of ground immediately west of the scarped rock of
 Antonia.
     The materials of which            the third    wall was composed         seem, as
  already remarked, to have been removed                by the builders of the later
  walla of the city.      The general         line of this wall, which was built
  about 44 A.D.      by Herod Agrippa, has been laid down by Colonel
  Warren in a maimer which appears to mo to be satisfactory.
     Starting from Hippicus this wall ran out northwards to                   a certain
 large octagonal tower called Psephinus, which stood on ground so high
  as to command a view of the mountains of Arabia.                    The remains of
  towers   were    discovered       by   Dr Robinson along this part of             the
 course   of  the wall, but are now hidden or destroyed.               From the high
 ground at the point now occupied                  by the Russian Cathedral, the
  mountains of Arabia           east of Petra       were distinctly     visible   when
  covered   with   snow in the winter of 1873-4.
      From the tower Psephinus the wall ran east and then south-east
  and passed over certain caverns            called the "Caverns of the Kings."
        vol.  x.                                                           3 o

492                 Proceedings of      the  Royal Society
Most modern writers identified these             caves   with the  great quarries
which extend       under Jerusalem immediately east of the Damascus
 Gate.    These quarries were those whence the Temple masonry was
hewn, and a curious rude carving of          a figure  resembling the Assyrian
winged bulls has been found in them and is now                in England.
    From this point the line of the third wall seems to have coincided
 with that of the present         north wall of Jerusalem,        standing on a
 rocky scarp with a rock-cut fosse outside.           The modern eastern wall,
as   far south   as  the Sanctuary enclosure, also appears to be on the
same line occupied by the east face of the               third wall, which thus
joined on to the comparatively roughly finished wall which, as above
mentioned, runs northwards beyond the present                north-east angle of
the Sanctuary.
   The main interest of tracing these ramparts lies in the connection
of their course with the question of the genuineness             of the site now
shown    as representing     tho  Holy Sepulchre and       the  Hill  of Calvary.
It  is admitted that    if  the remains of the second wall can be shown to
have included these sites        within  the boundary      of the   then existing
city, the description of the position of Calvary outside Jerusalem — as
plainly set forth in the New Testament         — would not be fulfilled.      The
question,   however,    of the course of the second wall is still unsettled.
   Without wishing        to enter into this old and fierce controversy at
the very end of my paper,         I would point out three indications which
arise out of the recent discoveries.
   First, The hill   on which the present Church          of the Holy Sepulchre
stands   is now identified, apparently beyond dispute, with that of
Akra or    the lower city, which was encompassed             by the second wall.
   Secondly,   The deep valley separating           this hill from that on the
south runs up almost to the Jaffa Gate.               The second wall started
from some unknown            point on the north side of the first wall and
ran in a curve to Antonia.          It seems impossible to suppose that it
can have crossed through        the great valley, and     if it was  built on  the
high ground at the head of that valley, and ran thence in a curve
to Antonia, it must apparently have included the Holy Sepulchre
Church.
    Thirdly, The     site of the     church is beyond dispute within the
compass of the third wall, which was           built  to protect suburbs which
had extended beyond the second wall                It  is true that the second

wall only            existed in the time of Christ              ;    but the third wall was
built       only       ten     years    after the Crucifixion.          It    seems difficult            to
believe that the suburb, in the short period, had extended itself over
120 acres, so as nearly to double the area of Jerusalem.                                        It   seems
more probable                that at the time of the Crucifixion the site now shown
as Calvary was already, if not within                      the walls, at least far         within       the
limits of the existing town.
      To state briefly          the objection, raised first      in the eighth century and
repeated by various writers in almost every succeeding                                   age,    the site
now shown as representing Calvary is so nearly in the middle of
Jerusalem,             that it seems impossible, on any reasonable                        reconstruc
tion of the ancient city, to suppose that at the time of the Cruci
fixion      it    was outside the border of the inhabited town.
      One of        the strong arguments           in favour of the genuineness                      of the
site      has always            been     found in the existence              close   to     the       Holy
 Sepulchre           of an indisputably           ancient Jewish tomb.               I     propose       to
inquire,          therefore, in conclusion           :   — First, What is this tomb, and
 how is its presence inside Jerusalem to be understood                               1      Secondly,
 If     the site of Calvary was not in reality where it is shown, where
 it is likely to have been                1
       As   regards the tomb,            it   is a chamber   cut in rock, with nine kokim
 or graves,         of which           three are placed at a lower level, sunk                       in the
 floor      of the      chamber.          The fact that the graves are kokim, that is
 longitudinal tunnels, running                    in from the sides of the chamber, so
 that the body lay with                   its feet towards the chamber               and        its head
 away from             it,   and that they are not loculi, or graves placed sideways
 on the        walls of the chamber, proves not only that the tomb                         is    Jewish,
 but that         it   belongs    to an early      Jewish period previous            to the time of
     Christ.
       We      are informed by the Talmudic writers that all the tombs were
 outside Jerusalem, except the tombs of the nine kings of                                 Judah,       and
 another tomb of the prophetess                     Huldah.         Josephus tells us that the
 graves        of   these kings were hidden, so that even those standing inside
 the monument could not see them.                            The site of the Tombs of the
     Kings       has long been anxiously sought, for the                     present       traditional
 site is recognised              as    having been invented in the fifteenth century.
 The ancient tomb above described answers all the requirements of
     the tombs of the kings.

     1st,   It is an ancient Jewish                       tomb.
     2d,    It is within Jerusalem.
     3d,     It contains graves for                       nine kings, which was                      the     number
buried, including David and Solomon.
     ith, It is        the only known                Jewish tomb inside the city, ancient or
modern.
     This view, which                    is,
                                          I     believe,     original, has already been                    cordially
accepted           by many students                  of the question.                    It   thus furnishes an
argument            against instead of in favour of the present site of                                    the Holy
Sepulchre.
     As     regards the probable site of Calvary,                           I      have        also in   conclusion
to mention            a    new indication.
     It     is   agreed that Calvary                  and         the    Holy Sepulchre                  were     close
together           and outside the town, and                           it   is    generally supposed              that
Calvary was the place of public execution.
     The tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, where                                              Christ    was laid,       waj
in   a    garden, as are             still     the tombs      of wealthy personages, but                     it    was
not the less likely to be near the great cemetery of the town.                                                  After
careful investigation,                         and the       recovery of inscriptions,                     frescoes.
sarcophagi,            and other remains,                   it    has       been     pretty clearly shown
that the ancient Jewish cemetery of Jerusalem was on the north of
the town.             The southern cemetery                       is    Christian, and there are very
few ancient Jewish tombs                          on the east.                 On the north, among the
gardens          which still extend over                     the        flat   ground,         as described         by
Josephus, there are many ancient tombs, including that of Simon the
Just.         It    is     in this direction apparently that the Holy Sepulchre
should        be sought,            though      it   is   probably now beyond the power of
modern research to identify out of so many sepulchres that of Joseph
of Arimathea.
     Calvary was, we may perhaps assume, the place of Jewish public
execution.             The recovery               of the place of execution                       is     therefore   a
matter           of      the    highest interest.                  In       the     Talmud         the place         is
described           under the name               " House of Stoning,"                         as being     just   out
side the           city.       It    appears       to have been                a   precipice some            12 feet
high, over which the culprit was thrown                                        before         the first stone was
cast at him.                The site of this place                is    still pointed out by the Jews.
It   is   a   precipice         with      a    swelling mound or                  hill   above, and a cavern
in the cliff, which                 is   known to Christians as Jeremiah's Grotto.                                The

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                          495
site  in question is just outside the Damascus Gate, and can be easily
shown to have been outside even the third wall of ancient Jerusalem.
    There seems no doubt that this is the ancient place of execution,
and    I leave   it to your consideration, whether it may not reasonably
be   supposed to be the site of Calvary, " the place of a skull."
    In   conclusion,    I would    call your attention to the immutability       of
the topography         of the Holy City.        The Rock of Foundation         still
stands     in  a Temple, and      within    a sacred    enclosure.    The   citadel
of   Antonia is still     a citadel.     The Upper and Lower Markets are
still markets.        The Royal Towers still form the western fortress
of    the    town.     The    venerated     tomb of the kings of Judah            is
surrounded by a famous             cathedral  ;  but the site    of Calvary — the
place     of execution — is only      graced by a cemetery      with an adjoining
 slaughter-house      ;  and the private sepulchre of the rich man is          still
indistinguishable        among     the   number of rich men's       tombs in the
 gardens beyond the         city walls.
     If there   are any here interested in the subject of further explora
 tion at Jerusalem,       I  would point out that much yet remains to be
 done.      The   second wall has to be found.          The great discoveries    on
 Ophel      and    Sion   require to     be followed     up,   the  secrets of tho
 enclosure     of the High Sanctuary           are not exhausted,      and   mines
 are   much needed in the ground immediately west of Antonia.
     It  is my earnest hope some day to be enabled            to take up the task
  of excavation from which such            great results were obtained by the
  energy and     skill of Colonel Warren,         and  I  trust that should such
  an   opportunity      arise   the   funds   may    not be wanting      ; for tho
  difficulties   arising    from the dangers        of the    work were counted
  as  but small, in comparison with             the  pecuniary obstacles     which
  had    to be met       during    the   whole    of the period during      which
  Colonel     Warren     was   so   bravely   persevering in the recovery of
  monuments which have an undying interest for the whole Christian
  world.
  2.  The Geology of the Faroe Islands.                     By James Geikie,
                             LL.D., F.RSS. L. & E.
     The author visited the Faroe Islands last summer in company
  with Mr Amund Helland of Christiania.                      They made various

496                  Proceedings of      the  Royal Society
traverses across the largest and most important islands, and touched
here and there at several      of the smaller    ones.   They have constructed
a geological    map of the group, upon        which is shown the outcrop of
the coal-seams of Suderoe,        the direction of numerous dykes of basalt ,
the position       of great intrusive     sheets of the same rock       ; and the
trend of the glaciation is indicated hy arrows.                The introductory
part of this paper gives some account of the geological observations
made     by previous writers — Jorgen Landt in 1800,              Mackenzie and
Allan in    1815, Trevelyan a year or two later, Forchhammer              in 1824,
llobert Chambers in 1854, and Johnstrup in 1873.                     The general
physical features of the islands are next described, the extent of land
being roughly estimated at about 600 square miles.                 Nearly all the
islands have an elongated form, and are drawn out in               aN.N.W. and
S.S.E.    direction.     This is likewise    the direction of the more or less
narrow sounds or open fiords that separate the islands in the northern
part of the archipelago, as also of the wider belts of water in the
south.     All the islands   have a mountainous character, and everywhere
exhibit, in the most marked manner, the well-known terraced outline
which is so common a feature of trappean masses, the highest eleva
tion they attain is 2852 feet, but many of the hills approach to
within    200 or 300 feet of that dominating           point.   The mean eleva
tion of the northern group of islands is estimated                to exceed    800
feet, and is probably not less than 900 feet.            The coasts are usually
precipitous, many of the cliffs exceeding              1000   feet, and   in  some
places    even   2000 feet in height.          The valleys are described         as
ascending     from the     sea  in  a series of great steps or terraces     —each
terrace   being cirque-shaped        and framed in by a wall of rock, the
upper surface of which stretches back to form the next cirque-like
terrace, and so on in succession        until  the series abruptly     terminates
 at the base,   it  may be, of some precipitous mountain.            Occasionallv
the col between       two valleys is so level that      it is difficult to   detect
the actual water-parting.          In this  case   the two valleys combine to
form   a  kind of    deep hollow passing right across the island          from  sea
to sea.     Lakes are very numerous,        but of small size, and the streams
are also abundant but of inconsiderable importance.
    The author then goes on to describe the geological structure of the
islands, which is extremely simple.              The rocks consist principally
of bedded basalts with intervening layers of tuff, and in Mygenses

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                   497
and Sudorbe of clay, shale, and coal.                 The prevalent dip of the beds
in the northern        islands       is south-easterly,     hut in Mygenoes            it  is
easterly, and in        Suderoe,        or  the    southern   island, north-easterly.
Nowhere       does the strata       incline towards the west.            The angles of
dip are generally very low — in               the northern islands not averaging
more than      2°  or 3°,  while in Suderoe they are          a degree    or so higher.
    The oldest part of           the     series   is represented      in Suderoe and
 Mygenaes.       The basalt rocks in these islands consist principally of
 bedded anamesites,         composed       of plagioclaso,    augite,    magnetite,     and
 olivine.     Their behaviour          in the    field and the general aspect they
 assume     are described      in considerable detail.         They are all more or
 less amygdaloidal.           Very often       the various sheets       of old lava are
 separated by partings and layers of a red fine-grained                 palagonitic tuff.
 Neaj    the top of the anamesite series occurs an irregular belt or band
 of shales and clay with two seams of coal.                    [The position of this
 belt was shown upon a coloured diagram, representing a section
  across the island of Suderoe.]              A thin and local       seam of coal and
  shale is found much lower down in the series.                 [This   also was shown
  upon the diagram.]            The distance between           this local coal and the
  workable     coal-beds       above     is about 1100      feet.     The author next
  gives   a detailed description of the various outcrops of the coal, and
  traces its extension over         Suderbe.        [The more characteristic appear
  ances presented by the coal were shown in another diagram.]                           The
  two workable coal-seams             vary in thickness from        a  few inches up to
  two or three feet respectively.               They are mined to a small extent,
  and in a very primitive manner.
     The author next gives a particular account of the basalt                         rocks
  above the coal.       It   is these rocks which compose the major portion
  of the northern islands         ;   the only one of the north           islands which
  shows any trace of the coals and the lower igneous                         series   being
  Mygenies.       The basalt rocks above the coals are for the most part
  more coarsely     crystalline than those of the older series.                  They aro
  dolerites rather than anamesites, but their composition is the same.
  They are also as        a   rule more coarsely         amygdaloidal — the cavities
  often    reaching a great size — two feet and even more in diameter.
  The minerals they contain are chiefly chabasite,                stilbite, apophyllite,
   analcime,   quartz, calcedony,         calcspar,   and green-earth,      and   it is not
   uncommon to find          two, three, or even four different zeolites            in    one

  498                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
 and the same cavity.         After describing in detail       the various appear
 ances assumed      by the dolerites,      and the features       exhibited by the
 associated    palagonitic tuffs, the author gives some account of the
 intrusive basalts, which are of two kinds — one occurring in sheets
 intruded along the line of bedding, the other in mere thin dykes
 and veins.
    He estimates the thickness of the anamesites               to be not less than
 4000 feet, and that of the dolerites as between                 9000 and 10,000
 feet ; thus giving a total thickness for the bedded volcanic rocks of
 not less than 13,000        or 14,000 feet.         As   the dip of the strata is
 extremely regular, and there are no large dislocations to complicate
matters,    this estimate may be relied upon           as  approximately correct.
    He then enters into        a  lengthened discussion        as   to the origin of
the strata, and combats the prevailing              belief that the igneous rocks
are relics of submarine eruptions.             The conclusion come to is that
the bedded basalt        rocks of the Faroe Islands represent             the heavy
basic, and more liquid lavas             which flowed from a cone or cones
placed at some       considerable      distance,   probably to the west of the
 present   islands.      The palagonitic       tuffs,  which sometimes       contain
 small  stones    and grit,     and   are often laminated,         represent  partly
line volcanic      dust (which the winds could carry considerable
distances),    partly volcanic mud, and to some extent they may also
have been derived from the subaerial               disintegration of the exposed
lavas.    They pass here and there into regular shales and tuffaceous
clays, especially    upon the horizon of the coal-seams.               The coals are
composed of land plants of Miocene age, and many plant remains
occur in the associated         clunch or clay and shale.            None of these
appear   to have     grown in sitri — there        are no roots      penetrating an
ancient soil.     The coals are made up of the debris of plants carried
down by freshets          into shallow pools and marshy meres.                Not  a
trace of marine      organisms      was observed       in any strata throughout
the islands.     The coals and clays indicate a pause in the volcanic
activity, during which the Miocene flora invaded the igneous area                   ;
but    whether from         the    direction    of    America     or  Europe   it is
impossible to say.          The    local seam      of coal    at Dalbofos     which
occurs low down in the series, proves that there were more than one
such pauses, and       its fragmentary condition leads to the suspicion
that the Miocene flora may               have    again    and again invaded the

these invasions having subsequently                                   been destroyed                 by newer flows

   1.    Glaeiation.—lLxn'y                          island visited showed conspicuous marks
of glacial          abrasion       ;       and         notwithstanding                  that the           rocks have
suffered       much since                  the glacial            period          from       the     action           of the
weather, striee are yet well preserved                                     in many             places.           They are
very plentiful           in and round Thorshavn,                                  where        they point E. 35°
to 45° S.           An      examination of Stromoe and Osterbe,                                            which were
traversed in several                   places,             and the smaller islands lying to the
north-east, proved that the whole northern group had been buried
under     a    thick sheet of ice, forming one compact mer de //hire which
flowed out in all directions from the dominant points of the islands.
The glaciation was traced                             up to a height of 1600 feet, and as the
water in some of the tiords is 100 fathoms deep, we must add this
to the other measurement                             to got the       maximum thickness of the ice
(2200 feet), which flowed outwards from Faroe.        The extreme
northern ends of the islands were sought everywhere for indications
of any invasion by ice from the direction of Greenland, but no
trace of this         was        found           ;    on     the contrary, the rocks wero there
highly rubbed, polished, and striated in                                         a    direction from south to
north.         In   Suderoe        the glaciation goes up to 1400 feet; above that
elevation the rocks are harsh, rugged,                                 and serrated, just as they are
above      the      limits       of glaciation                   in    the           northern       islands.            The
southern island showed that it too had been nearly smothered                                                              in
ice, which moved off in all directions                                 ;   and not only              so,    but it was
evident from the direction and position of the striae in the north of
Suderoe        that its          mer        de glace           was     coalescent            with         that of the
northern         islands.         During               the    glacial        period          the    Faroe Islands
were thus united                 by one and the same ice-sheet,                                     which had no
connection with either the mer de glace of Greenland or that of
Northern         Europe.               It        was        entirely         a       local     ice-sheet             flowing
outwards from the                  main elevations of the islands, and breaking
oil all round,       no doubt,              in       icebergs.

500                Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
land, Scandinavia, and Switzerland.              It is  a   more  or   less  locil
accumulation of       angular, subangular, and striated and smoothed
stones and boulders,      set in a matrix of bard gritty earth          and clay.
Its composition, its position with         regard to the configuration of the
ground, — sheltering     as it   does in the lee of rocks,      whose    polished
faces look in the opposite     direction, — and the    mode of its distribution
mark it out    as the  moraine du fond of the old mer          de glace.    Every
stone   it contained   belonged    to the islands, not a single fragment of
any rook foreign to the Faroes occurring in it.
    3.  Erratics and    Morainic debris are scattered        about everywhere,
and mark the retreat       and gradual disappearance           of the ice-sheet.
 Many of these erratics attain a large size, some measuring              upwards
 of 20 feet across.     Not  one of them is foreign to Faroe.          Few well-
 marked terminal moraines in the valleys were observed, partly owing
 to the fact that great quantities of debris have fallen from the cliffs,
 and tended     to obscure the glacial debris heaps, and partly           because
 they have suffered     much from the action of torrents and freshets.
 Here and there, however,        mounds of morainic origin are conspicuous
 enough.
    4.  The Rock-basins are next described,          and   their origin assigned
 to the grinding action of the glaciers.         They are numerous       upon the
 land, and seem to be as common           a feature of the fiords of Faroe as
 they are of the Scottish and Norwegian sea-lochs.
    The latter part of the paper         discusses   the origin   of the valleys
 and fiords, which is ascribed partly to subaerial erosion            and partly
 to glacial excavation.      The origin of the main water-parting of the
 islands also comes in for discussion, and considerable         space is devoted
 to the    consideration of such topics         as  present    atmospheric    and
 marine erosion     in  the   islands.     The paper     concludes    with   some
 account of the peat     with its   remains of small trees, and a description
 of  a number of typical rock specimens.
 3.   By special permission of the Society, there was read a
     Meteorological Note by Mr Alexander Wallace.                    Communi
     cated by Professor Piazzi Smyth.
    On Monday, March       1, 1880, a   strong breeze from the S.W., marked
 at  1 o'clock r.M. in meteorological observation,        as  equal to 15 miles

                    of Edinburgh,         Session 1878-79.                      501
per  hour, prevailed, after which             the   force   of the wind     rapidly
increased,   shifting to  W.N.W. until          about 2 o'clock when     it became
a  perfect   hurricane, accompanied          by    a storm    of snow and sleet.
The velocity of the wind must have been betwixt 40 and 50 miles
per hour, and partly from heavy black clouds covering the sky, and
partly from the dense sheet of snow which was drifting along, every
thing became obscured.
   From    the point where      I  stood (at the door of my house, the Old
Observatory, Calton      Hill)   there appeared two currents of snow drift,
one on each side, which meeting           each other about 20 feet in front of
me, after a severe struggle coalesced and shot upwards with excessive
velocity slantingly, and towards E.S.E.                As that   upshot was going
or gone, but when the storm was            still  at its maximum, a loud crash
was heard, and a      vivid   flash of light simultaneously seen, much as
one may suppose would be the effect of the bursting of a bomb-shell
within a few feet of you.
   Almost immediately        after this the storm         began to abate, and the
remainder of the day           was    comparatively calm.          Altogether    the
storm   did not last above ten minutes, and during that time tho
barometer    fell y\itbs of an inch, but rose again immediately after
wards to its former height.
        4.   On the Colouring of Maps.                By Professor Tait.
                                    (Abstmct.)
   Some     years ago, while      I  was   still working      at  knots, Professor
 Cayley told me of De Morgan's statement that four colours had been
found by experience to         be   sufficient for the purpose of completely
distinguishing from one another the various districts on               a map.
   I had previously shown that            if  an   even    number of boundaries
meet at each point on a diagram,             two colours (as on a chess-board)
will suffice for the purpose.         But in a map, boundaries usually meet
in threes.
   I replied to Professor Cayley that            I thought the proof might be
made to depend upon the obvious proposition                   that not more than
four points in    a plane  can be joined two and two by non-intersecting
lines.   Here points were made to stand for districts.             When two    such
points are joined by     a line they must have different colour-titles.            I

502                        Proceedings of           the   Iioyal Society
did not at the time pursue the subject,                       as   I    found that it was more
complex       than it appeared at lirst.
  Mr Kempe's           paper in Nature (February 20, 1880) has recalled my
attention to the subject, and some simple modes of treating the
question      have     occurred        to me.       The germs of them              are       in what    I
have said above, and they show one easily how to proceed to colour
any map.        A sketch only of             one of them is now given.
  Begin by making                as   above       stated a companion            diagram,         putting
points for districts, and lines joining                    them for common boundaries.
Then by introducing (in any way) as many new joining linesas possible
(but so that no two intersect) the diagram is divided into three-sided
compartments.
  Next, make all of these compartments four-sided by taking                                  a   number
of new points, each on a joining line.                        The whole set of points can
now be lettered            A   and    B alternately,      because two colours                suffice for
a map whose          boundaries meet in fours.                   But let the intruded points
be lettered     a and b, instead of             A   and   B   respectively.
  Now        perform the same operation                in a second way, differing every
where from the first,                and   call the newly intruded points a and                        [3
instead of     A   and B.
  Rules are laid down for carrying out these operations                                  ;    but they
require too many illustrative cuts to be given here.
  Then any one triangular compartment                         will     appear in two essentially
different forms        :   for instance, with its intruded points it may read
(in the two cases, taking the corners in the same order) a, B, A and               1!,
1!, A,   A. Now superpose the two figures, lettering included, and
       /?,
attend to the order of the two letters at the same point.                                    We    have,
from the instance              above, the compound               reading     (attending now to
the   corners      only)        BB, BA, AA, of which                   the separate          terms    are
necessarily     different.            Hence every point in the figure                    is      lettered
differently from all that              are   joined to     it,   and only four designations
can occur,      viz.   :   AA, AB, BA, BB.                 This        proves   the proposition,
and gives one mode of colouring the original map.                                For     the erasure
of joining      lines (such           as   were     originally introduced to divide the
whole into three-sided compartments)                      does not necessitate any change
of lettering.
   This mode of treating the question                      shows         incidentally that in           a
map where only three boundaries meet at each point, the boundaries

                  of Edinburgh,     Session 1879-80.                  503
may be coloured     with  three colours, so that no    two of the same
colour are conterminous.
   This particular  process essentially introduces four different colours,
and therefore does not      necessarily give the simplest way of colour
ing a map.    Another method, quite different from this, but involving
virtually the same principles, is next given.      Then come two other
processes, different in form from that of    MrKempe, but    based like  it
ultimately on the fact that only 3(»     - 2) non-intersecting lines can
be drawn (except for a= 2) joining n points in a plane.

  1.  On the Structure and Origin of Coral Beefs and Islands.
                              By John Murray.

   Darwin's Theory. — During the voyage of the " Beagle" and subse
quently,    Mr Darwin     made a profound study of coral reefs, and has
given a theory of their mode of formation which has since been
universally accepted by scientific men.
    Darwin's    theory may      be   said  to    rest  on   two facts — the one
physiological,     and   the    other physical — the         former,   that those
species   of corals    whose    skeletons     chiefly make      up reefs    cannot
live in    depths   greater   than from 20 to 30 fathoms             ;  the latter,
that   the   surface   of   the    earth   is   continually     undergoing slow
elevation or subsidence.
   The corals commence         by growing up from the shallow waters
surrounding      an island, and     form   a   fringing reef which is closely
attached to the shore.       The island slowly sinks, but the corals con
tinually grow upwards,       and keep     the upper surface       of the reef at
a level 'with the waves of the ocean.              When this     has gone on for
some    time a wide navigable water         channel is formed between          the

  reef and the shores of the island, and we have a barrier reef.                     These
  processes have but to be continued some stages further, when the
 island will disappear beneath the ocean, and be replaced by an atoll
  with its lagoon where the island once stood.
      According to this simple and beautiful theory, the fringing                      reef
 becomes a barrier reef, and the barrier reef an atoll by a continuous
  process    of    development.

                   if  the Present Paper.        — Professor Semper,* during his
  examination of the coral               reefs   in the Pclcw group,          experienced
 great difficulties         in applying Darwin's theory.             Similar difficulties
 presented          themselves to the author in those                coral   reef  regions
 visited during the cruise of the " Challenger."
      The object of the present               paper is to show, first,     that, while    it
 must be granted as generally              true    that reef-forming species of coral
 do not live at a depth greater than 30 or 40 fathoms,                     yet that there
 arc other agencies at work in the tropical oceanic regions                     by which
 submarine elevations             can be    built up from very        great depths so as
 to form a foundation for coral reefs                ; second, that while     it must    be
 granted     that the surface of the earth has undergone many oscillations
 in recent geological           times, yet that all the chief features            of coral
 reefs and islands can be accounted for without calling in the aid of
 great and general subsidences.
     Nature        of   Oceanic     Islands     mid Submarine        Elevations. — It is
 now known that, with scarcely                  an exception,!      all oceanic    islands
 other than coral           atolls are of volcanic origin.         Darwin, Dana, and
others have noticed           the close resemblance        between atolls and ordinary
 islands in          their manner       of grouping as well as in their shapes.
 In   a previous paper the author pointed out the wide distribution of
volcanic debris over the bed of the ocean in tropical regions, and
the almost           total absence of minerals,           such as quartz,      which    are
characteristic          of continental land.!            There is every reason for
believing       that     atolls  are   primarily    situated   on volcanic mountains
and not on submerged               continental land      as is so often supposed.

if  these can be regarded as oceanic islands.           Some of the islands between New
Caledonia and Australia may have primitive rocks, and the atolls in these
regions may be situated on foundations of this nature.

 Although now            capped     and flanked        by    deposits     of   Globigerina
 and Pteropod ooze, these mountains were most probably originally
 formed by volcanic eruptions.              The deposits in deep water on either
 side of them were almost wholly made up of volcanic materials.
     Volcanic       mountains situated        in    the    ocean      basins,   and    which
 during their formation had risen above the surface                         of the water,
 would assume          a more or      less sharp and pointed outline owing to
 the denuding action of the atmosphere                  and of the waves, and very
 extensive banks of the denuded materials would be formed around
 them.       Some,     like Graham's Island, might            be   wholly     swept    away,
 and only       a  bank with a few fathoms of water over it be left on the
spot.       In this way numerous foundations may                    havo   been prepared
for barrier reefs and even atolls.
    Those       volcanoes      which during     their formation           had    not risen
above      the    surface    of the sea (and they were probably the most
                                                                                   *
numerous) would assume a rounded and dome-like contour, owing
to the denser medium into which the eruptions had taken place,
and the deposits           which     had been subsequently formed                 on their
summits.
    In   order     to clearly understand how a submarine mountain, say
half   a  mile beneath         the sea, can be built         up sufficiently near the
surface      to form a foundation          on which       reef-forming corals might
live, it is necessary to consider attentively the
    Pelagic       Fauna and Flora of Tropical Regions. — During the
cruise of the " Challenger," much attention was paid to this subject.
Every     day while       at sea tow-nets    were dragged          through the surface
waters    ;  and while dredging they were sent down to various depths
beneath       the surface.        Everywhere     life was most abundant in the
surface and sub-surface             waters.     Almost       every     haul gave many
calcareous,       siliceous, and other Algae          ; great    numbers       of Forami-

    Most of these organisms             live from the surface        down to about
100 fathoms.*          In   calm weather they swarm near the surface,              but
when it is rough they are to be found several fathoms beneath
the waves.        They are borne          along in the great       oceanic    currents
which are created by the winds              ; and meeting with coral reefs, they
supply the corals on the outer edge of the reefs with abundant food.
The reason why the windward side of a reef grows more vigorously
appears     to be this abundant supply of food, and not the more
abundant supply of oxygen as is generally stated.                        The   " Chal
         "
lenger      researches     showed      that oxygen was particularly abundant
in all depths inhabited by reef-forming corals.
    When      these surface      animals die, either by coming in contact
 with colder water or from other causes, their shells and skeletons
fall  to the bottom, and carry down              with them     some organic matter
 which    gives a  supply of food to deep-sea animals.              The majority of
 deep-sea animals       live by eating the mud at the bottom.
    An    attempt was made           to estimate the quantity of carbonate          of
 lime,   in   the   form     of calcareous      Algae,   Foraminifera,     Pteropods,
 Hetcropods, Pelagic Gastropods,              in the surface waters.       A tow-net,
 having a mouth 12J inches in diameter, was dragged for as nearly
 as possible      half a mile through the water.              The shells collected
 were boiled in caustic            potash,    washed,   and then weighed.          The
 mean of four experiments             gave 2'545 grammes.           If  these animals
 were as abundant in all the depth down                  to  100   fathoms as they
  were in the track followed by the tow-net, this would give over                   1 6
  tons of carbonate        of lime in this form in a mass of the ocean one
  mile square by 100 fathoms.           j

       The Challengeridie, and many of the other members of Haeckel's new order
  Phccodaria, certainly live deeper, as we never got them in the tropica except
  when the net was sent down to a depth of 200 or 300 fathoms.

     Bathymetrical           Distribution      of  the Calcareous        Shells and Skeleton*
of Surface         Organisms.        — Although         those lime-secreting          organisms
are so ahundant in tropical surface                     waters, their cast-off shells and
skeletons        are      either wholly        or partially       absent     from by far the
greater part of the floor of the ocean.                      In depths      greater than 3000
fathoms we usually met with only                         a   few shells of Pelagic Fora-
minifera of the larger and heavier kinds                        ;    a few   hundred fathoms
nearer the surface they became more numerous,                            and we get a few of
the smaller kinds and some Coccoliths and Rhabdoliths.                                  At  about
1900       or 1800 fathoms              a  few shells of Pteropods and Heteropods
are met with          ;    and in all depths        less than a mile wo have a deposit
in which the shell and skeletons of almost every surface                                organism
is to be found.             In   the equatorial streams and calms the calcareous
Algae,      Pelagic Foraminifera,              Pteropods, and Heteropods are more
abundant on the surface                    than elsewhere       ;   and it is in these same
regions       that wo found their dead shells at greater depths                           than in
        Orhulina universa.                                 Globigcrina dubia.

     It is the dead shells of these Pelagic Foraminifera which chiefly make up the
 calcareous oozes of the deep sea.              The living shells of all the above varieties
 swarm     in  the tropical and sub-tropical waters near the surface.              It is especially
 in the region     of   the  equatorial    calms  that the  largest   and  thickest  shelled speci
 mens are found.           As  we go north or south into colder water they become smaller,
 and many varieties          die out.     In the surface waters of the Antic and Antarctic
 regions, only some dwarfed specimens of Globigcrina bulloides arc met with. The
 author is nimble to agree with Dr Carpenter and Mr Brady in thinking that
 these Pelagic Foraminifera also live on the bottom.                     This question was made
 the subject of careful investigation during the cruise.                 The shells from the sur
 face and from the bottom              were compared at each locality, and it was found,
 by micrometric measurement,               that surface specimens were as large and as thick
 shelled as any average specimens from the soundings.                        It is quite unlikely
  that the same individuals should pass a part of their lives in the warm sunny
  surface waters, at a temperature of from 70° to 80° Fahr., and another part in the
  cold dark waters two or three miles beneath, at a temperature                     of 30" or 40°
  Fahr.      The geographical distribution of these Pelagic forms over the bottom
  coincides    exactly with the distribution of the same forms on the surface ; that
  is to say, both on the surface and on the bottom, the distribution is ruled by
  surface temperature.            No specimens of these Pelagic varieties were ever ob
  tained from the bottom with the shells filled and surrounded                      with sarcode.
  Whereas creeping and attached forms (like Truncatulina, Discorbina, xVnoma-
  lina, and some Textulariae) were taken in this condition in almost every dredge.
  These last-mentioned          forms which we kuow live on the bottom have a distri
   bution quite independent of surface temperature.

the deposits            of other         parts        of the ocean.             Another          circumstance
influences the             bathymetrical                 distribution         of these        surface   shells.
When there is             a complete            and free oceanic circulation from the top
to the bottom,            these dead shells are found at greater                               depths in the
deposits than where the circulation is cut off by submarine barriers.
    The agent by which these shells are removed                                       is,   as   Sir Wyville
Thomson suggested,                   carbonic           acid.     Analysis          shows      that carbonic
acid      is    most      abundant in                sea    water,     and especially so in deep
water.         Pteropod and Heteropod shells are very much larger than
the Foraminifera,               yet are very much thinner                       ;   and hence, for the
quantity of lime contained in them, they present                                          a   much      greater
surface        to   the    action of the                   sea water.          This    seems to be           the
reason why all large and thin shells are first removed                                           from the de
posits with increasing depth, and not the fact that some shells                                               are
composed of arragonite                     and some of calcite, as has been suggested.
    There
                is
                a       continual struggle in the ocean with respect to the
carbonate        of lime.            Life      is   continually secreting            it   and moulding            it
into many varied and beautiful forms.                                  The carbonic acid of ocean
waters attacks these when                       life    has lost its hold, reduces the lime to
the form of         a     bicarbonate,              and carries       it     away in solution.           In all
the greater         depths of the ocean these surface shells are reduced to
a   bicarbonate either during their fall through the water or shortly
after reaching          the bottom.
    In    the shallower depths                  — on       the tops of submarine elevations or
volcanoes       — the accumulation of                       the dead          silicious and calcareous
shells    is    too rapid for the action of the sea water to have                                        much
effect.        Long       before      such          a   deposit reaches sufficiently near the
surface        to serve         as   a   foundation             for reef-forming corals,                it   is   a
bank on which flourish numerous species of Foraminifera, Sponges,
Hydroids, deep-sea Corals, Annelids, Alcyonarians, Molluscs, Polyzoa,
Echinoderms,              &c.        All       these       tend to fix and consolidate                  such      a
bank, and add their shells, spicules, and skeletons                                       to the relatively
rapid accumulating deposits.                         Eventually coral-forming species attach
themselves  to such banks, and then commences the formation of
   Coral  Atolls — Mr Darwin has pointed out that " reefs not to be
                                               "

banks such          as those here described.                      However, the improbability of

 so many submerged            banks existing in the open ocean caused him to
 reject this mode of formation for atolls.                   As   here stated,      recent
 deep-sea investigations have shown that submerged                     banks are con
 tinually in      process      of formation       in  the   tropical    regions    of  the
 ocean, and      it is in     a high degree        probable that the majority of
atolls are seated on banks formed in this manner.
     Mr Darwin        has also pointed out that the              corals   on the outer
margin of       a   submerged         bank would grow vigorously, whilst               the
growth of those on the central expanse would be checked                            by the
sediment formed there, and by the small amount of food brought to
 them.*      Very early in        the history of such       an atoll, and while        yet
several fathoms submerged,               the corals  situated on the central parts
would be placed at a disadvantage,                 and this would become greater
 and greater as the coral plantations approached                 the surface.      When
the coral plantation was small there was a relatively largo periphery
 for the supply of food to the inner parts, and also for the supply of
 sediment    ; and hence,        in small atolls the lagoon was very shallow,
 and was soon iilled up.             For   the same reasons coral islands situated
 on long and narrow              banks have no lagoons.            An atoll     one mile
 square has a periphery of four miles.                In  an atoll four miles square
— the periphery increasing in arithmetical                 progression    and the area
as the square     — we     have for each square mile only          a  periphery of one
mile over which food may pass to the interior, and from which
sediment     is supplied for        filling up  the lagoon.
    With increasing        size, then, the conditions become more and more
favourable      to   the   formation of lagoons,          and as a consequence          we
have no large or moderate sized coral islands without lagoons.                       Tow-
net experiments always showed very much less Pelagic life (food)                        in
the lagoon     waters     than on the outer edge of the reef.                The lagoon
becomes less favourable for the growth of all the more massive kinds
of coral   as the    outer edge of the reef reaches the surface, and cuts off
the free supply of ocean waters.              Many species of corals die.     f     Much
dead    coral,    coral    rock, and        sediment is exposed        to   the   solvent
action of the        sea    water.       Larger   quantities    of lime arc       carried
away     in solution        as    a    bicarbonate    from the      lagoon     than are

   t  There are no living corals or shells in some small lagoons, the waters of
which become highly heated, and in some cases extremely saline.

secreted by the animals which can                   still live in it;      the lagoon thus
becomes widened and deepened.*
     On the other hand a vigorous growth and secretion of lime takes
place on the outer margins of the reef                  ;  and when the water outside
becomes         too     deep for reef-forming corals           to live, these still build
seawards         on a talus       made    up of their         own debris      : — the whole
atoll expands somewhat after the manner of a Fairy Ring.
     It   is not necessary to call         in disseverment of         large atolls   in order
to explain          the appearances       presented       in  the Great Maldiva         group
of atolls.     f     The coral fields rising from very many parts of these
extensive submarine banks form atolls.                        The marginal atolls have
from the          first the     advantage     of   a  better supply of food.             They
elongate       in   the direction of the margin of the bank where the water
is shallower than to seaward.                 Many of these marginal atolls have
coalesced, and as this growth and coalescence have continued, a large
part of the food-supply has been cut off from the small atolls situated
towards the interior of the bank.                      Ultimately       a large    atoll like
Suadiva atoll would be formed.                     The atolls in the interior would
be perhaps         wholly removed         in solution, and the atoll-like           character
of small marginal but now coalesced atolls would                             be   wholly or
partially        lust by the destruction of their inner sides. \ A study
of the charts shows all the stages in this mode of development.
      In   the case of the Lakadivh, Caroline, and Chagos archipelagos                     we
 have submarine banks at various stages of growth towards the sur

 coral plantations, but            all submerged      several     fathoms,    and scattered
 amongst these some of the oldest and                  most completely-formed atolls
 and coral islands.              It is most    difficult    to conceive     how these sub-

        Complete      little Serpula-atolls, with lagoons from 3 to 50 feet in diameter,
 mi i i formed    in this way without subsidence, were numerous along the shores of
 Bermuda.
     t Mr     Darwin's application of Ids theory to this group — where the dissever
 ment      of large atolls is called in, and a destructive       power attributed to oceanic
 currents, which it is very unlikely they can ever possess — has often been con
 sidered unsatisfactory.

  its points had undergone           material change, or were no longer the same when
  visited after the lapse of fourteen years.          These remarks refer particularly to
  islets situated     within the lagoon.      I could myself quote many instances of the
  same description."        — " Wilkes' Exploring Expedition," vol. iv. p. 271.

merged banks could have been produced                    by subsidence,       situated  as
they are    in relation    to each other and with respect to the               perfectly-

    It is a   much more natural view to regard                 these atolls and sub
merged     banks as originally         volcanoes      reaching to various heights
beneath the      sea,  and which have subsequently been built up to and
towards the surface by accumulations of organic sediment and the
growth of coral on their summits.                   It is   a  remarkable fact that,
in all coral atolls which        have been raised several hundred feet above
the sea, the base is generally described               as composed     of solid lime
stone, or
             " of various kinds of         coral    evidently deposited         after life
had become extinct." *            This  base is probably often made up of such
a rock as that brought by the missionaries                   from New Ireland, and
described by Professor Liversidge,             f   as composed chiefly of Pelagic
                   the same as those taken by the " Challenger

    Microscopic sections of a rock taken from 50 feet below sea level
at Bermuda show that           a  deposition of carbonate of lime is going on.
The small shells are filled with, and the broken pieces of shells and
corals are cemented         by, calcite.     The wells in coral islands rise and
fall with    the tide, so that the whole atoll is filled like a sponge with
sea water.       This    water    is very    slowly     interchanged, and by the
solution of the smaller and thinner particles, becomes saturated, and
a  deposition of lime follows.              In    this way we may explain the
absence of many of the more delicate                shells from some limestones.         J

     Between 250           and 350 yards from the edge of the reef there
 was generally a very steep and irregular slope                  ;  about 100 fathoms
 was got at the latter distance,              and    the angles between        these last-
 mentioned distances            often exceeded        45 degrees.        The talus hero
 appeared to be composed of huge masses and heads of coral,                         which
 had been torn by the waves from the upper ledge and piled up
 on    each     other.      They    were    now     covered    with     living   Sponges,
 Alcyonarians, Hydroids, Polyzoa, Foraminifera, &c.*
     From      350 to 500 yards         from the edge of the reef,             we  had a
 slope with an angle of about 30°, and made up chiefly of coral sand.
 Beyond 500 yards the angle of the slope decreased                  till we  had at a dis
 tance of a mile from the reef an angle of 6°, a depth of 590 fathoms,
 and a mud composed            of volcanic and coral sand, Pteropods, Pelagic
and other Foraminifera, Coccoliths, &c.
     In  the lagoon       channel the reefs were found to bo fringed with
living      coral,    and to slope downwards and outwards for                  a few feet,
and then        plunge at once to        a  depth of 10 or         10 fathoms.      Many
portions of these inner reefs were overhanging, and at some places
overhanging masses had recently fallen away.                        Everywhere      much
dead       coral     rock   was    exposed     to  the   solvent action       of the sea
water.        The reefs of Tahiti are at some places fringing, at other
places there is a boat          passage    within    the  reef, and at Papiete there
is a large       ship channel with islets            within, and the outer edge of
the reef is a mile distant from                 the   shore.    The      island itself  is
surrounded with           a  belt of fertile low land, frequently three or four
 miles wide        ;  this shows     that the     island   has not in recent        times
undergone         subsidence     ; there   are, indeed,    reasons     for supposing    it
has recently been slightly             elevated.      Everything      appears    to show
    *
       This ledge and steep slope beyond where a depth of 30 or 40 fathoms was
reached, was characteristic of a. large number of atoll and barrier reefs, and
seemed due to wave action.            Experiments had been made with masses of
broken coral, and it was found that these could (on account of their rough
and jagged surface) be built up into a nearly perpendicular wall by letting
them full on each other.           A talus formed in water deeper than 40 fathoms
where there was little if any motion would be different from one formed on
land.     In the latter case the disintegrating forces at work always tended to set
the talus in motion; in the former case everything tended to consolidate and to
fix the blocks in the positions first assumed.           A removal of lime in solution
would take place from the blocks forming this steep slope, but, except in very
deep water, this would not be sufficient to check the outward extension of the
reef.

that the reefs have commenced         close to the shore and have extended
seawards,    first on  a foundation composed of the volcanic detritus of
the island, and afterwards on        a talus composed of coral debris, and
the shells and skeletons of surface organisms.*
    The lagoon channel was subsequently slowly formed by the solvent
action of the    sea  water    thrown over the reefs at each tide, and the
islets in the lagoon       channel are portions of the original reef still
left   standing.     The reefs have extended      outwards from the island
and have been disintegrated and removed              behind in the same way
as the atoll has extended outwards after reaching the surface.
    Where reefs rise quite to the surface, and are nearly continuous,
"we  find relatively few coral patches       and heads     in   the lagoons and
lagoon channels.        Where the outer reefs are much broken up, the
coral growths in the lagoon are relatively abundant.                  Where the
water was deep and the talus to be formed was great, the outward
growth has been relatively slow,f and the disintegrating forces in the
lagoons and lagoon channels gaining in the struggle, the reefs would
 become very narrow and might indeed bo broken up.                This, however,
would admit the oceanic waters and more food, and growth would
again commence        on the inner as well as the outer sides of the          still
remaining portions.       In  the great barrier reef of Australia, where tho
openings are numerous and wide, the reefs have          a great   width.  Where
the openings are few and neither wide nor deep (as in lat. 12° 30')
the reefs are very narrow and " steep to" — on their inner side.
    At   the Admiralty     Islands, on the lagoon side of the islets on the
barrier reefs, the trees were found overhanging the water, and in some
 cases the soil washed away from their roots.           It  is a common    obser
 vation in atolls that the islets on the reefs are situated close to the
lagoon shore.       These facts point out tho removal        of matter which is
going on in the lagoons and lagoon channels.
    Elevation and Subsiden.ee. — Mr Darwin has given many reasons
for believing that     those islands and coasts which have fringing reefs
had recently been elevated, or had long remained in               a state of rest.
   *  A dredging in 155 fathoms, close to the barrier reef of Australia (between
it and Raine Island), gave a coral sand, which was, I estimate, more than two-
thirds made up of the shells of surface animals.
   + Hence in barrier reefs, where the depth outside is very great, we find the
reefs running closer to the shore than where the depth is less, and conse
 quently the talus to be formed is smaller.

 Throughout        the   volcanic     islands of the        great  ocean   basins   the
 evidence     of recent elevations         are everywhere conspicuous.           Jukes
 has given most         excellent reasons for believing that the coast of
 Australia     fronted by the         barrier reef,      and  even   the barrier   reef
 itself, have recently been elevated.*             Dana and Couthouy have given
 a  list of islands in almost        every barrier reef and atoll region which
 have recently been elevated,          f
     This is what       we   should       expect.      Generally   speaking, all the
 volcanic regions which we know have in the main been areas of
 elevation, and wo would expect the same to hold good in those vast
 and permanent       hollows of the earth which are occupied by the waters
 of the ocean.       It must be remembered            that, probably, all atolls were
 seated on submarine volcanoes.                 Areas of local depression       are to
 be looked for      in  the ocean       basins   on either side      of and between
groups of volcanic islands and atolls,               and not on the very site of
these     islands.      This   is    what     the   deep-sea     soundings   show     if
they show any depression              at all.     Subsidence has been called in
in    order to account for the existence of lagoons and lagoon channels,
and the narrow bands              of reef      which     enclose  these ;  but it has
been shown that these were produced                 by quite other causes, — by the
vigorous growth of the corals where most nourishment was to be
had, and their death          solution and disintegration by the action of
sea-water and currents f at those parts which cannot be, on account
of their situation, sufficiently supplied with food.
     All  the chief and characteristic features of barrier reefs and atolls
may, indeed, exist        with slow     elevation,     for the removal of lime from
the lagoons and the dead upper                 surface    of the reefs by currents,
and     in solution by rain and sea-water might keep pace with the
upward movement.
     The most recent        charts of all coral reef regions          have been exa
mined, and it is found possible to explain all the phenomena                    by the
principles here advanced           ;  while     on   the subsidence     theory, it is
most difficult to explain the appearances and structures met                  with in

 barrier reefs, and atolls, all occur in close proximity, and where all
 the other evidence seems to point to elevation, or at least a long
 period of rest.       In  instances   like the    Gambier group,      the  reefs
 situated on the seaward side of the outer islands would grow more
vigorously than those towards the interior            ; they would extend in
 the   direction of the shallower water, and ultimately would form a
 continuous barrier around the whole group.                The distinguishing
feature of the views now advanced            is that they do away with        the
great and general subsidences        required by Darwin's theory,* and are
 in harmony with Dana's views of the great antiquity and permanence
 of the great ocean basin, which all recent deep-sea researches
 appear to support.
     Summary. — It was shown (1) that foundations have been pro-
 pared for barrier reefs and atolls by the disintegration of volcanic
islands, and by the building up of submarine volcanoes by the deposi
tion    on their summits of organic and other sediments.
     (2.) That the chief food of the corals consists          of the abundant
Pelagic life of the tropical regions, and the extensive solvent action of
sea-water     is shown by the removal of the carbonate            of lime-shells
of   these surface organisms     from all the greater depths of the ocean.
    (3.) That when coral plantations build up from submarine banks
they assume an atoll form, owing to the more abundant supply of
food to the outer margins, and the removal of dead coral rock from
the interior portions by currents and by the action of the carbonic
acid dissolved in sea-water.
    (4.) That barrier reefs have    built out from   the shore on a foundation
of volcanic debris or       on a talus of coral blocks, coral sediment,      and
Pelagic shells, and the lagoon          channel is formed in the same way
as a lagoon.
    (5.)  That it   is not necessary to call in subsidence      to explain any
of the characteristic features of barrier reefs or atolls, and that all
these features would exist alike in areas of slow elevation,          of rest, or
of slow subsidence.
    In conclusion it    was pointed out that all the causes here appealed

1.   Rock-Weathering,           as illustrated in Edinburgh Churchyards.
               By Professor Geikie, F.R.S.             (Plate   XVI.)
    Comparatively       little has yet been done         in the   way of precise
measurement       of the rate at which the exposed surfaces of different
kinds of rock are removed            in the processes of weathering.        A few
years ago, some experiments            were instituted     by Professor Pfaff of
Erlangen to obtain more definite information on this subject                    He
exposed to ordinary          atmospheric influences carefully measured and
weighed pieces of Solenhofen limestone, syenite, granite (both rough
and polished), and bone.            At the end of three years he found that
the loss from the limestone             was   equivalent to the removal of a
uniform layer 0-04 mm. in thickness from its general surface.                  The
stone had become quite dull and earthy, while on parts of its surface
fine   cracks   and    incipient     exfoliation   had appeared.*        The time
during which the observations              were   continued was, however,       too
brief to allow any general          deductions to be drawn from them as to
the real average rate of disintegration.            Professor Pfaff relates that
during the period a severe hail storm broke one of the plates                    of
stone.     An exceptionally powerful           cause of this nature might make

the loss during    a  short interval considerably greater than the true
average of a longer period.
     It  occurred   to mo recently that data of at least             a provisional
value might be obtained from an examination of tombstones                     freely
exposed to the air     in graveyards,   in  cases where their dates remained
still legible  or might be otherwise ascertained.            I  have   accordingly
paid attention to the older burial-grounds in Edinburgh, and have
gathered    together some facts which have, perhaps,           sufficient interest
and novelty to be communicated to the Society.
    At  the outset    it is of   course    obvious that in seeking for data
bearing on the general        question of rock-weathering, we must admit
the kind and amount of such weathering visible in                 a town to be in
some    measure   different from what is normal in nature.                So far as
the disintegration of rock-surfaces         is effected   by mineral acids, for
example, there must be         a good   deal   more of such chemical         change
-where sulphuric acid is copiously evolved into the atmosphere                  from
thousands of chimneys than in the pure air of country districts.
In   these respects we may regard         the disintegration      in towns     as an
exaggeration of the normal rate.           Still, the difference    between town
and country may be less           than might bo supposed.              Surfaces of
stone are apt to get begrimed with dust and smoke, and the crust of
organic and inorganic matter deposited            upon them may in no small
measure protect them from the greater chemical              activity of the more
acid town rain.       In  regard to the effect of daily or seasonal changes
of  temperature,    on the other hand, any difference         between town and
country may not impossibly be on the side of the town.                      Owing,
probably, to the inlluence of smoke in retarding radiation, thermo

    The illustrations      of rock-weathering       presented     by    city grave
yards are necessarily      limited to the few kinds of rock employed for
 monumental purposes.           In this district     the materials     used are of
 three  kinds : — 1st,    Calcareous,   including     marbles and limestones         ;
 2d, sandstones    and flagstones ; 3d, granites.

shell-marble,     and a finely fossiliferous          limestone,     containing frag
ments of shells, foraminifera, &c.
    In  a  few  cases  the white marble has been employed                by itself as a
monolith in the shape of an obelisk, urn, or other device                   ;  but most
commonly it occurs in slabs which have been tightly                          fixed in a
framework of sandstone.            These slabs, from less than            1   to  fully  2
inches thick, are generally placed vertically              ;  in one or two examples
they have       been    inserted    in largo     horizontal      sandstone      slabs   or
"  through-stanes."        The form into which it has been cut, and the
position in which it has been erected, have had considerable                        influ
ence on the weathering of the stone.
    A   specimen of the common            white marble employed              for monu
mental purposes was obtained from one of the marble-works of the
city, and examined          microscopically.       It   presented     the well-known
granular character of true saccharoid             marble, consisting of rounded
granules     of clear transparent       calcite,  averaging       about y^^th      of an
inch in diameter       (fig. 1, A).     Each granule has its own system of

 veloped.      Not   a trace  exists  of any amorphous granular matrix or
 base holding      the crystalline    grains together.     These seem moulded
 into   each other, but have evidently no extraordinary cohesion.                A
 small fragment placed in dilute acid was entirely dissolved.                There
 can be no doubt that this marble must be very nearly pure carbonate
 of lime.
    The process of weathering in the case of this white marble presents
three phases sometimes to be observed on the same slab, — -viz., super
ficial solution, internal disintegration, and curvature with fracture.
    (1.) Superficial Solution is effected by the carbonic acid, and
partly by the sulphuric acid of town-rain.                 When tho marble is
first erected it possesses     a  well-polished surface, capable of affording
a distinct    reflection of objects     placed in front of it.      Exposure for
not more than       a year or  two to our prevalent westerly rains suffices
 to remove      this polish, and to give the surface          a  rough granular
character.       The granules which have been cut across or bruised in
 the cutting and      polishing process are first attacked and removed in
 solution,    or drop out of the stone.            An obelisk in Groyfriars'
 Churchyard, erected in memory of a           lady who died in 1 8C4, has so
rough and granular a surface           that it might readily      be taken   for a
sandstone.        So loosely   are the grains held together         that a slight
motion of tho finger will rub them off.              In the course of solution
and removal, the internal structure of the marble                begins to reveal
itself.    Its harder    nests and veinings of caleite      and   other minerals
project above tho surrounding surface, and may bo traced as pro
minent ribs and excrescences           running across the faint or illegiblo
inscriptions.       On the other hand, some portions of the marble aro
more rapidly removed         than others.      Irregular channels, dcpendent.
partly    on the    direction given to trickling rain by the form of tho
monumental         carving, but     chielly  on   original  differences   in   tho
internal structure of the stone, are gradually hollowed out.              In this
way the former artificial surface of the marble              disappears,   and is
changed     into one that rather recalls the bare bleached rocks of some
mountain side.
   The rate at which the transformation takes place seems to depend
primarily     on tho extent to which the marble is exposed               to rain.
Slabs which have been placed facing to north-east,              and with a suffi
ciently projecting architrave to keep off much of the rainfall, retain

522                   Proceedings      of thc Royal Society
thoir inscriptions legible for a century or longer.              But     even     in these
cases the progress        of internal     disintegration is distinctly             visible.
Where the marble has been less screened from rain, the rapidity                           of
-waste   has been     sometimes      very marked.         A    good    illustration        is
supplied by the tablet on the south side of Greyfriars' Churchyard,
erected    in  memory      of G         G         ,  who died in 1785.*                This
monument had become             so far decayed       as  to require restoration in
 1803.     It  is now and has been for some years for the most part
utterly illegible.      The marble       has   been     dissolved away over the
centre of the slab to a depth of about a quarter of an inch.                      Yet this
monument is by no means in an exposed                    situation.       It   faces east
ward in a rather sheltered         corner, where, however,         the wind          eddies
in   such a   way as to throw the rain against              the part of the stone
which has been most corroded.
    In  the majority of cases superficial solution has been retarded                      by
the formation of      a  peculiar grey or begrimed crust, to be immediately
described.       The marble employed here for monumental                  slabs appears
to bo peculiarly liable to the development of this crust.                         Another
kind of white marble,         sometimes employed for sculptured ornaments
on tombstones,       dissolves without crust.           It   is snowy white,            and
more translucent than           the   ordinary marble.          So far       as   the   few
 weathered specimens        I  have seen enable        me to judge,        it  appears to
be either Carrara marble, or one of the strongly saccharoid,                    somewhat
translucent, varieties employed          instead of it.        This  stone, however,
though it forms no crust, suffers marked superficial solution.                       But it
escapes the internal disintegration, which, so far as               I have       observed,
is always an accompaniment             of the crust.        Yet   the few examples
of it   I  have    met with hardly       suffice    for any comparison            between
the varieties.

    (2.) Internal Disintegration.- Many of the marble monuments in
our older churchyards are covered with a dirty crust, beneath which
the stone is found on examination to be merely a loose crumbling
sand.     This crust    seems to form chiefly whore superficial solution is
feeble.     It may be observed       to crack into a polygonal network, the
individual     polygons occasionally curling up so                as   to     reveal     the
yellowish white crumbling material underneath.                      It   also     rises   in

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                523
blisters which, when they break, expose the interior to rapid dis
integration.
    So long as this begrimed film lasts unbroken, the smooth face of
the marble slab remains with apparently little modification.                      The
inscription    may bo perfectly         legible.     The   moment the crust is
broken up, however, the decay of the stone is rapid.                  For  we then
see that the cohesion     of the individual crystalline granules of the
marble has already been destroyed, and that the merest touch causes
them to crumble into       a loose sand.
    It  appears,  therefore,    that two changes take          place   in upright
marble slabs freely exposed to          rain in our burial-grounds — a super
ficial, more   or less firm crust is formed, and the             cohesion     of the
particles beneath is destroyed.
    The crust varies in colour from a dirty grey to                a  deep brown
black, and in thickness from that of writing paper up to sometimes
at least a millimetre.      One of the most characteristic examples             of it
was obtained from an utterly decayed                 tomb  (erected   in  the    year
1792) on the east side of Canongate Churchyard.                    No ono would
suppose that the pieces of flat dark stone lying there on the sand
stone plinth were once portions of white marble.               Yet   a mere    touch
suffices to break the black crust, and           the stone at once crumbles to
powder.     Nevertheless the two opposite faces of the original polished
slab have been preserved,         and    I even    found the sharply chiselled
socket-hole of one of the retaining nails.              The specimen was care
fully  removed,   and soaked     in  a   solution of gum, so as to preserve it
from disintegration.     On submitting the crust of this marble to micro
scopic investigation    I found    it  to consist of particles of coal, grains
of quartz-sand,   angular pieces of broken glass, fragments of red brick
or tile, and organic    fibres.    This miscellaneous collection of town
dust was held together       by some amorphous cement, which was not
dissolved by hydrochloric acid.           At my     request my friend    Mr B. N,
Peach tested it with soda on charcoal, and at once obtained                a  strong
sulphur reaction.     There can be little doubt that it is mainly sulphate
of lime.    The crust which forms upon our marble tombstones                 is thus
a  product of the reaction of the sulphuric acid of the town-rain
upon the carbonate       of lime.       A   pellicle of amorphous       gypsum is
deposited   upon the marble, and encloses the particles of dust which
give the characteristic sooty aspect to the stone.               This pellicle, of

 524                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
course, when once formed,             is comparatively little affected by the
chemical activity of rain-water.            Hence the conservation of the even
surface   of the marble.         It   is liable, however, to be cracked by an
internal expansion        of the stone, to which      I  shall immediately refer,
and also to rise in small blisters, and, as             I  have   said,  its rupture
leads at once to the rapid disintregation of the stone.
   The cause of this disintegration is the next point for consideration.
Chemical examination revealed the presence of a slight amount of
sulphate   in the heart of the crumbling marble               ;  but the quantity
appeared     to me to be too small seriously to affect the cohesion                   of
the stone.      I  submitted to microscopic          examination     a  portion of a
crumbling      urn of white marble           in Canongate Churchyard.             The
tomb bears a perfectly fresh date of 1792 cut in sandstone                   over the
top ;  but the marble       portions are crumbling         into sand, though the
structure faces the east, and is protected from vertical rain by arch
ing mason-work.          A small portion of      the marble     retaining its crust
was boiled in Canada          balsam, and was then sliced at a right angle
to its original      polished surface.        By this    means a section       of the
crumbled marble was obtained, which could be compared with one
of the perfectly fresh stone         (see fig. B).   From the dark outer amor
phous crust, with its carbonaceous and other miscellaneous                  particles,
fine rifts could be seen passing down between the separated calcite
granules,   which in many        cases were    quite isolated.     The black crust
descends into these rifts, and likewise passes along the cleavage planes
of the granules.       Towards the outer surface of the stone, immediately
beneath    the    crust,   the fissures    arc chiefly filled    with   a yellowish
structureless     substance,     which gave a feeble glimmering reaction
with polarised light, and enclosed minute amorphous                 aggregates    like
portions of the crust.          It  probably consists      chiefly of sulphate of
lime.    But   the most remarkable feature          in  the slide was the way        in
which the calcite granules had been corroded.                 Seen with     reflected
light they resembled those surfaces of spar which have been placed
in weak hydrochloric acid          to lay bare enclosed       crj'stals of zeolites.
The solution had         taken place partly along the outer surfaces, so as
to produce    the fine passages or rifts, and partly along the cleavage.
Deep    cavities,   defined    by intersecting cleavage planes, appeared to
descend into the heart of some of the granules.                 In   no case    did   I
observe   any white pellicle such           as might indicate a re-deposit of

lime from the dissolved carbonate.                                Except        for tbo veinings of
probable sulphate just referred                         to, the lime, when once dissolved,
had apparently been wholly removed in solution.                                   There was further
to be observed             a certain dirtiness, so to speak, which                           at the first
glance distinguished the section of crumbled marble from the fresh
stone.        This      was due partly to corrosion,                 but chiefly to the intro
duction of particles of soot and dust, which could bo traced among
the       interstices     and cleavage lamellae of the crystallino granules for
some distance back from the crust.
     It    may be inferred, therefore,                    that the         disintegration              of tho
marble is mainly due to the action of carbonic acid in tho permeat
ing rain-water, whereby the component crystalline granules                                             of the
stone are partially dissolved and their mutual adhesion                                     is destroyed.
This      process       goes on   in all      exposures       and    with       every variety           in the
thickness of the outer crust.                    It is    distinctly traceable in tombstones
that have not been erected for more than twenty years.                                             In    these
which have been standing for                        a   century it       is,   save   in exceptionally
sheltered positions, so far advanced                              that    a    very slight pressure
suffices to crumble the stone                    into powder.              But with this internal
disintegration we have to take into consideration the third phase of
weathering to which             I     have alluded.            In   the upright marble slabs                it
is   the union of tho two kinds of decay which                                 leads to so rapid an
effacement         of the monuments.
                                and Fracture.           — This                 remarkable phase of
   (3.) Curvature                                                   most
rock-weathering            is   only to be observed in the slabs of marble which
have       been firmly inserted into                a   solid framework of sandstone,                     and
placed in an erect or horizontal position.                           It    consists     in   the bulging
out of the marble accompanied                    with    a   series of fractures.            This      change
cannot be explained                  as    mere sagging           by gravitation, for         it       usually
appears       as   a   swelling up of the centre of the slab, which continues
until      the largo blister-liko expansion                  is   disrupted.          Nor    is   it   by any
means        exceptional    ;    it       occurs, as    a    rule, on all the older upright
marble tablets, and             is   only found to bo wanting in those                       cases where
the marble has evidently not been                            fitted tightly into its sandstone
frame.         Wherever there has been little or no room for expansion,
protuberance            of the marble           may be observed.                  Successive            stages
may be seen from the first gentle                        uprise to an unsightly swelling of
the whole stone.                This       change   is    accompanied            by fracture of tho

 526                            Proceedings           of the Royal Society
marble.             The rents in some cases proceed from the margin inwards,
more          particularly        from the upper and under edges of the stone,
pointing unmistakably                         to an    increase       in volume        as the cause    of
fracture.              In other    cases      the rents appear in the central part of the
swelling where the tension from curvature has been greatest.
        Some       exceedingly interesting examples                      of this singular process
of weathering are to be seen in Greyfriars' Churchyard.                                           On the
south wall, in the enclosure                      of      a    well-known     county family, there
is an oblong upright marble slab                          (Pl.     XVI., A,   measuring     30J inches
in height, by 22 § inches in breadth and   inch in thickness, and        J
facing west.  The last inscription on it bears the date 1838, at
which time,              of course, it was no doubt still smooth and upright.
Since then, however,                     it    has escaped from its fastenings on either
side, though still held firmly at the top and bottom.                                        It    conse
quently projects from the wall like a well-filled sail.                                      The axis
of curvature              is,   of course, parallel to the upper and lower margins,
and the amount of deviation from the original vertical line                                   is   fully
2i      inches, so that the hand and arm can be inserted between                                      the
curved            marble and the perfectly vertical and undisturbed wall to
which        it    was fixed.       At the lower              end of the slab a minor curvature
to the extent of ^th of an inch     observable, coincident with the
                                                              is
longer axis of the stone. In both cases the direction of the bending
has been determined                  by the position of the enclosing solid frame
of sandstone             which resisted           the internal          expansion of the marble.
Freed from its fastenings at either side the stone had assumed a
simple wave-like curve.                        T!ut the tension has become so great that
a   series of rents             has appeared          along the crest of the fold.                One of
these has          a   breadth of    ^th of       an inen a* its opening.*               Not only has
the slab been ruptured, but its crust has likewise yielded to the
strain, and has broken up into                        a   network of cracks, and some of the
isolated          portions are beginning to curl up at the edges, exposing the
crumbling decayed marble below.                           I        should add that such has been
the expansive             force     of the marblo that the part of the sandstone
block in the upper part of the frame, exposed to the direct pressure,
has begun to exfoliate, though elsewhere the stone                                is   quite sound.
    *
        It  further curious fact that the slab measures
             isa                                        inch more in breadth  4
across the centre, where     has had room to expand, than at the top, where
                                    it                                                                it
has been tightly jammed between the sandstone slabs.

     More advanced stages of curvature and fracture may be noticed
on many other tombstones               in the     same burying-place.             One of the
most conspicuous of these has a peculiar interest from the fact that
it   occurs on the tablet erected            to   the       memory of one of the most
illustrious    dead whose        dust lies within the precincts of the Grey-
friars — the      great Joseph     Black.         He died in 1799.            In the     centre
of the sumptuous tomb raised                  over his grave is inserted a largo
upright slab of white           marble,     which, facing south, is protected from
the weather partly by heavy overhanging masonry and partly by
a high stone          wall immediately        to the west.            On this slab   a     Latin
inscription records with pious reverence the genius and achievements
of   the discoverer of carbonic acid               and latent heat ; and adds, that
his friends wished to mark his resting-place                         by the marble whilst
it should     last.     Less than eighty years, however,                   have   sufficed     to
render the inscription already partly illegible.                      The stone, still firmly
held all round its margin, has bulged out considerably in the centre,
and on the blister-like expansion has been rent by numerous cracks
which run, on the whole, in the direction of the length of the stone.
     A   further stage of decay is exhibited by a remarkable tomb on the
west wall of the Greyfriars' Churchyard (PI. XVI., B). The marble
slab, bearing a now almost wholly eflaced inscription, on which the
date 1779 can be seen, is         still held tightly within its enclosing frame
of sandstone slabs,          which are firmly built into the wall    But it has
swollen out into a ghastly protuberance in the centre, and                           is,   more
over, seamed with rents which                  strike inwards from the margins.
In this and in           some    other examples              the    marble seems to have
undergone most change on the top of the swelling, partly from the
system of fine fissures           by which        it   is   broken up, and partly from
more direct and effective            access of rain.               Eventually the cohesion
of tho stone at that part              is   destroyed,       and the crumbling marble
falls out, leaving        a    hole in the middle of the slab.                    When       this
takes place        disintegration      proceeds         rapidly.        Three years ago      I
sketched      a   tomb in this stage on the east wall of Canongato Church
yard (Pl. XVL, C).   In recent visit to the place
                                   a                                     I   found that tho
whole of the marble had since fallen out.
     The first cause that naturally suggests itself in explanation of tho
remarkable change in the structure of                   a    substance,    usually regarded
as so inelastic,        is   the action of frost.             White statuary marble            is

528                Proceedings         of the Royal Society
naturally    porous.       It  is rendered     still   more  so   by that internal
solution which     I   have    described.      The marble      tombstones     in our
graveyards are, therefore, capable              of imbibing      a relatively    large
amount of moisture.            When this interstitial         water is frozen, its
expansive    force, as   it  passes into the solid state, must increase            the
isolation of the granules and augment              the dimensions of a marble
block.    I am   inclined to believe that this must               be the   principal
cause of the change.          Whatever may be the nature            of  the process
it is evidently       one    which     acts  from within the marble itself.
Microscopic examination fails to discover any chemical transforma
tion which would account for the expansion.                  Dr Angus Smith        has
pointed out that in towns the mortar of walls may be observed                       to
swell up and lose cohesion           from a conversion of its lime into the
condition    of sulphate.         I  have already mentioned that           sulphate
does exist within the substance          of the marble, but that its quantity,
so far as  I have   observed,     is too small to bo taken into account             in
this question.     The expansive power is exerted               in such   a way as
not sensibly to affect the internal structure and composition of the
stone.   And this      I imagine is most probably the work of frost.
   The results of my observations            among      our burial-grounds      show
that,  save   in exceptionally        sheltered     situations, slabs    of marble,
exposed to the weather in such a climate and atmosphere                   as that   of
Edinburgh,     are entirely destroyed         in  less than a century.       Where
this destruction takes place by simple comparatively rapid superficial
solution and removal of the stone, the rate of lowering of the surface
amounts    sometimes      to about    a third of an inch (or roughly 9         milli
metres)  in  a century.       Where it is effected by internal displacement,
a curvature of 2    J  inches,   with abundant        rents, a partial effacement
of the inscription, and a reduction of the marble                to a pulverulent
condition, may be produced in about forty years, and a total dis
ruption and effacement          of the stone       within   one hundred.       It   is
evident that white marble is here utterly unsuited for out of door
use, and that its employment for really fine works of art which are
meant to stand in the open air          in  such a climate     ought to be strenu
ously resisted.     Of   course   I am now referring, not to the durability
of marble     generally, but to its behaviour in a large town with a
moist climate and plenty of coal-smoke.
   II.  Sandstones       and     Flagstones. — These, being          the   common

                      of Edinburgh,         Session 1879-80.                         529
building     materials   of the country, are of most             frequent occurrence
as monumental stones.            Where properly selected             they are remark
ably durable.       By far    the best varieties        are those    which     consist of
a nearly pure fine siliceous         sand,   with little     or no iron or lime, and
without trace of bedding structure.               Some of our sandstones          contain
98 per cent. of silica.       A   good illustration of their power of resisting
the weather is supplied by Alexander                 Henderson's tomb in Grey-
friars' Churchyard.         He died in 1646, and a few years afterwards
the present tombstone,         in  the form of a solid square            block of free
stone, was erected at his grave.             It   was ordered       to bo defaced      in
 1662 by command          of the Scottish Parliament, but after 1688 it was
repaired.      Certain Indict marks upon the stone are pointed out as
those of the soldiery sent to execute the order.                  Be this as it may,
the original chisel marks on the polished surface                    of the stone are
still perfectly distinct,        and    the   inscribed lettering remains           quite
sharp.      Two hundred years havo effected hardly any chango                       upon
the stone,      save    that on      the   west and north           sides,    which   arc
those    most   exposed      to wind       and    rain,    the surfaco     is somewhat
roughened,     and tho     internal line parallel jointing begins               to  show
itself.
    Three obvious causes of decay in arenaceous                  rocks may be traced
among our monuments.              In   the first place, tho presence of a soluble
or easily removable        matrix in which tho sand grains are embedded.
The most common kinds of matrix are clay, carbonates                        of lime and
iron,    and the anhydrous            and hydrous          peroxides of iron.        Tho
presence of the iron reveals itself by its yellow, brown, or red colour.
So rapid is disintegration          from this cause that the sharply incised
date of a monument erected             in Greyfriars' Church          to an officer who
died only in 1863 is no longer legible.                   At  least  Jth of an inch of
surface has here been removed            from    a portion of the slab in 10 years,
or at the rate of about three quarters             of an inch in a century.
   In   the second     place,   where a sandstone            is  marked by distinct
laminae     of stratification, it is nearly certain to split up along these
lines under the action of tho weather,               if  the surface of tho bedding
planes    is directly exposed.          This   is well      known     to builders, who
are quite aware      of  the importance of          "laying     a stone     on its bed."
Examples may be observed              in our churchyards         where    sandstones   of
 this character have been used for pilasters and ornamental                    work and
        vol. x.                                                               3 T

530               Proceedings        of the Royal Society
where the stone, set on its edge, has peeled off              in   successive  layers.
In   flagstones,   which     are   merely thinly bedded             sandstones,    this
minute lamination is often fatal to durability.                 These stones,    from
the large size in which slabs of them can be obtained,                 and from the
ease  with which they can bo worked, form a tempting material for
monumental inscriptions.            The melancholy result of trusting                to
their permanence       is strikingly     shown by       a tombstone      at the end
of the south burying-ground in Greyfriars' Churchyard.                      The date
inscribed on it is 1841, and the lettering that remains is as sharp
as  if  cut only recently.       The stone weathers very little by surface
disintegration.     It   is a laminated flagstone           set on edge, and large
portions have scaled off, leaving           a   rough,    raw surface      where the
inscription   once ran.      In this    instance    a  thickness of about ^rd of
an inch has been removed          in forty years.
   In  the third place, where a sandstone contains concretionary masses
of different composition or texture from the main portion of the
stone, these are apt to weather at a different rate.                 Sometimes they
resist destruction better than the sim'ounding sandstone                  so as to be
left as permanent      excrescences.       More commonly they present              less
resistance, and are therefore       hollowed out into irregular and often
exceedingly fantastic shapes.          Examples of this kind of weathering
abound in our neighbourhood.              Perhaps the most curious to which
a date can be assigned       are to be found in the two sandstone              pillars,
which     until recently flanked       the    tomb of Principal Carstares            in
Greyfriars' Churchyard.        They were erected some time after the year
 1715.     Each of them is formed of           a single    block of stone about       8
feet long.     Exposure to the air for about 150 years has allowed the
original differences of texture or composition to make their influence
apparent.     Each column is hollowed out for almost its entire length
on the exposed side into         a  trough     4 to 6 inches       deep and 6 to 8
inches    broad.    As they     lean   against     the   wall,    beneath    the new
pillars which have supplanted them, they suggest some rude form
of canoe rather than portions of         a  sepulchral monument.
    Where    concretions    are of    a pyritous       kind their decomposition
gives rise to sulphuric acid, some         of which combines with the iron
and gives rise to dark stains upon the corroded                surface of the stone.
Some     of the sandstones        of the district, full of such impurities,
ought never      to   be   employed       for architectural purpose&            Every

 block of storm in which they occur should bo unhesitatingly con
demned.      Want of attention         to this obvious rule      has led to the
unsightly disfigurement of public buildings.
    IIL    Granites. — In Professor Pfaffs           experiments,     to which    I
have already referred, he employed plates              of syenite    and granite,
both rough and polished.         Ho found that they had all lost slightly in
weight at the end of a year.       Tho annual rate of loss was estimated by
him as equal to 0-0076 mm. from the unpolished, and 0'0085 from tho
polished granite.      That   a polished surface of granite should weather
more rapidly than a rough one is perhaps             hardly what might have
 been expected.      The same obsorver remarks, that though tho polished
surface of syenite was     still bright   at the end of not more that three
years,  it was less so than at first; and     in particular, that some figures
indicating the date, which he had         written on it with a diamond, had
become entirely effaced.        Granite has been employed for too short           a
time as a monumental stone in our cemeteries               to afford    any ready
means of measuring even           appproximately       its rate of weathering.
Traces of decay in some of its felspar crystals may be detected,               yet
in no   case that  I  have seen is the decay of a polished granite surface
sensibly apparent after exposure for fifteen or twenty years.                 That
the polish   will disappear, and that the surface        will gradually   roughen
as the individual     component     crystals are more or less easily attacked
by the weather, is of course sufficiently evident.              Even    the  most
durable granite will probably be far surpassed               in  permanence     by
the best of our siliceous sandstones.          But    as yet the    data   do not
exist for making any satisfactory comparison             between   them.
    [Note added 21st May 1880.              Since the preceding paper was
written,   I have had an opportunity of examining the condition of
the monumental stones in the graveyards            of  a  number of towns and
villages in the north-east     of Scotland, where tho population is sparse
and where      comparatively little coal-smoke          passes into the atmos
phere.     The marble tablets       last  longer there     than in Edinburgh,
but show everywhere indications of decay.               They appear to   "bo quite
free  from the black       or   grey   sulphate-crust.      They suffer    chiefly
from superficial erosion, but      I  observed a few cases of curvature and
and fracture.     As    a contrast   to the universal decay of the marble
tombstones,    reference may be made to the          remarkable durability of
the clay-slate which      has been employed for monumental purposes

   scattered     cubes of pyrites,       and capable of being readily dressed into
   thin smooth        slabs.     A    tombstone        of this material, erected in the

  round each cube or kernel of pyrites, but its general smooth surface
  is not affected.         The lapso of nearly a century has produced scarcely
  any change upon this stone, while neighbouring tablets                               of white

 to 25°      C,    but not yet in a permanent                  form.        The slight      trials
 I  have     been able      to make with          it give     promise      that, in respect to
 sensibility      and convenience            for practical       use,    it will most       satis
 factorily fulfil all       expectations,        and have given some experience                 in
 respect      to   the   overcoming of difficulties               of    construction,       from
 which the following              instructions       are   suggested        as   likely to      be
 useful to any one who may desire to make such an instrument                              : —
     (1.)   The sulphurous acid steam thermometer                          might     moro    pnv
perly be called         a cryometer        than a thermometer,             because    it is not
very convenient,          except     for measuring temperatures                lower than the
atmospheric        temperature        at the place and time of observation ; for,
it   must     be remarked,        that the       thermometric substance, that is to
say, the infinitesimal layer of              liquid    and steam        of sulphurous acid
at the      interfiiee between           the    two in the        bulb      in the annexed
drawing (fig. 1), must be at a lower temperature                             than any other
part of the space of bulb and tube between                           it   and    the  mercury

 surface     in   the shorter vertical column.                  It   is satisfactory, however,
 that the       instrument          is really      not needed for temperatures                    above
 + 10°     C,     because for such            the water steam-pressure             thermometer,
 represented        in      the first of the three        diagrams          of
 my former communication, has ample sensibility
 for most practical               purposes.        Hence, instead of
 the range up to 25° C. in the instrument already
 realised,    and the great length of tube (295 centi
 metres      for the long vertical branch) which it
requires,     I   propose         in future to let +      10°      be the
superior limit of the temperatures                   to be measured
by an ordinary sulphurous acid steam                            thermo
meter.       For this,           the long vertical branch need
not     be more          than      175   centimetres;         thus the                              -to'
instrument is much more easily made, and when                                                      -15"

 fluid less volatile than sulphurous acid, proceed                   as  follows  : — Apply
 heat at    T   and   in   the bend   next    T until     the   liquid     leaves that part
 of the enclosure and stands nearly at                a level in the short and long
 vertical branch, the instrument being held with                     A   down.      Apply    a
 freezing mixture to           T, taking    care not to cool        it  to quite as low a
 temperature        as    -11° C. f   so   that the pressure           of the sulphurous
 acid liquid and steam may remain                    something above the external
 atmospheric         pressure.     Occasionally        open    the     stop-cock     L   very
 slightly   to prevent the liquid from being drawn np the short vertical
 branch through preponderance                of temperature         in the long vertical
 branch.        Continue this until about          a centimetre      of liquid has been
 distilled     over into the bulb        T.    Then      open the       stop-cock    L  very
 carefully until all the liquid in the two vertical branches is blown
 out, leaving that which has been distilled over into the bulb T, and
 then close      L  again.
     (6.) Then dip the end E under pure mercury, and by opening L
 very gently and warming the free surface of tho liquid sulphurous
 acid,   let   gas   escape bubbling       up    through the mercury.               Close  L
 again before or when the quantity of liquid                 in   tho bulb at     T   begins
 to bo perceptibly diminished.              Then apply       a freezing      mixture to    T
 until mercury is drawn in.            Incline      the instrument with          A up and
L    down,      and watch until the mercury is drawn up to A, then
incline with        A   down and let     a  little   more mercury         come in.     Then
 close  L. Lastly) keeping T still in tho                freezing     mixture, melt tho
glass   below L till it collapses and blows              the mercury down, leaving
Torricellian       vacuum      at the   sealed     end.     The instrument is now
complete       and ready for use.

     This     thernioscope                 is founded               on       the      change             produced in the
magnetic              moment           of    a steel           magnet            by        change        of temperature.
Several different forms suggest themselves : the one which seems
best adapted to give good r,sults is to be made as follows :—
     (1.)     Prepare an approximately astatic                                        system          of two thin, har
dened steel wires,                 t   h,   / V,          each     1    cm. long, one of them,                        ;- b,    hung
by     a     single        silk    fibre,        and the other hung bifilarly                                   from          it,   by
fibres       about         3   cms. long,                so attached              that the projections of the
two, on           a   horizontal plane, shall                          be    inclined at an angle of about
"01    ofradian (or -57°) to one another.

      (3.)    Magnetise the two wires to very                                              exactly equal magnetic
moments               in the         dissimilar directions.                           This       is   easily         done      by    a
few successive                 trials, to make them rest as nearly                                         as    possible per
pendicular to the magnetic meridian.

means, to the highest for which glass remains solid.                       This,  I believe,
may be done by avoiding                  the objectionable expedient adopted              by
Pouillet    and Regnault, of allowing                 a portion     (when high tempera
tures are to be measured the greater portion) of the whole gas to be
pressed     into   a  cool volumetric chamber,                 out of the thermometric
chamber      proper,     by the expansion of the portion which remains
in   ;  and    instead fulfilling the condition, stated, but pronounced
practically impossible, by Regnault                   (" Experiences," vol i. pp. 168,
 169), that the thermometric gas
                                                " shall like the mercury of a mercury
thermometer        be   allowed to expand freely at constant pressure                    in a
calibrated reservoir maintained throughout at one temperature."                              I
have     accordingly designed             a constant      pressure    gas thermometer to
fulfil this condition.            It is represented      in the accompanying drawing,
and described        in the following extract from the article referred to: —
     The vessel containing the thermometric fluid, which in this case
is to be either hydrogen or nitrogen,* consists in the main of a glass
bulb and tube placed               vertically     with bulb up and mouth down ;
but there is to be         a secondary         tube of much finer bore opening into
the bulb or into the main tube                   near its top, as may be found most
convenient in any particular                  case.    The main tube which, to dis
tinguish it from the secondary                   tube,   will   be called the volumetric
tube, is to be of largo bore, not less than 2 or 3 centimetres,                       and is
to bo ground internally              to a  truly cylindric form.          To allow this to
be done      it must    be made of thick, well-annealed glass like that                    of
the French        glass-barrelled         air-pumps.       The secondary       tube,  which
    *                                                                                      its
       Common air is inadmissible, because even at ordinary temperatures
oxygen attacks mercury,             The film of oxide thus formed would be very incon
venient at the surface of the mercury caulking, round the base of the piston,
and on the inner surface of the glass tube to which it would adhere.                 Besides,
sooner or later the whole quantity of oxygen in the air must be diminished to
a sensible degree by the loss of the part of it which combines with the mercury.
 So far as we know,         Pegnault did not complain of this evil in his nse of
 common     air in his normal air thermometer              nor in his experiments on the
 expansion of air (" Experiences," vol. i.), though probably it has vitiated his
 results to some sensible degree.          But he found it to produce such great irregu
larities when, instead of common air, he experimented on pure oxygen, that
 from the results he could draw no conclusion              as to the expansion    of this gas
 ("  Experiences,"    vol.  i. p.  77).  Another    reason for  the avoidance of air or other
 gas containing free oxygen is to save the oil or other liquid which is inter
posed between it and the mercury of the manometer from being thickened or
 otherwise altered by oxidation.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                               541
will    be called the manometrie capillary, is to be of round bore, not
very fine, say from half a millimetre to                 a
millimetre diameter.             Its lower     end is to
be connected         with   a mercury manometer
to show       if the   pressure of the thermome-
tric air is either greater           or less than the
definite       pressure    to    which it is to be
brought every time a thermometric mea
surement         is   made     by the instrument.
The change of volume required to do this
for every       change of temperature           is made
 and measured          by means of a micrometer
 screw*lifting or lowering a long solid glass
 piston, fitting easily in the glass tube, and
 caulked air-tight by mercury between                  its
 lower end         and    an     iron    sole-plate    by
 which the mouth of the volumetric tube
 is    closed.       To perform this            mercury
 caulking, when the piston is raised and
 lowered, mercury is allowed to flow in                    -
 and out through          a  hole in the iron sole-
 plate by an iron pipe, connected with two
 mercury cisterns at two different levels by
 branches each provided with a stopcock.
 When        the    piston    is    being    raised   the
  stopcock of the branch leading to                   the
  lower cistern is closed, and the other is
  opened enough to allow the mercury to flow up after the piston and
     * This screw is to be    so well fitted  in the iron sole-plate as to be sufficiently
  mercury-tight without        the   aid   of any soft material, under such moderate
  pressure as the greatest it will experience when the pressure chosen for the
  thermometric gas is not more than a few centimetres above the external
  atmospheric pressure.        When the same plan of apparatus is used for investiga
  tion of the expansion of gasses under high pressures, a greased leather washer
  may be used on the upper side of the screw-hole in the sole-plate, to prevent
  mercury from escaping round the screw.            It is to be remarked that in no case
  will a little oozing out of the mercury round the screw while it is being turned
   introduce any error at all into the thermometric result ; because the correct
   ness of the measurement of the volume of the gas depends simply on the
   mercury being brought up into contact with the bottom of the piston, and not
   more than just perceptibly up between the piston and volumetric tube
   surrounding it.

  press gently on its lower side, without entering more than                      infinitesi-
  mally into the space between it and the surrounding                            glass tube
  (the condition of the upper bounding surface of the mercury                         in this
 respect    being easily seen by the observer looking at it through the
 glass tube).      \Vhen the piston is being lowered, the stopcock in the
 branch leading from the upper cistern is closed,                       and the one         in
 the branch leading to the           lower cistern is opened enough to let the
 mercury go down before the piston, instead of being forced to any
 sensible    distance into the space between it and the surrounding tube,
 but not enough to allow it to part company with the lower surface
 of the piston.       The manomet er is simply a mercury barometer of the
 form commonly called a siphon barometer, with                       its lower end not
 open to the air but        connected     to the lower end of the manometric
 capillar}".    This connection       is made below the level of the mercury
 in  the following      manner.       The lower end of the capillary widens
 into a small glass bell or stout tube of glass of about                     2  centimetres
 bore    and   2 centimetres       depth, with its lip ground flat like the
receiver of an air-pump.           The lip or upper edge of the open cistern
of the barometer         (that is to say, the cistern which would be open
 to the atmosphere were it used as an ordinary barometer) is also
ground flat,      and    the two lips are pressed together                with a greased
leather washer          between     them     to  obviate risk of             breaking the
glass,    and to     facilitate the making           of the     joint mercury tight.
To keep this joint perennially good, and to make quite sure that
no air shall ever leak in, in case of the                             interior pressure
being at any time less than the external barometric                             pressure   or
being      arranged     to   be   so    always,    it is    preserved        and caulked
by     an    external    mercury       jacket    not    shown       in      the    drawing.
The       mercury     in   the   thus      constituted      lower reservoir of            the
manometer       is above the level of the leather             joint, and the        space  in
 the upper part of the reservoir over                the   surface     of the mercury,
up to a little distance          into    the capillary       above,     is    occupied by
a fixed oil       or some      other practically         vapourless        liquid.      This
oil    or  other liquid is introduced             for the      purpose        of guarding
against     error in the       reckoning      of the whole bulk of the ther-
mometric       gas,   on    account     of   slight    irregular       changes       in the
capillary depression         of the border of the mercury surface                     in the
reservoir.

                         of Edinburgh,              Session 1879-80-                                     543
  In    the most accurate use of the instrument, the glass and mercury
and oil of the manometer                are all kept at one definite temperature,
according to some convenient                        and perfectly trustworthy                  intrinsic
thermoscope,          hy means of thermal appliances                     not represented            in the
drawing hut easily imagined.                    This condition heing fulfilled,                    the one
desired pressure            of the thermometric             gas    is attained with                exceed
ingly minute accuracy hy working the micrometer screw                                               up or
down until the oil is brought precisely to a mark npon the                                          mano-
metric capillary.
   In   fact,    if   the glass and mercury and oil are all kept rigorously at
one     constant temperature,              the       only   access        for error          is through
irregular variations in the capillary depressions                          in the borders of the
mercury surfaces.                With   so large       a diameter          as the 2 centimetres
chosen    in     the figured dimensions of the drawing, the error from this
causo can hardly             amount to          T      per cent. of the whole pressure,
supposing this to be one atmo or thereabouts.
   For ordinary             uses of      this       constant-pressure            gas    thermometer,
where the most minute accuracy is not needed, the rule will still be
to bring the oil to a fixed mark on the manometric capillary                                         ;   and
 no precaution         in   respect     to temperature            will   he necessary except to
 secure that      it   is approximately uniform throughout the mercury and
 containing glass, from lower to higher level of the mercury.                                            The
 quantity of oil is         so   small that, whatever its temperature                       may be, the
 bringing of its free surface to a fixed mark on the capillary secures
 that the mercury surface below the oil in the lower reservoir is very
 nearly     at    one Constant          point        relatively to the glass, much                       more
 nearly so than it could be made by direct observation of the mercury
 surface, at all events             without         optical magnifying                power.        Now        if
 the mercury surface be at a constant point of the glass, it is easily
 proved that the deference                 of pressures           between         the two mercury
 surfaces    will      bo constant,     notwithstanding considerable                       variations of
 the common temperature                 of the mercury and glass, provided a certain
 easy condition is fulfilled, through which the effect of the expansion
 of the glass is compensated               by the expansion               of the mercury.                This
 condition is, that the whole volume of the mercury shall bear to the
 volume in the cylindric vertical tube from the upper surface to the
 level of the lower surface the ratio of (X - ^                            tr)   to   (X   - c),   where       X
 denotes the cubic expansion of the mercury and                            cr    the cubic expansion

for simplicity of statement         that the tube is truly cylindric from the
upper surface to the level        of the lower surface, and that the sectional
area of the tube is the same at the two mercury surfaces.                 The cubic
expansion       of    mercury    is approximately        seven    times   the cubic

that is to say, the volume from the lower surface in the bend to the
same level in the        vertical branch is to be       \   of the volume in the
vertical     tube above this surface.           A   special   experiment on each
tube is easily made to rind           the quantity      of mercury that must be
put in to cause the pressure            to  be absolutely constant when the
Surface in the lower reservoir is kept at a fixed point relatively                   to
the glass, and when the temperature            is varied through such moderate
differences    of temperature     as are to be found in the use       of the instru
ment at different times and seasons.
    A sheet-iron      can containing      water or oil or fusible metal,          with
external thermal appliances of gas or charcoal furnace, or low-pressure
or high-pressure steam heater,            and   with proper internal stirrer or
stirrers,   is fitted round the bulb and manomctric tube to produce
uniformly throughout the mass of the thermometric gas the tempera
ture   to be measured.          This part of the apparatus,          which will be
called    for brevity the heater, must not extend so far down                      the
manometric tube that when raised to its highest temperature                    it  can
warm the caulking mercury to as high               a temperature     as 40°   C,   be
cause     at somewhat      higher temperatures        than this the pressure         of
vapour of mercury begins to be perceptible, and would vitiate the
thermometric         use   of  the   pure     hydrogen      or   nitrogen    of    our
thermometer.         To secure sufficient coolness       of the mercury       it will
probably be advisable to have an open glass jacket of cold water
(not shown         in the drawing)       round the volumetric        tube,   2   or 3
centimetres      below the bottom of the heater, and reaching to about
half  a centimetre      above   the highest position of the bottom of the
piston.

gas thermometer        which wo have now described            may give even        moro
accurate thermometry than Regnault's               constant-volume air thermo
meters, and      it  seems certain that     it will   he much more easily used
in  practice.
   We    have     only to remark hero further that,           if Boyle's law       were
rigorously     fulfilled,   thermometry       by the two methods            would     bo
identical, provided the scale in each          case   is graduated      or calculated
so as to make the numerical reckoning of the temperature                       agree at
two points, — for      example,   0° C. and 100" C.          The very close agree
ment which Regnault found among                 his different    gas   thermometers
and his air thermometers            with air of different densities,           and tho
close approach       to rigorous fulfilment     of Boyle's law which he and
other experimenters          have   ascertained    to be presented        by air and
other gases used in his thermometers,            through the ranges of density,
pressure,    and temperature      at which they were used          in  these thermo
meters,    renders      it certain that in reality        the   diflerenco     between
Regnault's       normal     air  thermometry        and    thermometry         by    our
hydrogen      gas constant-pressure        thermometer       must be exceedingly
small.    It    is therefore    satisfactory to know that for all practical
purposes absolute         temperature     is to be obtained with           very    great
accuracy    from Regnault's thermometric system by simply adding 273
to his numbers for temperature               on   the   centigrade      scale.    It  is
probable that at the temperatures              of 270° or 300°         C   (or 532 or
573 absolute)       the greatest deviation of temperature            thus reckoned,
from correct absolute        temperature,    is not more than half a degree.

despiseJ.     The    number of such             stars     is great,      the   number     of
observers    small.
    Next in    order    comes the size and shape                of the earth.       A rela
tively small difference in our position on the earth's surface makes
a  notable difference      on the apparent          position of the moon, and, in
consequence,      on tho time of the occultation              ;  even the height of the
observer    above the      level of the       sea    has its influence.          This may
bo well studied in the present instance                 ;  viewed from our latitude,
the moon was seen to pass a little to the south of the planet Mars,
whereas in the southern counties of England an occultation was seen.
The oblateness of the earth has also to be taken into account.                            In
the present instance        calculations made         as  if  the earth were spherical,
would give the disappearance             some eighteen          seconds earlier than the
above.      Hence observations made on these phenomena                         from places
in different latitudes          afford   a  means      for determining the earth's
 oblateness.
    But, lastly, these observations are all deranged                      by the extreme
jaggedness     of the moon's edge.           This   jaggedness        is well seen   during
 nn eclipse   of the sun      ;  it  is also conspicuous against             the disc   of a
 planet.    I  recollect    of witnessing an occultation of Saturn, some
 half a   century ago, during which the corner of                 a  lunar mountain was
 projected against the planet in such              a  way    ns to     cut out a sector    of
 about one-third of the surface.               Irregularities        of such magnitude
 cause serious variations         in  the times    of disappearance          and reappear
 ance  ;  and, for the purpose          of estimating their possible              extent,  it
 might be useful to make concerted                    observations       at places    a  few
 miles apart, so that the appulso may happen, here on the top of a
 lunar mountain, there in the hollow.

         Substances, and on a new                 form of Telephone Receiver.
         By James Blyth, M.A.
    In former      papers    laid before      this Society,        I   showed that when
 any two metals       are rubbed against each other, a current of electri
 city is produced     ;  and that this current agrees              in direction with the
  thermo-electric current for the same two metals,                         and is greater,
  approximately at least, in proportion               as   the metals       rubbed are far

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                            549
apart on the thermo-electric scale, — the greatest current, as far as                                 I
have yet observed, being got from antimony and bismuth.
     It    is very difficult to decide           as    to the cause or causes of such
currents.  They may be (1) purely thermo-electric; (2) the cur
rents, which are the supposed cause of friction ; (3) currents pro
duced by contact force between                   adhering films of air, moisture,                    or
other substances        with which the surfaces                    rubbed are tarnished          ;   or
(4) they may arise from all these causes combined.                               The following
experiments were made in hopes of getting some information on these
points.
     My first experiment         was to obtain the                 exact difference,      as   far   as
the       production    of a momentary                 current is concerned,              between
rubbing two pieces of metal together, and knocking the one against
the other.        For this      purpose     I    repeated, with greater                care, an ex
periment which         I    formerly described.               It   consisted     in attaching         a
wire firmly to an ordinary hammer,                          and leading it to one of the
terminals of a telephone                circuit, while the wire from the other
terminal was rigidly attached to                 a    stiff bar of copper held vertically
in    a small table vice.            When   the face of the hammer was rubbed
against the end of the copper bar,                    a   very distinct grating noise was
always heard in the receiving telephone                       f   but the sound was almost
inaudible when the bar was knocked by the hammer,                                 if   proper caro
were taken not to combine                rubbing with knocking.                   This     is,   how
ever, so difficult practically, that             it    is   just    possible   that the sounds
which     I   heard are due to faint rubs accompanying the knocking.
      Should     this not be the         case,       however,         this difference     of effect
seems to show that the currents are not wholly, although they may
be mainly, thermo-electric, as            it     is   hard to believe that the heat pro
duced at the junction            of the surfaces by               a   smart blow can be less
than that produced by            a    faint rub.          Granting that the knocking                 is
actually heard,        it   seems not     unlikely that this effect may be due to
the currents associated              with rapid changes of form in matter.    As
has        remarked by Professor Tait (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin. vol.
          been
ix. p. 552), these currents are such as would be capable of detection
by the telephone.
      In   order to detect what effect,          if    any, the presence of the air had
 upon these friction currents,           I       employed the apparatus                 commonly
 called the electric          egg.     Having         unscrewed          the   interior    balls,    I

  550                 Proceedings         of the Royal Society
 fastened    in their    places two metallic strips,         one  of   copper and    the
 other of iron, so arranged           that they could be made to rub against
 each other by moving the upper rod up and down                        in its air-tight
 socket.     Before being fixed on, the metal              surfaces    were both   well
 cleaned    by scraping.         "When     this apparatus      was   included in the
 circuit either of a galvanometer            or telephone,    no difference   could be
 detected either in the deflection           or the sound produced,        by exhaust
 ing the air, as far as could be done, with an ordinary good air-pump.
 It is possible,    however,      that there may bo films of air adhering to
 the metals which cannot           bo removed       by pumping.         Indeed, in the
 whole of this inquiry, the great difficulty is to be sure of what are
 the surfaces that are in contact.
    Having      ascertained     that the current produoed           by the friction of
 antimony and bismuth is of some strength, and fairly constant when
 the friction is constant,      I proceeded      to make a small dynamo machine
 for producing currents on this principle.                It  consists   of a cylinder
 of antimony       3 inches    long and 2£ inches in diameter, mounted on
 an   axis which       runs in centres.           By a fly-wheel and band this
 cylinder is driven rapidly round against a plate of bismuth pressed
 tight against it by      a stiff spring.       Wires   are led from the plate        of
 bismuth and from one of the pivots on which the cylinder revolves
 to two binding        screws, which form the electrodes              of the machine.
 When this       machine     is included in the circuit with a microphone
 transmitter and a telephone,           the current from      it can be used for the
 transmission of musical sounds              and even loud speaking.          There is,
 however,     heard along     with    the transmitted       sound the noise arising
from the friction of the antimony and bismuth.                     I  have   succeeded
in transmitting, in this way, very distinctly, tunes played on a violin
to which a microphone was attached.                   It   is very curious,     in this
experiment, to hear          so   distinctly     the music,     notwithstanding     the
friction    noise which      accompanies        it.  It  is to be noticed that the
sound heard in the telephone             of the rubbing of two pieces of metal
together     in   a distant room is an effect precisely identical               to this.
In this   case the rubbing         produces    the current, and the more or less
loose   contact     of the metals         acts as the microphone whereby the
sound is transmitted through means of that current to the telephone.
    I have    also tried, with varying success, several other forms of this
friction   current-producer.         In   one of the most effective of these the

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              551
rubbing    substances       are arranged     like  a pair of mill-stones, the lower
stone being a disc of iron laid horizontally, and the upper a disc of
copper mounted on a vertical axis on which it can revolve.                          The
surfaces are kept pressing against each other by a strong spring.
"When the upper disc is made to revolve rapidly,                     a  very decided
current is produced          ; and this    I found to be markedly increased, as
indicated by the telephone, by feeding in between the discs powdered
antimony and bismuth combined.                    Of  course we have     hero a series
of rapid   reversals of the current,          as the  direction of the current      will
depend upon whether particles of antimony or particles of bismuth
are  in  contact with the lower plate.             This clearly indicates    a thermo
 electric effect  ;   and    I have  no   doubt that the effect will bo      increased
 by applying a means whereby the upper surface of the copper plate
 and the lower surface of the iron ono can bo kept cold by a freezing
 mixture.     As     yet, however,      I  have    not had time to try that.         In
 another form        I   took two cylinders, the one of antimony and tho
 other of bismuth, and placed              them together      end-wise,  the pressure
 between them being regulated by                a screw.    Tho antimony cylinder
 was kept stationary, and the bismuth made to revolve very rapidly
 against  it, so much so that both cylinders rapidly became hot.                   This
 also gave a pretty strong current.
    Seeing that the friction between metals does certainly produce an
 electric current, it seemed natural to inquire whether an electric
 current sent from         a   battery across the surface between         two metals
 would not modify the friction of the one against tho other.                     I have
 tried to test this in a variety of ways, and the results leave me in
 doubt whether to attribute tho indications which                I have    received to
 actual changes        in the friction    or to incipient fusion of portions of
 the surfaces together          by the heat produced by the current, or to an
 effect similar     to tho Trevelyan        rocker.    In  one experiment      I   made
 an inclined     plane      which carried a pair of parallel rails of copper
 about three quarters of an inch apart.               Tho rails were hinged at the
 lower end, so that the plane could be set at any angle with tho
 horizon.     It was so arranged         that the current from the battery could
 be sent up the ono rail, through any conductor laid across the two,
 and down the other rail.            The surfaces of the rails were made quite
 smooth.      When        a heavy piece of metal was laid across tho rails, tho
 angle   of repose was the same both when there was and was not a

 552                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
current passing.         It  was different,   however, when a light body, such
as a  sewing needle, was put on.             Then, when the current from three
Bunsen cells was passing, the plane could be elevated                   considerably
past the angle       of repose for no current, before             the needle  rolled
down.       On examination        I found that the needle was actually stick
ing to the copper        ;  but that, in almost all      cases,  this sticking gave
way without the angle being altered after the current had been taken
off for some time, and the needle and copper allowed to come back
to their normal temperature.             In another experiment        I  employed a
Bell   telephone    to enable me to detect any variation of friction when
a current was passing between the rubbing                surfaces.    To the centre
of the telephone disc was attached            a long narrow strip of light wood;
the object of making the strip so long being to remove the telephone
as  far as possible from the inductive action of the battery current
which was to be used.            To the other end of the strip was attached
a flat piece    of bismuth.         This   rested   on the convex surface      of  a
cylinder of antimony, which could be rapidly rotated.                   The battery
current was sent through the antimony and bismuth by entering the
antimony by the axis on which it revolved, and leaving the bismuth
by a spring pressing          tightly against it.      In  the battery circuit was
included the violin with its microphone already                     mentioned, and
the telephone     with the rod attached          was placed as the transmitting
telephone     in a telephone      circuit.    When    the antimony cylinder was
rapidly rotated,     a  listener in the receiving telephone          watched atten
tively   till his ear became accustomed           to the sound produced by the
rubbing, and transmitted along the wooden rod to the telephone disc.
The battery circuit was then joined, and the violin played, the anti
mony cylinder meanwhile rotating at the same rate as before.                     No
alteration in the sound was audible, which indicated no alteration in
the friction.     I   then substituted       a sharp    point for the flat piece of
bismuth, and immediately the violin sounds were faintly but clearly
heard.      This led     me to   think that    some sticking was produced by
the   fusing of the sharp          point, and more especially as the sound
became a little clearer as the rotation became very slow.
   Acting on this hint, it immediately occurred                to me that a receiv
ing telephone      could be constructed depending upon this effect.                I
therefore    took my bismuth cylinder and mounted it on a frame so

 and bands it was also made to rotate slowly.                       A phonograph      mouth?
  piece,  with     a very    thin disc of        wood or mica, was next placed, so
 that a fine wire with a sharp                point bent at       a  right angle, and with
 its other     end attached        to the centre of the disc just pressed with its
 sharp point on tho convex surface of the bismuth cylinder.                                 A
 current of four Eunsen cells was now passed through the wire and
 cylinder, and also through the violin microphone.                         When   the  violin
 was played the tune was heard                   faintly   proceeding     from the mouthT
 piece even when the bismuth cylinder                      was stationary.       This   arose
 simply from tho loose contact of the wire and bismuth.                          Tho sound
 was, however,         very greatly increased when the cylinder was rotated
 slowly, — so loud         indeed,     that it could be distinctly heard all over
 an    ordinary       room.      I   have     been     able   to transmit singing very
 clearly, but not speaking clearly enough                      to be understood.         This
 instrument         is analogous        to    tho    loud-speaking       telephone    of  Mr
 Edison    ;  but the explanation of their action must bo very different
 if  electrolysis, as is usually supposed, be the cause of the variation
in   the slipping of the platinum                 point on the chalk cylinder, which
is characteristic of Edison's instrument.                    Quite recently tho electro
lytic action       has been questioned,             and   a  different explanation given
by Professor Barret of Dublin.                     It  is evident that electrolysis can
in   no senso come into play when tho cylinder and rubbing point are
both metallic.           In  that   case   two probable explanations of the action
readily suggest themselves.                 The one is that there is more or less of
an actual      sticking of tho metals together, arising from their fusion
by the heat of the current.                If   this be so, then, the loose contact is
alternately made a very good one, and then one actually broken.                          The
other is the action of the Trevelyan                       rocker.     Here, however,     we
have clearly only an analogous,                  and not by any means an identical
effect.      In   the Trevelyan        rocker the heat passes from            a large   mass
of hot metal through two points of contact to                      a  cold block, whereas,
in    the  other      case    tho   heat     is   only produced        at the   surfaces   of
separation, the temperature               of the rest of the metals being almost
unaffected.          Still it  appears to me that tho variations of the heat at
this point has a great deal to do with the actions of all microphones,
and in general with all sounds transmitted from one loose contact to
another.        This is shown by substituting cylinders of different                  metals
for   the bismuth cylinder above mentioned,                     all other things     remain-

ing the same.       I have    tried in this way, besides bismuth, cylinders
of load, tin, iron, antimony, and carbon, and find that bismuth gives
by far the best result.         In   the other cases the sound from the simple
loose    contact is heard        clearly enough;         but there      is hardly     any
increase of     it produced      by rotating the cylinder.           Now this      seems
to bo duo in great part,        if not entirely,     to the difference     between the
 metals    as   regards    their    specific    heat    and thermal       conductivity.
 Obviously, with the same current, the greatest heat will be produced
 at the junction     of tho rubbing point and cylinder, when the specific
 heat and thermal conductivity            are both as low as possible.            Hence
 very probably tho reason why bismuth answers                    so well, seeing that
 of all common       metals    it  stands    lowest on the list both in specific
 heat and thermal conductivity.               In   fact, if we take the product          of
 the reciprocals    of  tho specific heats and thermal conductivities              of  the
 above-mentioned       metals, we find tho product for bismuth greatly in
 excess of that for any of the others.

     The physical activity going on in the Sun is still increasing, and
 worthy of all admiration.             There was      a  very large spot had come
 round on the North-following limb on March 29                       ;   and was after
 that tho subject of observation from day to day               as  it approached      the
 central Solar meridian.            But when it arrived          there,    on   April   3,
 behold two less large but still most notable spots had burst out
 clear and    full within     the previous twenty-four           hours between the
 great spot and the preceding limb.                And   on this day,     April  4, there
 arc two more notable ones very close to the greatest spot, making in
 all five remarkable spots not only all visible at once, but working and
 seething   positively before our        eyes.

          and     a Plate         and       between          a     Ball and             a    Plate.             By
          Alexander Macfarlane, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S.E.
      I   have made the following observations                         in the Natural Philosophy
classroom of the United                     College,       St Andrews, with                     the View of
ascertaining          whether the electromotive force required to cause a
spark to pass between               a   small globe and            a plate,       or between a point
and a plate, differs for the two kinds of electricity.                                       Sir William
Thomson suggested that                  I   should apply to this question the method
of    measuring        the electromotive force required to produce sparks,
"which      I   have described          in papers already contributed to the Society
(Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. vol. xxviii. p. 633). It is a problem to which
Faraday attached great importance.      He says at sect. 1523, vol. 1, of
bis Experimental R&carches in Electricity : " The results connected
with the different conditions of positive and negative discharge will
have a far greater influence on the philosophy of electrical science
than we at present imagine, especially                           if,   as
                                                                        I      believe, they depend
on the peculiarity              and degree of polarised condition                               which          the
molecules        of the dielectrics concerned acquire."                           He    records          a   great
number of experiments on this subject in sections 1465-1525.                                                   Ho
took sparks between             a   ball    0'2,rc   Inch in diameter and               a   ball     2   inches
in diameter.           When      the largo one was connected with                           a   discharging
train, the small one charged                    positively gave              a   much longer spark
than when charged                negatively          ;   also the small ball            charged              ncga--
tively gave       a    brush more readily than when charged                                 positively in
relation to the effect produced by increasing the distance between
thy two balls         1489).   When the interval was below 0-4 of
                       (sect.
an inch, so that the                small ball gave sparks whether positive or
negative,       he could not, he says, observe any constant difference                                   either
in their ready occurrence or the number which passed in                                              a   given
time.       But when the interval                    was such that the small ball when
negative        gave   a    brush, then the                 discharges           from   it      as separate
negative        brushes were far more numerous                              than the corresponding
discharges from          it     when rendered              positive, whether those positive
discharges        were     as   sparks or brushes                (sect. 1490).*                 As   he puts

      Drs De La Rue and Mulfer have found in the case of the discharge

                                                                                                 "   the     relative
degrees       of charge           which the small ball acquires                               before       discharge
occurs,      that         is;   whether       it     acquires        a      higher           condition         in the
negative,         or in the        positive state, immediately preceding that                                    dis
charge."           The method of our experiments,                                  it    appears         to me, has
solved this difficulty.
I         employed         a    Thomson's           divided ring               reflecting            electrometer,
which has either half-ring insulated.                                In this instrument Professor
Swan        has       substituted        a   glass       dish with             a    tubulure         for holding
the sulphuric             acid     in   place      of    the    original leaden                 pan,       in which
the charge            of acid      was       carried on pieces of pumice                             stone.      The
tubulure          allows the acid to be filled in or taken out with con
venience.             A   piece of platinum              foil   suspended               in   the acid, from       the
aluminium             needle,     completely checks the oscillations, and renders
the    instrument " dead                 beat."           The terminals for connecting the
divided rings, which originally                          projected downwards, now project
upwards, and, to secure perfect contact,                              are      in   the form of a helical
brass spring passing                through         a    varnished glass tube.                       The instru-
nient was set so that the                          needle       when charged                    was      symmetri
cally situated             with     respect        to    the     two haltrings,                 and the scale
was       set so that the wire-image                       was       in   the       middle.              The    Holtz
machine by which the electricity was produced, was at                                                a   distance of
20 feet from the electrometer.
     In    the first series        of observations              the point used was the conical
point of          a   rod of      a     Henley's         discharger.               It    was     connected       by
means        of an insulated                 wire       with     one       conductor             of the        Holtz
machiue.              The       plate    used       is    of    7     inches            diameter,          and was
attached          to the        other stem of the discharger in such                                     a   manner
that the rod was always normal to                                it       at    its centre.                Both the
plate and the other conductor of the Holtz machine were in con
ducting connection with the earth.                               Either kind of electricity was
obtained by charging the one or the other paper conductor of the
machine by means of                     a    small Leyden jar.                       As either half ring
of the electrometer                 could be insulated and the                                other connected
with       tho     earth,       readings      were        taken in both                      directions.        This
is    the meaning of the entries in the record                                      connections          direct and
and    a   disc    is    much moro continuous with the point negative than with the
point positive          (Phil. Trans. vol. clxix. 90).    p.

 connections      reversed.     The deflection       in    the  table   is the position
 of the wire-image       immediately before the passing of the spark                  ;  and
 the zero is its position after the spark had passed, and the Leyden
jars of     the    Holtz machine had          been discharged.          These jars were
 found    to contain a residual charge,             but its existence        had only       a
 very slight effect upon the position of the wire-image.
     In  the second      series of observations,           the   arrangement       differed
 only in this — that      a spherical ball of       "5  inch diameter was attached
 to the end of the rod.
    From the first series of observations,             by taking the mean            of the
 two opposite readings,         wo obtain the following           results : —

  Thus the electromotive force for the positive discharge was always
  greater   than for the negativei          but the ratio approaches            the     more
 nearly to unity the greater the distance              of    the point from the largo
 plate.     Thus the difference        in the electromotive forces appears to bo
 due to the presence of the large            uninsulated plate.          The behaviour
 of the index showed that the discharge was not single, but consisted
 of a rapid succession of discharges,           for it first attained a temporary
 maximum deflection and then              a steady    deflection slightly       less than
 the maximum.           The latter on account of its being capable of being
  observed     with   greater    precision was the one recorded.                 The dis
 charge     was     not silent, but       accompanied          with   a  slight     hissing
  sound.
     From the second table, by taking the mean of the two opposite
  readings,    we obtain the following results           : —

    Thus under the above conditions und for a range of spark up to
 -5 inch, at least, the electromotive force required to produce the dis
charge is less when the ball is charged positively than when charged
negatively.       Within that        range     the discharge       took place in the
form of a single loud whito spark, the index gave only one reading,
and fell back after the passage of the spark almost to its ultimate
position.       But when the distance between the extremity of the ball
and the plate was increased            to -75 inch, the charge being negative,
hissing sparks, giving only very small discharges as indicated by the
behaviour of the index, preceded               the loud spark which           gave com
plete   discharge.       When      the charge       was changed      to  positive, tho
distance     remaining the same, no hissing discharges                 were     observed
preceding      the  loud discharge.          This is     an instance    of the pheno
menon      to which     Faraday refers, viz., that when the charged                  ball
(under     tho   above     conditions)      is positive,      a longer spark can be
obtained than when the charged                      ball is negative.        When the
distance     was increased       to   1  inch, hissing discharges        preceded     the
loud discharge       in both     cases,   but they were much more numerous
in  the case of the negative than of the positive charge.
    The results     of the observations appear               to explain   this pheno
menon.        They show that a charge of positive electricity requires a
less electromotive      force than a charge of negative,            in order     to force
its way in the form of         a  spark (which is a complete discharge).                A
charge    of positive electricity will therefore be able to discharge
all together      at a greater       distance,     provided we assume           that the
brushy      spark begins       at   the    same     electromotive force        for  each.

Tho truth or falsity        of this assumption appears to bo capable                 of
being established       with   ease   by   means     of the     method of these
experiments.
    From the end of the second table it appears that the ratio tends
to change from being less than unity to being greater than unity,
when the hissing discharges         begin to appear.        Suppose    tho negative
spark preceded by hissing discharges, but the positive not.                      Then
the occurrence       of these hissing discharges          is apt to diminish       the
deflection at the time -when tho negative             spark passes, while their
absence in the case       of the positive spark allows the full deflection
to be observed.       Thus the ratio of the readings may change to bo
greater than unity,        In  tho case    of the positive spark, the electro
motive forces for tho four distances             lie well on the curve which
from previous experiments          we   found to bo true for the discharge
between      a ball and a plate, but in the case of tho            negative    spark,
only those for tho first two distances.
    The discharge      from the point is       a   more    complex phenomenon
than tho discharge       from tho ball; its explanation probably requires
many further experiments.
    These    results  accord   with   those   published by Drs De La Rue
and Miiller, in Part I. of their "      Research."       They state (Phil. Trans.
 vol. clxix. p. 70) that with high tensions— 5000 to 8000 chloride of
 silver cell3 — tho spark between a point and a disc is longer when
 the point is positive, but     with low tensions up          to 3000     colls,  it  is
 generally longer when the point is negative.                   For   tho  discharge
 they observed is single, like that which wo obtained             between the ball
 and plate, at the smaller distances, not intermittent like that which
 we obtained between the point and plate.
     I may mention that the observations                of April     10,  1880,     are
 supported by      a previous series of observations,         taken by means of
 a more   roughly divided scale.
     The   inductric   and   inducteous balls (to employ terms invented
 by Faraday), by which tho measurement was effected, wero at a
 distance from one another of 15 inches                ;  and   the   length of the
 wire    connecting tho      inducteous ball        with    tho   electrometer     was
 about 10 feet.
     In  the record    of observations      the   entries   are given in the order
  in which they were observed.

            Determination          of   Urea in the Blood.                By John
            Haycraft, M.B., B.Sc.
    The subject of these investigations, some of the results of which
are before     the Society to-night, was suggested            to me by Professor
 Carl Ludwig,       and was carried         out  in his laboratory at Leipzig,
 where    I  worked     with the help of his assistant,             Dr Drechsel, to
 whose     kindness and large knowledge of the subject                  I was much
 indebted.
    In this    paper    I   shall give simply an account of the method of
 analysis, leaving for the future           a record   of the facts which it has
 enabled me to obtain.
    The estimation        of  a   quantity of urea in a pure form, or in            a

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1879-80.                             565
watery solution of fair strength is not difficult;               nothing, indeed, can
well be easier.       There are     a  number of methods             which wo might
employ, and which           are exact     and easy of application            ;   such   are
those     of Liebig,   of Hointr,     and    Ragsky, of Bunsen, of Huefner,
and      of Davy,     all  of which       may be applied for its estimation
in urine.
     "With the blood it is another           question,      for hero this substance
exists in Very small quantities (3 parts in 10,000), mixed with a
mass of organic matter, from which it has first to be separated in a
 tolerably pure form before tho quantity can be ascertained.                          This
 separation     from the blood is the difficult task to be overcome, the
 estimation of the quantity will then be              easy.
         The   subject is      one   of   great     importance       in    physiological
 chemistry, as all        will admit, for it      is a key to our knowledge of
 the metabolism of albuminous              substances        in the body, nearly all
 the nitrogen which is excreted passing out in this form.
      This importance      has been thoroughly           appreciated       by chemists,
 and many men of note have turned their attention to this                              sub
 ject.
      It  was   Sir Robert Christison who first               gave the stimulatus to
  modern     inquiry, for he it was who found                 a large   amount (much
  above the normal) of urea in the blood of patients suffering from
  Plight's   disease.
      His method did not pretend            to great chemical accuracy,             for ho
  took only the clear serum of the blood, from which he crystallised
  out the urea as a nitrate after concentration.
      This discovery ranks with         tho highest that chemists              have made
  in their investigations of tho healthy and diseased tissues, and few
  indeed have been the facts gleaned gradually, and with difficulty in
  later years.
      Physiologists     have     endeavoured,        but    in   vain,    to    found    an
  accurate     analytical     process    for  its     determination        in   blood,    in
   order to investigate the many changes which occur in its amount
   during      different     physiological      and       pathological         conditions.
   Lecanu,     Marchand,      Simon,      Millon, Pettenkofer,          Joseph      Picard,
   Gscheidlen,     and    Drechsel    have    all    worked       with   this object in
   view.
       Indeed the chemistry of blood is beset with difficulties, as all

 506                       Proceedings of                 the   Royal Society
 will admit      ; so     many nitrogenous substances                   exist in it      ;    these are
 closely allied one to another in their chemical                           relations,    hence      their
 separation      is very difficult;           and, lastly, during the process of separ
ation, one substance               may bo changed into another.
     In   the case       of urea estimation,               fresh obstacles       stand in our path
 which it       is necessary to understand, in order that their removal may
be attempted.             Urea not only entirely                   decomposes        when heated
over 120°        C,   but when a watery solution is evaporated to dryness,
part of it decomposes,                 producing a loss             which varies             of course
with the quantity of water and tho strength of the solution.                                           A
fraction of       a gramme            evaporated          in a litre of water loses from 3
to    4   per    cent.        Now it      is necessary          to separate the albumen of
blood from the urea, which                      entails the addition               of much fluid,
which fluid has to be evaporated                     down when decomposition of part
of the urea ensues.
     A    common         way is to coagulate                the albumen with            hot alcohol
when three volumes of spirit are at least required.                               With acidulated
boiling water, six or seven volumes                         are necessary for tho complete
coagulation.          Besides         this,   the     decomposition on evaporation is
much increased           if   other    organic      impurities are present in the fluid.
So much so, that              if ordinary defibrinated undiluted blood                         be eva
porated in flat dishes, even with a gentle heat, not a trace of urea is
to be discovered              in the hard black cake which results.                            Nay,    a
large quantity of pure                 urea may have             been   previously added, the
whole decomposing                  during the evaporation.                 This    is also the case
with the watery and alcoholic extracts of urea from blood, for these
contain much extractive matter of which the urea forms but                                     a   small
portion.        The loss which occurs during                       these    evaporations           is far
more than would occur were the urea alone present                                  in   an alcoholic
or watery solution.
     Another difficulty in our way is that no substance                                 was    known
which might be useful in its extraction, and in which it is insoluble.
It   is often     thought to bo insoluble in sulphuric ether, but this is
far from the truth             ;   indeed it is so soluble that ether can never be
used to separate,             say fat from          it,    in an   analysis which professes
to   be    quantitative.            Urea,     it   may      be stated,      is    very soluble in
water     and alcohol,         and     is     soluble also in chloroform and acetic
ether.

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                  567
    ily    first endeavour was to find         a  liquid in which        urea is insoluble.
A    number were tried, and at last               a substance,       petroleum naphtha
(a naphtha lately imported from America, and which is sold with
other naphthas under the name of benzoline), was found in which
urea     is quite insoluble, and by means of which it is possible                           to
separate       urea   from oil when both are in alcoholic solution.                      This
petroleum naphtha, or benzoline, as we shall afterwards                           see,  is of
great service.
    An     endeavour      was now made to prevent or lessen                 the loss which
occurs on evaporating a solution of urea.
    It     wan thought       that possibly       the   high     temperature       used    was
prejudicial,        and    accordingly      evaporations        were      conducted      with
solutions of known strength at              a temperature      lower than is ordinarily
used.        The solutions were evaporated            on a water bath         in flat  dishes
at a temperature           of from 40°       to 50°     C,   but, unfortunately,          this
was of little avail,            the   difference     in   the result being         but very
slight.
    Failure also resulted when the urea solution (not an artificial one)
 was evaporated at a very low temperature and with diminished
 atmospheric pressure.             The solution was acidified with acetic acid
 with     loss following its evaporation.
     Urea forms with acids salts of definite composition, and of well-
 marked crystalline form.
     It   was thought       that by changing this suhstance                into an oxalate
 or    nitrate     these   might     prove    more     stable,    and     as  the   ordinary
 methods admit            of their    estimation in these forms,               the    process
 might succeed, or at any rate it would be easy to reduce them                            as a
 last step into urea again.
     A    partial success was the result of this trial            ;   for on evaporating
 an alcoholic solution of oxalate of urea               (0'l  gramme        per litre) there
 was not quite 2 per cent. loss.               Indeed, a certain          degree of decom
 position seemed inevitable, and              no way was found out of the diffi
 culty.       No   method     which involved evaporation could be said to be
 perfectly accurate.          It  is still possible     to reduce       this loss by using
 as   little fluid      as possible,   and    to   obtain the urea unmixed with
  other organic solids,        the presence      of which is        so   prejudicial to the
 accuracy       of our results.
     To separate the albumen from blood, either with boiling alcohol

508                    Proceedings        of the Iioyal Society
or hot      acidulated water,         requires     a    dilution      of the blood with
several     volumos of water           as  we have         seen   ;  worse     than this the
alcoholic or watery extract of urea thus obtained contains so many
extractives that the urea passes through several                            processes    before
it is in       a tit    condition     to   estimate,      loss occurring during            each
process,
    Can we lessen or altogether                prevent this loss is the question
before us     1
    Hearing that tungstic acid does not precipitate urea, and knowing
also that     it  precipitates    most organic        substances,       I  tried to separate
the urea by this agent.
    Diluting with only §             vols.  it  was     possible      very completely to
separate the albumens             as  a fine   granular mass by the addition of
tungstate      of soda and acetic acid.
    The after process, however,             was so complicated (the              urea had to
be separated from the tungstic acid, and acetate                        of  soda, and many

    The separation by dialysis had long been thought                               of, for    it
was      naturally      suggested      by    the     epithelium          of    the   kidneys,
by which urea is separated during               life from       the blood.
    It   had    not been      tried, however,        as   it   promised       to be tedious.
Hearing, however,           from     Professor Browne that by placing blood
into   a  dialyser with alcohol in the outer vessel it became quite hard
and    dry in a few hours, encouragement                   was given to a trial of this
method.
    Urea being very soluble               both in alcohol and water,                it would
probably pass out with the fluid parts of the blood into the alcohol                           ;
a  trial proved this to        be the case,    and    a  few experiments           sufficed  to
found the method which will now                 be described.
    80 c.c.     or 100 c.c. of       defibrinated       blood       are   placed    within     a
dialyser    so as to    form    a  thin layer on the parchment paper.                      The
dialysera    that    I use are of glass, the inner vessel having a diameter
of   8 to   9    inches, the outer one-half or three                 quarters     of an inch
more.      The blood must not form               a   layer more than about              3 mm.
thick, otherwise the lowest              stratum      will     become      dry and imper
vious while the upper           will still  remain fluid.
    One    hundred c.c. of alcohol are poured                     into the outer vessel,
and the whole is covered.              In from four          to eight hours the alcohol

in tho outer             vessel    has risen, being increased                           in volume by the
fluid parts of the blood, which now forms                                     a    dark tough cake within
the dialyser, which,              as    a    rule, sticks to the parchment paper.                                  Of
course this contains              still much         urea, and                it must          bo washed.         It   is
not sufficient to pour fresh water upon it                               ;    it      must be detached from
the parchment paper and bruised with                                         fresh water in               a   mortar.
For this       purpose        the parchment paper                        with the blood attached is
brought into a flat dish gently heated over                                       a    water bath, when the
blood     may       be     detached          with the help of                          a    little warm        water.
Fresh parchment paper is now placed upon tho ring of the dialyser,
and the bruised mass brought into it and placed                                                      again    in the
alcohol.       The blood soon becomes                           dry again                   from abstraction of
water, and the alcohol is now evaporated                                           after acidification with
oxalic acid.
     Tho blood in the dialyser is now warmed                                               to drive off the little
alcohol that is mixed with                   it,   and   is   replaced in the dialyser with some
more water, with which                  it   can now bo mixed with                             a   curved spatula;
for now       it   forms      a   finely granular mass, and does not cling to the
parchment paper.                  When this          is       dry   it   is       washed        in   the same way
for the last time.
     The alcohol here              is   also evaporated                  and          the      residue    extracted
with     a    little alcohol                which        is    evaporated.                     An all-important
point    is    this, that mixed with the urea, which                                           may even now bo
seen on the dish, there                     is   but little organic matter.                          Most of this
can     now        be    removed            by washing               the          residue          with   petroleum
naphtha.           It    is   then extracted with acetic                                   ether and the urea
estimated.
I       accomplished this in Germany by                                      a     method introduced by
Bunsen     ;   the urea       is   heated with an ammoniacal solution of chloride
of barium           in     sealed       tubes       at        200°       C.   ;       decomposition           of the
urea into ammonia and carbonic acid occurs, and the amount of this
is    determined           by weighing               the       carbonate               of      barium which            is
formed.
     LatelyI        have      used     a     shorter and more suitable method intro
duced by Huefner.                      Tho urea          is    mixed with                  a   solution of hypo-

       3.  On the Accurate Measurement of High Pressures.
                               By Professor Tait.
                                                                                     "
    In  the course      of an examination of some of the " Challenger
deep-sea    thermometers,      I  have     recently had occasion       for measure
ments, accurate to one or two per cent., of pressures such as five or
six tons weight per square             inch.     Tho ordinary gauges showed
themselves     to bo quite untrustworthy, and        it was necessary to devise
some    plan of whose accuracy            tho experimenter can feel assured.
The following        process   has    proved completely successful,           and is
capable of any desired        degree of accuracy.
    Simple methods based on the compression              of gases,    such  as air or
nitrogen, are of the highest value wherever they can be adopted                       ;
for the law of compression            of these bodies     is known       with   great
accuracy    (at loast for one definite temperature)           from the measure
ments     recently made       by Amagat, in which           tho     pressures   were
directly reckoned in terms of a column of mercury.                  A simple form
of gauge, in which the column of mercury compressing                    the gas  into
a small bulb at the extremity is made to break off at a constriction
 in the connecting tube, enabling us (by weighing the mercury forced
 over into the bulb) to measure the compression very accurately,
 suffices amply for all pressures up to a ton weight per square inch,
 or oven farther.
     But this instrument        becomes      rapidly less and less sensitive at
 higher pressures     ;  so that though tho law of compression             for a con
 siderably extended        range   is now known, for pressures           above a ton
 something else is required.
     Hooke's Law now comes to our assistance.                An instrument          re
 sembling    a   thermometer     in form (but with a tube of much larger
 section   compared      with the capacity of the bulb than is usual in
  mercury thermometers) supplies tho next step.                   It is filled with
 mercury (because of the small expansibility of that liquid), and is
  thus practically unaffected by small changes of temperature.                   Over
  the mercury in the stem is a long column of alcohol in which                     tho
  index moves, and the rest of the tube contains alcohol vapour only.
 The bulb is made cylindrical            for several reasons    ;  tho chief being
  to secure uniformity of thickness, which is practically unattainable

(or at least unverifiaLle) in a sphere. By properly choosing the thick
ness of the cylinder in proportion to its bore, the sensitiveness                 of
this gauge may be made           as  great or as small as we please.         And,
by having two or more, with             bulbs of nearly the same internal
dimensions, but differing considerably from one another in thickness
of the cylindrical        walls, a very important advantage           is secured.
For, under       the same pressure,    the maximum amounts         of distortion
of the glass are greater in the thinner bulbs, and thus these begin to
deviate from Hooke's Law at pressures under which the thicker ones
are   still following it   accurately.    Thus, by comparison,     we can easily
find through what portion of its range each instrument gives effects
strictly proportional to the pressure.          The thinnest of these is to bo
graduated by comparison          with the nitrogen gauge.
    When this       method has to be extended       to pressures such as would
crush glass, recourse must bo had to steel, and              a series   of instru
ments with different thicknesses         of this material is to be prepared.       I
do not yet know whether it may be found practicable to furnish these
steel bulbs      with thick   glass tubes of small bore — probably we may
succeed,     if the-steel  be made to project into the glass.          But if   not,
it is    easy to construct them entirely         of steel, so  as to act    on the
               of the    " weight- thermometer."        Anyhow,     they can be
principle
graduated accurately        from one another, each from         a  thinner     one   ;
 until we     come to the thinnest, which is to be exactly graduated              by
 comparison with       one of the    thicker of the glass instruments.          We
 have    thus a series of gauges, each of any desired              sensitiveness,
 capable of reading accurately pressures           up to those for which steel
 at the interior of a thick tube ceases to follow Hooke's Law.
     To illustrate this process, and to show what amount of sensitive
 ness is to be expected      from an instrument of known dimensions,                I
 append     an approximate solution of the problem of the compression
 of a cylindrical     tube  with rounded     ends.    The exact solution would
 be very difficult to obtain, and would certainly not repay the trouble
 of seeking it.        I  content myself, therefore,      with the    assumption
 that all transverse sections are similarly distorted, which, of course,
 involves their continuing to be transverse sections.
     Let   £ denote the displacement        of a transverse   section    originally
 distant x from one end, and let           p be the   change   of  r the original
  distance     of any point of the section      from the axis.     Then,    as  it is

    The materials      for this Report have been obtained from the Con

Jolly, Esq., II. M. Inspector of Schools, Inverness,                     and   William
Wallace, Iisq., High School, Inverness.
    To   make      the   descriptions of the          boulders     more     intelligible,
it has been found necessary,           as in former Reports, to annex              a few
diagrams,      which will be found at the close of the Report.

                                    AUGYLESIIinE.
    1.  In   consequence     of information       in the schedule        issued by the
Committee, and filled           up   by   Mr Montgomery,             schoolmaster        at
Southend, near Campbelton,            I wont     to Southend, and had pointed
out by      Mr Montgomery boulders          at several places there.
    Mr Montgomery           considered    these boulders        to    be   granite.      If
granite, they were different from any               I  had  ever before       met with.
They     were certainly an igneous or primitive rock of some kind, and
composed       of different ingredients, the chemical         naturo of which        I  am
unable to state.        There appeared to be crystals of white felspar.                   I
could detect no mica.          The general mass was          a whitish-grey colour.
    These boulders wero pointed out to me at many places.                          I   saw
two in the River Conn (about half             a ton in weight), one on Penny-
serach farm (3 or 4 tons), another on the adjoining farm of Bruneri-
can    (1J ton), another      at Macherioch (about half a ton in weight).
I  heard of many more lying on the sea-shoro adjoining these farms.
    I  was assured by      Mr Montgomery,          and    by the tenants of these
respective farms,        that there was        no    rock   in the      south end        of
Cantyre similar to that of these boulders.
    Along     the east coast between        Campbelton and Southend,               a   dis
tance    of   8   or 10 miles,    I   descried    many     boulders      of the same
nature    ;  and in   a gravel  pit near Campbelton gas-work,                I  saw the
fragments of another, which had weighed probably                    3  or 4 tons.
    In this    same gravel pit    I  found   a  boulder of grey porphyry, con-
        vol. x.                                                              4 B

578                    Proceedings       of the Royal Society
taining crystals of white felspar, somewhat                   similar to the Southend
boulders.       The gas manager informed me that he believed there was
rock of the same nature           a  few miles to the north.
    In  the valley of Brackerie           I   found rock of a crystalline           nature
somewhat        similar in composition to the boulders above described                     ;
and at a place in the same valley, called Collielangart,                         I  saw a
monumental pillar, about            8 feet   high, similar in composition, said to
have     been obtained from Glenlissa, a place                    about   3  miles to the
N.W. of Campbelton.               I was     informed also that boulders of this
same rock, weighing 2 or 3 tons, had lately been observed in a recent
cutting into boulder-clay to the north of Campbelton.
    Professor Nicol, in        a short account of the Geology of Cantyre in
the   "London Geological Society's Journal"                      for 1852 (vol. viii. p.
421), refers      to the boulders at and near               Southend.       He describes
them as white        granite, and      as   resembling       a granite in Arran, from
which, therefore, he supposed these Southend boulders had somehow
been transported.           Professor Nicol takes notice of several                striated
rocks on the east coast of Cantyre, one of which showed                       a  direction
of E. 10° N. by compass, which he remarks is nearly parallel to the
line of coast, and in the direction of Arran, 25 miles distant.*
    There was only one spot where                  I   found    a smoothed      rock, viz.,
about a mile to east of Campbelton.                    It sloped down to      N.N.'W.     at
an angle of 40°.         There wore no         striae.
    I  oiler no positive opinion regarding the position of the parent
rock from which these white granite boulders came.                           It  is pretty
 clear, however, that those at Southend must have travelled from the
 north, and many of them there are lying on the Old Red Sandstone
strata which fringe the south-west coast of Cantyre.
     Another part of Cantyre visited by me was the district between
 Campbelton and the west coast at Drumlenhie and Balahunty.
     Near Killtenzie,      a  few miles west of Campbelton, there are hills
 reaching to a height of from 500 to 600 feet, well covered                            with
 detritus   ;  and on their western slopes there are numerous boulders of
    *
      With    reference  to Professor    Nicol's view that the white granite boulders
 seen on the east and south coast of Cantyre came from              parent rocks in Arran,
 it is right to notice     that the late Rev. Mr M' Bride of Rothesay, who was a
 good geologist,    and  well   acquainted     with the rocks of the West Highlands.
 suggested a more northern source (Bryce           "On Arran," 4th edition, p. 337).

gneiss        and mica               schist.       I   measured         several,       the largest            contains
about 150 tons.
   The Old Red Sandstone                                formation occupies              the        west coast for
some miles.                 It   is well covered               by detritus, and on the detritus,
especially when it slopes to the west, there are many boulders of
granite and gneiss, which from their position appear to have come
from the           JNT.W.
   Fig.       1,    plate        XVII.,          represents       a    bank of gravel, at               a    height of
about 50 feet above the                           sea, and       sloping to the              sea   in    a   N.N.W.
direction           at an         angle          of about        25°,        well     covered        with       gneiss
boulders, of which three are represented.                                      There was no rocky cliff
from which they could have fallen.                                They were true erratics.                      Thick
turf had       formed on the bank, which partly covered the boulders.
  Fig.    2, plate          XVII.,         represents, near the above spot, another boulder
of gneiss, at          a     height of about               -10    feet above           the sea,         lying on     u
mass     of   reddish            coloured mica schist, blocked at its south end.                                   Its
longer axis lay N. by E. and S. by W.                                          It had apparently                 come
from the            north, and been                    stopped        in its further          progress         by the
rocks at its south end.
  On the shore,                      I    found a boulder partially                     in    a fissure        which
cuts through the mica schist strata,                                  hero forming tablets                   or sheets
nearly horizontal.                       Figs.   3 and     4, plate          XVII.,     represent            a fissure
running        N.W.              and       S.E.,       about      6     feet        wide.          The       boulder,
very hard gneiss,                    10x5x4            feet, was sticking             in this      fissure.       Fig.
3 represents           the fissure running                 N.W.         and    S.E.,    and the upper part
of the boulder projecting above it.                                   Fig.    4 represents           the interior
of the fissure partially filled with pebbles, and the boulder resting
partly on them and partly on the S.W. wall of the fissure, whilst
the other end of the boulder, outside and above, was resting on the
N.E.     edge.         The boulder had clearly been pushed                                    from the north
ward (from B in figs. 3 and 4), and on reaching                                                the fissure        had
partially fallen into                    it,
                      and become jammed there.
  If   the idea of               a   sea-current        from the north, with ice floating in                        it,
be entertained, there                          seems to be no difficulty                    in explaining          the
above facts.            The weight of the boulder was about                                   15 tons.
  On the same part of the shore, there were many other hard gneiss
boulders.            The largest measured was 12                          x
                                                                          6

pointing north and south.

580                      Proceedings    of the Royal Society
     Specimens        of these boulders, found by me in Cantyre,               I  sub
mitted to Professor Heddle              of St Andrews        University,    so    well
known for his acquaintance           with the igneous rocks of Scotland, and
their      mineralogical      composition.      He   has    kindly supplied        the
following notes         :—
     (1) Most       of tho Southend boulders, and those along the east
coast between Campbelton and               Southend, are identical in composi
tion      with    one    variety of the coarse porphyritic          rock of Davar
Island, situated at the mouth of Campbelton Bay.
     (2)   One specimen is a small-grained white granite, which              I  think
I  have seen somewhere           in Arran.
     (3)   One specimen from the west coast is a coarse grey granite,
identical in appearance with the granite of the Moume Mountains
in the     KE.     of Ireland.     I observe in this specimen       two crystals of
topaz.       This   granite,   from containing also crystals of albite and of
a  lithian mica, should be easily recognised.
     2.   Loch Lomond. — On tho west side of tho lake, near Arden,
a   lateral valley runs up towards the west.                There is    a horizontal
terrace in this valley about 70 feet above the lake, bounded by
a steep      bank,      showing that at one time the lake had filled the
valley up to that height.              On   this flat lie   a  number of quartz,
granite,     and    mica    schist boulders, which most probably           all came
from tho westward,            as the  rocks in the valley are Old Eed Sand
stone.       Tho head       of the valloy reaches to about 150 feet above
the sea.        The land then slopes down westward towards tho                 sea  in
 Loch Long.           If these boulders were floated from the westward,              it
must have been when tho soa was at a greatly higher level than 150
foot.      The largest of these boulders, a mica schist,             I found to be
 5x3x3         feet, with its longer axis lying    E.   and  W., and its sharpest
end towards the west.
     On the east bank of the loch, nearly opposite               to Arden, on the
 farm of Over Balloch, and at a height of about 337 feet above the
sea,    I  found     a grey   granite boulder,   5x4x4       feet, much    rounded.
 Its longer axis lay in like         manner    E. and W.       It  was on a bed     of
boulder-clay.          It  most probably had come from the west or north
 west, crossing therefore the valley now occupied              by Loch Lomond.
     3.  Loch Long and Gareloch.        — On   the ridge between Gareloch and
Loch Long         I found several boulders.       At  a height of 160 feet above

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                           581
the sea, there is one of mica slate,        11  x 6 x  0 feet, lying on rocks of
clay slate.     Its longer axis is N. by E. and S. by W., its sharpest
end being to the north.         The axis was parallel to the valley of Loch
Long.      Its south    end   was    pressing    against   a  knoll of gravel     as
shown on fig. 7, plate       XIX.,    which seemed to have intercepted           its
farther progress to the south.            This boulder had apparently come
down Loch Long, though whether floated                   by ice or carried     by  a
glacier, is  a question.      But the knoll of water-borne            gravel at its
south end, favours the former theory.
   Another boulder on this same ridge,           8 x 6 x 5 feet, occurs at about
360    feet above    the sea, also blocked at its south          end by a rocky
knoll.
    In  the Gareloch,    on the east side, a little below Shandon, on the
beach, a gneiss boulder occurs,          18x 15x     12 feet, with its sharp end
pointing N.N. W.        The boulder on that side presented          a  very smooth
surface.     Every other side was rough.
   The foregoing      boulders    as regards   position, may all be accounted
for by the supposition of the transporting agent having passed through
the valleys    in which they     are situated,    in a southerly direction.
   The boulders in the Gareloch and Loch Long were reported on by
the late   Charles Maclaren, and the opinion which he formed was
that they had been brought to their present position by floating                ice.
    It appears that the late      Sir Roderick Murchison visited this dis
trict, and gave an opinion against the theory of glaciers             as applicable
here.  — (Chambers in      "

    4.  Loch Fyiw. — I     was invited      by Mr M'Killop, schoolmaster          at
Loch Gair, situated about         7  or  8 miles west    of Inveraray, to inspect
some large boulders in that district.
   The first block seen was situated           about   3 miles   to the north of
Loch Fyne, surrounded by hills,           most of them covered by drift.          It
was 23 x 17 x 12 feet, its longer axis lying           N.N.E.    and   S.S.W.     It
was resting on a      knoll of  gravel, and at some distance       from any hills.
It  was clearly an erratic,—      a coarse gneiss.      At first I  was puzzled to
account for its position being      so  exactly on the apex of the gravel knoll
It  struck me eventually, that its great size and weight had been the
means     of protecting, by covering the knoll on which it originally
had been dropped.         The denuding agencies which could loosen and
 sweep away the gravel         and   sand in the      surrounding parts of the

582                          Proceedings of                the    Royal Society
valley, probably did not move the boulder, and so would leave it                                                        in
its original position or nearly                      so.
   I    proceeded next towards Loch Glcushan, and was rather surprised
to see the          hills     on its south side, which sloped                                down towards the
N.E.,        well-covered         with        boulders,           and      also       striated rocks,           facing
N.E.     and        N.N.E.        In       fig. 5, plate         XVIL,         there is a view of one                   of
those        boulders,         8x4x3              feet,      on       Knock           farm,         resting on           a
smoothed            rock,     dipping N.N.E.,                at an angle                of about 30°,                 and
at a     height of about 400                        feet above             the        sea.        At this       place,
looking towards the                    N.N.E.,            there       seemed to              be a      sort of low
level district             for some miles,                with high hills on each side.                                On
examining the map,                     I    found that Loch Awe and Loch Etive were
in that direction.
   5.    A few         weeks after being at Loch Gair,                            I   visited Loch Awe, and
remained           for a few days at Port Sonnachan,                                  situated         on the south
bank of the lake.
   On inquiring of the innkeeper,                             I    was informed of a remarkable
boulder situated among the hills to the south, and distant 3 or                                                          4
miles.         Having obtained the services of                             a shepherd             as   guide,    I    pro
ceeded on foot across the moors, and came to a high cony,                                                       with      a
ridge in the middle, on which ridge the boulder stands at a height
of 1026 feet above the                     sea.      The boulder is so distinguishable from
every other in the district, that the corry takes its name from                                                 it,   viz.,
Corry        no.    clach.
   Fig.       7,   plate     XVIL,         gives   a   distant view of the boulder among the
hills    to the south of Loch Awe.                               Fig.      8   shows its position on the
ridge where            it    stands.        This ridge           is   narrow and has steep sides, so
steep that they can be climbed with difficulty.                                            The side facing the
south        is    about 80 feet, the side facing the north                                  is   about 50 feet,         in
height, above the level ground adjoining.
   The ridge, shown in iigs.                       7   and    8,      is   composed           entirely of       a      soft
arenaceous            mica       schist, in thin slaty strata, which stand up verti
cally, and form              a   table      about      3    feet above            the ridge, as shown                    in
lig.    9.        This   table, on which the boulder sits,                            is   about       5   feet square.
The surface of the table slopes down to W. by                                          S.    at an angle of 22°.
The bouldor on this table of rock occupies                                        a   most precarious                 posi
tion.         Stooping below the boulder, to examine                                         the strata forming
the table,         I   saw daylight               across,    under the boulder, and observed

                                of Edinburgh              ,   Session 1879-80.                                 583
that it touched the rocky table at three points, each point of con
tact consisting of                a   few square inches.
     The boulder was 13 feet long, 12 feet wide, and about                                        6 feet   high.
Its longer axis lay                across the ridge, viz., about N. and S.                        Neither the
nature of the rock composing the boulder, nor its own position, gave
any indication of the direction from which it had come.                                              It    was a
hard compact gneiss, the rock which prevails in most of the hills of
the district on all sides.                         One feature           in   the position of the boulder
offered a suggestion,                     though slight,            as    to the direction of its trans
port.        If the      rocky table on which it lay was sloping                             as    now (at an
angle of 22° to the west) when the boulder landed on the table, it is
probable that it must have come from a westerly rather than from
any other point.                  If it    came from an easterly direction, it would, by its
own weight when still in motion, have slid off the table altogether.
But      the assumption that the table on which it rests was originally
sloping          as   now, may not be correct.                           On this ridge denudation may
have changed               the surface             — except        where       protected    by the boulder.
Moreover, it is possible that the boulder itself, by the mere action of
the wind              upon      it,   might cause             it   to move on and abrade the rock.
The space between                     it   and the rock may also have                      been acted on by
frost.       Certain         it   is,   that at present the stability of the boulder                      is   most
precarious.             With          a   lever,   I   could easily have moved the boulder off
its site.             The innkeeper at Port Sonnachan informed me that there
had actually been                     a   proposal      by some travellers staying at his inn,
to perform this exploit, and that he had prevented it.
 I       am unable to explain                       how the boulder could have got on tho
apex of the             hill,    except on the supposition that                     a   sheet of thick ice,
strong enough to lloat the boulder, may have stranded                                             on the       hill   ;
and that when                it       melted, the         boulder might have subsided on the
part where the ice had stuck.
     6. Having            asked           my guide, whether there were any other large
boulders in the neighbourhood,                            I    was conducted            by him to the side
of   a   hill,   about    £     of    a   mile to the eastward, well-covered                 with boulders.
The height above the                       sea was about 900 feet.               I   was rather surprised
to find the boulders here in such positions                                     as to   indicate that they
had come from                N.KE.             Tho largest measured 18 x 10                   x   10 feet, and
its longer axis lay N. and                           S.   I        observed      that most of the other
boulders lay in              a    similar position.                 The rocks presented smoothings

584                       Proceedings          of the Royal Society
which faced N.N.E.,                  being      the    direction in which                  Loch          Etive
lies.
   I     remembered            that in       walking         up from          Loch     Awe on this
occasion,      I    had       seen several      smoothed           rocks with striee running
much in the same direction, but                   I   omitted to take the exact bearings.
      I felt surprised at this direction,              as,   when last year in the Hebrides
and      the west coast            of Argyleshire,           I   had   been accustomed               to se«
that N.W. was the usual direction both of boulder transport and of
rock striatums.
   7.    Thin N.N.E. direction of transport appears, however, to charac
terise all the boulders and the rock striation at the Gareloch, Leck
Gair,     and Loch Awe.               It will   be observed            that these places form a
band or line across the country about                            N.N.E.     and    S.S.W.           It   is no
doubt premature               to theorise on so small a number of facts recorded
in these notes.           But they          seem to suggest that in this district there
may have been a curreut of floating ice, moving in a                                      S.S.W. direc
tion, dropping boulders where the ice which bore them was stranded
or obstructed.
   Is it not probable               that,    when the Highlands                   of Scotland were
covered by the sea, up to a height of say 2000 feet, and when they
presented          an archipelago        of islands, there may have been currents
moving in different directions, and these directions changing as the
sea     fell from one level to another 1
   The valley through which the Highland                               Railway        passes,      between
Killin and Dulmally,                presents, on the sides facing and sloping down
to the north, many examples                     of large boulders and striated rocks,
which, even from              a   railway carriage, are seen to be well- deserving                          of
special investigation.               Thus at l.uih station, and for some miles both
to the east and west of               it,   there are numerous              large boulders resting
on the      hill    sides sloping down to the north                    ;   as also great          masses    of
boulder-clay and water-borne                   gravel, with            huge    boulders,        and occa
sionally      under these beds,               surfaces           of rock, well         smoothed           and
striated.      A     special examination of this district would be rewarded
by many important                   discoveries.         Similar           features       occur     at    and
near      Crianlarich          and Tyndrum.              But        at Tyndrum,             while        there
are knolls          and escars of gravel,               so numerous               indeed that             they
have      given      a   name       to the     place     (in Gaelic),*            there    is   a   sudden

                     of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.                               585
 and remarkable cessation        of boulders.           This absence of boulders
 continues west of Tyndrum           till about      2 or     3  miles    east of Dal-
mally, when they again begin to make their appearance, and they
are very numerous      on the hills there facing the            N.W.
    May the   reason of this be, that at or near Tyndrum                    there is the
valley (traversed by the high road) running in a N.N.W. direction
between     high mountains, passing through Glencoe, whilst near
Dalmally    there is a similar opening towards the sea by Loch                         Awe
and Loch      Etive.     When     the   sea   stood at say 2000              feet    above
its present    level, currents may have flowed through both of the
 openings just described,       but not over          the  high ground            between
Dalmally and Tyndrum, the land there being so high that it may
have   prevented     a  current.     It will      be    remembered         that in the
 Committee's    Fifth Peport     facts were stated, which            seemed to show
that in Glencoe a current had passed up the glen carrying boulders
towards the S.E.
   The current which passed through what is now Loch Etive and
across Loch Awe, towards the           S.S.W.,      may have continued             till the
sea  sank below the level of the hills lying in that quarter.                       Along
the banks of Loch Awe there           are sea-terraces at a height of at least
200 feet above the present sea-level          ;  and in the narrow pass at the
south end of the loch, near Ford, there are indications of                      a  current
which flowed through it from the north.
   Whilst    on the subject of Loch         Awe,     I   may notice      a   boulder on
the south bank of the loch, at a place called                Kaim,    about 10 miles
west   of Port Sonnachan.           The boulder is of mica schist,                 and    is
2-1x11x9       feet.   Its longer axis is N.W.               by N.      It    rests on a
knoll of     gravel which      is about       20    feet   above      the      adjoining
meadow.      This    meadow      is   surrounded         by hills      (from 400 to
600 foot in height) on all sides but one, whore there is an opening
due west from the boulder, and by this opening the boulder may
have   entered   the  ad  de sue where       it  lies, though,     if brought when
the sea was 400 to 600 feet higher than now, it may have come from
any other direction.
   The hills to the south of this meadow are, on their sides sloping
down to the north, well-covered by boulders                ;  and they apparently
had come from some northerly point.
   Along   the south bank of Loch             Awe, between         Port Sonnachan

586                         Proceedings of the Royal Society
and Kaim, striated rocks occur, almost all of which present surfaces
towards the N.W.                    Fig. 8, plate    XIX.,      gives an example of one of
these rocks.               It   slopes down   N. by W. at an angle from 60° to 70'.
The       striae    upon        it run E. and W., dipping down east at an angle of
20°.        Li     one part of the surface there is a hollow,                 A,   over which the
striating agent has passed without marking its sides.                                The striating
agent had moved from the west, as the striae were deepest at their
west ends.

gives a bird's-eye sketch                 of the loch and these hills.                No.   1   is the
town of Ardrishaig.                    No.    2   is Loch Gilphead.            A lateral valley
cumes down from the                   S.W.    marked     AD.
     At     a and     /;   many of the rocks             of clay slate) are (at a height
                                                    (a sort
of     120 feet       above the sea)          well smoothed, the smooth faces being
parallel with the axis of the loch, which here runs about N. and S.
The smoothing had evidently come from the north.        On reaching
fd, at a height of 600 feet above the sea, the smoothed                                 rocks were
 more abundant, and evidently from the same direction.
      A Loulder of dark-coloured                     granite,    12x6x4            feet, was     found
 between            ah and cd,         whose      position implied           transport from the
 north.
      At     a     height of from         500 to 600 feet between a and c there are
 numerous            whinstone knolls, sloping down towards the north                           as   indi
 cated on fig. 2, plate             XVIII.,    beautifully smoothed and polished on the
 north sides, but rough and precipitous on the south sides.                                 On some
 of them a few boulders were lying,                           evidently intercepted          in their
 farther progress southward by these knolls, because on the south
 side there were numbers of boulders which, having been pushed
 over, had remained                  there, as shown in the figure.
       At    one place indicated on the sketch, lig. 1, plate                      XVIII.,       by the
 letter       e, a   smoothed         rock was met with sloping down S.E. by S. at
 an angle of 35°.                   Two sets of     striae   were on    it,   one running            N.W.
 by W., the other running N.E. and S.W.
       This        spot was very near the corner                where   the lateral valley            Ali
 joins       the main valley of Loch Gilp.                   The two sets of striai indicated
                                                              the axis
 of course two several currents, one apparently parallel with

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              587
of the lateral valley AB, and the other nearly parallel with Loch
Gilp    valley.
    At   the mouth of this lateral valley, at           / on    the sketch,   a  number
of boulders were found at             a height of about 670 feet above the            sea,
lying    on the     hill   slopes  facing the N.W.           Some    of these were in
such positions        as showed     transport from the       N.W.     One example is
given in fig.        3,   plate  XVIII.,    where    a boulder A,      4 feet   high by
2i feet wide, was resting           against the   N.W.     sides of rocks B, on their
W.N.W. sides.
    On proceeding         to the head of this lateral valley, about         1   mile dis
tant, and at a height of about 795 feet above the                        sea,   I found
numerous boulders,            many of large size, resting chiefly on rocks and
hill   slopes, facing       W.N.W.,     and with     their longer axis lying much
in the    same direction.         One of these measured          12 x 6 x 5 feet.
    There were several smoothed but no striated rocks.                   At   one place,
however, at        a  height of 650 feet above the            sea, I found     a mass   of
softish Silurian rocks traversed by            a  hard quartz vein about        2 inches
thick, standing up above the Silurians,                 as   shown by     A in    fig.  4,
plate   XVII L          This vein had been evidently ground down by some
 thing which had passed over it from             W.N. W. The quartz           retained a
beautiful polish, but the Silurian rock, though it had once presented
a   smooth      flat    surface, had become        rough by atmospheric           action.
 Being softer than the quartz vein, it had been ground down more
 effectually by the agent which had passed over.
    9.  Loch Kille.iport.— Having been informed by                 Mr J. F. Campbell
 of Islay (author of " Frost          and Fire ") that the largest boulder he had
 seen in Scotland           was on the south side of Loch Killc.sporf, near
 Ormsary House,           I   went there in company with Mr Alexander                   of
 Lochgilphead,         who was so obliging         as  to undertake to be guide.
 His local knowledge was of much              service to me.
    We went first to some boulders            a little beyond Ormsary House on
the sea-shore.          One (of gneiss) had a girth of 65 feet and a height
of 16 feet.        It   was tolerably well rounded, its sharpest end pointing
 N.W. Another measured 17x13x5                         feet, its longer axis lying
N.W. by W. Another measured 24 x                      12 x 5 feet, its sharpest end
pointing W.S.W.
    The largest boulder was situated about             \ of   a  mile east of Ormsary
 House, on the south            side of    the coast road,       adjoining    a  ruinous

588                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
cottage.      The boulder was in two pieces, having                     evidently      been
broken by some natural agency.                    Before it broke,       it must have
measured      in length 52 feet, in width              36 feet,    and in height         20
feet, containing       1387 cubic yards or about 2770 tons.*                  It  was ex
tremely angular in shape.              Its narrowest         end   was to      the   west.
This   immense       boulder was at the foot of what was evidently an old
sea-bank,    whose      base is about 40 feet above the sea at high water.
The bank is about          35 feet in height, and consists            chiefly of gravel
and boulders.
   Fig.   5 on     plate  XVIII.    is intended as a sketch from memory of
this spot,   AAA      being the old sea-bank, B the largo boulder, and CD
the high road along the south shore of                Loch Killesport.
    Along the line of this old sea-bank, there were great numbers of
boulders above it and at its base.               The measurements         of a few may
be given.         A boulder     at base of the bank, measured 23 x 14,                lying
E. and \V.      ;  another measuring         20x12x10          feet, lay on the slope
of the gravel bank, which here faces \V.S.W.
    Another boulder on top of bank measured 24 x 16 x 13 feet                        ;  and
another     18 x    10x8    feet, lying   on gravel with its sharp end to the
 W.N.W.          There were       about twenty           more,   smaller than these,
 scattered on the lields above the old sea-bank.
    At  a little    distance   from the top of the bank,            I  found a rock of
 mica schist well smoothed,         with striae running E. by N. and W. by S.
    Near the village of Ballibayach, in             a  field to the north- east, there
is a gneiss boulder, 33 x 18 x 12 feet, resting on a smoothed                      rock of
 mica    slate,    which slopes      down towards the            west.     This boulder
 weighed    probably above 400 tons.              Along     the range of    hills and up
to their summits,        at a height of about 600 feet above the sea on the
 south side of Loch Killesport, numerous boulders were seen from the
 road ; but     I  was prevented     going to them.
    About    3 miles to the east      of Ormsary, the road passes through the
 narrow valley of Auchloss, which runs in a direction about east and
 west.     Smoothed rocks occur in this valley, on one of which                          Mr
 Alexander        pointed    out striee running          in   a direction    W. by N.
    *
      In the   "American      Journal of  Science     and   Aits"  for 187", reference     is
 made to a boulder in Vermont, called         "The    Given Mountain Giant," weighing
 about 3400 tons ; and      to twelve   still  larger   in New Hampshire — the largest
 measuring    62 x 50 x 40 feet, and estimated      to weigh nearly 6000 tons.

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.                        589
These   striee seemed    deeper at their west ends, as        if  the tools which
cut them, had struck the rock first at these ends.
    The boulders on Loch Killesport appeared to me, from their posi
tions, to have all come from the westward.            If they came      on floating
ice, the sea must at that time         have  stood   at a high level to have
floated ice of sufficient size to carry and deposit            boulders of such
weight    as those   above described.      On that point there need be no
difficulty, as there is abundant evidence that the            sea   prevailed over
the Highlands       of Scotland to a height of at least 2000 feet, and
thereafter subsided,     whether gradually or rapidly is not yet known.
The sea-bottom on which tho boulders were dropped, would of course
 present a very different surface from what forms the present dry land.
 What   are now valleys in tho land would be formed (after tho sea sub
 sided) by the detritus which filled these hollows being scoured out by
 rivers; whilst the boulders which had occupied the old sea-bed, when
 too heavy to be moved        by river floods, would remain in the newly
 formed valley, though sometimes at lower levels.            In like   manner, the
 boulders which are now on tho shores of             sea   lochs,    may in many
 eases have been undermined by the scouring out of detritus by tides
 and storms, and sunk to       a lower level than they originally occupied.
 Hence it is that along tho preterit line of high water the boulders are
 generally more numerous than elsewhere          ; and the same circumstance
 occurs everywhere      along the old sea-margin,     as  in Loch Killesport.
     10. Another place visited was Loch Sitrin, an arm of the sea on the
 west coast of Argyllshire, about 16 miles west from Lochgilphead.
 Mr Alexander        of Lochgilphead      kindly    accompanied         me   to this
 district also.    At Keills,   on the north bank of the loch, close to its
 mouth, there are several boulders of       a light-coloured grey gneiss, and
 one or two of a fine-grained      granite.    The rocks on which they rest
 are a coarse dark-coloured Silurian.
     The first boulder examined        was on the shore         facing the island
 of Jura, here distant about          4  miles to the west.           Its  size  was
  12 x 10 x 9 feet.     It lay on   a  bank sloping down towards the              sea
 at an angle of about 15° to the        W.N.W.       It  rests on Silurian rock,
  at a height of about       50 feet above    the sea, and about 100 yards
  from the beach.
     About    a mile to the eastward,     and not far from tho old ruinous
  church of Keills, there is another grey gneiss boulder,              18x15x12

590                    Proceedings of                    the       Royal Society
feet, resting on        a terrace      about 150 feet above                       the sea.           Another
boulder, of fine-grained           granite, lies near it on the same terrace.
     Another       boulder is on the shore here, 16 x 10 x                            9 feet,       with the
longer axis lying E. and W.                              I   learnt from Angus, shepherd at
Keills (and who         also acts as post messenger),                         that on the Island              of
Dana, at the south side of Loch Swin, there are three boulders larger
in size than any on the north side.
     On my return to Lochgilphead,                             I    walked to Carig Bay, in the
parish of North         Rnapdale, and on the                         hill    to the   S.W. facing the
island of Jura was shown                   a    fine-grained gneiss boulder,                       12x6x6
feot, similar       in composition             to those at           Keills.     It   was resting on a
rocky surface         sloping down to                N.W.            Its position     suggested trans
port from N.N.W.              Its height             above the sea was 270 feet.
               i
     At Tn rail kit,     on the north shore of Loch Swin,                                 I    fell in with
boulders        forming two groups of                    3 and 4      in number, whose                 relative
position indicated transport of the uppermost from the west.
     At   Scotnish,   also on Loch                  Swin, found an old sea-terrace at 42
feet above         the sea, with       a   boulder on                 it,   18 x 11   x
                                                                                      8       feet, besides
many others of smaller size.
     In   a   short lateral valley opening into Loch Swin at Loch Mhwrich,
I    had shown to mc by Dr                          J.   M'Leod of Tayvallich                 an immense
boulder, 36 x 15        x   13 feet, weighing about 500 tons.                                 It   rests on   a
knoll of shingle, and         is   about 30 feet above the sea-level, and distant
from   about ^th of mile.
          it                This knoll
                             a            in the centre of marshy     is                           a
meadow, which     surrounded by hills of from 260 to 300 feet in
                       is
height, whose         sides show beds of sand and gravel.                                  The mouth of
this small loch opens on Loch Swin to the W. S.W.                                         The boulder         is
many hundred yards distant from                              the adjoining hills, so that there
is   no doubt that       it   is   an erratic.                 But from what          quarter,         and   by
what means has         it   come   ?   One naturally supposes that                            it   must have
come in by the mouth of the valley, of course at                                      a   time     when the
sea was deep enough           to float         it    and lodge        it    in this cul       de sac.        The
sea-bottom         on which   it    dropped may then have been higher than
the existing meadow           ;    and         as    the detritus was washed                       away,     the
boulder may have protected                      the bed on which                 it   rested,       so as to
form the present knoll.
I     may add that there are numerous                              small lateral valleys along the
north side of Loch Swin, extending                             a    few hundred yards, and run

 ning in    a   N.E. and S.W. direction.           They open into Loch Swin,
 and are well filled by boulders.             These are generally most abun
 dant on tho south sides, and on the slopes of hills facing towards
the N.W.
                                   Berwickshire.
    1.  In Ayton parish,       on  Whitfield farm,       2 or 3  miles N.E. of the
village, several small boulders of grey granite occur, about 270 feet
above     the    sea.    Nearest rock of         same     kind is    on   Cockburn
Law, about         10 miles to     W.N.W.        Near Ayton Castle a bed          of
sand was excavated          to the depth of about 20 feet and removed.
 Bits of coal (including cannel) were found in the bed, about 200 feet
above the sea.         Nearest place where coal strata occur, is in Mid-
 Lothian,    on north side      of Lammermuir          Hills, about    30  miles to
N.W.
    2.  In Coldingham parish,        on Crosslaw farm, well rounded masses
of hematite were turned up by tho plough at a height of about 500
feet above the sea.        Nearest place where hematite has been found is
in   Ea.st   Lothian,    about 30       miles   to   N.W.      But   the range    of
Lammermuir         Hills  intervenes.      On this same farm,         a boulder of
white coal sandstone          occurs,   which must have          come   from   East
Lothian.      Lumps of coal have also been found there in the boulder
clay on Blackhill farm.
    " On   tho heights east of Coldingham Loch, the rocks lie in sepa
rate and parallel ridges.         The ridges are much rubbed and planed,
especially on the        N.W.     exposures,    as   if  some   mighty force had
battered and grated         them down.         There were also indications of
striae, which      bore  by compass      nearly north, or N.A-\V. — in this
agreeing     exactly with the stria3 at St Abb's Head and the Earne
Islands." — (Address       hy Jag. Scott Robson, President of Berwickshire

boulders of grey granite, from         1 to 2 tons      in weight, and about 300
feet above the sea.        Nearest rock of same kind is at Stanchal and
Cockburn      Law hills, visible from Old          Castles,    and about 8 miles
distant to    N.W.
    4. At Blaclcadder, in Edrom parish,             a boulder     of blue whin or
greenstone     is on a knoll     of gravel, on the west side of knoll.           Its

 Level above the          sea   about 250 feet.          Nearest rocks of same kind
 are at Hardens, about 5 miles to                   N.W., and about       500 feet above
 sea.
    5.  In    II id ton   parish, at Paxton           brick-work,     buried in boulder
 clay,  a  blue whinstone boulder,             7 J x 4|   x 3 feet, weighing    about 12
 tons,   was found.          Its longer axis pointed N.W.               by N.     In that
direction, Borthwick            Hill     near  Dunsc is situated, distant about 10
 miles.      It  is the nearest         spot for whinstone rock in situ.           In the
same brick-work,           small boulders were found             of old conglomerate,
greywacke,         chert,   and white         sandstone.       Rocks     of these   kinds
occur in Berwickshire              to    the  westward.       The brick-coloured       por
phyries of Kyles and Dirrington hills, situated about 15 miles to
 the west, were found there also.
    Blocks of the same blue whinstone occur on the farms of Broad-
meadows and Sunwick.                 I Hocks   of a peculiar greywacke, of      a  concre
tionary character and black in colour, occur in the Pistol plantations.
The only rock of that kind known to exist is in the channel of the
Whitaddcr, near Cockburn Law, about                     14 miles  distant to the    N.W.
Blocks of the same peculiar rock occur in great numbers on aU the
farms     in   the   same line.         There are specimens         of them at Paxton
House.
    6.  At Mitchell       Craggs, pebbles        of Old Red Sandstone are lying on
the whinstone         rocks, at     a   height of about 600 feet above the sea.
Nearest place where Red Sandstone strata occur is some miles to the
west.      On the west sides of these craggs there are smoothed surfaces
of whinstone rock dipping towards                  W.N.W.       None are seen on       an
other side.        At Baillie Knowe, in same parish, about 300 feet above
the sea, a whinstone           hill occurs, presenting on its west side similar
smoothed       portions of rock dipping            W.N.W.
    Cowdenknowes           Hill, situated in Earlstou               parish,  consists    of
felspar porphyry.           Large blocks of this rock are strewed over the
muirs situated to the east, resting on Old Red Sandstone strata.
    On SmailJwlm          Craggs, about 3 miles west of Stitchell, at a height
of 570 feet above the           sea,   rocks facing    W.N.W. show striae       made    by
some agent coming from               W.S.W.
    On Hume Castle Craggs, at height of about 740 feet above the sea,
there are rocks smoothed             and striated,     in an E. and W. direction.

     " Boulders, carried       a   hundred miles and more from their native
 localities, are still found in many parts of Berwickshire, though by
 far the greater number, especially of the smaller ones, have bee n
 broken up for road metal.             This is particularly      the  case  along the
 post road between         Reston and Ayton, where fragments of gneiss,
 mica slate, pure vein quartz, porphyries, and other rocks of Grampian
 origin, were,    a few years ago, to bo seen in every depot by the road
 side.    The current which brought the ice upon which these were
 conveyed, must have come from the westward, where these rocks
 occur in situ.      Among the more remarkable of these boulders may
 be mentioned a rounded block              of gneiss    on the road at the top of
 Ecclaw Edge, — a       large block of mica slate ou the slope             of the hill
 east   from Burnhouses, — several smaller             masses at    Windshiel, Kid-
 shielhaugh, and      Abbey St Bathans, — and           a block of a very peculiar
 diorite, formerly one of the stepping-stones             in  the  River Whitadder
 at Ellenford.       This diorite, which is         composed      of greyish quart/,
 red felspar, and a     little chlorite,   occurs   in situ in   the neighbourhood
 of Aberfoyle.       Bounded pebbles         of the same have been found in
 the Whitadder      below Preston Bridge, where also mica slate, quart/,
 sandstone     from the Lothians, &c., are to be met with in the river
 shingle." — (Win.     Stevenson on Ice Action        in Berwickshire, " Berwick.

    Aram. — Some       years ago     I spent  a few days at Brodick and Corrie,
and made the following observations              : —
    1.  In travelling along      the high road between Lamlash and Brodick,
I observed     thick beds of boulder-clay containing numerous boulders,
the most prevalent being granite, and also                   a conglomerate,     with
large quartz pebbles in it.          The height of these clay-beds         was about
387    feet above    the    sea.    Rocks    in situ of the        same   nature are
situated to the     N.N.W.
    To the south of Brodick Bay, there is            a large   number of Boulders,
along and near the coast         ;  but in Brodick Bay itself, there is        a total
absence of boulders, whilst           to the   north of Brodick        Bay they are
numerous.
   This   circumstance     suggests a theory which        will  be mentioned, after

594                   Proceedings of      the   Royal Society
some account has been given of             individual boulders remarkable for
size or position.
    One of the boulders to the south of           Brodick Bay is known by the
name of the Corriegill         Boulder.     It lies near the shore.      Its highest
point is about 15 feet above its base, and its girth is about 60 feet.
Its   shape is indicated       by fig.  1, plate    XIX.,   representing a section
through it horizontally a little above the base.                Its longer axis lies
N.W.     and    S.E., with its    sharpest    end to N.W.
    The boulder is granite of           a grey    colour,  the ingredients being
crystals    of quartz,    felspar, and      mica,   which    are  all rather larger
than usual in size, and give to specimens                a very coarse and rough
aspect.      It  has a vein of finer grained granite running           through it.
    The   top of the       hill called Goatfell        bears   from this     boulder
N.N.W., and         is distant about 4 miles.         Granite occurs in situ on
Goatfell.
    Another boulder was measured, situated about half a mile to the
north of the above on the shore at half-tide.              It  was  12x9x8      feet
 Its longer axis lay due north and south.
    From this part of the coast, where these boulders begin to be
numerous,       the northern horn of Brodick Bay, at the sea-shore, bears
N. by E.         This horn    is a continuation of a steep ridge         which runs
up to Goatfell.
    2.  To the south of Corrio (about a mile) two boulders of consider
able size are situated on a plateau or terrace, which is from 89 to 96
feet above the sea.
    The largest is shown on fig. 2, plate            XIX., A     being a horizontal
section    near the     base, to show dimensions of the sides              and their
position by compass        ;   B indicates   the position of the greatest       mass
which is at the south end, the highest point there being 15 feet above
the base.
    The    longest axis      is in   a   direction    about N. by W. and &.
by E.
    I calculated the weight of this boulder           to be about 620 tons.
    I  omitted to mark the nature of the rock composing these two
boulders    ;  but they are, according to my recollection, grey granite.
    Goatfell from their position bears about W. by S., and is distant
about    3 miles.
    The rocks of the district where these boulders lie are sandstone,

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                              595
apparently carboniferous.                       There is a quarry for building purposes
not far           off.
     These two boulders must have been                                   earned, for there are no
adjoining  hills from which they could have fallen. Carried by a
glacier they could not be, as they are not in a valley nor near any
from which a glacier could have issued.
     3.       To   the north of Corrie, about                 2   miles, the road passes a large
boulder called the Catstane,                         which is about 18 feet in height and
56 feet in girth.                   The late Dr Rryce estimated its weight at above
200 tons.                I   calculated its cubical contents to bo 131 yards, and
therefore its weight about                     262      tons.      It   is very angular in shape                  ;
but       I    could not ascertain              correctly the length and direction of its
different sides.
    On         the beach near the                last-named         boulder, there             is a    granite
boulder which                I was    able to measure           with    exactness.        It is in     height
about 12 feet. Its longer axis lay in a N. and S. direction, its
narrowest end being to the north.   Its shape and the length of
its sides are shown in fig. 3, plate                              XIX.      I estimated its            cubical
contents           at 106 yards, and its tonnage                   about 212 tons.
    The boulder next larger in size at the same place is shown in
fig. 4, plate            XIX., A        and    I5,   where    A   represents        the lengths of the
different sides, and                B   gives an idea of the             height, which was about
10    feet.         The direction of the longer axis and of the narrowest end
was much the same as                     in   the other boulder.
   Another granite boulder on the shore (at the old sea-margin of 12
feet above Che present sea-level) shown on fig     plate XIX., where
                                                      is                      5,
A    gives         a     horizontal section to show its shape and direction of its
longer axis, and               15   its peculiar position, resting             as   it   does on      a   mass
of Red Sandstone (coarse) conglomerate                             strata, rising up towards the
north.  The position of the boulder, blocked                                   as    it   is   at its south
end by the sandstone,                   shows that       it   has come from the north.                    The
girth of this boulder  about            is            33 feet, its length about                 9     feet, its
width feet, and its height
              8                                 8    feet.
    Many blocks of                  the conglomerate         sandstone on which this boulder
rests     are found along the                  shore       to the south, none             to the       north.
It will        not fail to be observed that one feature                        characterises           all the
cases         of boulders just mentioned.                       The narrowest end points to
wards the north, suggesting                     the idea that, after being deposited, they

596                 Proceedings           of the Royal Society
had been subjected to some agency which put them into                        a   position
enabling them to withstand any farther dislocation.
   That this agency came from the north, their position clearly indi
cates, an inference       confirmed by the transference           towards the south
of the sandstone blocks above mentioned.
   4.  On ascending        the hills   to the west of Corrie,     I  found smoothed
surfaces on the sandstone           rocks and traces of      striae   at a height       of
about 158 feet above the          sea.     The direction of the      striae was    N.W.
and S.E.
   On these hills, up to       a  height of about 587 feet above the sea, the
boulders are very numerous.                 All  that  I examined were of grey
granite,    except three, and these were of conglomerate.
   Between these hills and the                 high   granitic boss to the west,
reaching to a height of about 1800 feet, there is                   a  valley running
X.   and S.
   The high hill on the other side of the valley to the westward is
composed       of grey granite.         I  climbed this hill up to a height of
1270 feet.       The ground passed over was thickly strewed with grey
granite blocks.        I  could here distinguish two sets of boulders — one
sot angular,     which may have fallen from the mountain —another set
well rounded, which seemed to be erratics, not only because of their
shape, but because they wore of a harder texture than the rock of
the   hill.    The ingredient crystals were also larger in size.                    These
rounded blocks       I   observed      to bo on the hill-side        for at least 100
feet above the point reached by me.
   One of the boulders arrested my attention on account                      of its size
and position.       It   was 25 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 12 feet high.
This boulder and         many others were lying with           their longer axis N.
and S., and could not, as        it  seemed to me, have fallen from any rocks
on the    hill  above.
   5.   I  went across the island to Loch Ranza, the summit-level being
about 660 feet above the           sea.
   I  was unable to examine           any individual boulders.           But   I  noticed
 hat there were many more on the east side of the summit-level than
on the west side.
   I  saw on the     hills facing     the    N.W. numerous "        perched      blocks,"
at heights of from 1600 to 2000 feet.                But  they were too far off to
admit of examination.

                       of Edinburgh, Session                   187 9 -80.                               o97
  Near      Loch      Ranza some remarkable terraces, with boulders, ar
rested    my attention, at heights of from S0 to                           100 feet           above the
present sea-level.          Great scaurs of gravel               and sand, which were in
beds, sometimes           flat, sometimes      dipping at        a   high angle, were under
these terraces.
   6. In connection with              the   Arran boulders,          reference may be made
to the following :—
   Ailsa Craig (Ayrshire)             is a mass of trap,             — much of it              (as     I un
derstand from Professor Heddle) being columnar porphyry of a white
colour.  It reaches to a height of 1114 feet. Not having visited
it myself,     I may      be allowed to refer to information given by others.
   In    a paper     by   Mr W. N. Macartney, in                 the      " Proceedings of                 the
Glasgow Nat. Hist. Society for 1868," it is stated                                  that the Craig
bears many marks of glaciation, up to near                        the top.          On the north
side there     is,   at the height of about 600 feet,                  a   deposit of boulder-
clay in    a   slight depression            of the rock, and guarded                    by    a   boss of
rock from any currents,           which, when the Craig was submerged, may
have flowed from the            N.W.          This deposit           is   of   a   red       colour,       and
composed       of sand and            clay, derived probably from the Old Red
Sandstone rocks situated in Arran and other islands to the north.
In this    deposit,       Mr Macartney        says he gathered            a    number of pebbles,
striated or scratched,         consisting of quartz, and metamorphosed                                 slates
and shales.
   Mr Wiinsch of Glasgow informed                     me that he had                    found granite
pebbles    on Arran.
   (2.) At Ardrossan            (Ayrshire),       on the        beach, there             are numbeis
of conglomerate           boulders,    distinguishable by the prevalence of white
quartz pebbles in the rock.
   At Lamlash Bay, in Arran,                  I   noticed boulders of               a    similar con
glomerate.
   Have they all come from some northern quarter?
   (3.)    At Millport (Buteshire)            there are two large boulders                      of   coarse
                                                                                         "             "
grey granite, which are used in the harbour there                                  as        pauh          for
ropes from ships.
  (4.) Near Beith (Ayrshire) there      hill called Guffs, which Mr
                                                      is   a
Craig of Beith took me to visit.   On the north side of this hill he
pointed out many small-sized boulders of grey granite at                                       a     height
of about 560 feet above                 the    sea.    The felspar crystals in                       it    are

 598                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 of a large size and very white colour, much resembling those found
 in the Arran boulders.           Cuffs   Hill   consists  of porphyry.        It  is
 surrounded by Carboniferous strata.
    7. On a review of the facts stated            in these notes regarding the
 Arran boulders, it       seems probable that those         described    had been
 brought from the north, judging by the way in which they lie, and
also by their composition.
    With    reference   to the absence of boulders from        Brodick Bay, and
to their abounding         along the coast     both north and south of that
bay, what occurred to me was, that          if the  boulders were brought from
the north by floating ice, the rocky ridge running down from Goatfell
peak (a mountain 2874 feet high) to the north point of Brodick
might have had the effect of diverting the current in a S.E. direction,
which would         carry the ice beyond the bay.           That   bay is at the
lower end of a valley which runs up among the highest hills                  ;  and
if the theory of glacier from        these    hills be adopted,   the bay should
have     been   crowded with boulders,           instead of being free         from
them.
   Big    Cumbrae.    —I    was   guided to the north        end   of the island
by the Rev.        Mr Lytteil.     There, on the farms of Figgatoch             and
Balloch Martin,       I found several large boulders of mica schist lying
on    Old Red       Sandstone rocks.        The largest    measured     12x6x3
feet.     But it     may have been larger,        much of    it being below the
surface of the ground.        The longer axis lay N.N.E., which was also
the direction of the hollow or small valley in which             it lay.
   On the 70 feet terrace one of the schist boulders was about               5  feet
square.
   At   the  S.W. point of     the island (viz.,    Kennery point),    above    half
a mile to the west of      Millport,   I found several other schist boulders,
on the old     12  feet sea-terrace.
   Little   Cumbrae.    — The rocks of this island        are entirely a    brittle
claystone    trap.    The rocks at the highest part (near an old tower),
at a height of about 400 feet above the sea, are very distinctly
smoothed      and grooved.      Most of the smoothed        surfaces slope down
towards and face N. by W.
   The only part of the island on which striae were found is at the
east side, near a small ruined         fortress.    A hollow    or trench occurs
between     the  knoll  on which that      ruin stands and     the main body of

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1879-80.                              599
the island.         Fig. 6, plate   XIX.,   shows the trench apparently scooped
out in the rock by some heavy agent which has passed through,
smoothing it on both sides                 and striating it on one side.                   The
direction of the trench is N.E. by N.                     As it    is only the        east side
which shows striation, the striating agent,                if it   came from the north,
must have moved from a north-westerly point.
    The   striae    can be traced longitudinally          for about 30 yards.
    The   figure shows a boulder, B, resting on an upper part of the
trench, where there happens to be              a   sort of shelf where it has origin
ally been lodged.
   This is the "Split Boulder" first noticed and                          described     by Mr
Smith of Jordanhill. Before it broke into its two                     fragments, its size
must have been           8 x 7 x 6 feet.     Though the boulder is               a claystono
trap, viz., the same rock as that composing the main body of the
island,   I   do not    think it    has rolled down to its present position, but
agree with         Mr Smith, that it is      a true erratic, having been brought
by ice which           probably jammed in the trench                 as    it   was    passing
through.
    The island has        a   number of Old Bed Sandstone and also of con
glomerate          boulders on various parts of           it,   very similar in mineral-
ogical character         to the strata      which are seen on the shore to the
N.N.W.         at Bothesay and           Toward.      One of        these       conglomerate
boulders      is   of archaeological interest.       It   bears the name of the Bel-
stane, and     is    supposed    to have been in former times connected                   with
the Beltane fires.            There are markings on the stone which have evi
dently been made for some special purpose.                       One of these boulders,
about     5   feet square,      rests   on rock, and       may have         been used as     a
"Rocking Stone."               The Rev.     Mr Lytteil pointed out this                  stone
to me.

of granite,      syenite,   porphyry,     mica slate, gneiss,     quartz-rock, and
varieties of groywacke,         which are met with only in the central dis
tricts of Scotland, while an examination of them shows                     that they
decrease both in magnitude and frequency, as we advance southward ;
a fact    indicating     that the aqueous       currents (for to such only can
they be referred) diminished in intensity as they were removed from
the central parte of the island."
   Professor Nicol of Aberdeen (in the " London Geological Society's
Journal" for 1848, vol. v. p. 23) refers to "one angular block of
mica slate, near Habbie's How, on tho Pentlands, weighing (according
to a measurement           I   made)   6   or 8 tons.       Farther west,    I  found
another block, also angular, of the same sort, weighing about                  |  of a
ton.     When it     is considered that these masses must have been carried
upwards of 40 miles, floating ice seems to be the only agent to which
their transport can be ascribed.              Blocks of    a smaller size are very
common; — some          are of kinds      of rock which      I  have   never seen   in
Scotland.       On one hill,       1500    to  1600    feet  high,   I  found these
travelled stones particularly abundant, and apparently increasing in
number      from    below     upwards.      In  some    places   they appeared      to
form broad bands          running nearly in straight lines from          N.N.W. to
S.S.E., and without any            reference    to the present     declivity   of the
ground, except becoming more numerous                 towards the summit of the
ridge.       These blocks consisted          chiefly of trap rocks, especially
basalt   ;  the   hill on which      they rested being a red felspar or clay-
stone porphyry."
    3.  On 29th Oct. 1879, the island of Inchkeith was visited, under
the guidance of Colonel Moggridge,             R.E. , superintending the erection
of fortifications       there.    The rocks consist chiefly of basalt and
porphyry       intruded      among    the   Coal-measures      of Fife and       Mid-
Lothian.         In various     places the rocks are covered           with   beds  of
boulder-clay, gravel, and occasionally sand.               The inspector of works
 (Mr Beck) mentioned that at the east end of the island, when
 removing a bed of shingle (about 60 feet above the sea), he

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1879-80.                     601
 picked up two pebbles         of red granite about the size of             a hen's
 egg.    Thinking it curious that granite should            be found there,      he
laid the pebbles aside and kept them for some time, but they had
since been mislaid.
    Having been told that       a  number of large pebbles of various kinds
were seen at the west end of the island, on the beach,              I  went there,
and found numerous        pebbles of granite (both red and grey), gneiss,
quartz, and hard Silurian rocks.
    On the highest part of the island (which is 182 feet above the
sea), and on portions facing the N.W., the rocks have been well
planed down to even surfaces by some agency from the west.                     But
no striae were observed.
    4.  A short   time   ago  I    went, on the invitation of Captain John
 Macnair of Edinburgh,       to examine        two boulders lying at the side
 of the Water of Leith, on the farm of Whelpside, near Kaims and
 Dalmahoy hills, about       9   miles S.W. of Edinburgh.            One boulder
 was 13 x 10 x 6 feet, and        the  other 10 x 8 x 5 feet; but the depth
 of either could not    be   well ascertained,     being deeply     sunk.     They
 were both of them a hard porphyry, containing minute crystals                  of a
black mineral like hornblende, in             a basin of white felspar.        The
longer axis of both was E. and \V.              They wore    covered with strit:,,
long and deep, running also E. and W., and indicating                 a movement
over them from duo west.
    I ascended   the Kaims      hill, situated    about a mile to the     N.W.    of
the boulders,    and found its west         side swept    bare, with    numerous
large fragments      of the rock of the hill (a hard sandstone)            strewed
over its eastern slope.
    On my way back to Edinburgh             I  examined the whinstone quarry
of Ravelrig, and found, on the natural surface of the rock composing
the    hill  there,   numerous      examples      of ruts   and scoopings,       all
indicating    an   agency    which     had    passed  over   the   hill from    due
west.

   Largo rounded fragments of granites and syenites are abundantly
scattered   over the    Stewartry, and so arranged          as   to indicate that
they have     been dispersed    by    a force   proceeding from the N.W. —

was lying       on   Old Red Sandstone           strata.    The nearest greywacke
rock is situated to the westward about                   3 miles.       Between these
rocks and the position             of the boulder, there          is low ground, at
least 800 feet below the level of the boulder, which                      it must    have
crossed to reach        its site. — (" Edin. Roy.         Soc.   Trans." vol. xv. p.

   3.    Near the village of Ncsbit, about           8  miles S.W. of Kelso, there
is a boulder of small-grained greenstone                 8x7x5      feet,   identical in
composition with         the rock      of Penielhough,     a   hill on which      stands
the    "Waterloo     pillar,    a   structure    of about      120    feet   in height.
The rocks where          the boulder lies consist          of Old Red Sandstone           ;

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                               603
and they are well covered by beds of gravel and sand.                    The boulder
is on   a  knoll, near the top, but a little to the              N.W. of it.      The
longer axis is in a direction S.W. and N.E.                   Penielheugh      Hill  is
situated to the S.W. and distant about a mile from tho boulder.
The   hill is 774 feet above the sea — the boulder              224 feet above the
sea.    The exposed      rock of the      hill   on its west side      reaches down
to about 400 feet above the          sea.
    That   the boulder has        been    brought to its present site from
 Penielheugh,      is evident, — the composition              of   the rock     being
the   same   in both.       The Old Red Sandstone rocks which prevail
generally in the district, reach up to within about                 100 feet   of  the
top of Penielheugh,         but only on the east side.             These strata are
entirely absent      on   the west    side,   suggesting,    therefore,   the  proba
bility that   the west     side of the    hill   has been denuded        of  them by
some agency which          has come against tho          hill from    the westward.
This inference is confirmed by            the   fact,  that on tho sides of the
hill facing    the west, the igneous rocks are            all  bared, and many of
them smoothed ; whilst           on the     sides  facing the east, no igneous
rocks are visible,       being covered       by sandstone        strata,  with drift
materials over these.
    These facts will be better understood by reference to plate                XVII.
fig. 6, where    P   represents    Penielheugh       Hill, B    the boulder.      The
strata in dark colour is the Old Red Sandstone formation.
    On looking from the top of Penielheugh westward,                   a wide valley
is seen in that direction, the Eildon              Hills  on the north, and the
Minto Hills     on the south.
    Through that valley some agency has undoubtedly come, imping
ing with great force on Penielheugh              ; but whether a local glacier
or a sea-current    with floating     ice, there    is nothing to show, though
the extensive       beds    of gravel and sand           which     abound     in this
district,  at no great      distance   from Nesbit,       seem rather to favour
the latter theory.

     On the top of Meiglc                      Hill, about          2    miles from Galashiels, there
is a boulder which                    I    was requested                to come
and examine.                It    is of this shape, and its size
is 6 x   4|    x   3J     feet.
   Its longer axis lies N.W. and S.E., the sharp
end pointing N.W.       The person who invited
me to visit the boulder, and guided mo to                                    it,   told me that he had,
by means            of    a      lever,      moved        the     boulder          about   9    inches from
its original natural position.                          The boulder          is    a   hard grey Silurian
rock,      much          harder           than      the     rock        of the      hill, which        is    also
Silurian.
     The boulder, being well rounded, seems to have undergone                                               much
friction   ;   and there are hollows and scoopings                                 on several     parts, such
as   frequently occur on rocks long subject to the eddying action of
water.        The boulder               is   about 58 yards east from the apex of the
hill.    It    appeared to be lying on gravel or other                                 drift   materials,    and
about    12 feet          below the apex of the hill.                           The hill reaches            to   a
height of about 1430                       feet     above         the sea.         Many other boulders
occur    near the top of the                       hill, all of         the same Silurian          rock, well
rounded, but none                     quite        so     large     as    the      one   above     described.
Meigle     Hill     stands         by itself, i.e., there are no other hills of equal
altitude within some miles.                        There can be no doubt that all tin'
           mentioned are                  " erratics," but from what quarter
above                                                                        brought
there    is    nothing to show.                     It    would be difficult, however, to con
ceive any other medium of transport than floating ice.

     In looking through                      the    Committee's previous Reports,                     I      find
reference      made to            a   boulder near Doune,                  a    conglomerate,         weighing
about      900 tons.             A    full    account          of this boulder, of the gravel beds
on which           it    lies,    and     of its probable parent rock,                     is   given in my
little book called                "Estuary of            the    Forth" (Edmoustone                &   Douglas.
1871), to which              it   may be allowable to refer (page 41).                             There are,

places    :   —
    On Landrick Estate, one weighing about 360 tons (p. 43).
    At Kcltie Bridge (a mile east of Callander), one weighing about
60 tons        (p.   45).
    On Gartineaber estate, one weighing about 16 tons (p. 43).
    On north side of Teith, bolow Landrick Castle, one weighing about
13 tons (p. 44).
    In   the      Burn of     Cambus,        two weighing             about 13 and          24    tons
respectively (p. 44).
   In the district traversed                    by   the    hill   road    between    Doune          and
Callander, there are multitudes of conglo /iterate boulders                              of smaller
size (p. 44).
    At Cornton brick-work           (between Stirling and the Bridge of
Allan)   I        saw a small conglomerate boulder found in the clay-bed
there.
    On the rocks adjoining Stirling Castle on the north,                              I    observed
small conglomerate               boulders, besides           some of gneiss        and greywacke
 (p.   39).       At Loch Coulter           and      Gillies Hill,        places   about    3    miles
south from Stirling, and from 400 to 600 feet above the                                         sea,   I
found several conglomerate                  boulders, besides some of mica slate and
felspar porphyry, evidently all brought irom the N."\X.
    On Plean estate              (4   miles S.E. of Stirling),              besides   boulders of
granite, gneiss, greywacke, and whinstone, there were some of con
glomerate         (p. 46).
    At Glenbcrnie,           near Torwood            (5    miles S.S.E. of Stirling),     I      found
a   conglomerate        boulder about        6   feet square (p. 48).
  On Dunmore estate (about     miles S.E. of Stirling) there
                                                9                                               is   the
Carlin Stone, conglomerate boulder weighing about 10 tons.
                      a
    This list of        conglomerate        boulders may be considered                   interesting,
as the        position of the parent rock                   is   known, viz., the band which
traverses         the country at Callendar, running                       from that point N.E.
towards           Brackland,          and    S.W.           towards       Aberfoyle      and      Loch
Lomond.
    Assuming that the boulders have all come from this band of con
glomerate         rock, they show           a   transport from the            N.W.        They also
show that they cover             a    wide district of country towards the S.E., not
a   district forming         a    valley, in which            a    glacier might have moved,

   fi06                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
  but a district at various heights above the sea from 20 to 600 feet
  or more.
      The boulders seem to increase in size and number the nearer they
  are to the parent rocks.
      In    the accounts    given of these boulders it will be seen that those
  which are somewhat          elongated    in shape, have their longer axis lying
  N.W. and S.E.,         and that where     striae occur, either on boulder-clay       or
  on rocks, these striae lie in the same direction (pp. 46, 60, 61, 64).
      The conglomerate        boulders are chiefly referred to, because they are
  the most       numerous,     and the position of their         parent   rocks is best
  known.        But the other boulders of         the district  — granites, silurians,
 and porphyries, — all yield confirmatory testimony, as will be seen
 from the positions of their parent rocks, and also their own position.
      One other feature         in this district     may bo mentioned, viz., the
 direction in which the gravel-beds            have been by some means scoured
 out, leaving escars or kaims.              Thus (1) at and near Bucklyvie (10
 miles west of Stilling) there arc three elongated knolls of gravel,
 sand, and boulders,        lying in  an  E. and   W. direction, reaching      a height
 of from 60 to 70 feet above the adjoining district.
      (2) .   On    Blair-Drummond         lands, there     is   a  knoll    composed
 chiefly of sandstone           rock, but partially     covered     with gravel.      It
 is known by the classical           name of the Naidds' Knoll, given prob
 ably by Lord Kames,           a  former proprietor.      It  is in length 90 yards,
and in extreme height about 50 feet,               with a width of about 40 yards
at its greatest       width, which is near the east end.                The direction
of the longer axis of this knoll is                W.N.W. and E.S.E.            At the
head of the valley towards the west, the lowest level is what is called
the Pass of Bolat, and that point bears            W.N.W. from the knoll.           The
rock of the knoll is a soft red sandstone,                which could have been
worn into its present shape by           a  current flowing through the pass in
an easterly direction.
     (3) .   About    2  miles south of Stirling, there is a gravel         hill called
Coxit.        Its length is about     f  of a mile, and its greatest width 300
yards.        Its height is from       80 to 100 feet.         Its longer axis runs
about       N.W. and     S. E.     A current flowing from the westward down
tho     valley upon Stirling Castle rocks, might have had                    a  branch
diverted towards the S.E., and have scoured out the drift deposits,
as    it flowed    near   St Ninians     and Sauchie, leaving Coxit         Hill   as a

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                607
  remnant of the drift.             Between       Sauchie and Gillies          Hills (chiefly
  whinstone), which arc near Coxit, there is                 a narrow valley running
  in   a direction      N.W.    and   S.E., which would help            to guide a current
  running in the direction supposed.
       (-1).  The long escar of gravel passing through Callendar Park and
  Polmont, extending for about              2  miles, runs in an cast and west direc
  tion, because there, any current would flow in a direction approxi
  mative!y parallel with the axis of the valley of the Forth.

      1.   In  the    Valley of the Stinchar, a boulder of fine-grained clay-
 stone, about a cubic yard in size, lies near the hamlet of Poundland.
     It   seemed to bo in its mineralogical character                 identical with the
 rock of the        hill of Glassal,   situated    to the  N.E.,  and also with       a rock
 on the shore to the west near Bennane Head.
     2.    About half       a mile to N. of Colmonell, at          a    height above the
sea     of about      200 feet, a dolerite       boulder occurs       27 x 23 x 12 feet.
 Its longer axis lies N. and S.
     It lies on till, and the till          covers    the serpentine       rock of the S.
slopes of Belhannie           Hill.
     A small boulder, apparently              a fragment    of the larger, lies to the
south.
     About 600 yards E. by S. of this boulder, viz., up the valley,                        a
spur of the same kind of rock projects                   out of the serpentine        of the
hill.
     3.   Lower down the valley there is another boulder of the same
rock.        It   has   been   rent into four pieces, and            the     impression is
suggested         that it had been rent in consequence                 of falling from     a
height.         It  also rests on    till.    The fragments      indicate the boulder
before       being broken to have been               21x21x10         feet in size.      Its
long axis is also N. and S.

     Colonsay.  — The rocks   near the place in this island where the steam
boat calls, viz., on the    N.E.   side, were found to have been smoothed
in a lino bearing     W.N.W. and E.S,E.         ;  but from which direction
the smoothing agents had come was not ascertained.
     North Uirf.- — At Loch Maddy         the rocks were found to have been
smoothed      every where, and in the same line as at Colonsay.
     There arc localities which show unmistakably that the smoothing
 agent had followed a course         from west to    east,  or rather from the
 north of west.       But the hollows or trenches          between  the higher
 grounds and the strike of the old gneiss strata have exercised some
 influence   in diverting the smoothing agent, sometimes one way and
 sometimes another.
     The two trap islets, Maddy More and Maddy Beg, porpoise-nosed
 to the west, and cliffy to the east, vouch for the direction of flow of
 the agent which conferred upon them their striking forms.
     Whilst   at Loch Maddy,     I was accompanied      by   Mr Harvey Brown,
 who has written several well-known works on the natural history of
 Scotland, and has noted glaciation with an active eye, and an intel
 ligent and independent mind.
     Mr Brown had lately returned from            a visit of some duration to
 Newton, on the coast of North TJist,              where   he   had Mr James
 Thomson of Glasgow         as a companion.         He furnished    me   with   a
 sketch and description of a boulder which lies on sloping ground to
 the S.E. of Newton.       It  is  13 x 5 x 4 feet.     It lies with its longer
 axis pointing N.N.W. and S.S.E.             Another is     9x5x5    feet.    He
 stated that   Mr Thomson and         he had spent   some time in examining
 the glaciation of the noigbbouring shore, and found that all the rocks
 were glaciated    from the N.W.         He suggested my applying to          Mr
 Thomson for farther information.             Mr Thomson, in reply,       stated
 that the glaciation on the west shore of the Long Island was all from
 the   west,   varying occasionally between        N.W.     and  S.W., and    he
 added an expression      of surprise    that any one could have made the
 mistake of not seeing this fact, it was so palpably evident.
     Harris. — On Gilebhal      Glass, the southern flanks are striated up

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                            609
to a height       of 500    foet, apparently by ice which came through the
gorge of Tarbert from the west.               Above this hoight the glacial striae
strike down the slopes of the            hill in  every direction.
     On the S.E. slopes of the hill, there are portions of the ribbed
and striated rock which have been torn up, and carried but                     a  short
distance,     then let down and fractured in the fall.
     Clisham and Langa have but few boulders; those on the south
spur of Langa reach a height of 1400 feet, which is nearly the upper
limit of     the glaciation     of those hills.
     While     the glaciation of the east and west           trenches between       the
Harris hills shows a course of transit from west to east, the valleys
of the highest hills showed           ice to have passed down them from the
higher level, whatever the direction of these valleys may                 be.
     West Loch Tarbert. — Though rock does appear between the eastern
and western         arm of the sea which impinge hero so closely upon one
another      as to   warrant tho above common appellation, yet the isthmus
is for the most part made up of boulder-studded till.                  One or two of
 the boulders are of a close-grained            hornblendic     rock, and doubtless
have been portions of a band of rock of an identical character situated
a   few hundred yards westward on the north shore of Loch Tarbert.
     As   tho nature and structure of thia crypto-crystalline bed is very
 marked       and     unmistakable,     I  regard    the abovo    as unimpeachable
 evidence     of  the course of the ice through the pass        ; and  it must stand
 as  such till    a  similar bed is found on the shores of East Loch Tarbert.
 For such       I searched    without success, though      I found   a characteristic
 bod of graphic granite, no fragment of which, however,                 did   I find  in
 the   till which plugs the throat of the pass.
     Glen Scramble. — This deep glen lies between Gilabhal Glass and
 Skiam Hill.          At  the bridge which crosses the stream issuing from tho
 glen,    I found     a number of loose masses of an ignoous rock, identical
 with    a rock forming a dyke coming out above the bridge.                       These
 masses, therefore,        have come down the glen, viz., from tho east; but
 if they    were     brought down by ice, there could have been no great
 mass of ice, the distance of conveyance being quite trifling              in  amount.
     Scalpa Island. — Walking           eastward from the village,      I fell in with
 a  boulder,     7x6x6       feet, of a characteristic   granite, butted up against
 the rocky steps of           a  small knoll of gneiss rocks on its east side,
  about    35 feet above       H.W.   mark.      A  sketch of this boulder is given

  610                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
  on plate  XVIII.    fig. 6.  On the face of the hill directly opposite on the
  Harris shore, situated to the N.W., a great hed of the same granite
  rock is distinctly      visible.     Two other granite boulders similarly
  "          "
                occur to the east of this one.
    stopped
     Shiant Islands. — On the upper surface of these islands, three in
  number,   all of  basaltic   trap, and reaching      to a height of about 500
 foet, there are no boulders of any foreign rock.                On the southern
 island there     is a line of     bouldors not much rounded,            which     lie
 directly east of   a spot where      there has been a palpable      rending.
     Two of the islands are connected            by a ridge or
                                                                  " ayre " of   loose
 materials,   over    which    the    waves now occasionally roll.          On the
                   of this " ayre
                                    "
 western slope                         there are much worn fragments of two
 foreign rocks, viz., hornblendic gneiss and Cambrian sandstone.
    The gneiss blocks are about          2 cubic   feet in size.    The conglome
rate blocks are sometimes as small as eggs ; two of these, but none
of the gneiss, were found on the east side of the "ayre."
    On   a stretch   of shore along       the  N.W.   side of the most northern
island, conglomerate       blocks also occur.
    The only place in this part of Scotland whore            I know of    a similar
conglomerate     rock is on the Eye Peninsula of Lewis, a short distance
east   of Stornoway, and about 30 miles to the north of the Shiants.
    There is one other feature         about the Shiant Islands which seems
worthy of notice.          The    two highest islands, viz., Garbh            Eilan
(rough island), and Eilan            an    Tighe, lie north and south of one
another; whilst the third, viz., Eilan Mhuire, lies to the cast, and
does not reach so high a level as the other two.
    The upper surface of the two largest and highest islands, both
when viewed from         a distance     and when examined       in detail, present
such soft and gently-sweeping risings and hollows that ice                 in  some
form or other appeared to have passed over and pressed on the surface
of the rocks.      It  had evidently gone over        Eilan   an Tighe from       W.
to  K,   and over the southern part of Garbh Eilan (lying to the
north) in the same direction, but over the higher parts and main
bulk of the island from the S.W.
    This movement and direction of the ice on these islands is corro
borated    by the position of       a   number of boulders on both of these
islands consisting of the basaltic          rock of the islands, which are all
on the east side of the most southerly of these islands,               and   in the

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                            611
 more northerly to the east of one                or more    spots    where    there has
been a palpable rending of rocks by some powerful agent moving on
them from the westward.
    Now,     it  is    rather   remarkable that the island of Eilan Mhuire,
situated to the east of the other            two islands, presents on its surface
no traces of the same smoothing which                     occur   on the     other two
islands.       It is   lower in level than the other two.          If  it was ice which
passed over and rubbed on them moving towards                       the east, why did
not it also pass over and rub on                Eilan Mini ire i      If it was a sheet
of land ice, the fact of Eilan Mhuire being                   a little lower in level
should rather have ensured contact by the ice.                   If,  however,    the ice
was floating,       it  may have passed over the lower island without reach
ing it.
    Skye.   — An examination of          the north-east part of the island from
 Aird Point       to Portree was made, chiefly along the coast, and partially
among the hills.
    While     there      was found throughout         evidence    of vast denudation
 with frequent rounded contours (as along the lino of cliffs above the
 Kilt rock), the rocks nowhere bore groovings or even scratchings.
    The cols between            the numerous       heights of the central range of
hills  were narrowly examined,             as,  in  the case of a movement         across
 the island from either          N.W.  or  N.E.    these  hills must     have been sub
jected to     a great     amount of "scour."
    At   the several       cols, averaging     about 1300 feet above        the sea, the
water-sheds which fall to the south commence with the most singular
precipitancy, there being hardly             a   yard or two between the brink of
the precipice        (which falls sheer to the N.E.) and the trickling of a
 marshy stream flowing in the opposite direction.                   Between many of
 these cols, peaks of rock shot up to a height of 2000 feet and more.
    There were no hollows and no contours which could be assigned
 to ice.     The slope on both sides of the stream-trench                   was such as
 would result merely from the sliding soak of water.
    No    true   boulders were any w:here to be seen.                That the summit
 of this range has not been ice-worn, may be deduced from the abrupt
 ness with which fragments of an upper bed of basaltic                    columns shoot
 up with a pillared steepness which show no rounding of their angles,
 or abrasion of any of their terminations.
    A  loose pillar (of which a sketch was taken) points the same way.

 612                        Proceedings of the Royal Society
This pillar, retaining all its original                   sharpness of angle, lies on              its
side at the very highest part of the whole range.
     Though there is no evidence                    that ice has been over the top of
these cliff's, there is evidence that               it   has been at the bottom.
     The southern shore of Stainchol Bay                    is,   with the little island        at its
eastern horn, stretched              like   a   half-opened hand, so       as to catch       every
thing which may have been carried from the north along the eastern
shore.
     Among the rounded               masses lying on the beach, there are blocks of
the same Cambrian conglomerate                     which occurs at the Shiant Islands,
and of        a   larger size.
     On account           of the position of Stainchol Island,                 it   is   not likely
that these could have come from any point east of north.
     On the island itself, no boulders were                       seen   except on the       S.W.
shore     ;   several     consisting of dolerite, in which labradorite                     is   well
seen, lie here.           A   rock of the same nature occurs about 50 yards to
N.N.W.
     Loch Torridon          and Loch Maree. — The position of " Tfic thousand
hills" (consisting of dirt             cones and         delta heaps) in Glen Torridon,
and the smoothed                 rocks at the head of the glen, leave no room for
doubt that          a   true glacier had descended this glen from the north and
east.         But, on the other hand, the till at the very summiHevel
between Glen Docharty and the head of Loch Boisk, has indubitably
been water-dressed,              and the dressing         agent seems to have             come up
Glen Docharty.
     The ice had apparently come out of every corry of the eastern sides
of Leagach          and Eye, to merge into the Torridon glacier.
     But, on the other hand, there were found on Scuir na Convaran
(a   N.E.      quartzite      spur of Ben         Eye) boulders of hornblende rock,
hornblendic gneiss, and of Cambrian sandstone.
     The hornblendic boulders were very similar to the hornblende of
Ben Arrichar on the north shore of Maree, 13 miles to the west
ward.
     As   they lay much in line, in order to ascertain                   that they were not
merely the turned-over fragments of                  a   vein, though such      a    thing was
most improbable, the ground was carefully scanned by several pairs
of eyes, but no fixed mass was found.

    Blank Mount district, — having Loch Levin                on the north, Moor of
Rannoch on the        east,   and the   Linnhe Loch        on the west.
    1.  A train of boulders having          been noticed        by me on the north
slopes of the valley of the Beathard, west of Loch Tulla, viz., on the
low slopes of Stob Ghabhar and Ben Toaig, and also several huge
blocks upon the shores of Loch Dochard,                 I  felt a desire to seek for
the parent rocks.
    The boulders on Stob           Ghnbhar were of         a pecular white granite,
and were in size on an average up to 10 x 10 x 7 feet.
    Ben Toaig and Ben Terrick arc hills of gneiss.                In  the col between
these hills, at a height of 2530 feet, the same variety of white granite
boulders were found, with an average size of about                      a cubic  yard,
much worn.        There was glaciation on the rocks (but much effaced),
from S.W. to N.E.
    Stob Ghabhar is also a gneiss         hill.     No boulders     were seen except
on its southern slopes, i.e., at the spot already             mentioned.
    Ben Starrav was ascended.             Its rocks   were different from that of
the boulders, as they consisted          of a flesh-eoloursd      granite.
    The hills called        Scon    Ghearraen and        Meal     Odhur were next
examined,     forming west spurs from Stub Ghabhar.                     The rocks on
them, as well as on Glass Bein Mohr, were found to be granite,                     but
not exactly the same         as that of the boulders.
    Albannach hill      was found, from its first eastern cliff to its summit,
to consist of granite        identiccd   with that   of   the boulders.     Blocks of
the rock strewed       its cross-corries in numbers ; and the whole process
of boulder formation may be said to be still displayed upon its
slopes.
    On the east and south-east sides of the hill there seemed to have
been ice moving towards           the south and towards the east.
    On its northern side, similar traces were visible in the great corry
under the sharp        peak, showing a movement              first to the north, and
 then    a confluence       with    glaciation   from     a   west   corry of Meall
 Targuinn, thereafter        curving westward, and sweeping towards Glen
 Etive.
   This   great hill, reaching to a height of 3425 feet above the sea, seems
 to have    been   the cradle of local glaciers,        and also the source from

614                         Proceedings of the Royal Society
which the boulders near Tulla had been carried about ten miles in a
direction E.S.E.
    As it   was thought desirable                      to see whether these boulders                           could
be traced      farther to the eastward,                     I    tracked them back to the west
and north shores of the lake, and thereafter                                     for   2 or 3 miles           up the
course of the water of Tulla.                        They evidently diminished in numbers
towards the       east.           Some         of the boulders at Loch Tulla were about
8   cubic feet in       size.
    A    search was next made                     along         the    southern range of hills, of
which       Meal Buldh,               Ben Creachan,               and       Ben Achallater                   are   the
highest.      But      no boulders of the same or of any kind were found
on them.
    Thesu boulders, therefore, had been carried, as                                    it   were, in a stream,
and one of no great width, towards the S. E.
    The valley, which gradually ascends westward from                                                     Loch Tulla
towards     the great massive                   hill of Starrav,           becomes very narrow im
mediately to the east of Loch Doehard.
    If   any powerful agent passed through this valley eastward, it is
probable     that there would                  be great     obstruction and                 a   violent pressure
on and rending of the adjoining rocks.
    The lower part of the pass contains much till, and occasionally
rock rises up through the             till with finely                 smoothed hunches, showing
striations from the              W.N.W.
    On the south            side      of   the lake there are some enormous                                 boulders,
mostly      angular,        several        of which are broken or fractured, as                                 if by
falling from      a    height.             A    sketch is given of one of these, fig. 7 on
plate    XVI T   1.,   as   it   is   the largest      I    have seen or heard of in Scotland,
except one in Arran.                    Its     size   is   45   x    22   x    26 feet, and amounting
therefore    in weight to about 1900 tons.                                 It   consists of mica gneiss,
and lies upon          till.       The view in the figure                       is   taken       from       N.N.W.
Other boulders of                a    similar rock occur at the same place, nearly
equally large.
    The hill immediately to the south of this boulder                                           is   composed      of
a   similar sort of rock               ;   so    that very possibly, nay probably, the
boulder may have been detached from the hill.                                          But      it   is   so far from
the hill, and the intervening ground                         is   of such        a     nature, that nothing
but ice could have brought                      it   into its present position.
    The rocks at this place arc much rounded, and show                                           striae      running

from the westward.
    2.   Loch Creran. — On the east side of this loch there are               a number
of boulders,       some of very large          size, of which    notice was taken in
the Committee's two last Reports.
     My attention         was drawn to these by our Convener, so that in
 the event of my visiting              that district during the past summer              I
 might endeavour          to discover from what quarter these boulders had
 come.
     I  was glad to find myself able to comply with this request, and                    I
 spent several days         in examining      the district in question.
     On the       banks of       the Creran there       are two distinct      classes   of
 boulders, differing in mineralogical composition.
     Those in the lower part of Glen Creran, near the bridge at the
 head     of the loch and between             Invercreran House and Fasnacloich,
  are  much weather-worn, dense in structure,              and dark in colour.       The
 hornblende in them is dark-brown in colour, with but little felspar,
 and they contain         a  little bronzy biotite.
      In  a higher part of the glen, at and above Fasnacloich House, the
  boulders have much felspar, which is pale in colour                ; also hornblende
  which is always green, sometimes                 light-green, and    a  little quartz,
  but almost no biotite.
      The rocks of the glen             adjoining the places where both sets of
  boulders lie are quite different from the rocks                      composing       the
  boulders    ;  I  therefore     made a diligent      search among the      hills in the
  neighbourhood for the parent rocks.
      The first-mentioned set of boulders, which                I may call the Inver
  creran boulders,        I   found     as regards   mineral composition to        be the
  same, or      very nearly the           same, as a band       of rock in the Coire
  Dim of Fraochaid, at a height of from 1500 to 1700 feet above the
  sea.     This corry     leads up from Glen Creran about 4 or 5 miles to
  the   N.N.E. of Invercreran.             The only mineralogical difference which
  I  could detect was, that in the rocks on the hill, there was perhaps
  rather less biotite.
      The place where the rock composing the Fasnacloich boulders was
  found is in     a  col lying    a little north of   the fountain-tarn of the River
  Durer,    a   river running into the Linnhe               Loch   at  Coil Buy.      The
  col lies between Stab Coire Dhu and Steb                  Coire Ruadh, at     a  height

616                          Proceedings             of   the    Royal Society
of 1940 feet.          A number of blocks of this rock were found by me
at the west         foot of Miall an Aodain, a hill situated to the east
ward.
    How        these two sets of boulders have been carried to their                                   present
positions is a question on which                            I    have yet         formed     no        decided
opinion.          As    perhaps bearing on that question,                          however,     it     is   rijdit
to mention that the rocks near the fountain-tarn of the River                                           Durer,
at a height of 1940 feet, are much glaciated                                 and apparently from              the
west.
    Striae occur on a clay-slate                 rock about             \   of a mile south from the
place     just    mentioned,             just before        the ascent         of Stob Coire Rucuih
commences,          and at           a   height of nearly 2000                    feet, which          show     a
movement          from      a   little to the north of west.                      These    facts       seem to
suggest that some powerful smoothing and striating agent had passed
over this district              from the west, and at a level exceeding                         2000 feet
above the sea.              But      west from the place where                    these smoothed             and
striated rocks occur, there are no                    hills      so   high    as to produce        a   glacier,
unless, indeed,            a glacier      had    come through Glen Tarbert, which is a
continuation of Loch Sunart, and crossed what is now the Linnhe
Loch.          Loch Sunart and Glen Tarbert occupy                                a   hollow in the dis
trict which runs in              a   direction about             W.N.W.        and     E.S.E.
   It    is,   however, proper to add, that on the rock where these                                W.N.W.
striae occur, there             are cross striae           overlying and cutting into these,
which cross        striae    indicate       a   movement              from the    S.W.      These           cross
striae   being more sharp and minute than those first made, indicate
more recent and also less powerful action.                                  Can   it   have been that          a
sea existed       at   a    level exceeding               2000    feet above the present level,
with ice in  which was floating about in eddying currents, among
                  it
what are now high peaked hills, tearing rocks out of the shallows,
and pushing them over what were then submarine reefs                                       1
   In    regard        to the boulders at Ivercreran                         and Fasnacloich, they
manifestly have come from the particular hills above specified                                          ;    but
whether dropped from floating ice, or carried by glaciers,                                      it     is   with
our present information impossible to say.
   The     striae last       mentioned,         as   occurring at the height of 2000 feet,
pointing about          W.N.W.,            bear on the top of Fraochaidh,                   a   hill        2883

 there is the deep gorge of the Coire Ruadh, which                 if it  then existed
 would have conducted any glacier from that hill in                 a  different direc
 tion, viz., towards the N.W., and not towards Loch Creran, which
 lies almost due south from Fraochaidh.
     3.   Upon the south slopes of Stab Col re Ruadh there is              a boulder of
 the peculiar porcelain porphyry worked at Kentallen                  inAppin.       The
 boulder is about      a square    yard in size.   That it is  a  boulder, is evident
 from the fact of the rocks of the hill where it lies being totally
 different.    Its height     iibovc the sea is 2250 feet.         Now,     a porcelain
 rock of exactly the same kind occurs                among     the Ben a       Bheithir
 hills,   at  exactly the        same height above        the  sea,    about midway
 between     Craig Ohorm and Sgorr Dhonuill, which is                    3   or  4 miles
 to the    N.N.W.
     Assuming that the boulder came from that point, it must have
 crossed two valleys, each of which             is less than 700 feet above           the
 sea.     How it could      have    crossed these, except      on floating ice,      it  is
 difficult to  see.
     4.  There is another boulder among these hills deserving notice.                   It
 is one of Schistose Breccia, lying on the east side of Fraochaidh,                     at
 a  height of 2235 feet.        The rock of the    hill  here is a Schistose Gneiss.
 Now rocks of       Schistose Breccia occur between          the two peaks of Ben
 a  Bheithir just     mentioned,      situated   to the    N.N.W.       This boulder
in like manner must have been carried across the deep valley of the
 Durer to have reached its present position.
    5.   The col between Creran and Al/t na Guorran showed glaciation
coming down from the conies of the rough Saorr na Ulaidh, and out
of   a  corry on Ben Fhionnlaidh.            Many loose and angular blocks of
the hUls themselves,         much confusion, and smashing              of every kind,
and the glaciated         contours,    twisting away to go down both glens
in    opposite   directions, S.E. and S.W.,             is all   that this      locality
discloses.     The deep cut of Glen Ure showed evidence of movement
down it.
    In reviewing       the   information      obtained by me regarding             these
Creran boulders,       I feel   that there ought to be farther study of them,
before their mode of transport can be said               to have been discovered.
On the one hand, the clustered             manner in which the boulders lie on
the west of     Miall    an Aodain, and at two spots on the east side                   of
Glen Creran, is suggestive of blocks having rolled over the terminal

618                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
front of glaciers   ; or perhaps of a lateral moraine, when      regard is hii
to there being in some places a train of blocks         in almost single       file.
But, on the other hand,         I cannot shut my eyes to the     possibility      of
these boulders having been carried or pushed into position            by   ice in
another form, which came from the west through Glen              Tarbert ; an!
which, when it reached the Durer valley, was blocked by the hup:
masses of Seuir na         Ulaidh and Ben Fionnlaidh,        and  then   forced
to sweep down the          trench   of Glen  Oreran,   carrying boulders,     an   J
lodging them where they now lie.
   District of    Glencoe. — On the western        grass clad  slopes  of Sron
Coire Odhar Bcg, a       hill north of Glen   Coc, in the higher part    of    the
glen, a number of small boulders, much rounded, were observed                of   a
peculiar granite.       It  was whiter and coarser     grained than the well-
known Ardshiel granite, and had a little hornblende in it.
   They were in composition altogether          different from the rocks of
the  hill  on which they were first noticed, which consists of schistose
breccia.
   The hills to the eastward           I had  previously examined (Ben a
Chrulaide     and  others),     and knew that they consisted of epidotk
gneiss.
   I therefore  thought it probable that the birthplace of the boulders
would   be somewhere to the       westward, so in that direction  I proceeded.
   On reaching the Aonach-Eagach range,           I found the same boulders,
fewer in numbers but markedly larger in size.
   They were lying almost exclusively on the eastern side of                 the
narrow ridge leading up to the summit, and almost              on the summit
of the nameless peak           marked 2938 feet on the 1-inch Ordnance
map.      On the next rounded        haunch (2880 feet) they were not seen;
but they reappeared on the ridge as it ascended to the eastern peak
of  Meall Dearg (3090          feet), and almost up to the summit of the
western peak (3118 feet).
   Their position here was most peculiar.            They lay upon     a ridge
not many times wider than their own bulk, and only on the               eastern
slopes of that ridge     ;   while on the lower hills where they were       first
seen, the same boulders lay on the west slopes.
   The parts between Meall Dearg and Meall Garbh, extending to            about
half  a mile, are quite inaccessible,     and could not be examined.         But
so far as the peaked rocks        composing   this district could be seen,     no

boulders were on thom, and, indeed, on account of their sharp-edged
ridges boulders were not likely to have lodged on them.
   On the hills of Sgornan Fiannaidh (3188 feet) and Sgor an Caiche
(2430 feet), situated farther west, these boulders were not found, nor
any rock of the same description.
   I   proceeded to the next hills, of somewhat                          greater         height, about
6 or 7 miles         to the west, to         the south of Balachulish,                     viz., Bhein
Balm, Sgorr Dherag, Sgor Dhonuill,                    and Creag Ghorm.
   In     the bed of a stream which               descends the steep eastern face of
Creag Ghorm, at about 1500 feet above the                           sea, a     belt of rock occurs
identical      with that of the boulders               ;    also        along    a great       part    of
the semicircular         ridge which            connects        Creag        Ghorm with Sgorr
Dhonuill,       at   a height       averaging        2250       feet,     there       is    rock very
similar to that of the boulders,                 there     being rather less mica in                   it,
and only occasional hornblendic crystals.                       Biddian         nam        Bian   (3786
feet) was       twice ascended,           but   it   presented          no     trace of the rock
sought for.          But though         the rocks at the two other places indicated
were found to be almost identical in mineralogical composition with
that of the boulders,          I        am not satisfied            that they supplied the
boulders.        The spots where these rocks occur arc only from 1500                                  tu
2300 feet above the          sea    ;   whereas the boulders              on some parts of the
Aonach Eagach to the eastward                   were at     a   height of 3100 feet above
the sea.
  Therefore     I     admit that there must still remain some uncertainty
as to the      birthplace of these boulders.                   An   attempt          has been made
by some geologists          to explain how boulders may be transported                                 to
positions above the level of the parent rocks                       ;    and    if   that theory      be
correct   it   may overcome the difficulty referred to.
  It    is   possible   also    that the rocks at Creag                      Ghorm and Sgorr
Dhonuill       may have formerly reached                   a   higher level          ;    and in that
view   it    may be remarked            that at present the rocks of these hills are
even now, under the action of the weather, breaking off into huge
blocks.
  Of    course   it   may   still   be possible to find the peculiar rock of these
boulders on more elevated hills elsewhere.                          Ben Cruachan and other
hills to the south and west reach                a   height of more than 3100 feet                     ;
but
  I       have been on most of these hills, and                  I      do not think that on
any of them there are          rocks which would produce the boulders.

620                           Proceedings        of the Royal Society
   It   is therefore          a fact of considerable             importance bearing on any
theory of transport, that these boulders on Aonach Eagach                                    occupy
positions much              higher in level than any of the hills in a vary wide
extent    of country          ;    so   that it is difficult,    if   not impossible, to adopt
for them the explanation of any local glacier.
   I    have adverted             to the peculiar position of the boulders on                   Meall
Dearg, where            at a height of 3100 feet they lay upon a ridge                            not
many times wider than their own bulk, or rather on the sides                                 of that
ridge facing the E. or N.E.                     I am    not able to offer any satisfactory
explanation of this feature.                   I would    like   again to study the positions
'if these      boulders.          They must have been brought there by ice, which
may have         come from the               N.W., and stuck           there    among      the high
peaks    till it    melted, and allowed the boulders to subside on or near
the top of the ridge.                   My explorations about Glen Creran led to the
supposition of          a   flow of ico through Glen Tarbert on the N.W. side
of Linnhe Loch.                   This might possibly        also account        for the boulders
on Aonach Eagach.                       But in that   case, where      could the parent rocks
be?
   (Though         it   does        not seem to have any direct bearing upon the
question, yet it may be well to record the fact that the bed of the
Cona     is,
         for   short distance, about midway between the little lake
                   a
and the hamlet of Clachach, cut through                           a   rock very similar to,          if
not identical with, that of the boulders.)
                        III. NOTES BY WILLIAM JOLLY,                       Esq.
 On the Carried Boulders on the South Shores                             of    the   Moray FirtJi.
   In    answer to your request,               I    send some notes,            supplementary        to
those of last year, on the above subject.
   The      Dirriemore             Granite     seems to be more            widely        distributed
towards        the east than        I      anticipated.     Since last year,         I   visited the
place where      I      had       formerly found       it   in   situ, on the road between
Dingwall and Ullapool, where                     it   appears    in the valley of the Black-
water, about and below its junction with Strathvaich.                                    None   of   it

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                            621
has been carried        westwards     between    this part of the valley and
Loch Broom,        a tract which     I have    examined     more than once.        It
has been carried altogether         towards the east, in accordance        with the
general slope of the country.           This granite would      seem, however,     to
occupy a wider and more elevated area             in  the Ben   Wy vis mountains
than is shown in the Blackwater, from which it has been borno and
dropped along the south shores of the Moray Firth, after being
carried down the several           valleys that drain this range           into the
Cromarty Firth, as well          as   down through Strathpeffer, and down
the    lower valley of the Conon below its junction with the Black-
water near Tor Achilty, in Contin.
    In   the valley of the Alness, for example,         it is widely    distributed,
having evidently come from some centre near its head waters.                    Good
specimens      of it may bo seen round the village of Alness, and along
the shore between        it and Invergordon, skirted by the public              high
way.       It has been carried     across the Cromarty        Firth, and   scattered
abundantly in large and striking masses over the whole of the Black
Isle, from end to end.            Good examples of it may be seen at its
northern extremity round Cromarty, and along its central ridge on
the road between that town and Fortrose, large pieces being easily
seen on the moor near Peddieston, a few miles                 south of Cromarty,
and along the road between               Invergordon      Ferry and the Sutora
 It is  also found extensively along the whole of the east shore of the
Black Isle,     and has been carried         thence eastwards towards Buckie.
It  exists plentifully    all over the Laigh of Moray, and may be well
wen along the seashore           there,    especially   between     Burghead and
Lossiemouth.
    The      Strathorriek    Liver-coloured      Conglomerate       I  have    found
numerous       additional examples       of, from its source on the east shore
of Loch Ness north of Inverfarigaig, onwards to Lossiemouth.
    There would seem, however,            to be two varieties     of conglomerate
distributed throughout the         Laigh of Moray — the        above easily distin
guished rock, and another consisting of more angular components                  and
entirely without the liver-coloured quartzite or porphyry.                Examples
of the latter     may be seen   in the old quarry of Oolitic limestone at the
classical Linksfield,     near   Flgin,   embedded     in the boulder-clay there,
one    of  the masses on the south side of the quarry being very large.
The Douping Stone           on the top of the Califer         Hill,  east of Forres,

622                   Proceedings    of the Royal Society
mentioned in my notes of last year, is certainly of the Stratherrick
liver-coloured variety ; but the block on the top of Roseisle Hill,
also mentioned by me, may bo              of  the   other.    This second con
glomerate     would     seem,   from various indications, to have           been
transported at an earlier period than the Stratherrick, for it is
found embedded at greater or less depths in the prevalent boulder-
clay of Morayshire;        whereas    the   Stratherrick    rock is seldom,     if
ever, thus buried, being confined more to the upper surface of the
country. The glaeiation of Morayshire shows two main directions
of the scratches, indicating        two lines of ice movement          from   the
westward,     as   exhibited admirably on the ridge of Carden Moor,
near Alves     station.    These scratches      point respectively 13° N. of
W., and    6° S.   of W.,  as the  directions from which the ice has come.
The second conglomerate         may have been carried across the           Moray
Firth from Ross-shire, like        the Dirriemore      granite,   in the line of
the former scratches.
    The red orthoclase Kinsteary Granite, found in situ near Nairn,
is very abundantly distributed from this point towards the east,
onwards    beyond Buckie.
    Mr Linn of     the Geological Survey, at present engaged in mapping
the district round     Elgin,  has found these three rocks widely spread
all over the Laigh of Moray, and has taken the fullest notes of the
 composition and positions of the various carried blocks there, which
 will  bo embodied       in his map of the         region,   and will form an
 important contribution to the question of the transportation of rocks
 along the south shores of the Moray
                                              Firth.
    I append     some notes supplied to me by         Mr Wallace of     the High
 School, Inverness,     mentioned    in last  year's notes,  regarding their dis
 tribution on the north coast of Banffshire.           These carry the account
 of the transport of boulders eastwards to Cullen.             It would be most
 desirable  that the Committee should,         if possible,  obtain information
 regarding   their farther distribution through Aberdeenshire, and thus
                                             Ocean.

                   IV. NOTES       BY     THOMAS D. WALLACE,                     Esq.
      On llns Curried Boulders in (he Parishes                      of Enzie and Rathytn.
                                           Banffshire.
      Having revisited this district at Christmas 1879, and examined                                     it
more carefully than on former occasions,                     I   found further proof of the
eastern flow of the great               ice-sheet    that at one time traversed the
whole of the southern shore of the Moray Firth.                             In    the neighbour
hood of the Enzie post-office, I found numerous                              boulders of the
Dirriemore granite, none of them so large                        as those   that were dug out
during the excavations             for the Buckie Harbour, and mentioned last
year in the Committee's Report.
    Numerous small boulders of the Elgin Cornstones lie scattered                                       all
over the lower part of the district.                       Several are to be seen in the
Gollaehy Burn,        a   little   to tho west of Buckie.
    Conglomerate       boulders are rather rare.                 Except the few remaining
stones    forming the "Stone Circle of Unburn,"                             near     Portgordon,
I   found only one, about           a   quarter of a mile east from Dry burn.
    A very characteristic          specimen        of Kinsteary Granite is seen close
beside the harbour of Buckie..                Smaller pieces may easily                  be picked
up on the fields          along the shore.               A well-marked           feature          of   the
schists which underlie the Old Bed Sandstone in this district, is the
frequent occurrence of large veins of                 ca-lc spar, quartz,         and quartzites.
Specimens of these are also numerous                      in the drift.
    A line         of Cairngorm (water-worn) was picked up by a
             specimen
labourer on the high ridga to the south of the district, locally known
as the
          " Hill of Altmore."            It measures 2 inches thick at the one end
and 3 inches at the other.                It is about 4J inches in breadth.   This
man, ignorant of its value, took it to Aberdeen and had                                 it polished
on both sides by some friend at the granite works.                          This    has rendered
it quite transparent,        so that one can read with the greatest ease any
thing placed under          it.
    One    section of Boulder-Clay            is    deserving of notice.                It   is   in the
wood of Pathhead, on tho estate of Cairnfield,                        a   little to the south of
the    Enzie post-ofliee.          It   consists    of   a   fine    plastic clay of             a   dark
bluish-black        colour, overlaid by the well-known                      red    boulder-clay.
The blue clay represents the denudation of the schists, and the red
that of the Old lied Sandstone.                     Notwithstanding           a     very minute

024                   Proceedings         of the Royal Society
examination of every burn in the district,               I  failed to find any of the
blue clay on the lower ground.                  This   I take    to be an additional
proof uf the easterly How of the ice.
    As far    as the    boulder evidence in this district         goes,   it proves    con
clusively that the ice-tlow was from the W., or a little to the S. of                   W.
    All   along    the south shore of the Moray            Firth    there are scattered
boulders        of   conglomerate,        hornblende,     and     dirriemore      (besides
other)     granites.       In the neighbourhood of Inverness, these would
indicate      a  drift from the N.N.W. and one from the S.W., both
tending E., or        a  little to the N. of E.        The boulders of hornblende
might have come from the N.W.                      The only place where            I  have
seen hornblende in situ in the neighbourhood of Inverness, near
which are found numerous                  boulders of that rock, is at Raven's-
Rock near Strathpeffer.
                               (Signed)         David Milne Home,            Convener.
    Mr Milne         Home,        Chairman     of  the Boulder       Committee,       after
presenting the preceding Report, made the following remarks : —
    I may explain that, to save the time               of the meeting, and also to
 afford    to   members         information     regarding the       operations     of   the
 Committee         during      the     past  year,   copies    of   the    Report     were
 circulated with the billets for the present                 meeting    ;
                                                                          — and for the
 same purpose, as Convener of the Committee,                    I now proceed      to give
 an abstract of the chief features of the Report.
                 I. Boulders       in  Nairn, Moray, and Banffshire.
    I   begin     by alluding        to the boulders in these counties,            because
 the notes applicable to them               are  in  some sense a continuation            of
 the part of last year's Report applicable to these counties.
    In   these counties        there are two classes of important boulders, —
 Granites and Conglomerates:
    Of granites there are four kinds, distinguishable by the ingredients,
 and by the different districts where their parent rocks are situated.
    There     are,  First,   the boulders, consisting of a very peculiar gran ito,
 with lenticular pieces of dark mica, arranged in pretty regular layers,
 through     a  pinkish mass, giving to it some resemblance to                 a stratified
 deposit.       The granite of these boulders has been identified by                    Mr

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                        625
Jolly   of Inverness with the granite rocks of the Dirrio Muir, a tract
in Ross-shire situated     to the west of Ben   Wyvis,  and lying about half
way between the east and west coasts.             Theso boulders have been
transported in a E.S.E. direction across the Cromarty Firth, over
the district of the Black        Isle, and across the Moray Firth, into the
low grounds of Moray         and   Banff.   The distance travelled must be
nearly 100 miles.        Second, there are two other granites, one red and
the other grey, which have been transported from the hills forming
the sides of the great Caledonian Valley, — called the Loch Ness
granite and the Stratherrick granite.
    These boulders also are found in Moray- and BanlF-shircs,        and show
a line of transport not quite the same as the           Dirrie Muir    granite,
viz., about E. by N.
    Mr Jolly    says, that the Stratherrick      granite boulders have been
seen by him on the        hills  south of the Great Valley, up to a height
of 1500 feet.       But  the Boulder Committee, three or four years ago,
received    through Captain White of the Ordnance Survey, notice              of
these boulders, having been          found by his surveyors at heights of
2250 feet, the parent rocks being on hills 2000 feet in height.            This
fact is mentioned in the Committee's second annual Report.
    These    boulders,  before reaching Morayshire,     must have travelled
also about 100 miles.
    A  fourth class of granite boulders in Morayshire and Banffshire
is a beautifully pink-coloured rock, quarried at a place          called   Kin-
steary   in Nairnshire.      No boulders of this peculiar granite      are seen
east  of the parent rock.
    What    has now been said of Granite boulders, as regards transport,
applies to the boulders       of  Conglomerate.     There arc two kinds of
conglomerate      rock forming them, and they come from different dis
tricts, — one in the Great Valley itself, which it crosses near the hill
called Meal Fourvounie        ; the other in Ross-shire, at some distance
to the north of the Great Valley.
    The Committee have,          in  regard  to  these  Moray-    and    Banff
shire boulders, obtained          valuable notes from Mr      Jolly and Mr
Wallace, both resident in Inverness.            The information   given    as to
the position of the parent rocks is gratifying           in this respect, that
when, three years ago, many of these boulders were examined by
myself,    I  drew an inference regarding the quarter from which they

 G26                Proceedings of      the  Royal Society
had probably come, founded solely on the position              and  attitude of
the boulders themselves,          the correctness   of which inference         has
now been confirmed by the discovery of the                 particular districts
where the parent rocks are situated.
              II.   Professor Forster Huddle's Explorations.
   The Professor's survey last year began on the West of Scotland,
and extended      from Ayrshire to Loch Torridon         in Argvleshire    ; and
also into the interior,       near  the  districts called the    Black Mount
and Glencoe.
   I  was especially     glad, on receiving the Professor's notes, to        find
that he had visited several of the islands of the Hebrides           ;  because,
as was   explained in our last year's Report, the problem of the mode
of transport becomes less complex on islands where there are neither
hills 1101 valleys suitable for the formation of local glaciers.
   1.  The first island visited was         Colonsay, — on which, however,
nothing seems to have been found, beyond rock striations running
W.N.W.      and   E.S.E., but which       way   the movement     was,   did not
appear.
   2.  The next island was Uist.          There, in like manner,       the rock
striations   were    W.N.W. and E.S.E., and it           was there    seen that
the striating agent come from the westward.               The Professor adds,
that " the hollows or trendies between the higher grounds and the
strike of the old gneiss strata         have   exercised   some influence,      in
diverting the smoothing agent, sometimes             one way and sometimes
another."
   At Loch Maddy in Uist, Professor Heddlo               met with   Mr Harvey
Brown, who had been for some time surveying there               for objects of
natural history, in company with Mr James Thomson, a member of the
Glasgow Geological Society.          Both of these gentlemen had also been
studying the phenomena          of boulders and striated rocks in the north
part of Uist.       Mr Brown supplied Professor Heddle with a note of
the size  of several boulders (which arc specified in this Report), and
he recommended        the Professor to write to    Mr Thompson for farther
information.      The Professor did     so, and the answer he received from
Mr Thompson        was,
                         " That   the glaeiation on the west shore of the
Long Island was all from the west, varying occasionally between
N.W.    and  S.W.    ;" and    he  "added (the Professor     says) an cxpres

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1879-80.                       627
sion of surprise, that any one could have made the mistake                    of not
seeing this fact,     it  was so palpably evident."
    3.     In Harris,     Professor    Heddle    found that on        the southern
flanks of the hill called Gilebhall Glass, rocks were striated up to                 a
height of 500 feet, apparently by ice which (ho says) came through
the gorge of Tarbert from the west.
    At this    gorge, he found in the    Till, boulders of   a close-grained   horn
blende rock, doubtless        (as he says) portions of a rock of identical
character situated       a few hundred yards to the westward.
    The Professor adds, that         as  this crystalline rock is very marked
and unmistakable, he regarded it            as unimpeachable       evidence  of the
course of the ice through the gorge.
    4.   iSadpn was next visited, — an island half          a  mile or    so oil' the
east coast of Harris.         Here  a  granite boulder was "found hutted itji
on its east side against the rocky steps of            a  knoll of gneiss rocks."
A sketch of this boulder            is given    in the Report.          With   refer
ence to the direction of transport, Professor Heddle mentions that
the same rock of which the boulder is composed                   forms a bed in a
high cliff on the mainland of Harris to the N.W.
    5.    The Shiant islands, which were next examined,                are throe   in
number.         They also are off the east coast of Harris, about twenty
miles to the N.E. of Tarbert.
   On the surface        of these islands, which are of basalt, no foreign
erratics     of any size were found.         But on the shore of two of these
islands, he found blocks of conglomerate               and Cambrian sandstone,
which had probably .come from near Stornoway, about 30 miles to
the north, where those rocks are in situ.
   The Professor saw in the two largest islands, which lie N. and S.
of each other, that some agent — it might be ice — had passed over
them from the west, smoothing thorn,                 and   pushing fragments       of
the trap rock towards the east.             But  he observed      particularly that
there      was   no  such smoothing on the third            island lying     to the
cast   ;  and the only explanation of this fact which occurred to him
was, that the third island, being much lower in level than the other
two, the ice may have passed over, without                  touching it — an ex
planation suggesting the agency of floating ice.
    6.   The next island visited was Skye, but the Professor was able only
to examine the N. and        N.E. portions,    viz., from  Aird Point    to Portree.

628                  Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
   He was       surprised to find no boulders either on the coast or
on the    hills adjoining     the coast, except     on the small islet    of Stain-
chol, at the mouth of Loch Staffin.             On the shore of this loch there-
were blocks of Cambrian sandstone,               a rock of which he had found
pebbles on the shore of the Shiant Islands.                On Stainchol, he als-       i
found    a   boulder of dolorite, containing much labradorite             ;
                                                                            — a rock
of the same nature, was in situ about 50 yards to the                N.N.W.
   Professor Heddle further attests,             that the    rocks on     the hills
examined      by him, which he ascended to above 1500 feet, "nowhere
bore groovings or even scratchings ;" and               ho states that   "the    cols
between the numerous           heights wero narrowly examined by him."
   Now     these   facts    seem    to  have    an   important     bearing on the
question of boulder transport.            Mr James Goikie, in his " Great
Ice Age," p. 77,        says,    that "most of the islands which lie              oti"
the    coasts  of Scotland plainly         indicate, by striations       and   other
glacial markings, that ice has swept over them."              He adds   that " The
most striking     example      of this is furnished by Lewis, the northern
portion of the Long Island, which (says he) I found to be glaciated
across its     whole breadth from S.E. to N.W.                 The land-ice that
swept over this tract, must have come from the mountains of Rose-
shire — a distance of not less than 30 miles.            Leaving the mainland,
it  must    have filled up the whole of the           North Minch (60 fathoms
in depth), and overflowed          Lewis to   a  height of 1300 feet at least.''
   This    statement,    made      in 1877,     was repeated    in two elaborate
papers read before the         London Geological Society in 1878, in w-hich
it was maintained,      " that   the whole of the Long Island, from the         Butt
of Lewis to Barra Head, has been overflowed               from the Minch by ice
that moved outwards from the inner islands and the mainland."
   Now this theory        seems entirely at variance        with the facts ascer
tained by Professor Heddle last year, and by myself in the previous
year.     If a  mass  of   ice came from the Ross-shire          hills, so great as
to  fill the Minch,    overflow the Long Island to the height of 1300
feet, and to stretch from the Butt of Lewis to Barra Head, a distance
of about 80 miles, it must have impinged on the island of Ski/e, and
especially on the north-east           part of it. But there, according to
Professor Heddle, no boulders are to bo seen, and even no groovings
or striations of the rocks.
   On the other       hand,     boulders and striated       rocks,   which in the

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                             629
Long Island       are plentiful,   all indicate    a movement      from the N.W.
—a     direction the very opposite        of that requisite for      a great  glacier
from Ross-shire.
     Mr Geikie, in       a  footnote (page 60), says that " Air Campbell of
Islay     considered   that the Hebrides Islands had been glaciated                by
sea-ice coming from the          N.W. ; — while,    on the other hand, my obser
vations in Lewis compelled me to believe, that the glaciating agent
was land-ice streaming          outwards from the mainland.          My   colleague,
Mr Etheridge, Jan., who           accompanied     me during my last visit to the
 Long Island,      also concluded,    that the glaciations had been effected
by land-ice coming from the S.E."
     Whilst much weight is proper          to be given to the observations        and
 opinions of such         experienced    geologists   as Mr James Geikie         and
 Mr Etheridge,       on the other hand       it is only right     to keep in view
 that the late Robert Chambers and Dr Bryce, though they wrote no
 papers on the subject, are known to have concurred                with Mr Camp
 bell   ;  and  I have reason to believe, that         Mr Jolly of Inverness        is
 of the same opinion.
     7.   Black Mount District
     (1.) Some white granite boulders, which were noticed by Pro
 fessor Heddlc on the shores of Loch Tulla, were, after a minute and
 laborious search, traced        by him to    a hill called Albunnach, situated
 about 10 miles to the        W.N.W.      Professor Heddle having ascertained
 the line of transport, next tried to rind whether the boulders covered
 a large space    transversely.     The result of this search was to show that
                                       " these boulders had been carried, as it
 (to use the Professor's words)
  were, in a stream, and one of no great width, towards the kS.E."
     (2.) Notiee was next taken of several large boulders, one weigh
  ing no less than 1900 tons, in a valley, which becomes very
  narrow to the east of Loch Dochard.               The Professor says, " Tf any
  powerful agent passed through this valley,               there   would bo great
  obstruction and      a   violent pressure on and rending of the adjoining
  rocks.      The lower part of the pass (ho says) contains much till ; and
  occasionally rock rises up through the till with finely-smoothed
  hunches,     showing striations from the       W.N.W."       In   reference to the
  large boulder above referred to, Professor Heddle              gives   his opinion
   that    " nothing   but ice     could have      brought   it into its present
  position."

 630                               Proceedings        of the Royal Society
    (3.) The Glen Creran boulders having been referred to in the two
 last Reports of the Committee, with a confession of uncertainty as
 to the source from which they had come, Professor Heddle,                                     in   com
 pliance with my request, kindly undertook                              a renewed      survey of the
 district.
        The result has been that the Professor has found rocks on the
 hills       4 or 5 miles from Glen Creran to the                      N.N.E. identical in          com
 position with the boulders.                      But how        the boulders were carried from
 these hills, where the parent rocks are from 1700 to 2000 feet above
 the sea, to Glen Creran, which is only about 200 feet above the sea
 — i.e., "whether dropped from floating                              ice, or carried    by glaciers,"
 " it        is (observes the Professor), with our present information, impos
 sible to say."
        He found on the hills containing the rocks of the boulders nu
 merous             striw, which showed " that some powerful smoothing and
 striating agent had passed over this district from the west, and at                                   a
 level exceeding              2000 feet above the             sea.     But   west     from the place
 where these smoothed                     and striated      rocks occur, there are no hills so
high          as        to produce    a    glacier,    unless,    indeed, a glacier had come
 through Glen Tarbert, which is                        a   continuation of Loch Sunart, and
 crossed            what is now the Linnhe Loch.                        Loch   Sunart and Glen
 Tarbert occupy                a   hollow in the district which runs in a direction
 about            W.N.W.      and    E.S.E.
        "    It   is, however (he says), proper to add that on the rock where
these         W.N.W.          striae occur,     there      are cross striee overlying          and cut-
ling into               these, indicating another and more recent agency from the
ft.W.              These cross striae being more sharp and minute than the first,
indicate more recent and less powerful action.                                 Can it have been
that         a sea       existed exceeding       2000 feet above          the present level with
ice in            it,   which was floating about in eddying currents among what
 arc now high-peaked hills, tearing rocks out of the shallows, and
pushing them over what were then submarine                                 cliffs?"
     (4.) In this part of his notes applicable to the Glen Creran dis
 trict, Professor Heddle refers to what he calls " a bendder of the
peculiar porcelain porphyry                      worked at Kentallen in Appin."                     That
                  boulder         evident from the fact of the rocks of the                 hill where
it it
        is   a               is
        lies, being totally different.                 Its height     above the sea    is   2250 feet.
 Now, porcelain rock of the same kind occurs                                   among     the    Ben a

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              631
liheither hills      at exactly the same height above           the sea, about mid
way between two other hills whose names are given,                     3 or 4 miles to
the    N.N.W.
    Assuming       that the boulder came from that point, it must have
crossed two valleys, each          of which     is less than 700 feet above           the
sea.     How it could       have    crossed   these, except on floating ice,        it  is
difficult to    see.
     (5.) There is another boulder in the same district of Schistose
Breccia at a height of 2235 feet. The parent rock was found at some
distance to the N.N.W.              "This boulder      (the Professor says)       in like
manner must have been carried across the deep valley of the Durer
to have reached its present position."
     (6.) A very interesting account is given of boulders in the neigh
bourhood of Glencoe.             Being much rounded, they suggest a long
transport, and were          "of     a peculiar granite," somewhat           like "the
well-known Ardshiel granite," only "whiter and coarser grained."
     Being " altogether different from the rocks of the hill on which
                                                      '
they were first noticed,          consisting of     a   schistose breccia,' the Pro
fessor resolved       to seek for the parent rock."
     Thinking,    from his knowledge of the rocks to the eastward, that
they were not likely to have come from that quarter, he set out on
a   hunt in     a   westerly direction.        On reaching the Aonarh-Eruinch
range of hills, he recognised           the same boulders on them, " fewer in
number, but markedly larger in size."
     He followed them up           to  the first summit of the        hill, which was
293S feet     ;  and, proceeding       still further   west to a     hill called Mwdl
Deary, he found the same boulders first at 3090 feet and eventually
 "almost up to the summit of the western peak at 3118 feet."
     The Professor says that " their position here was most peculiar, —
they lay upon        a  ridge not many times wider than their own bulk,
and only on the eastern slopes of that ridge."
     Proceeding still farther west to other hills (which are named in
 his notes) at from 2400 to 3200 feet, the Professor did not iind
 either boulders, " or rock, of the same description              ;
                                                                    "
                                                                      but on proceed
 ing to the next hills, of somewhat greater height, about                  6 or 7 miles
 to the west, he found at two spots, the kind of rock he was in quest
 of.     He however adds, that " though the rocks at these two spots
 were     almost identical       in mineral composition with               that of the

032                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
boulders,     I am    not satisfied      that they supplied the boulders, — for
the spots where those           rocks occur, are only from 1500 to 2300 feet
above the sea,       — whereas     the boulders on some parts of the Aonach-
Eagach, to the eastward,            were     at a height of 3100 feet above the
sea,
   " An attempt         has been made by some geologists                to explain, how
boulders may be transported to positions above                         the  level of the
parent rocks      ;  and,   if that theory be correct,          it  may help to over
come this difficulty."
    " But it     is a fact      of considerable       importance, bearing on any
theory of transport, that these boulders on Aonach-Eagach,                        occupy
positions much higher in level than any                   of  the   hills in a vtry wide
extent     of country,     so that    it  is hardly possible to adopt for them
the explanation of any local glacier."

of these boulders on Meal/. Deary, where, at a height of 3100 feet,
they lay upon        a  ridge not many times wider than their own bulk,
or rather on the sides of that ridge facing the E. or                   N.E.    I am not
able    at present to offer any explanations of this feature.                    I would
like   again to study the position of these boulders.                   They must hare
been brought      by ice, which may have come from the                  N.W. and stuck
there among the high peaks,              till it melted and allowed         the boulders
to subside on or near the           top of the ridge.          My explorations about
 Glen Creran, led to the supposition of a                  flow of ice through Glen
 Tarbert on the N.W. side of the Linnhe Loch.                           This might also
possibly account for the boulders on                 Aonach-Eagach ; but, in that

 case,   where could the parent rocks be            ?
    This query by        the Professor,        Where could the parent rocks of
 these    boulders be     ?   he leaves unanswered          ; and,    no doubt, it is a
 query more         easily asked     than answered.           It   would, therefore,  be
 presumption in me even              to suggest       an answer.         But  the  query
 reminds me that, two years ago,                  I  sent    specimens      of the Loch
 Creran     boulders to Professor Judd of London,                      an eminent geo
logist     well acquainted with the rocks of the West Highlands, to
ask    him, whether ho knew of rocks anywhere like those of the
boulders, and he gave             a decided      opinion that rocks of exactly the
 same    kind   existed    in Mull and Ardnamurchan.                 Now, these places
are to the west of the boulders referred                to by Professor Heddle, and

                        of Edinburgh,          Session 1870-80
 it  is from the west thnt he thinks they came.                    Moreover, in Mull,
 the hill of Uenmore           is 3180 feet above the           sea,  whilst in Ardna-
 nmrchan there are hills nearly that height.                     It strikes   me, there
 fore, that it would bo very desirable,              if Professor Heddle could, in
 the course of this summer,               visit Mull and Ardnamurchan             to see
 whether he agrees with Professor Judd's surmise on this subject.
                                III.   Convener's Notes.
     The points brought out in these, arc very unimportant, compared
 with      those of Professor Heddle            and Messrs      Jolly  and Wallace of
 Inverness.
      1.  The boulders in Vantyre            I found had, on the south and cast
 coast, come apparently from some point due                      north;   those on the
 west coast, from points varying between N.W. and                      N.N.W.
     2.   In Arran,    the    boulders on the east coast, which were all that
 I   examined,      seem to have        moved     in   a  direction from about duo
 north.
     3.   In   the Cumhrae      islands,    they seemed also to have come from
 due north.
     4.  In Loch Long       and the Gairloclt, the boulders showed transport
from points varying between              N.N.W. and N. by E., which            happens
 also to be about the axial lino of the valleys in which the boulders
lie.
     5.  In    the hills  to the north of Loch Fi/ne,         I  was rather surprised
 to   see    the smoothed rocks facing           N. and N.E., and         tho boulders
lying with their longer axis in much tho same direction.
     6. When I reached Loch Aire, I found the boulders                      among    the
hills,     at from 000      to   1000    feet above the sea, indicating         in like
manner transport from the N.N.E.
    This deviation, at several places in the interior of the country,
from the N.W. direction which is so prevalent elsewhere, at first
rather surprised me         ;  but it probably does not on principle differ
materially from the fact, that occasionally on                    the  same rock,      or
on the same boulder, there are separate sets of striee.                  If these striae
are produced by currents           which run lirst in one direction and there
after in another,      a  similar explanation might apply to the variations
of direction over       a large   district of country.
    For     example,   Professor Heddlo,        as we    have   seen, takes notice of

                                Proceedings of                the   Royal Society
such variation in Uist, and on a larger scale among the                                             hills       at Glen
Creran          ;   and the boulders in Nairn and Morayshire have evidently
been brought by currents which came from different points.
     If   in        the    North of Scotland,                 the normal direction of the current
was to the                 S.E., it    is probable that the deep trench of the Great
Caledonian Valley running about E. by N, with                                               a range      of hills           on
each side             2000       feet high,            would there               cause a deviation               in the
direction of the current.                              As    the sea subsided from one level to
another,            the currents           would change in directions.
     Examples were seen by me last year in the Lewis, of a change
oven on the same hill.                       At        the top, the direction was as usual                       N.W.,
near the bottom,                 it   was from due                 W.   or   W.S.W.
     Among the hills south                             of Loch Awe,               I    found a large boulder
perched on a peak of rock in a remarkably precarious position.                                                         It   is
shown on the diagram.                             By        a glacier        it certainly could not have
been brought, there being neither hills nor valleys to form a glacier.
If   it   came by floating ice, the ice might be arrested by the peak, and
when it melted, the block which the ice carried, might remain.
     7. The largest               boulder which                I   have yet seen, was found by me
on the west coast of Argyle, in Loch Killasport.                                             Calculating by its
cubical contents, it weighed                                about 2770 tons.                This boulder, and
many others                 of large size, were on the                   sea shore, and            half     a    mile at
least from                any   sea   cliff, old or recent.                  I   felt convinced from their
situation, and also from the direction of their longer axis, that they
had all come across the sea from the                                    N.W.
     S.    A short time                    ago, my           attention           was    called to a boulder,
1)   x   S x 6        feet,     in Roxburghshire,                   weighing            about       16 tons.            On
examining                 it,
                           I    found that             it   was of exactly the same rock as that
which composes the Penielheugh, the hill on which the Waterloo
Pillar          stands.         It    is   about       a     mile to the east of the hill, and has
evidently been floated                       to its present position by ice.                         The        hill   also
presents other facts of no small interest                                     bearing on the transport                      of
boulders.                 The west side of the hill has been swept bare, so that
the trap rocks stand                        out        like the bones of                a   skeleton with the
skin and liesh off, whilst the east side of the                                             hill    is   covered  by
soft Old Red Sandstone,                           as   well as by sand and gravel.                        This place
affords undoubted evidence of sea with floating ice,                                               which stripped
the      hill       and carried fragments                   to the eastward.

     Whilst    tho view         I   take in regard              to the transport of boulders,
and tho atriation of rock surfaces                           in Scotland           is,   that these phe
nomena were          in most instances                  due to ice in         a   sea,    which reached
to our highest mountain tops,                      I     admit that           there       are traces          also
of land ice in the form of local glaciers.                                   In    last      year's Report
I   pointed out what appeared to me clear evidence                                    of glacier action
in Gleucoe     ;    and Professor Heddle                  also recognised             glacier action on
the west coast near Loch                       Torridon.             But my        idea      is,   that      these
glaciers    must he referred to                a   period antecedent              to the submergence
of the land, for we find those traces of glaciers                                        in many          places
covered      over by thick beds of gravel,                           sand, and      clay which could
only have been deposited by the                         sea.

Australian naturalist.
      The masks had been procured                       by Dr Cox from missionaries,                          and
were       either from tho island of New Ireland or New Britain,                                                in
proximity       to tho north coast of New Guinea.                                     Thev         were      both
formed       of the frontal and facial bones, on which                                   a   face had been
modelled in          a    composition,             formed        of   a   mixture            of    a   resinous
substance      with earth or clay.                      This artificial           face had then been
painted with red, black, and white pigments.                                          The larger             mask
was     hollowed out behind, by the removal                                   of tho sphenoid and
ethmoid        bones,      so       that    it     could be           adapted       to       tho face of         a
wearer,       and    a    bar of wood was fastened                           transversely across the
hollow, which the wearer had evidently used for holding the mask
 between      his teeth     ;       as     the mask            had    both the eyelids                 and     lips

separated from each other, the wearer                          could both             see    and breathe-
through these openings.
      The smaller mask              was not capable            of being closely adapted                     fc'
the face of a wearer, for the sphenoid and ethmoid bones                                            were    in
position, and the orbits were filled up with                               a    composition similar
to     that employed in                modelling       the     face ;      and        an artificial        eve
formed of the operculum of the shell of                               a    mollusk was fixed in
each orbit.           An artificial        tongue      formed of           a piece          of bright red
cloth folded on              a   wooden framework              partially            projected through
the open mouth.                  Whiskers and          beard; which             in    the larger mask
were modelled            in      the hard composition, were                    in    the    smaller mask
formed of vegetable               fibre, and from their mode of arrangement                               gave
a    pantaloon-like          character     to the face.          This      mask may have                 been
used as an ornament,               or as an object of worship.
      Warrior Island,             from    which       the      skull       was        procured,          is an
island off the south coast of New Guinea, and to the north of Torres
Straits.        The skull was smeared on the forehead                                  and face          with
streaks of red pigment.                   The orbits were filled up with                      a   hardened
material,       to    which        lozenge-shaped            pieces       of        mother-of-pearl         to
simulate eyes were attached.                   A plug of wood             3^ inches          long, cut so
as to represent        an artificial nose, was inserted                   into the anterior nares.
     The skull was that of an adult man, 175 mm. long, 154 broad,
137 high,        515    in horizontal          circumference,           and with a capacity of
1 650        cubic    centimetres.            It    was     brachycephalic,                megacephalic,
mesorhine,       and mesognathous.
     The      skull    was       compared          with the     crania         of Australians             and
Papuans, which are dolicocephalic, microcephalic, and prognathous                                               ;
and     it    was     pointed       out    that its affinities             were        not    with these
races but with the Malays.
     Various methods of decorating preserved heads and skulls                                            were
then referred          to.       This communication will                   appear          in ertmso in
the    "Journal of Anatomy                and Physiology,"            July          1880.

probable position of an ultra- Neptunian                planet,   I   havo   now to
inform the Society that        I  have detected     the   existence    of perturba
tions in the motion of Uranus, agreeing               remarkably       in character
and period with those which would be produced by the now planet.
These results are obtained from observations of Uranus extending
over more than       a century.      The position of the planet, from this
point of view, is found, from the             first rough examination, to be
the  same as that given by me in my former memoir.                       This    gives
a  means      of   determining the      mass of the      new     planet.     In this
way   I   find it to bo about the same as that of Saturn.                     I  have
also  some     reasons   for believing that the following stars observed
by Riimker,       but stated     by E.   J.  Cooper     ("llarkree Catalogue of
Stars," vol. iv.    p. 2:29) to be   missing, are actually the new planet.

   The Chairman presented              the  Keith Medal for the Biennial
period 1877-79, to Professor Fleeming Jenkin, for his Paper
" On the                      of Graphic Methods to the Determina
             Application
tion of the Efficiency of Machinery," the second part of which
was published in the Society's Transactions for 1878, and in
doing    so made the      following remarks         : —
   Professor Jenkin has contributed several valuable papers to our
Transactions.

638                   Proceedings   of  the   Royal Society
   In  1869 wo had      " The Practical Application of Reciprocal Figures
to  the   Calculation    of Strains on Framework,"            in which      he    ex-
emplified in     a very clear manner the mode of applying to important
utatical   questions a beautiful principle, due in part to Rankine but
mainly to Clerk-Maxwell.
   The paper for which the award of the Keith Prize is now made
is more thoroughly original,        and   may     be  roughly described       as an
extension     of Maxwell's principle to the kinetics of machinery, where
all parts     move in one     plane.     It is entitled " The Application
of Graphic        Methods to the     Determination        of  the    Efficiency    of
Machinery."         The first part was read to the Society in 1877, and
the second in the following       year.     All   three of these papers are in
our Transactions.
   Among his other contributions may be mentioned his application
(in conjunction with Professor Ewing) of the Phonograph records
to the   " Harmonic Analysis of certain Vowel Sounds." This is an
ingenious and elaborate piece of work, and shows us (among other
things) within what wide        limits the components          of  a sound may
vary while it is still recognised by the ear         as having   a definite vowel
quality.
   Professor Jenkin, in handing you this medal            I  express,   I  am sure,
the feelings    of all the Fellows of the Society, when            I  say that we
thank you heartily for the valuablo contributions you have already
sent to our Transactions, and that wo look with                confidence    for an
additional series.
   Professor      Jenkin then took the Chair.
   The following communications were read                  : —
      1.  Non-Euclidean Geometry.               By Professor Chrystal.
                                 (Plate   XX.)
   When     I  had the honour of being asked by the Council of the           Royal
Society to give the following address,      I  chose the subject partly because
it had been brought under the notice of the fellows by my predecessor,
Professor Kelland.        His memoir was written comparatively early in
the history of the subject      ;  and   he seems to have been but             little
acquainted     with what others had done even up to the time at which

                          of Edinburgh,              Session      1879-80.                     639
he wrote.         Accordingly,        although the subject is treated very ably in
his paper, it is treated from only one point of view                        ; and, indeed,      one
side of    it  is left out of sight altogether.                  The relation of the whole
theory to the question of the origin and mutual independence                                      of
the axioms of geometry has been made much clearer                                of late, and      T
believed that some account                    of the more modern views might be of
interest.
    I  am particularly desirous               of bringing pangrometrieal speculations
under the notice of those engaged in the teaching of geometry.                                   In
discussing with schoolmasters                   the difficult problem of the reform of
geometrical         teaching,     I  have met with             much enlightened and some
unenlightened criticism.                The former kind of criticism has convinced
me that many teachers of mathematics                        will be glad to have this subject
made more accessible            ;   and     I  believe that a knowledge of what great
mathematicians have thought on the subject would destroy criticism
of the latter kind altogether.
     It will     not    be  supposed           that     I   advocate     the   introduction       of
pangeometry          as a school     subject      ;  it  is for the teacher that      I  advocate
such a study.           It  is a great mistake to suppose                  that it is sufficient
for the teacher of an elementary subject to be just ahead of his pupils.
IsTo   one can be a good             elementary           teacher     who cannot handle his
subject with the grasp of               a master.          Geometrical insight and wealth
of geometrical          ideas,     either natural or acquired, are essential                   to a
good teacher of geometry                ;  and     I know of      no better way of cultiva
ting them than by studying pangeometry.
    The following sketch is addressed                       to those already      familiar with
Euclid's geometry.            I   have made no attempt to give                   a detailed ac
count of modern researches, or to build up                              a systematic      treatise.
I    have     simply tried          to    give in       a   synthetic way      a   general    idea
of     what      is   known        in     a    certain       department of        a   now     very
widely developed             subject.         In    so     doing   I   have   used    the    mate
rials    and      methods     of Euclid            as    much     a;;  I  consistently could,
at some sacrifice          of elegance, no doubt, but with obvious practical
advantage.
    I  have     not attempted          to give any bibliographical              details,   for the
simple reason that any one who wants them will find nearly all that
can bo desired in two papers                    by Mr Halsted in the first volume of
the   "  American Journal of Mathematics."
        vol. x.                                                                      4 o

 640                   Proceedings of          the Royal Society
                                      On Pangeometry.
    I know     of no question possessing more interest for               a  thinker, and
none     of more importance for             a  mathematician, than the well-worn
 one of the origin of the axioms of geometry.
    Passing over the discussions of mental philosophers, which, so far
as   I am   acquainted with them, are of little mathematical                   or physical
interest,   we find two great modern contributions                   to this interesting
subject   ;  one by the mathematicians           headed by Gauss, Lobatschewsky,
Bolyai, and Riemann           ;   the other by the physiologists represented              by
Helmholtz.
    The mathematical investigators may be taken as representing the
subjective side of the subject,              the physiologists      as representing the
objective    ;   although,      in   point    of fact,     Helmholtz,      the     personal
representative       of the latter, is a happy             union of both         classes   of
philosopher.
    Any purely        abstract     science starts with      certain data called defini
tions and axioms ;* and of these materials                   reason builds the        fabric
of the science.
     I do not intend to take up the question of the origin of axioms
directly.       On the contrary,         I  shall lay down axioms, and the only
argument against         me, so far,     will  be to prove the inconsistency          of my
 conclusions with my premises, or with one another.
     The absence of such inconsistency is what                    I   mean by conceiv-
 ability.      I  do not deny that other meanings             may be attached        to this
 word, and that the question of the conceivability of axioms might be
 profitably discussed        from other points of view.               We might discuss
 it as a purely personal          question,    each man to be judge and         jury, or it
 might    be granted,     as   I, for   the most part in what follows, take             it to
be, that any axioms          that can be made the foundation of               a consistent
 reasoned      system    are given &       priori.    I  suspect    that   this would      be
    *
       In Euclid's Geometry the functions of definition and axiom are not always
 clearly separated ; at all events, some of his definitions serve purposes for which
 others are unlit, and this must be kept in view in what follows.              With postu
 lates I have at present nothing to do, as I am concerned solely with geometrical
 theorems.      The mixture of problems with theorems is a peculiarity of Euclid's
 method for which there is no absolute necessity, and which is certainly incon
 venient in an elementary text-book.            Geometrical constructions are in a sense
 the applications of geometrical theory, and ought to be kept by themselves.
 The Society for the Improvement of Geometrical Knowledge have acted wisely,
 I think, in following this arrangement in their syllabus.

allowed by most of those                       who    have          considered       the    question              of
axioms           in what        I   believe     to   be     by far the            most       useful and
effective        way,       viz., by examining and pushing the conclusions to
be    drawn from them to the                     utmost         ;    aud      by investigating              what
change       on these conclusions would be induced by varying                                              one or
more of the axioms themselves.
     The question might also bo approached                            from the side of experience.
I   take, for the sake of illustration,                    an instance which brings me at
once to my subject.                   We      have, by generalisation from experience,
ideas      more         or less      refined according to                  our individual physical
education of             a geometrical        straight line, and of             a geometrical              point.
Let       us think, then, of two straight lines intersecting at a point, and
let us ask ourselves, Can two such lines intersect again                                     i     (   )ur first
impulse is to answer no                ;   but due consideration will show us that, in
point of fact, experience              does not settle the question.                   All       we can say
is that no one starting from the point of intersection of two straight
lines has ever followed them by physical (say optical) observation to
a second          intersection.        But then we must admit that, on our usual
assumption that space is of infinite                                extent,    and    straight lines of
infinite length, the distance through which any one has so followed
them       is,   after all, relatively speaking, but an infinitely little way.                               Our
assertion,         therefore,       that two straight lines never intersect again                                 is
merely an assumption, accordant,                      no doubt, with our limited experi
ence, but otherwise unfounded, and certainly not of necessity involved
in our      idea of straightness,             though wo may superadd                   it   thereto        if    we
please.     I          recommend       those who doubt this statement                            to begin by
defining         a     straight line by    a    single geometrical property, which                          is   not
verbally equivalent to the assertion                         in question, and to attempt to
prove it.
     It   may be well to remark here that the discussion of the properties
of tridimensional space in reality divides itself into two parts                                       :— first,
what may the properties of space be conceived                                  to bo   1   conceive being
understood in the sense above explained                               ;   second, what are the pro
perties of space as we know, or                      think      we know, them          ?         The former
question          is   a   purely mathematical one              ;    the latter   is   one in the main
for the physicist or the mental philosopher, and the function of the
mathematician in connection with                      it   is   to make clear what the question
exactly          is,   and what alternatives are open for us.                        What        the bearing

642                    Proceedings       of the Royal Society
of modern mathematical            research on this point appears to be,            I  shall
ondeavour       to explain later on.
     With     these preliminary       remarks    in explanation,       I   now proceed
briefly to sketch       a system    of geometry which,       as to   its foundations,
differs from that of       Euclid only in       the alteration of one (or at most
two) axioms.          Its conclusions will    be found to differ very materially
from his, although this difference is merely in the way of wider
generality,       Euclid's geometry       being contained      as  a    particular     case
in what       I shall, for distinction's sake, call Pangeometry.
     The space which        I shall  consider is to be tridimensional.          I   appeal
 to the ordinary conceptions           of
                       Point, Line or curve, Surface, Solid          ;
 and, for the sake of the words, state that a point has no extension, a
 line is once extended,        a surface  twice, a solid thrice.
      As   a test  of these distinctions, the idea of motion may be intro
 duced.        I cannot   stop now to     justify this, but     merely      remark that
  nothing is to be predicated          concerning time.
       Farther, space is to be uniform, in the double sense that                it  has no
  properties     depending either on position or direction.
      The great test of t his last statement is congruence,* which             I mention
  thus early,      because    it  is the   touchstone    of geometry.          Thus      the
  statement that space has no properties depending on position, simply
   moans that congruent figures exist, e.g., that a solid of a certain size
   and shape can be carried          from one part of space to another without
   alteration in either respect        ; and that two congruent figures              can be
   conceived      as separately     existing in different parts of space.              It  is
   evident that all space measurement rests on congruency.
        It is essential to be careful with our definition of             a  straight    litf,
   for it will be found that virtually the properties of the straight line
   determine      the nature of space.
        Our definition shall be that two points in general determine                        a
   straight line, or that in general          a   straight line cannot        be made to
    pass through three given points.
        It  is important to notice the force of the phrase in general.                  This
       *
          Two figures are said to be congruent when one can be placed on the other,
    so   that every point of one shall coincide with a point of the other, and ctre
    versa.    The phrase equal in every respect is used in the same sense in roost
    English editions of Euclid.

will      be best understood from an illustration.                                 We all know from
the case of a throe legged stool,                   if not from any          more scientific source,
that three points determine                   a plane.         Yet not any three points                    ;   for,
if   the third          foot were put in line with the other two, the one stool
would be            as unsafe a seat as the            proverbial two.             Yet      again, and very
near indeed to our case, two points on a sphere                                  in    general determine
a great           circle on it.      But      there      are exceptions            ;    a   point and          the
diametrically opposite point do not determine a great circle, and yet
it would            be a good    definition of          a great    circle to call            it that line       on
a sphere            which is in general           determined when two of its points are
given, no other condition being assigned.*
     "VVo    recognise therefore             that, although        in    general,           any two points
being taken,             a   line will thereby be determined,                          yet it may happen
that, one point being taken, another point may exist which                                                 along
with the first does not determine                        a   straight line.             The necessity for
this admission appears when we consider space in which two straight
lines have more than one point of intersection.
      Here let it be mentioned,                   to avoid misconception,                   that it follows
from our definition of                   a   straight line, and from the uniformity of
 space (the test being congruency),                          that space is symmetrical round
 every straight line.                This     is at once an answer                      to those who say
 that pangeometry                is merely         an analogy drawn from the theory of
 surfaces of constant curvature.
      A plane           may be defined as          Euclid      defines       it,   and the conclusions
 drawn, that two intersecting lines,                     a   point and       a   line, or        a   line passing
 through            a   given point and moving perpendicular to                             a    given line, all
 in    general determine             a   plane.        The last form of definition of course
 presupposes             the definition of         a   right angle.
      Farther, we adopt all Euclid's definitions up to the definition of an
      *   It interesting to notice that any curve already conditioned number of
               is                                                                                    a
 times less by two than the whole number       of conditions that completely deter
 mine       it,
            fulfils in many respects the definition of     straight line, for any two
                                                                         a
 points completely determine the curve.           very interesting particular case
                                                               A                                                  is
 that of series of circles which always pass through given fixed point. Such
               a                                                             a
 a series of circles may take the place of straight lines in many of Euclid's pro
 positions.     Most of the propositions as to congruency hold for them.      The sum
 of the three angles of triangle formed by three such circles
                                 a                                  two right angles;       is
 the perpendiculars from the vertices of such              triangle on the opposite
                                                                         a
 sides are concurrent and so on, as
                                ;              otherwise evident by the theory of

acute angled triangle, but reject in the meantime,                     at  all events, all
that follow in the first book.
    Next     wo adopt Euclid's propositions concerning angles at a point,
viz.,    I. 13, 14,   15;   also the propositions as to congruency               I. 4, 5, 6,
8,  and the first part of 26, with a protest to the effect that in many
cases his demonstrations arc needlessly circuitous and difficult.                       All
that is wanted for the demonstration of these . propositions is the
defining property of the straight line and the ordinary axioms and
definitions      as to equality.
                                Different Kinds of Space.
    Before going farther, we must distinguish the different cases that
may arise when we consider two intersecting straight lines.
    1.    They may never intersect again and be of infinite length (i.e.,
each is non-re-entrant).           Space which has this characteristic is called,
for the present, hyperbolic           space.     We shall     see, however,     by and by
that another        case must be       distinguished under this head, that, viz.,
of homaloidal or Euclidean space.
    2.    They may intersect again.            Space     having this characteristic is
called elliptic space.
    The simplest space of this kind is that in which                       a  straight line
returns into itself, so that the next point in which two straight lines
intersect     is the point     in which they first         intersected.      In this kind
of space, which         I shall call single elliptic space, two straight lines
intersect      in only one point       ;  and   there is no exception to the state
ment that two points determine               a  straight line.
    The next simplest        case    would    bo  that in which two straight lines
intersect     a second time       in a distinct point, and         then re-enter at the
next point of intersection which coincides with the original one.
This might be called double elliptical space.                    I  am not yet certain*
whether the symmetry of space will allow us to carry this multiplicity
   *   I  have not been able to find a definite      settlement    of this question by any
of the great authorities on hyper space.           Frischauf takes double elliptic space
as the representative of elliptic space, and seems to hold that this is the only
 possible kind.     Klein (" Mathematische       Annalen," vi. 125) takes single elliptic
 space, and criticises Frischauf's view         ("  Fortschritte der Mathematik," viiL
 313, 1876).      Newcomb     (Borchardt's    Journ.  , lxxxiii. p. 293) professes himself
 unable to settle the question.        If the notion of double elliptic space cannot be
 shown to be self-contradictory, then it would appear that the question becomes
simply one of the choice of axioms.           See note below, p. 661.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.
of elliptical     space farther.      In    the meantime,     I   may remark that in
a space    of this second kind we must,               as  already explained, admit
exceptions to the statement that two points determine                   a straight line.
    In what follows        I take single elliptical space as the representative
of elliptical space generally,        although on account of the non-existence
of  a closed     surface of uniform positive curvature, on which a pair of
geodctics intersect only once, the conclusions of the geometry of single
elliptical     space appear      in some respects more          bizarre   than those of
double elliptical space, whose planimetry is mirrored by the geodesy
of   a sphere.
    It  is obvious that Euclidean, or homaloidal,               space is included        in
hyperbolic space as above                defined.     We shall afterwards          show,
however, that it may be regarded                as a limiting case of elliptic     space.
It   is therefore     the transition case lying between          the other two.
           Sketch    of the   Geometry      of Hyperbolic (Infinite)      Space.
     From the definition of this kind of space it is clearly infinite.
 Here    I must    insist on the distinction betw een infinite and unbounded,
a  distinction first brought into notice by Riemann.                   The uniformity
of space necessarily          involves the notion that it is unbounded, but
by no means necessitates that it shall be infinite in extent                   ; in   fact,
I shall    point out directly that        a  single elliptical space is necessarily of
 finite extent.*
     After   the propositions relating to congruency              already proved, the
next fundamental proposition to be established is the following                      : —
     In hyperbolic       space the sum        of  the three angles     of a rectilineal
 triangle cannot       exceed   two right angles.
     The following        proof of this proposition is due in substance                  to
Bolyai.        Legendre had given another,              but he failed to    see  exactly
the nature of the assumptions               on which ho founded.
    ABC     (fig. 1) is any triangle, O the middle point of BC,           OD  =  OA    ; so
that CD falls within the angle BCL.                (Here we assume that a straight
line is non-re-entrant, and that            a pair of straight lines never intersect
twice.) Then DOC =            f AOB    ; and   ADC     is equal in area to    ABC,     and
    *
       An ellipse and a eirele are unbounded but finite lines ; a hyperbola is both
unbounded and infinite.
    t I adopt the sign — used by continental writers for congruent to, or equal
 in every respect to.

f,46                         Proceedings        of   the     Royal Society
has the sum         of its   angles the same, while the sum of                   A   and   D = BAC.
Of   these angles one          island          the other -<£than £ A.            Taking the least
of them, and bisecting the opposite side, we derive                                as    before    from
ADC       a triangle,     still having         the same area, and the same sum                    of all
the angles, but in which the sum of two of the angles                                      A
     By   a similar process we derive another triangle,                       still having the
area and the sum of its angles unaltered,                         but in which the sum of two
angles     }>-A.
     At   last we get a triangle,           in which the area is the same                  as   at first,
and the sum of the angles the same, but the sum of two of them
^^A,             where   n may be as great as wo please; that                            is,   in which
the sum of two angles                is   as small as we please.
     But the third angle can never be greater than 2R, hence the sum
of the angles of the original triangle cannot be >                            2R
     It   is   to be noticed that this demonstration would                        fail   ifa    straight
line were re-entrant,           or   if   two straight lines had more than one point
of intersection.

      The amount by which the sum of the three angles of                           a  triangle
  falls short of 2R is called the defect of the triangle. This is the same
  as the excess     of the sum of its exterior angles over 4R.                   If we take
  the latter statement of the definition, we may talk of the defect of any
  plane rectilineal figure.          In forming         the external angles of figures
  generally, wo must go round, producing all the sides in the direction
  of our progress, assigning the positive or negative sign according                          as
  the angle is not or is re-entrant.
     Thus in figure       2  the defect is
                                  a+   /3-y    +8+    c-4R.
  Defining defect in this way, it is easy to prove that
     The defect of any rectilineal figure in equal to the mm of the defects
  of any rectilineal figures of which it may be supposed to be composed.
     Cor. Hence      if one   rectilineal figure lie toholly         within another the
  defect  of the  former is not greater than that of the latter.
     Hence follows at once the following important proposition                        : —
     If the defect    of any triangle        whose   sides are  finite   be zero,   then the
 defect  of  every  finite triangle mud          be zero.
    For if ABC          (fig. 3)   be a triangle whoso defect               is zero,     then,
 by applying to its sides three triangles,                 each congruent with itself,
 as  shown in the figure,          we evidently construct            a  triangle     A'B'C,
 having the same angles             as   ABC,      and hence       zero defect,      each of
 whose sides is double a corresponding side                 in ABC.      We    may repeat
 this process with         A'B'C,     and     so on.     Hence we may construct                a
triangle, having zero defect, large enough                   to contain    within it any
finite triangle whatever.            But     the defect of any triangle cannot be
greater than that of a triangle            within which it       is contained, and the
defect    cannot be less than zero             ; hence     the  defect    of every      finite
triangle must be zero,         if the defect of any one finite triangle be zero.
    Thus in hyperbolic space,           as  defined above, wo are shut up to one
or other of       two alternatives.           Either     the defect    of a triangle         is
always positive or it is always            zero.

      If   we take the latter alternative, we get Euclidean or homaloidal
space ; and, from the defining property by which we have character
ised       it,   we can prove Euclid's                parallel axiom, and develop Euclid's
geometry              in his or any other equivalent manner.
      Having separated out homaloidal space, let us now consider mere
closely hyperbolic space proper, in which the defect                                  is   always positive.
     The fundamental proposition to be proved                                  is   the following.
      The defect         of     a triangle (and consequently the defect                           of   any plane
rectilineal figure)              is   proportional       to its area.
     Various proofs of this proposition might be given.                                      I         select that
which depends on the properties                          of the curves of equidistance from
a    straight line, because the intermediate propositions are the analogues
in     hyperbolic           space          to the    propositions             regarding parallels                 and
parallelograms             that are given in the latter part of Euclid's first book.
     If    in any plane perpendiculars of constant length be erected upon
a    given straight line, their extremities generate                                two curves which                I
shall call the equidistants, the two equidistants corresponding to                                                   a
given length of the perpendicular may be called conjugate equidis
tants.
     The equidistant is               a    self congruent line.
     For    if    we take any piece              AB    (fig.    4)   of   the given line, and              LM       the
corresponding piece of the equidistant, and              AB and                if   also     A'B'      =
L'M' bo corresponding points to A' and B', then,   we place A'B'
on AB, L' and M' will coincide with  and M, and,   AT' = AP, Q'L                         if if
will coincide with   and so on. Hence the piece L'M'
                                  Q,                   congruent                                  is
with the piece LM.
     The equidistant              in   at every point at right angles to the generating
perpendicular.
     This        is   at once evident by considering two equal                                   pieces     (fig.    5)
LP     and       LQ of     the equidistant on either side of                         L,    and the corres
ponding points A and                        B   on the         straight line, so that                  OA = OB.
We have LOAP = LOBQ,                             hence     £OLP=              L   OLQ,     each = R.
     The equidistant in hyperbolic space                        is   a curved line, concave towards
the given line.
     Let LQM            (fig.    6)   be   a   piece of the equidistant,             LM      a    straight line
cutting          the     perpendicular            through        P,       the middle         point          of    AB,
in    R          Then     LRPA         =   MRPB.         Hence          PRL
                                                                          L          =   L   PRM        =    R,   and
the angles at           P   are each =          R,   therefore       ALR<B.

    But   L  QLA = R, therefore LQ falls above LRQ, however small
the distance AB may be ; in other words, LQM is concave towards
AB.
    Every straight line terminated by a          pair of    conjugate equidistants
to a given       straight line is bisected by the given straight line, and
makes equal alternate angles with the equidistants,              §c.
    If AB     (fig. 7) be the given straight line,        XP    and  YQ    the  equi
distants, POQ the line terminated by the equidistants, then the
proposition follows at once by observing that,                 if AP    and   BQ   bo
perpendiculars to AB, then          AOP     = BOQ.
    The common perpendicular             to  two conjugate     equidistants is the
lead distance       between them, the oblique distances are greater       according
ns the angle       they make     with the perpendicular         is greater, and   the
length   of an    oblique can be   increased without limit.
    It will   be seen that conjugate       equidistants are analogous to Eucli
dean parallels.        The analogy may be carried much farther.
    If equal    arcs of two conjugate       equidistants be joined towards the
same parts by two straight lines, the figure so formed may be called
a  hyperbolic parallelogram.
    A  mixed triangle whose base is the arc of an equidistant, whose
two remaining sides are straight lines, and whose vertex lies on the
conjugate equidistant, may be called a hyperbolic triangle.                      The
following propositions are then very easily proved.
    The sum      of the   three angles  of  a hyperbolic, triangle is 2R.
    The opposite straight sides        of a  hyperbolic  parallelogram arc equal
to one   another ; its diagonals bisect         one  another in a point on        the
straight     line to which      the equidistants that      form its    curved   sides
belong   ; and      each   diagonal divides it into     two congruent hyperbolic
triangles.
    A  series of propositions analogous to those of          Euclid, Book I., 35-
41, may be proved very easily ; we have only to substitute hyperbolic
parallelograms and triangles for ordinary parallelograms and triangles,
and conjugate equidistants for parallels.           In particular,   we see (fig. 8)
that
    Two hyperbolic triangles CAOB, DAOD, which have                    for   common
base the    arc   AOB of     an equidistant (and consequently have their ver
tices on the conjugate equidistant) are equal           in  area.
    Hence follows at once        that —

        The rectilinear triangles CAB,                         DAB          on the same chord              of   on
equidistant, whose vertices lie on the conjugate equidistant, are equal
in area and defect.
  N. B. — tho defect is                     2 L   O AB in both     cases.           It   is obvious that,   if we
join the middle points of the sides of any triangle, the extremities                                             of
its base lie on an equidistant to the line so drawn, and the vertex
lies on the conjugate                       equidistant.        Bearing this in mind, the pro
perties of equidistants enable us to establish                                      the following proposi
tions : —
        We can always construct an isosceles                        triangle whose                base   is equal
to one side            of a       given triangle, and whose                     area and defect           are the
same as those            of   the given triangle.
   Given two triangles, we can always transform one or other of them
into another of equal area and defect which has one of its sides eqwjl
to one       of   the sides        of   the remaining          triangle*
    Hence two triangles that                         hare the same area must have t/ie same
defect, and conversely,                          for we can      transform them into a pair of
isosceles triangles on the same base without altering either area or
defect.           It   is obvious that two such triangles must be congruent
if they      are equal            in    area, and hence          they must               be   equal in defect        ;
and from what                 I    have          proved concerning the defect of composite
figures, the converse follows                        with    equal ease.
    Hence the area of a triangle is proportional to its defect.    Hence,
p   being a certain linear constant, characteristic of a hyperbolic space,
and      A   the area of a rectilineal triangle of defect                                8,   we have
                                                       A = P28.
    A     great variety of very important conclusions                                can at once be drawn
from this formula.                      I   mention some of the most interesting.
    Since         8=    ^-,   if   p        be    infinite, then        8   =   0   for every       triangle    of
finite area       ;    in other words, homaloidal space                             is   simply   a   hyperbolic
space whose             linear constant                is   infinite.       This conclusion may                 be
looked at from another,                            but mathematically equivalent, point of
view.         Let      us imagine            a    hyperbolic space of given linear constant                     p.
    *
    I   leave the render to consider and settle for himself whether   simpler pro                 a
position than the above could be established.     In particular he should consider
the following problem in hyperbolic geometry: — "To construct an isosceles
triangle of given area on    £;iven base."

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                      651
If  we take a region         in this    space whose greatest             linear dimension is
an    infinitely small fraction of p, then the defect of every triangle
within that region will be infinitely small, and its geometry will not
differ sensibly        from that of a homaloidal                     space.    This is often
expressed        by saying that hyperbolic                    space   is homaloidal       in its
smallest     parts.
    It   appears,     therefore,    that,       even       in hyperbolic space, Euclid's
planimetry will apply to            infinitely small figures.              For instance, the
ratio of the         circumference           of    a   circle to     its   diameter    will    be
tt=3-14159         ....       (the ordinary            transcendental constant),           when
the diameter        is made infinitely             small.      We    may, therefore,      if  we
please,     measure      our angles         in radians (circular           measure),     and in
fact use all the formulae of homaloidal                      plane trigonometry,      if proper
restrictions be observed.
    It  should also be noticed that the existence of this length                      p related
to the space, but not direetionally related, suggests the possibility of
explaining the properties of tridimensional                         space by subsuming          it
in   a space    of four or more dimensions.                    I have    not chosen to enter
into speculations of this nature, partly because their development
has been entirely analytical hitherto                   ;   and partly because, so far as        I
can see at present,        it may    be    justly     contended      that the conceivability
of hyperspace        of three dimensions rests on different grounds from
that which we must necessarily                       assume     when we attempt          to add
another dimension.              In this,      however,        I may    be but one of those
whom Gauss playfully called B<eotians.*
       Before leaving this part of the subject, I may mention the curious solution
   *
of the problem of dividing a plane in hyperbolic space into a network of
regular polygons.
   If n be the number of sides of each polygon, p the number of polygons round
a point of the network, A the area of ea' h of the >i-gons, then

                                  < -l  .
   Suppose,     for instance,   we wish to divide a plane into squares, i.e., regular
four-sided    figures.    Then n = 4.        Ifjn = 4, i.e., if the angles of the square be
right angles, A     = 0,  which does not, strictly speaking, give a solution. The

 line or not, remains to be       seen.
     As   P moves off along     DI the angle       at  P diminishes      without limit.
     This is easily shoWn (fig. 10) by taking            PPi  =  OP,   P1P2
                                                                              =
                                                                                 OP! and
 so on ad. inf.
     In homaloidal       spare the parallel     to  DI    through     0 is    the perpen
 dicular to     DO   at the point O    : for the sum of the three angles of the
 triangle   DPO    is always 2R, and     P diminishes       without limit, hence the
 angle at O approaches        nearer to   Pc   than by any assignable quantity.
     Thus in homaloidal space the two parallels OK,                   OK'    are parts   of
 the same straight line, and all the lines through                 0 cut EDI', except
 the parallel, which may be said to cut             it  at an  infinite distance.       In
 the language of modern geometry              there    is but one point at        infinity
on the line      IDI'.
    In   hyperbolic    spare there are two parallels          through a given point
to a given     straight line.
    For   as we move      P away from    D   the area of    ODP, and consequently
its defect, constantly increases, but the angle              OPD constantly dimi
nishes, hence the angle at O can never exceed a certain                    angle which
is less than a right angle.
    It follows,   therefore, that   if  we take any line      IDF and     any external
point 0, we must classify the lines through O                as  follows   : — (1) inter-
sectors, (2) non-intersectors,       (3) two parallels.

as p increases.    The area of the greatest possible square tile that we could use
would be 2irp\ but the lengths of the sides would be infinite.

    In   figure 11  KOL' and K'OL are the two parallels ; all lines lying
in   the angles     KOL, K'OL', are non-intersectors, all those lying in
KOK', LOL'          are intersectors.       The fact that in hyperbolic space
there are two parallels through a given point to a given straight line
is expressed in modern geometry by saying that in hyperbolic space
a straight line has two distinct real points at infinity.
   After what      has been laid down, the following propositions either
are immediately evident, or can be proved                 with very little trouble.
   If a line    is parallel  to another      at any point,       it  is so at every point
of  itself.
    Parallelism     is mutual.
   Lines -which are parotid            to the same         line are parallel        to one
another.
    Lines that am parallel continually              approach        one another     on the
side towards which they are parallel.
   Non-intersectors in the same plane have a minimum distance, which
is the common perpendicular.
   The angle which a parallel through O to                    L   makes with the per
pendicular on      L  is called the parallel angle.
    Tlte   parallel  angle is a function       of the length      of  the perpendicular,
increasing when the perpendicular diminishes.
    If 6 be the angle,     p  the length of the perpendicular, then                 it  may
be shown by methods          which    I  shall presently explain that

                           Geometry     of Elliptic      Space.
   For simplicity I take single elliptic              space, but there         will  be no
difficulty in modifying what follows so              as to make        it apply to double
elliptic space.
   In single elliptic     space every straight line returns into itself               ;  and
two straight lines intersect       in only one point.               Thus, starting from
any point P, and proceeding in any direction continuously, wo at last
return to the point      P;   the length       L  travelled over in this process is
called the length of the complete straight line.
    It is obvious that      in single     (as   well   as   in double) elliptic        space

 654                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
two intersecting complete straight lines enclose                   a plane   figure.        Such
a figure   I  call a biangle.
    Two biangles        are    congruent      when,    their angles are         equal.         All
complete straight lines          are   of  the same length, and            all  the   straight
lines emanating        from    the same point          intersect     in the same second
point.
    These propositions are all equivalent to one another, and are equally
true for single or double elliptic space.                 The last of them is a mere
truism for single elliptic space.            The following demonstration, which
holds good for single or double elliptic                  space, may help to render
 the matter clearer.
    Let  APBQA A'P'B'Q'A'             (fig. 12) be two Wangles having the angles
A   and   A' equal         If A'T,'  be placed      on  AB   so that    A lies   on   A', and
AT'    along   AP, then A'Q' will lie along AQ,               since the angles at          A are
equal; hence by the fundamental property of                         a  straight line       APB
and   A'P'IV must wholly coincide, and AQB and A'Q'B' must wholly
coincide ; and hence B' must fall on B.                   It is to be noticed that the
biangles are multiply congruent.
    Next, suppose       AKA', AK'A'         (fig. 13) to be any pair of intersecting
straight lines.       Let   AL bisect    the angle    A and    cut the lines in      J and J'.
Since A.T and       AJ' are    equiangular biangles, they are congruent                 ;   from
this it follows at once that            J  and   J'  must coincide with each other,
and therefore each with A'.              Hence the bisector of the angle             A    passes
through A'      ;  and    it and    AKA'     and     AK'A'     are all of equal        length.
We    may next bisect either of the halves of                   A, and     so on   ;  and we
may double any of the angles                thus obtained        as   often as we please.
Hence the propositions stated above are completely proved.                                   The
length    L  of   a complete      straight line is therefore           an absolute        linear
constant    which characterises an elliptic             space.
    In  single elliptic space the least           distance     between    two points          cm
never he greater than hL, and the greatest distance can never be greater
than   L.
   This is obvious,        since the whole length of a complete                straight line
through the two points is L.
    If we  consider      the plane determined            by two intersecting straight
lines  AO A, BOB, and            if we pass from 0         along OA through a length
L,   we  return    to  0, but find ourselves on the opposite side of the plane
to  that from which we started, and only arrive at the same point O

 on the same side as
                     before by travelling once mure through a length
 L.
       This curious conclusion                   is an immediate          result of the fact that
 straight lines are re-entrant and intersect only once.                                          (In double
elliptical space the apparent anomaly does not occur on account of
the double
             intersection.)
    The best way of representing the thing to the mind that    can                                       I
think of is to imagine a rigid body composed of three rectangular
 arrows lx, ly,            lz   (fig. 14).        lx   slides along      OA   ;    ly   passes through
a ring which slides                on   OB (being long             enough never             to slip out) ;
 lz    is,   of course, determined            in position when           lx   and       ly   are fixed         in
any positions.
   In starting from    let I* and  O,                        ly
                                      be horizontal and lz vertical                                              ;
then slide lx along OA. lx will at last return along A'O. The ring
will return along IJ'O. It     obvious, therefore, that, at our first
                                                 is
return to O, lz must be downwards, for, since the system of arrows                                              is
rigid, one who plants himself with feet at   head at and looks along
                                                                   I,              z
lx must see to his left as ho did at starting.
                    y
      It   is   obvious that during the journey                   ly    as well as      lz       has rotated
through 180°,           a   repetition of the process rotates both through 180°
more, and then everything                    is   as before.
      If   we cause     a   complete straight line of length               L      to revolve through
360°, always remaining perpendicular to                                 given line,         it   will
                                                                   a                                    sweep
out the two sides of              a    complete plane.
      It   follows at once, therefore,                 that the area of       a     complete            plane,
taking into account                 both sides,         is   finite, and the same for every
complete          plane.        ThisI        shall call      P    in the meantime.                 We        also
see,   in      accordance       with what was proved before, that the two sides
of the complete plane are not distinct, since we can pass continuously
upon the plane from     point on one side to the same point on the
                                   a
other side.
   Those who find difficulty in realising this property of the
                                                               plane in
single elliptic space should take    ribbon of paper, twist
                                                       a       through                       it
180°, and then gum the ends together.       A surface     thus formed                  is
which has the property that one can trace    continuous line upon   a                                         it
from    point on one side to point exactly opposite on the other side.

   After what has been laid down the following
                                                     propositions are
obvious.

65H                      Proceedings of the Royal Society
  They are given by Neweoinb in an extremely interesting article                                              to
which reference was made above.                        I      arrange them           in    the order which
best suits what has gone before.
  All    the -perpendiculars             in a given plane to a given straight                               line
intersect in a single point, whose distance                         from       the straight line is         \L.
  Conversely,       the locus      of all      the points at a distance                     iL   on straight
fines passing through            a given point in a given plane is a straight                               h"ta:
perpendicular       to   all    the radiating lines.
  The fixed point is called the pole, and the straight locus its polar.
  If ire    came        the given plane to                 rotate     about          the   polar    the pole
describes a straight             line which           may       be called        the conjugate         of    the
given polar.
   The relation         of   these two    lines is mutual, every point on one being
at a distance-     \L from        every point on the other.
  Without dwelling farther upon propositions of this kind,                                         I proceed
at once to establish the fundamental proposition concerning the sum
of the angles of         a plane triangle.                I   might follow a course like that
adopted for hyperbolic                 space, but a much simpler method suggests
itself at once as applicable to finite                     space.
  Tn the first          place,    since    a complete               plane       is   generated       by     the
revolution of a complete                straight line through 360°, it follows that
the area of a biangle whose angle is A° is                               -J^   P.
   In    figure    15     let    ABC      be   any triangle.                   Produce the          sides to
form biangles.           Each of the Wangles departs from the vertex on the
upper side of the plane and returns to the vertex on the lower side.
To make this clear areas in the neighbourhood of                                     ABC in the        figure
are shaded with vertical lines when reckoned                                   on the upper and with
horizontal lines when reckoned on the lower side of the plane.                                                A
glance   will     show that      if    we take        the three biangles they overlap the
triangle   ABC      thrice, and that the rest of the plane                             is    covered   every
where     once on one side or the other,                         but nowhere                on both sides.
Hence,     A   denoting the area of the triangle, we have
                         Ap +            ?_p      +       *Lp = AP + 2A

     If,   therefore,         we define      A° + B°          + C°    -    180° as   the excess            of the
triangle, we have the proposition that —
   The excels of every triangle is fmsitive,                               and is proportional              to its
area.
     The        conclusions          drawn         above       (p.     650)    for hyperbolic               space
follow here, mutatis mutandis.                           In particular,          we see that we may
apply       Euclidean              planimetry       to    infinitely small           figures.           On this
remark we can,                as    will   be done later, found a system of planimetry
for elliptic space, and determine                        P.        The result is     P   =         .       Hence,
writing p for          I' ,   and ( for the radian measure of the excess, we have
                                                     A =P-(
where p is a linear constant                   characteristic of the elliptic                   space.
     It    is easy after what has now been                             established       to work out            the
propositions corresponding to Euclid's                                first book.        The conclusions
will, of        course, be subject to certain modifications, but these are easily
found.          I may     mention in particular that the propositions concerning
the curves of equidistance already given for hyperbolic space, hold
with very slight modification for elliptic                                 space, the main difference
being that the equidistants are convex instead of concave to the given
straight line.

      In elliptic       space there          is,   of course, no such thing                   as   a    parallel,
because there are no infinitely                      distant points on           a   straight line.*
      If   O    (fig. 16) be        a   point outside the line                IDT;       then   it   is    easy to
see      that the two segments of the perpendicular from                                     O     are respec
tively the least and greatest distances from the given hue.                                                If   O1)
be the least distance,                  then, as    OP, starting from 01),                   revolves       about
O,       OP continually             increases, until          it   has rotated       through 180°, and
then       it   is   at its maximum, after which                      it   decreases again.
      It   can easily be shown that, as                       OP revolves from OO,                     the angle
OPD         decreases,         until OP       is    perpendicular to O1), and then OP1)
is    at its minimum value.                    After          that,   as    may be easily          shown         by
producing the line backwards through                                  O,   the angle again increases.

     In the language of modern geometry the points at infinity on                                      a   straight
line in elliptic space are imaginary.

     If I   have succeeded in my attempt to explain the results           of modern
research concerning the axioms of geometry,              it will  be apparent that,
oven     if  we overlook the possibility of space being non-uniform,                in
the sense of having properties           depending on position and direction,
it is still possible to develop three self-consistent           kinds of geometry
— the hyperbolic,         the homaloidal, and the elliptic.        It is impossible,
it appears to me,        to say on h   priori grounds that any one of these          is
more reasonable         than the   others.   If, therefore, d priari ground is      to
be sought for the axioms of geometry, such tests of its firmness
                                                                                  " as

the inconceivability of the opposite             and others like it are not to be
relied upon.        They are merely an appeal to ignorance.
     If,  on the     other   hand, we view the question from the side of
experience,       three   alternatives are open to      us.   We     may   hold that
space is homaloidal          and therefore    infinite.   In this   case wo   extend
to the infinite part of space which we do not know the results of our
 experience      of the finite part of it that we do know.
     Again, we may hold that space is hyperbolic and therefore infinite.
 In this     ease experience    teaches us that the radius of the sphere of our
 rxperience is infinitely small compared              with the linear constant of
 space    ;  for Lohatschewsky calculated         from astronomical     observations
 the sum of the three          angles of triangles whose      smallest sides were
 about double the distance of the earth from the sun, and found that
 the difference from two right angles was not greater than the probable
  error of observation.
      Lastly, we may suppose that space is elliptic and therefore finite,
  in this    case we    must admit that our experience           extends   to but an
  infinitely small fraction of its whole extent, since no sensible excess
  can be found in the largest triangles with which we are acquainted.
      Before leaving this subject, it may be well to illustrate with             som<'
  care what is meant          by the words finite and infinite as        I have   used
   them.      They have, of course,        a  purely relative meaning.         In  the
  geometry       of homaloidal space no distinction          can be built     on the
  relative dimensions of figures apart from their form.                 Owing to the

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                  650
existence      of similar figures,      the    geometrical     experience     of  a cheese
mite in homaloidal space would not be different from that of                       a being
one of whose habitual walking stops was from the sun to the dog star.
    In hyperbolic       or elliptic space the case is otherwise.             In either of
these two kinds of space we might divide intelligent beings into two
classes according to their bodily dimensions.                   We might      have a race
of micranthropes, whose bodily dimensions and the radius of whose
sphere of experience          were infinitely     small compared with the linear
constant of space.         For   instance,    if the space were elliptic, the world
of the micranthropes would be but an infinitely small fraction of the
elliptic universe.        It must    bo noticed,      however,     that from the point
of view of      a micranthrope, his world need not be                a prison-house      by
any means, for he would compare it not with the linear constant                          of
universal space, of whose magnitude he must necessarily                      be ignorant,
but with some arbitrary standard               such as the length of his own arm,
 and so considered his world would to him be infinite,               if we only suppose
him small enough.             Again, we might have           a race  of macranthropes,
 whose bodily dimensions were comparable                    with    the linear constant
 of space.      In   the case of an elliptic         and   finite space, we could, of
 course, conceive one of these himself so great that there would not be
 room enough in the universe for another                 as great.
     The geometry of the micranthropes would, of course,                  be  homaloidal.
 The axioms of Euclid would appear                  to them strictly       in  accordance
 with experience,        and,   although they lived          in part of    an elliptic or
 hyperbolic space, their prejudices would render the conceptions                          of
 the general properties        of such    a space as    difficult to them      as  they are
 to us.     On the other hand, the geometry             of the macranthropes         would
 be    elliptic   or   hyperbolic,      as   the   case    might be.       A hyperbolic
 macranthrope would, of course,            be  familiar with thefact thattho defect
 of   a   triangle    diminishes      as   its area diminishes.          If   he    were   a
 mathematician he would be aware of the relation of proportionality,
 and might speculate          concerning triangles of zero defect, much               as we
 do about absolute zero of temperature.                If  Euclid's geometry were to
 fall into    the  hands of an instructed macranthrope,                  he would very
 likely    regard  it  as the production       of some macranthropic lunatic, who
 had meditated        on the fact     that the defect        of  a  triangle diminishes
 with its area, until         he had     so   far lost his wits      as to   commit the

     The following appears to me to be the simplest,                                 and at the same time the
most instructive way of establishing the Trigonometry of                                         Elliptic and Hyper
bolia Space.
     The method might, indeed, by assuming proper axioms, be made to take the
place of the preceding   synthesis.  As it is, I shall base it upon the results of
that synthesis.           What I shall want
                                        are mainly the propositions concerning
the excess or defect of plane   triangles, and the conclusion founded on them
that homaloidal trigonometry may be applied to figures, all of whose dimen
sions arc infinitely small compared with the linear constant of space.
     Let   KA and LB      (fig. 1 7) be two straight lines in the same plane at an infinitely
small      distance     apart.    They may be either non-intersectors, whose minimum
distance     d is infinitely small, or intersectora  which make a very small angle a
with each other at their point of intersection.
   Let KL, AB, CD he lines making equal angles with KA and LB ; and let

complete development would be out of place here, t
   • The differential     equations (2) and (2) contain all the metrical properties of elliptic and
hyperbolic    space.    (2) suggests that a pair of straight lines diverging at a small angle from a
point might Intersect again in distinct points any number of times.          The proposition proved
above for elliptic space generally, that all the lines radiating from any point intersect in the
same second point, seems, however, to compel us to conclude that at the point where any line
intersects another for the second time, it must return into itself; for a line can be brought by
continuous rotation into coincidence with its prolongation,          hence we must reach the same
second point of Intersection        In whichever direction we proceed from the first point.     I can
see no way out of this       at present; and if there is none, it would appear that wc cannot get
beyond double elliptic space, even If we can consistently get so far.

The reader will observe that these are simply the formulas included in Napier's
rules for right-angled spherical triangles.              The only modification being that in
hyperbolic space hyperbolic functions take the place of circular functions.
In   other  words,  the trigonometry of single elliptic space is identical with
the geodetic   trigonometry of a sphere, although it would not he correct to say
that the planimetry of single elliptic space is identical with the geodesy of a
sphere.
   For hyperbolic space the analogue is the pseudo-spherical                      surface of   Bel
trami.

shall find the parallel angle in hyperbolic space.
   Taking formula IV, if we make B move off to an infinite distance, then AB
becomes the parallel to CB.      A is then the parallel angle corresponding to b.

 reached     us.     In it   there are exhaustive papers         by Messrs       John
 ston and Story on the subject of this               American invention.           The
  principles they       give   differ only in form of statement           from those
  at which       I  had independently arrived.              I have,   therefore,     cut
  down my paper to the smallest             dimensions consistent with intelli

     The essential       feature   of this puzzle      is that the circulation        of
  the pieces      is necessarily    in rectangular channels.         Whether      these
  form four-sided      figures, or have     any greater (even) number of sides.
  the number of squares in the channel itself is always even.                     (This
  is the same thing as saying that a rook's re-entrant path always
  contains    an    even   number of squares.           This follows immediately
  from   the fact that a rook always passes through black and white
  squares alternately.        The same thing is true of a bishop's re-entering

                                of Edinburgh,               Session 1879-80.                                 665
path, for it is           a   rook's upon              a new chess-board              formed by the alter
nate diagonals                of the squares on the original hoard.) That there
may be circulation                 in the channel, one of its squares must he the
blank one.
     Hence an odd number of pieces lies                                     along the         channel, and,
therefore,         when they             are anyhow              displaced along            it,   so that the
blank         square          finally      remains          unchanged,          the     number of          inter
changes        is   essentially         even.
     Thus to test whether any given arrangement                                         can be solved,        all
we need know               is    how many interchanges                      of two pieces will reduce
it   to the normal one.                          If    this number bo even, the                    solution    is
possible.           To        find      the      number of interchanges,                    we      have    only
to   write          in pairs         the      numbers           occupying         the    same       square    in
each         arrangement,               and       divide         them        into       groups,      such     as
                    wn'cn forln closed cycles.                             Here there are four pairs
'b   e   d    a'
in    the      group,           which       correspond           to    three     interchanges,        because
     ^
f        is   one interchange.
     Dr Crum Brown                   suggests the term                Aryan for       the normal arrange
ment,         with        the    corresponding                 term     Semitic for         its    perversion.
.Similarly Chinese                would signify the Aryan rotated                           right-handedly
through        a     quadrant, and Mongol                         Semitic         rotated     left-handedly
through        a    quadrant.
     Now      it    is    easily seen that Aryan                      is   changed      into Semitic, and
Chinese into Mongol,                        or    vice versa, by an odd number of inter
changes.            Similarly Aryan                   and      Mongol, and Semitic and Chinese,
differ by an even number of interchanges.
     Hence any given arrangement                               must     be either Aryan or Semitic.
The former can                 be changed             into Mongol, the latter into Chinese.
     Unless the           6     and     9   be        carefully distinguished from one another
every       case     is   solvable,        for    if   it   be Semitic the mere turning these
figures       upside down effects one interchange                               and makes      it   Aryan.
     The principle above stated                          is,   of course, easily applicable to the
conceivable,          but scarcely realisable,                  case   of   a   rectangular       arrangement
of equal cubes with one vacant space.

         Functions      of Osteoblasts.         By De Burgh Birch, M.B.,
         Demonstrator          of  Physiology in the University of
         Edinburgh.
                                     (Abstract.)
      By tearing thin      sheets from     the surface      of decalcified     bones,
  Sharpey first demonstrated         the lamellar nature of- bone, and also
 that these lamellae have a fibrous structure.
      The fibres, consisting of two sets crossing each other, were thought
 to be interwoven in each lamella, and contiguous fibrous laminae to
 be separated     from each other by       a homogeneous         ground substance
 in    which the     lime salts    were   mainly      situated  ;   alternations    of
 fibrous and      homogeneous      layers   giving rise to the appearance           of
 lamellation.
     From the researches of V. Ebner and my own investigations, the
 mat rix is undoubtedly throughout           fibrous,   the lamellar appearance
 being due to an alternation of layers in which the directions of the
 iibres differ.
     By digesting with trypsin sections of decalcified             bone, the white
 fibrous tissue elements of which had been rendered indigestible by
 protracted    treatment     with chromic acid, the interfibrillar         substance
 was entirely removed.
     In  sections   thus treated,     an alternating       band and       dot series
obtained, where        one set of lamellae was cut longitudinally            and the
other transversely.
     In Haversian     systems the entire system         in section    presented   the
same     appearance,      or  the  lamcllation     was     perceptible only over
curtain    parts, this difference     being due     to    the fact that in some
cases    the   fibres are arranged     spirally,   whilst    in   others   they run

     Trypsin digestion further caused the isolation of lacunar mem
branes with      their tubular prolongations the canaliculi            ; these were
found united to similar membranes             lining the interior of Haversian
canals.
    Such membranes         were   also met with       in the substance        of the

 of   cessation,   in  the deposition of the systemic            lamella:,   of some
 duration.
    The situation of the lacunEe was found to be almost universally

    Functions of Osteoblasts.      — For     the ordinary classification of bone
 formation, it seems to mc that the following               is a subdivision more
 in accordance      with    observed    facts.     Bono is produced under con
 ditions where
    1.  There is preformed fibrous tissue,
    2.  Where no preformed         tissue occurs.
    Subperiosteal bono formation comes under the first, and under
 the second, the production         of  bone    upon cartilage      spicules and in
 the excavations for Haversian canals.
    There are situations where bone grows at the expense of tendons
 inserted into them; the level of ossification           is indicated by    a regular
and rapid      proliferation    of the      connective tissue        corpuscles,  the
 resulting corpusek'3       becoming     lacunar cells and secreting         the  cal
careous matrix, the fibrous        tissue of the tendon becoming that of the
osseous matrix.
    Subperiosteally the fibrous tissue of the osseous matrix is preformed
as the   reticulum of the periosteum.            This reticulum     is produced    by
connective tissue corpuscles          of the     periosteum   ;   other protoplasts
secrete the interlibrillar     calcareous     cement.
    From these appearances and others observable upon the spicules of
cartilage    in subepiphysal       bone    production, it seems justifiable to
ascribe the production of the fibrillar elements on the one hand, and
the interfibrillar      calcareous    cement      with lacunar and       canalicular
membranes      on the other to two          sets of protoplasts,     which   I would
                 "                               "
designate as       spinners and plasterers.

    The two eggs of the Great Auk which                        I now exhibit were bought
in Dowoll's Auction               Rooms rather more than                   a   month ago, and
formed part of a           collection of " birds'          eggs, shells, and other        natural

cellaneous         property belonging             to a legal      gentleman         of this city.
This small collection of                eggs     had      been in the possession            of the
owner for about thirty years, and the two eggs in question had
been purchased            by his father from another collector in Edinburgh                      —
a  Mr Little — in         whose possession           it  is thought, from collected            and
trustworthy evidence, the specimens had been at least other thirty
years.        These      eggs,   therefore,       have     probably not changed             hands
more than once during a period of fifty or sixty years.                               The present
owner of the specimens,              Mr Small, animal             preserver, George Street,
purchased         the lot at the sale for .£1, 12s., and has since taken great
pains       to    establish     the   few facts          I  have    stated       regarding their
history.*
    The chief interest in the             eggs     of the Great Auk arises from the
circumstance           of the bird itself being now regarded                       as an  extinct
species.         In  the early part of the present               century it was reckoned
a very rare         bird, although it        appears to have           lingered in Scotland,
where       it  was confined       to the Orkney Islands!              and      St Kilda, \ until

may bo regarded as having been at one time the stronghold                                   of the

which year all traces of the living bird have been lost.                           Very great
interest has consequently been felt by all classes of naturalists in
everything that relates to the Great Auk                    ;   and the discovery of two
specimens       of its egg, in addition             to      those     already     recorded     as
existing in collections,             is an event   which          is sure to create      some
degree of excitement,           not only among              egg     collectors,   but among
scientific ornithologists in all parts of the world.
      Some years ago,       in writing    a   history of this remarkable bird                as a
Scottish species,      I    made a very careful summary of the records of
its occurrence in North Britain, from the earliest published accounts
of the bird until its linal disappearance; and to this account, which
is given in the " Jiirds of the West of Scotland,"*  I may perhaps be

  t 1 have the pleasure of inserting here the following letter which has been
addressed to me sinco this paper was read.   It narrates the capture of the last
of the Auks in Scotland :—
                                                    " Edinburgh,          17tlt June 1S80.
      " My dear Sir,— I think you will be interested in knowing that when at St
Kilda on the 14th of this month I found there was a man still living there
who assisted at the capture of Fleming's Great Auk in 1821— 2"2.
   " Having shown a drawing of an Auk to the collected natives to see if they
had any knowledge of it, they said they knew it used to be there long ago,
but they had never seen it.      Subsequently they told me the man was still
there who cawi/it the last Great Auk.
      "I
       had him immediately brought tome.          His name is Donald M 'Queen,
Sen.   He is a very little man, and is also so much bent, that he does not now
stand much higher than the Gn at Auk did.        He said he was 73 years of age,
but to all appearance he is considerably more.
   " Donald disclaimed having been (as his neighbour reported) the person
who actually caught the Auk.      He informed me that he was one of four per
sons iit a boat on the east side of the Island when they discovered the bird
sitting on    a low ledge of the clitf.
      "Two                (then young men) were landed, one on either side of
             of their number
the bird, and at some distance from it. These two cautiously approached                        it,
whilst he and another boy rowed the boat straight towards the Auk, which
ultimately leaned down towards the sea, when one of the youths, having got
directly under it, caught    in his arms.
                                it        The old man with much animation
went through the pantomime of grasping         supposed bird in his arms and

    "A partial error of the old St Kildian served to identify this Auk with
Fleming's. He said the people who gut        tied   string to its leg and killed
                                                   it

070                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
     Regarding its existence           in other parts of the world there can
be    no   reasonable        doubt    that the     Great Auk           had,     as   already
mentioned,         its headquarters     on the rocky and almost inaccessible
islets off the coast of Newfoundland.                     In   these localities,          if   we
may judge from the writings                  of the early navigators,            it existed
in very largo communities, especially                  during the breeding season,
and was taken in boatloads             for sustenance to the ships' crews.                     We
read, for example,           in Captaine Richard         Whitbourne's           "Discourse
and Discovery of Newfoundland," published in 1622, that "these
         "
Penguins (the name by which the Great Auk was known on the
           " are   as bigge as geese and       fly not, for they have but a little
coasts)
short wing, and they multiply so infinitely upon                   a certaine   island that
men drive them from thence upon aboord into their boats by hundreds
at a time, as       if God   had made the innocency of so poor a creature to
become such an admirable instrument for the sustentation of man."
Other writers speak of parties landing upon the rocks and knocking
down with clubs hundreds of Auks, which they carried to their ships
to be used as food.           In short,     we know that nearly all the French
sailors    of that and later periods           trading between         Havre de Grace
or other French           ports     and Newfoundland,          victualled their ships
regularly with Great Auks taken in such places as the Funk or
Penguin Islands, which are situated on the east coast                     ;   and that on
leaving homo they regulated their supply of provisions accordingly.
It   is stated in a letter written from Bristow to              Mr Richard Hakluyt
of   the Middle Temple by             Mr Anthonie Parkhurst, and                 dated         the
15th of November 1578, that "the Frenchmen that fish neere the
grand baie doe bring small store of flesh with                       them,    but victuall
                                   "

1583 by   Sir Humfrey Gilbert, knight, &c., by Mr Edward Haies,
gentleman, &c., it is stated that the French men barrell them vp
with salt." f           Such a fate for the poor Auks was foreshadowed
in    1536,   in     which     year   Penguin     Island,      one    of their haunts,

what he had heard about        itafter itwas taken away.
    "Mr Mackenzie, the factor of the island, who was present, said Donald

    Minion '— about          tho latter end of            April.        They arrived at Cape
Uriton, and from thence went to the north-eastward till they came
to Penguin Island, an island situated                         on the southern coast of New
foundland, and which was named thus after                           a   kind of    sea-fowl which
the Spaniards and                Portuguese called             Peuguins on account of their
being     so    very fat, and which used to build their nests and to live
in astonishing quantities                 on this       little rock."*        Four        years        later
(15-40) Jacques Carrier in his                  "Third Voyage"            refers to the slaughter
of these birds by himself and his crews, and speaks of loading his
two vessels           with   dead        Penguins         in less than half              an    hour, as
he might have             done with          stones, so that, not reckoning those that
were eaten fresh           he had in each vessel four or five tons of them put
in salt.
     No    species of bird, especially               one to which the power of flight had
been denied,          could long survive such wholesale                    destruction          as these
French sailors narrate; and                    as we have       already seen that subsequent
traders continued to make very serious inroads upon the haunts of
the doomed Penguin,                it   need excite no surprise that by the time the
attention of scientific writers was drawn to the bird, it had almost
become a rare species.                  In   a published         form there is but little to
narrate,        between    the time          of Whitbourne's         visit and the inquiries

sea-fowl    breed upon        it  every summer,     which are of great service to
the poor inhabitants of Fogo, who make voyages there to load with
birds and       eggs.    When      the water is smooth they make their shallop
fast to the shore, lay their gang-boards from the gunwale of the
boat to the rocks, and then drive as many Penguins on board as she
will hold     ;  for the wings of those birds being remarkably short they
cannot fly.        P,ut it has been customary of late years for several crews
of men to live all tho summer on that Island for the sole purpose of
killing birds for         the sake of their feathers,        [and]    the destruction
which they have made is incredible.                  If  a stop is   not soon put to
that practice the whole breed will be diminished to almost nothing,
particularly the Penguins, for this is now the only island they have
left to breed upon          ;  all others   lying so near to the shores of New
foundland they are continually robbed.                  The birds which the people
bring from thence, they salt and eat, in lieu of salted pork." *
    The     same      author      states  that tho     Red    or Wild     Indians of
 Newfoundland          visited Funk Island every year.

    *
       Vol. iii. p. 55. At page 222 of the same volume, the author writes as
follows — and the quotation may servo to show that if such islands as are
alluded to were at one time inhabited by Great Auks, the birds may have had
other enemies to contend with besides human invaders :— "All along the face
of the east coast, and within the many capacious bays which indent it, are
 thousands of islands of various sizes, [on which innumerable             multitudes of
 Killer Ducks and other water-fowl breed. The very smallest are not without
 their inhabitants, if the spray of the sea does not fly entirely over them ; and
the larger ones have generally deer, foxes, and hares upon them.            The former
will swim out to them to get clear of the wolves which infest the continent ;
but the two latter go out upon the ice, aud are left upon them when it breaks
 up in the spring."
    t Pinwing is now the uaine in use among old residenters, at the various

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                            673
had been extirpated from its old haunts            ;* and in     1838, Audubon,
who has very little indeed to say regarding the species, and nothing
whatever from personal observation, writes as follows : — " The only
authentic account of the occurrence           of this bird on our coast that
I   possess   was    obtained from      Mr Henry Havell, brother of my
 engraver,   who, when on his passage from New York to England,
 hooked a Great      Auk    on the    Banks of Newfoundland in extremely
 boisterous     weather.     On    being    hauled    on    board    it  was    left
at liberty on the deck        ;  it walked very awkwardly, often tumb
ling   over,  bit every     one    within reach of its powerful bill, and
refused   food of all kinds.        After continuing     several days    on board
it  was restored to its proper element.''f            This, as   I  have already
 remarked,    was probably the lust time         the Great    Auk    was seen     in
that part of the world.         The same author also states that when ho
was    in Labrador      (no   date is given) many of the fishermen had
 assured him that the     "Penguin,"     as  they named the bird, bred upon
a low rocky island to          the south-east    of Newfoundland,        and   that
great numbers of the young were destroyed              for bait.    Corroborative
 information     had   been   given him by several individuals            in New
 foundland.
    From that time until the present day all our information                regard
ing the bird is more or less traditional in its nature.            In  1841, how-
over, ornithologists and others interested          in the fate of the species
were startled by the announcement made by Peter Stuvitz, a                    Nor
wegian naturalist, that he had collected quantities of Penguins' bones
on the     Funk Islands, and        bad seen the      nuns of the rude stono
 enclosures    into which former visitors         had driven the poor birds
 before  being massacred.       \    Many of    these bones are       now in the
Museum of the University of Copenhagen,               and were the first relics
fishing stations   on the coast of Newfoundland, who still remember the bird
and its odd figure.
   * "There was formerly on this coast a
                                             species of birds of the diving genus,
which from their inability to fly were always observed within the space
between the land and the Groat Bank, and were once so abundant as to
have given their name to several islands on that coast, but they arc now
utterly extinct. They were known by the name of Penguins." — History of

obtained          as   corroborative proof of tbe correctness                      of the various
records by the French sailors whose                       annual visits and slaughter of
the defenceless          birds have been already referred to.             Shortly before
Stuvitz made this discovery, Mr                     J.    B. Jukes, who was engaged in a
geological        survey of Newfoundland                 in   1839,      thus refers to a group
of islands nearer            the mainland:          — "Aug.             26.     At dawn        we were
under weigh.                We   sailed along shore as far as Dead Man's                         Point
where the sand beaches ended and a rocky                                shore    began;       and then,
passing by some low rocks called the Penguin Islands, sailed through
the         islets called    the Wadhams.                There was a large island of ice
aground off these islands.                    Penguins were formerly              so   abundant on
these shores that their fat bodies have been used for fuel                                :    they are,
however,          now all destroyed,              and none            have been    seen       for many
years."*           Writing in        the same year            in which Mr Jukes' book               was
published, viz., 1842,   Sir Richard Bonnycastle has the following
             "
remarks : — In winter many of the Arctic ice birds frequent the
coast, but the largo Auk, or Penguin (Alca impennis), which not fifty
years ago was a sure sea-mark on the edge of and inside the banks, has
totally disappeared,             from the ruthless trade in its eggs and skin."                      t
    Mention may here be made of a mummified specimen of the bird
which was procured from Funk Island in 1863, and forwarded to
Professor Newton             ;   and also of three            other specimens, preserved              in
a   similar way, from the same locality, which were obtained in the
following year.             The first formed the subject of a communication
to the Zoological Society of London by Mr Newton, and is referred
to as, with one exception, the only approach to a complete                                     skeleton
existing in Europe ; the others passed into the hands of Professor
Agassiz, and the P,ritish Museum.    All these specimens were in a
fair state of preservation owing to the antiseptic property of the
soil    :    they were found         3   or   4   feet below the surface, under a cover
ing of ice, about           2 feet   in thickness.        J

     Following         those discoveries        chronologically, we now come to the
visit of Mr John Milne              to the     Funk Islands in               1874, an account of
which       was contributed by that gentleman                    to the
                                                                             " Field"

but afterwards published in a separate form. In this paper, entitled
" Relics of the Great Auk on Funk Island," Mr Milne has given a
most interesting description of the Island and its feathered inhabit
ants   ;   and    as     but few persons possess a copy of the pamphlet on
account of its scarcity, no apology seems necessary for giving                                      a   short
extract from the author's narrated experiences                           on this old dwelling-
place of the Penguin.
     " At   the distance         of half   a    mile the island looked not unlike a
smooth-bottomed                upturned        saucer,     slightly          elongated         into        an
ellipsoidal form towards its north-eastern                       extremity, from which end
it   sloped more gradually up from the sea than it did from its opposite
end.        As   we drew near a few irregularities could bo seen along its
northern         half,    which afterwards we found                     to     be heaps            of large
boulders.         Immediately in front of us there was a small cliff, in a
crevice of which, we understood,                 was the usual place of landing.                           To
get ashore at this point — which, as a rule, is the most accessible on
the island — is a matter of difficulty.                  First   the boat is rowed alongside
the cliff, on the face of which there is a ledge leading to higher ground
The next thing is to balance                     yourself        upon one of the seats or
thwarts of the boat whilst it rises, falls, and rolls upon the ever
heaving swell.    You now wait your chance until you think yourself
sufficiently high for a spring. You make    but                  it,
                                                   must be without           it
hesitation, and you are landed on your perch.                                 A short      scramble,
and you are upon the high ground, gazing                                 down       at your             com
panions, expanding               and contracting           as    they rise          and    fall upon
the waves,         balancing themselves            like     acrobats         whilst       waiting          to
follow      your example.           However,          we   were        saved       from this exhi
bition      of agility by finding          a    comparatively smooth                 corner        a    little
further to the north, where,                 under     a   shrieking and wailing cloud
of birds,        one by one we jumped             ashore        and     clambered         to   a    secure
foothold."

for use."
     " Having    a strong wish to secure some relics of this bird, and                                     my
time for their discovery being limited to less than an hour, it was
with considerable excitement that                    I   rushed from point to point and
overturned tho turf.                At nearly       every trial bones were found ;                        but
there was nothing that could be identified as ever having belonged
to tho bird, for which               I searched.         At   the eleventh hour the                       tide
turned, and in        a    small grassy hollow, between two huge boulders, on
the   lifting of   tho          first sod   I recognised       an alcine beak.              That rare
element      called luck was in operation.                      In   loss than         half      an       bow
specimens      indicating the pro-existence                of at least fifty of these birds
were exhumed.               The bones were found only from                        1   foot to         2   feet
below tho surface, and in places even projected through the soil into
tho underground habitations of the Puffins.                             With
            *******
                                                                                      the exception
of one small tibia and two or three tips of long and thin beaks,
probably those of tho Tern, all the bones were those of the Great
Auk."
     " In   several cases          whilst exhuming tho skeletons                      I noticed           that
the vertebrae followed                each other successively,             and were evidently
in    the same position which they                    occupied       when in the live bird.
This    is in part confirmed by one curious case, where                               the rootlet of
some plant has grown through tho neural canal                              and expanded so at
to fix the vertebras              in position.       This, together with the fact that
there remains         no evidence           of cuts or blows, leads to the supposition
that these birds may have died peacefully.                           Nevertheless, it may be
that they were the remains of some great slaughter,                               when the birds
had been killed,                parboiled, and       despoiled only of their feathers,
after which they were                 thrown in          a heap     such    as   tbe       one    I have
just described."
     Mr Milne      also alludes to a considerable                    difference       in   size   which
he observed      in    several of the bones, but states that the only trace
of the bird having been used                   as   fuel was    a   single burnt fragment of
a    sacrum.     It       is,   however,      possible that with more                  time at his
disposal he might have made further researches which would have
thrown some light on traditional                      records       bearing on this subject.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                  677
In    the last published work          on Newfoundland          I  find the following
remarks : —
    "The Penguin        or Great     Auk (Alca impennis, Linn.) about seventy
years ago was      very plentiful on Funk Island, but has now totally
disappeared from the coast of Newfoundland.                      Incredible     numbers
of   these birds were killed, their flesh being savoury food, and their
feathers valuable.         Heaps of them were burnt             as  fuel to warm the
water to pick off the feathers, there being no wood on the island.
The     merchants    of Bonavista at one time used to sell these birds
to the poor people by the hundredweight instead of pork."*
    On examining the two eggs which are now upon the table, it will
be seen that the word          " Egale," written upon        each, points to a former
French possessor       ;  but   if the writing       means the name        of  a  rock or
islet,   I have been unable         to trace any such       locality on the maps          I
have consulted, although these are somewhat                   minute in their indica
tions of both along the entire coast-lino of Newfoundland.                            Pro
 fessor Newton informs me that on some                   of the eggs which he has
                                              "
 examined the       words " St Pierre            are plainly    written, which pro
 bably signify that such specimens have come from some rocky islet
 in   the neighbourhood of that island,              if not from St Pierre itself.
 This locality    is off the southern coast of the group called " Mique-
 lon,"f and     is   not far distant from the Penguin                  Islands, visited
 by     Hore   and others         in the sixteenth century.               A   glance    at
 any well-prepared          map     of Newfoundland,          including      the    south
 eastern    shores   of Labrador,^        will show that all round            the coasts
 there are numerous           bays,    with     rocks and islands bearing such
 names as Penguin          Island,    Penguin      Isles, Bird Island,       Bird Isles,
 Murr Island, Murr Rocks, Gull Island, Duck Island, Shag Rocks,
 Cormorant Rocks, Petrel Islands, &c., and we not only infer that all
 those named      " Penguin " were so called on account of the obtrusive
 numbers of Great Auks frequenting them, but that many of the

    t  Lieutenant Chappell, an intelligent and observant cruiser, in his " Voyage

 makes no allusion whatever to the Penguin.

 paratively recent times Great Auks have been known to occur in some
 numbers on     a  rocky islet in Bonavista Bay.         Dr William Anderson,
 late  of Brigus and now of Heart's Content, writes to me that Mr
 Alfred Smith residing          at Cupids, and other aged residentere,        have
 informed him that they remember this haunt being partially occupied,
 and that quantities of the birds were, in olden times, used               both as
 food and fuel.       Another     informant has stated to him that he re
 members seeing, when a boy, Great           Auks   on the   Funk Islands.       In
 sailing past, the birds were pointed out to him          as  they sat upon the
rocks, and the impression he had formed of their               size and upright
figure had never been effaced.          Mr Smith    at same time informed        Dr
 Anderson that ten years ago at Manok, or Mannock Island, Labrador,
he saw in the hands of some Indians what they spoke of as a young
Bin-wing.       The length of the bird was equal to that of his hand,
and " half-way up        the fore-arm."    The Indians told him they had
picked up the bird dead, but whether on ice, water,                or strand he
could not ascertain.         Dr Anderson, however,       whose letter is dated
 28th September       1879, cautiously adds that, on further investigation
he discovered      that these Indians had at the same time a live Porcu
pine, among other things, for sale or barter, which showed they had
been   "in   the curiosity line."
    Another informant       — Joseph Bartlett — stated    to  Dr Anderson that
he had often heard his father, who died            in  1871   at the age    of  70,
speak of the     Pin-wing;     and that crews occasionally got on the      Funks.
built   enclosures,    lit  tires, and burnt the birds to        death   for pure
 mischief.     Several other aged masters of fishing-vessels,          who have
been spoken       to by    Dr Anderson, recollect perfectly hearing their
fathers refer to both birds and eggs which they had taken              ;  and   Mr
«Smith especially referred        to the eggs being of
                                                         " one pint capacity,"
and the feathers of the bird being of considerable           sharpness,    readily
pricking the skin and causing festering.           None of the aged people,
however,    examined      by my correspondent,     seem   to be able to fix       a
precise date for the Penguin's disappearance          from the Newfoundland
habitats.
    In alluding    to the former existence     of the Garefowl in Iceland,        I
uiay refer to an excellent paper on the subject contributed               by Pro
fessor Newton        of Cambridge to       the   "Ibis"    for   1861,    entitled

 "  Abstract       of  Mr Wolley's       researches      in Iceland      respecting      the
 Garcfowl       or Groat    Auk."*      In this very      able paper      a  graphic and
 circumstantial account is given of the capture                  and death of the two
 latest survivors of their species, which event took place on                       a  rock
 called Eldey, or Fire Island,              by the Icelanders, and             by Danish
 sailors, Meel Soekken,          or the Meal         Sack, on the       6th June 1844.
 The      chief     actors   in   this    memorable        undertaking        were    three
 Icelanders       named     J6n Brandsson, Sigurbr Islefsson, and Ketil
 Ketilsson.        Experiencing the greatest difficulty in landing upon the
 rock,     the   three    men,   as   they clambered          up, saw two Garefowls
 sitting among the numberless other rock-birds, and at once gave chase.
 " The Garefowls         showed    not the slightest disposition to repel               the
invaders, but immediately ran along under the high cliff, their heads
 erect, their little      wings somewhat          extended.       They uttered no cry
 of alarm, and moved           with their short steps about            as   quickly    as  a
 man could walk.             36n, with outstretched arms,             drove one into       a
 corner,    where he soon had        it  fast.     Sigurbr and Ketil pursued            the
 second, and the former seized             it close to the edge of the rock, hero
 risen to a precipice         some fathoms high, the water               being directly
 below it.       Ketil   then returned to the sloping shelf whence the birds
 had started, and saw an egg lying on the lava slab which he knew
 to be a Garefowl's.          He took it up, but finding it was broken, put it
 down again.          Whether     there was not also another egg is uncertain.
 All   this took plac,: in much less time than it takes to tell it.                  They
 hurried down again,           for the wind         was    rising.    The     birds   were
 strangled      and    cast  into the boat."          And    so  died   the   last of the
 Great Auks. t
     The commander         of this expedition, on reaching the shore with his
ill-gotten booty, started at once for Reykjavik to take the birds to
Carl Siemen, at whose instance the expedition had been undertaken                           ;
but on his way he seems to have met                 a  knowing purchaser,        to whom
he    sold them        for about    £9.       Allusion    is also made in Professor

opportunity of seeing the remains of these two specimens in the University
Museum      at Copenhagen.      They are simply anatomical preparations, consisting
of the intestines      and other internal organs — the muscles, bones, skins, and
feathers    not having been preserved.

680                   Procecdi'iujs       of the Royal Society
Newton's paper to the disappearance                  of   a range     of rocky skerries
in Iceland, the Geirfuglasker, which was engulphed by the sea in
1830     during a submarine volcanic disturbance, a catastrophe                    which
contributed very materially to the birds' destruction.                       This  range
was a noted haunt of the Great               Auk for    centuries,     and the eruption
which overwhelmed it seems to have been                    a final blow towards the
extinction of the species.
   In    connection     with Iceland it may not be out of place to refer
to the name given to the Great                 Auk by Niels Horrcbow, whose
work on Iceland appeared               in 1752, viz., the " Geir, or Vulture."
Whether this writer had traced any connection                    between the Iceland
name Goirfugl and Lammergeir, or geyer (literally,                    "lamb vulture"),
which is a connecting-link              between    the Eagle and          Vulture,  I  am
not prepared       to  say — the etymology of            the name Garefowl         being
confessedly     a difficult question.         Professor Newton informs me that
the obvious resemblance           at first sight between        Geir and the German
 Geier or Geyer (its older form) has struck several persons, but that
he   doubts if it is more than a coincidence.                        The following is
Horrebow's account of the Garefowl which                     I  have not seen quoted
in any recent publication : —
   " The Vulture Rocks,           called also    Bird Rocks,      lie beyond Reikenes
in   the    south   district, about        6  or  8 leagues      west     of this place.
 On these cliffs and rocks are           a great  many Vultures, which, besides,
harbour in other parts of the island.                The inhabitants at a certain
season go to these islands,           though the expedition is very dangerous,
to seek after the eggs of this bird, of which they bring home a cargo
in   a   boat  big enough         for eight men to row.               The danger      and
difficulty consist      in getting ashore near these cliffs, which lie 6 or
8   leagues    out at     sea,    where      the  water generally runs so high
that   if  the boat bo not carefully managed               it runs    the risk of being
dashed to pieces against            the   rocks   by the violence of the waves.
Though there are not           so  many of these birds          as  of other sea-birds,
yet they are not scarce.             They are frequently seen          ; and those that
go to take their eggs from them see enough of them.                         The eggs are
very large, and about          as  big   as  Ostriches'."      Horrebow also quotes
the authority       of Hcrrn Johann Anderson, who states that " the
Geir, or Vulture, is not often seen in Iceland except on                     a few  cliffs
to the west    ;  and that the Icelanders, naturally superstitious,                 have

event.      Of this    he assures us being told that the year before the late
King Frederick IV. died            there       appeared several, and that none had
been seen before         for many years." *                 It    is worthy of note that in

work, the Ueirfuglasker            and    Eldey       are there          marked        as

    It    may not be out of place here to refer to tho fact of both French
and English writers using the term Pingouin or Penguin, in speak
ing of the Razor         Bill (Alca tarda)            as well as of the Great                       Auk.
Thus, Buflbn (Ois. vol. ix. p. 393) has given Le Grand Pingouin
as the name of the Great Auk, while the Eazor Bill is simply Le
Pingouin.          Temminck      (Manuel, vol. ii.           p.    937-939)        also gives           tho
name  Pingouin brachipQre and Pingouin macroptere ; the former
for the Great Auk and the latter for the Razor Bill. MacGillivray

The name Penguin had apparently at one time been applied in this
country to the Razor Bill in popular works,                        as
                                                                    I     find from         a   map of
the Western Isles, published in Edinburgh                           in   1823, in which              it   is
stated     that "    tin: south west       coast of         Bcrnera and Mingulay                        are
remarkably bold precipices           rising perpendicularly                    from         the   sea    in
lofty dill's of      gneiss   which are frequented in summer                            by innumer
able flocks of Purlins, Razor-bill              Pun-guilts and Kittywakes.                          These
birds disappear early in autumn with their young."
    For     the last forty years,        if    not for      a     longer period, the money
value attached to the eggs and skins of tho Great Auk has contri
buted in     a     very material degree to the destruction of the species.
Caterers      for collections,     public and private, caused                      a     demand,         to
supply which organised parties                 visited the bird's haunts even at the
peril of      their lives, and       effectually exterminated the bird.                              The
very last expedition,         as   we have        seen, resulted              in but two birds
being captured,         and   it   has    a    most    melancholy interest when we
reflect    that from that time       till now      the Great         Auk      has been          a   thing
of the     past.    Judging from published                  records      it   would         seem     that
there are about seventy skins and about as many eggs of this bird

of great value no one can doubt.                    Indifferent skins may           be  worth
from eighty to one hundred guineas, and indifferent                              examples of
the egg more than half that sum.                    A really  fine specimen of the egg,
blown at the side,         if  there    be one in existence,           must be valued at
its weight not in gold,           but in bank notes.             No wonder, then, that
unprincipled persons have been known to                     imitate both egg and skin
— the counterfeit         egg especially       being a consummate           work of art.
     Although much has been written of late years about the Garefow1,
a complete        monograph       on this extinct bird is          still  a  desideratum in
scientific literature       ; and ornithologists         have    for some time been in
 expectation       of seeing such     a  work produced.           The name of Professor
 Newton of Cambridge University has been mentioned, and naturalists
 of    all  nations allow that            the    task   of writing the Great            Auk's
 memorable        history could not be committed to abler hands.
    5.  On   a   New Telephone Receiver.                    By Professor Chrystal.
     The experiment which forms the subject of this communication
 was originally devised            as  an illustration       of the explanation of all
 kinds of microphone receivers,                  suggested     by the beautiful experi
 ments of        Mr Blyth,      on loose       contacts.       My     idea    was to replace
 Mr Blyth's         heated    point of metal by          a  continuous portion of the
 circuit which should act in the same manner.
     It   was obvious, for two reasons, that this part must bo                       of small
 diameter      ;  1st, in order that the resistance, per unit of length, might
 be great       enough to make          the variation of the heating sufficient to
 cause sensible        longitudinal      extension     ;  2d, in order that the section
 might be small enough to allow sensible                     cooling in, say the        -j^th
  of   a second.        I had reason beforehand to believe                  that the second
  of these conditions could           be    fulfilled in practice       ;  because,   I  found
  in my experiments           on Ohm's       Law (Brit. Ass. Rep.              1876, p. 58, H
  .?«/.) that,   when currents of two different strengths                   alternated, even
  with great rapidity           (60   times      per   second)      in    a   fine  wire,   the
  resistance      was sensibly higher during the                passage of the stronger
  current.
       My first experiment          was tried       with    Mr Blyth's         apparatus.     A
  fine platinum-iridium          (10  p. c.   Ir.  Res.   7 Ohm per Cm.) wire, about

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                 683
5 Cm. long,        was soldered      to a tolerably thick        copper wire, which
served as a terminal         ; the other end was fixed securely to the copper
spring attached to the mica-diaphragm of the ear-piece.                      The whole
was     then    put in line with four Bunsen's cells, and a microphone
attached       to a violin.      The    experiment succeeded           at   once.      The
music was perfectly audible close to the diaphragm, and                     a tune was
reproduced quite distinctly.
    For     convenience      in experimenting with different             wires,    I   con
structed the apparatus           which    I   now exhibit       to  the    Society.       It
consists      of  a fine  palladium-silver      wire (4 Ag. 1 Pd. lies. -52 Ohm
per Cm.), 8 Cm. long, soldered              to two cupper terminals, which are
well amalgamated,           and lie in the mercury of two cups forming the
line terminals.         One    terminal is hooked to the membrane of                 a  toy
drum,* the other end of which is removed                  ;  and the other terminal
is attached       to a string,    to which is hung a scale pan, with small
weights for producing the requisite tension.
    With this        apparatus,   I  can reproduce     the music of the violin in
the far room, so that all present can hear it.                 The roughness which
 mars the effect, is simply due to vibrations of the microphone, which
 happen to be in unisou, now and then,               with    the note of the violin.
    I  have satisfied       myself that the action of this instrument is not
due to loose contacts,          or to the earth's magnetism.            I  believe     it to
be due to the variations            in  the   heating of the wire, which follow
the variations of the current strength caused by the microphone.
 The tension of the wire does not seem to be material, farther than
that there must be a certain tension before the effect is produced                           ;
 for  a   wire absolutely loose, gives little or no effect.           A   thick wire of
 platinum, with the four cells, did not act until                   it was made very
 short    ;  and a wire of copper,        4J Cm. long         and about      -01   Cm. in
 diameter,      would scarcely act at all.          The only apparent          exception
 that    I  found was iron.        I  found that     I could get    a tolerable      result
 with an iron wire         4  Cm. long, and thicker than the copper wire last
 mentioned.          A fine steel wire hairspring       acted very well, but not so
 well    as the   long palladium silver wire.           I   also tried other metals,
 but none surpassed the platinum and palladium-silver wires.
     So far as     I have been able to go with a very fine wire, the effect

 used by Edison, Blyth, and others,       is best.

684                       Proceedings of the Royal Society
increases with         the     length.        There must,        of course, be        a limit to
increase     ill this       way    ;  but, unfortunately, the stock of fine wire
obtainable in Edinburgh is neither very varied nor very extensive                               ;
so  that   I  could not examine this point farther.
   With       the     same       wire,     the    effect    increased      with    the   current
strength.        The notes came out best when the current just heated
the fine wire to a very dull                 red.     It  was beautiful        then to   see the
wire burst into a bright glow when reproducing                              a  prolonged note,
especially     a   high one.            This glow       is sometimes       so strong that the
wire softens         and      breaks      under the tension.             When       the  wire is
shielded from air currents,                the glow can be seen to follow the swell
of the music, and, with               a  wire 10 or      12   Cm. long, the motion of the
end could be seen quite distinctly                     keeping time with the swell of
the music.
    1 leating     the    fine    wire extermdly by means of a lamp increases
the effect slightly, and               cooling with water or a blast of air seemed
to produce       the opposite          effect, but only slightly in the case             of very
thin wires.
                                 — Since the above experiments were made, my
    [Added May l8th.
attention has been directed to a paper by Dr Ferguson (Proc. Roy.
Soc.    Edin., 1877-78,            p. 028),     in which       he anticipates to a certain
extent,    the     main experiment above                   described.       It is true that he
has not applied his apparatus                  to the transmission of music or articu
late speech        as  I   have      done, but he makes            the practically very im
portant step of attaching               a mechanical        telephone     to the wire convey
ing    a varying current, and thereby renders                       the observation of the
sounds of De          La Rive both            easy and       certain.      He has also given
the    very important             result that these sounds               may     be caused    by
currents       of    very       small     total heating effect, such as induction
currents.        This     I  have since verified          in certain    cases.
   Dr Ferguson         is of opinion that these sounds are not due to heating
effects but to some other molecular cause, which                             he does not very
clearly define.          Except in the           case   of iron,     I see    no reason as yet
for   so explaining them.                It  must     be remembered           that it is not the
vhole heating effect that is the question, but its variation in a very
short time, say the              -37,0th    of   a second,      so that there       may be no
inconsistency in explaining the ticks in                      Mr Ferguson's experiments
and the music in my own as due to the same cause.

    The exceptional behaviour            of iron in the      case   of thick    wires
(in very thin wires its superiority is doubtful) is not surprising.
Professor Tait has suggested a farther anomaly, viz., that at <x
very high temperature        iron may be incapable of producing these
sounds altogether.
    I  am at present    in possession        of some very interesting results
bearing on this point, which         1  propose    to lay before the Society at
somc early meeting.
    It happens, very curiously, that         Mr   Preece,   apparently about the
same time     as myself, was led to deviso             an instrument practically
identical with the one     I   exhibited to the Society.         An    account  of it
appeared    in "Nature," vol.       xxii.   p.  138  ;  being an abstract of the

 1.   On the Differential Telephone, and on the application of
        the Telephone generally to Electrical Measurement.                        By
        Professor Chrystal.
     The plans and calculations in this paper are now more than two
 years old, but the author has only lately, by the kindness of Pro
 fessor Tait, found opportunity to carry them out in practice.
     A discussion is given of        the    different methods of applying the
 telephone    to accurato   measurement,         and mention is made of the
 points which the author thinks have been missed                  by most of those
 who have worked in this way hitherto.
     A  common    principle     runs through all telephonic null methods,
 viz.,  that the balance     may    be    dependent      on the frequency      of the
 interrupted current or may        be   independent of it.        In  the latter case

  686                   Proceedings        of the Royal Society
 there are in general more than one condition of balance, and                        in the
 former    case,  although one will very often suffice, two may occasion
 ally be necessary.          In    the former class        of   cases    we get relations
 between      electric   quantities of the same dimension, in the                     latter
 relations between        quantities of different dimensions,                e.g., between
 coefficients     of   induction        and     resistances   :   so     that    when    the
 frequency is known we can lind                a coefficient    of induction, in terms
 of  a resistance,    and so on.
    A new instrument           is described       called' the differential telephone.
 It  is an ordinary telephone            only wound double like a differential
 galvanometer.         The peculiar difficulties attending the construction
 of an instrument of this kind which will give no sound when the
 same current passes round its two parallel circuits in opposite                      direc
 tions are explained, and the means of overcoming                      them pointed out.
    The method of using the instrument is explained.                           A multiple
circuit of two branches          A and B is inserted in a circuit containing
 a battery    and an    interruptor.        A and B each contain one coil of the
 differential telephone,        so   that the currents pass in opposite               direc
tion round it.         A  and B have self-induction coefficients,               M and N,
which can be varied at           will by altering       the configuration of certain
coils in the two circuits.           If  the resistances of      A   and   B  be Q and    li,
then the conditions of equilibrium                  are shown to be M = N, and
Q = R. There cannot be silence if either of these is unfulfilled, and
if both are fulfilled there is silence for all frequencies of the in
terruptor.
    It  is pointed out that the instrument, and                 in fact the telephone
generally, is better suited            for measuring        coefficients     of induction
than for measuring         resistance.
    A practical     method     for procuring       a graduated      scale  of coefficients
of induction is then explained.
    The mathematical         theory of the disturbance of the balance               in the
differential telephone         by two independent circuits                E and F neigh
bouring to     A   and   B  is given.       If S and     T  be the resistances,     G and
H    the coefficients    of self-induction, and          I and    J   the coefficients    of
mutual induction          with    A and B of E and F respectively, then
the following four conditions
                              Q     =   11       SJ2   =   TP
                              M     =  N        GJ2    =  HI2

                                  of Edinburgh,             Session         1870-80.                                  687
must        be        satisfied         in    order    that there            may          be        silence        for all
frequencies of the interruptor.
     It    is also possible                  to obtain       silence        for      a given frequency by
satisfying two conditions, which are given.
     The bearings of this theory on practice                                  are pointed out, and                    the    -
reason explained why the induction balance as arranged by Hughes,
does not give results than can be interpreted satisfactorily.
     The mathematical theory of the measurement of capacities is then
given.           If    the armatures             of two condensers of capacities                              X    and   Y
be attached,              by wires whose resistances                         may      be neglected,                to the
circuits A and B, so                     as to    include between                 them      all the self-induc
tion of the circuits except that of the telephone                                               coils,    it is shown
that there cannot be silence for all frequencies                                      unless
                                  Q = R,                M    =    N,             X    =    Y.
     Another method                     is described         for finding capacities                       in terms of
resistances.              In      the    circuit      A of       the   differential telephone                       is in
serted a multiple arc, in one branch of which is a condenser                                                      of capa
city X,          the resistance of this branch is Q".                                 In       the other          branch
there is resistance  Q' and self-induction M'.  The resistance and
self-induction of the rest of A are Q and M, and the resistance and
self-induction               of    I!,   R    and     N.    The conditions for silence                             for all
frequencies             is
            M      =     N,              Q'   = Q" =        R     -     Q,   and     ^          =
                                                                                                     Q'X   .
This last of these conditions means that the time constants of the
coil (M', Q') and the condenser (X, Q') shall be equal.                                                   When this
is   the       case,    the       multiple arc behaves like                      a   resistance           Q', having
neither induction nor capacity.
     It   is     proposed         to apply the differential telephone                            to the measure
ment of coefficients of induction, and to the comparison                                                 of capacities
and their evaluation in absolute                                 measure.            It    is    also expected to
prove useful in measuring specific                                 inductive           capacity,           in investi
gating the properties of electrolytes,                            and       in examining the internal
resistance            and polarisation of batteries                    in    action.           It   is   possible     that
the method last described                         may afford an improved determination of
the ratio of the electrostatic                        to the electro-magnetic                   unit.
     The rest of the paper                     is   occupied       with      a    discussion of the use of

the    ordinary telephone          in connection with          Wheatstone's       bridge.
The mathematical theory of various cases likely to prove useful is
examined,      and their application to the comparison              and evaluation        in
absolute measure of electrical quantities is discussed.
     Several curious experiments with the differential telephone were
shown to the Society.             In particular it was shown that when an in
terrupted current was passed through one coil of the telephone so that
the sound could be heard all over the room, by merely connecting up
 the parallel coil through a small resistance,              the sound was so much
 deadened as scarcely         to be audible at a distance.              The deadening
 effect was      shown to       be    much less when the resistance              through
 which the idle coil was connected                had considerable self-induction
 Grant's experiment          ("Phil. Mag.," May             1880,   p.  352) was also
 shown.       The electrical theory of these experiments                 is given in the
 above paper.
                                 [Added, August 19.]
     Since the      above    abstract      was   written    I  have    carried out the
  practical     application      of    the   above    theory     much farther.           An
  instrument      for    giving     a    variable    self-induction     with     constant
  resistance    has been       constructed,      and promises      to   give very good
  results.  I hope    to lay a description of it before the Society next winter.
      By the kindness of Sir William Thomson and Professor Fleeming
  Jenkin, my stock of available resistance coils and capacity standards
  has lately been       much increased         ; and   I   have   been able     to satisfy
   myself as to the thorough practicability of all the above methods of
  electrical measurement.             I  reserve   details in the meantime           ;   but
   may mention that the differential             telephone    shows    differences     as to
   self-induction between          the so-called     induction-less resistance         coils.
   I have measured this difference           in the   case   of two 1000 coils in one
   of Elliot's boxes,      and find       it about what might         be expected      from
   theory  (see   Maxwell, "Electricity and Magnetism," vol.                  ii  p. 291).
   I believe,   from preliminary experiments on capacity measurements
   with this instrument, that it will be possible                  by means of         it to
   compare     capacities   of the order of       a   microfarad to the xxrsmrs Part
   (provided, of course, that capacity turns out to be definite to that
   degree of accuracy).
      Since   I have    had    the    use of standards      of capacity     I have     been

 able to add       to the   general   experiments with the differential and
 ordinary telephone above described.               In particular,      I have repeated
 the experiments of Grant in several                striking      forms, and made        a
 variety      of others    of a similar      nature.        I   havo    gone   into   the
 mathematical theory of these results, and,                   I  think, succeeded       in
 explaining       the curious changes in the quality and intensity of the
 sounds observed.         Among the results, I should desire particularly
 to draw attention to the theory of the striking alterations produced
 by condensers in the pitch, or, more correctly speaking,                    quality of
 telephone      sounds.
  2.  On the Determination of the Specific Heat of Saline Solu
       tions.      By Thomas Gray, B.Sc, Demonstrator in Physics,
       and Instructor        in Telegraphy, Imperial                College of Engi
       neering, Tokio, Japan.            Communicated by Professor Tait.
     The object of the present paper is to describe the results obtained
 and the mode of experimenting adopted                    in    some    determinations
 which     I  have made of the specific heats of solutions of salts.              These
 experiments form part of          a series   which     I   am     at present carrying
 out on the physi<al        changes     produced    when salts are dissolved in
 different amounts of their solvents.             From such an investigation             I
believe much information            may bo gained         regarding the       nature of
 solution.
     The method       of experimenting adopted             in the experiments de
scribed below was that of mixtures              ;  but as regards the mode in
which the exact amount of heat added to the solution was measured,
it   differed    from any process with which             I   am    acquainted.      This
peculiarity consisted in using         as  heater a thin       glass bottle of about
50 cubic        centimetres    capacity,   and furnished with            a  long glass
neck, just wide enough to allow an ordinary mercury-in-glass thermo
meter to pass through.           This bottle   was nearly tilled with mercury,
in which       was immersed      the bulb of a sensitive thermometer,               and
thus the temperature          of the mercury in the bottle could be read
off at any instant.           The graduation of this thermometer                 was to
fifths of    a degree centigrade,    and    had been compared           with the Kew
standards.        The distance    between    two consecutive          divisions of its
scale was about one millimetre.

    The liquid, whose specific         heat was to be determined,         was placed
in a thin glass beaker of about 350 cubic centimetres                capacity,  which
in its turn was contained within a thick porcelain vessel of about
two centimetres        greater diameter.        The two vessels were separated
by    a packing of cotton wool, which prevented in great measure loss
of heat, and at the same time permitted the inside beaker to be
removed      and replaced with facility.           To measure the temperature
of the solution       a   very sensitive mercury-in-glass thermometer was
employed.         This  thermometer,      which had also been         compared    with
the    Kew   standards,     was graduated     to tenths of a degree centigrade,
and the distance         between     two successive divisions was about one
 millimetre.
    It  is evident from what          has   been stated       above   that a rise of
 temperature      of one degree could be determined within two per cent.
 of its true amount, and therefore          a rise  of temperature     of four or five
 degrees could be        measured     with great accuracy.          There are other
 causes of inaccuracy, however,          than incorrect reading of the tempera
 ture, of which the most important is perhaps                 the variation    of  tem
 perature in the course of the experiment.               All   these causes of error
 were carefully allowed for, and in most cases three experiments made
 for each density of solution, the arithmetical mean of the results of
 which was taken          as  the true   specific   heat for the solution       of  the
 density in question.
    The heater was arranged to have about one-tenth                   of the thermal
 capacity of the liquid, so that the temperature               of the liquid experi
 mented on should not be raised much above that of the atmosphere,
 and consequently only a small amount of heat be lost by radiation.
 The method of experimenting was              as  follows  : —
     In   the first place the thermal capacity           of   the glass beaker was
 determined.        This   was done     by filling it to about half the required
 height with water at the temperature              of the atmosphere, and at the
 same time      a  similar vessel was tilled with water about              10° above
 atmospheric       temperature.       The temperature        and rate   of cooling of
 this water were accurately determined, and then the temperature                      of
 the water in the beaker.            The two quantities of water were then
 mixed, and the temperature             read at the end        of two minutes and
 again at the end of four minutes.             The difl'erenco between these two
 readings     added    to   the  first reading     gave the temperature         of the

mixture.        The differences between this temperature                         and each of the
other two temperatures,                 viz., the high             temperature      corrected        for
cooliug, and the low temperature,                       gave the fall and rise of tempera
ture respectively.             Calling now w the weight of water in the beaker,
wl the weight of water added, t tho rise of temperature,                               tl   the   fall of

almost exactly 12 as its value.*
     The thermal capacity of tho heater was next determined.                                        This
was done        by filling the vessel with the same volume of water as                                   1
intended to use of the solutions, and finding the rise of temperature
produced in the water                  by nearly the same change of temperature
in   the heater as was to bo used in tho experiments.                               Putting       w' for
the weight of water,             t'   for the rise of temperature,               t\ for the fall of
temperature       of the heater, and          c'   for its thermal capacity, wo get

It   is   manifestly of great importance that tho value of                             c'   should be
known with accuracy, and accordingly the experiments                                   for determin
ing   it   were made with the utmost care.                       As   tho following results         of   a
series of experiments do not vary by one per cent. from the mean
result, we may conclude                that the mean result             is   true to   a    fraction of
one per cent.

      The following          is   a   description of the mode of performing an ex
periment.           The volume of the solution                      is   first roughly measured in
a    graduated        flask, the       liquid      is    then poured               into the beaker and
weighed.           The beaker          is    then     placed      in the pad of cotton wool,
ami     the   thermometer              put into position within it.                                 The heater              is
placed      on    a   hot plate and heated to about 95° C.                                    ;   it    is   then lifted
off and shaken               up to bring             tho whole               of    the            mercury to one
temperature,           and    placed     in the solution, the temperatures                                           of the
solution and of the mercury in the heater being carefully read just
before the heater            is   immersed.           Thus all uncertainty                         as to         what the
temperature           of the heater was when                 it   was placed in the                          liquid       was
avoided.          The temperature                of the solution was noted four or five
minutes after tho heater was placed                            in     it,    the     liquid having first
been stirred to equalise its temperature.                             After this interval of time
there was no appreciable                 difference          between the temperatures                                 of the
heater      and liquid.            Another          reading of tho                  temperature                      of   the
solution was made after the lapse of an equal interval of time, and
tho     difference      of the two readings added to the first to allow for
cooling.

   It  is interesting     to note   the  nearness     in  every case     of the value
of the specific heat per unit volume to unity.                I  am continuing      my
experiments,      and hope later to be able to state the results of a more
extended series of observations.
             3. On a "Navigational"              Sounding Machine.
                               By  J. Y.    Buchanan.
   The sounding machine of which the annexed figure is a represen
tation, is intended for use at considerable depths while the ship is
proceeding      on her course.        It   is therefore     necessarily    capable    of
                indicating     the depths independently            of  the length     of
     )J a       sounding line or wire usod.              It  possesses the     further
                great   practical advantage,      that when it has served            its
                purpose      once  it is   immediately available for another
                sounding.
      E             It indicates primarily        the extent to which         a given
      Z          volume of air at atmospheric pressure                has been con
                 densed    by the column of water to which it has been
                 subjected.      As the law of the compression               of air is
                 known, the depth reached by the instrument is at once
      _          deduced.
                    The instrument consists of           a tube    A B, which may
                 either  be  of uniform diameter,       or made up of lengths         of
                 different diameters     ;   in the figure       the  instrument      is
                 represented    as made    of two sizes of tube.        This answers
      —          all practical requirements.       The lower end B is contracted
      _          into a nozzle so   as to receive a piece      of india-rubber tulw
     ~    |
                 which can be plugged          with  a glass    rod.    At the other
      —
                 end A,    a piece  of tube drawn out to          a  moderately fine
                 point is inserted,    the point being bent slightly round,
                 and fused hermetically into the end of the tube.                  The
      —
                 end   A  is thus closed by a sort of crooked funnel, which
                 on the upper side is contracted           to an orifice, at least as
            B    small  as  that of the end of the tube, projecting inwards.
                 The object of this is to sift the            water and allow no
                 solid particles to enter which will not pass through the
                 lower orifice    of the funnel.          The instrument is cali
brated either by weighing          or by measuring        the water which        it can

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                             695
  hold.     As   tho volume assumed by the air is inversely as the pressure,
 it  can at once he graduated           into fathoms or other units of depth.
     For   use   it   is enclosed   in a brass tube, and attached          to the sound
 ing line and allowed to sink.              As it sinks   the air is compressed, and
  its place taken by water which enters through the funnel, and being
 delivered in       a fine stream against      tho walls of the tube runs down
 and collects at the lower end.               On bringing the instrument to the
 surface     again      tho   water   cannot   get   out,   but the compressed          air
 occupying tho upper portion of the tube gradually expands through
tho orifice,       which      it thus completely       occupies      and prevents      tho
entrance       of water.        Arrived    at the surface, the depth is read            off
 directly    if tho instrument         is divided    into units of depth, or if its
 scale is arbitrary the depth i9 found from a table constructed accord
 ing to the results of calibration.            When this has been done the plug
 C is removed, the water runs out, tho plug is replaced,                         and   tho
 instrument is ready for use.
     Last summer          I had frequent occasion to test the accuracy              of one
of those instruments in the deep waters of Loch Fyue, and found it
 most    satisfactory.         The instrument which         I  used had an arbitrary
scale of equal           lengths,  and had     been very carefully calibrated by
weight.        From the results of the calibration              I  constructed a table
of depths corresponding to the graduation, on the assumption that it
was inversely proportional             to the   volume assumed by the air, and
neglecting any effect of this pressure in causing increased absorption.
     The following results obtained on 13th June 1879, while anchored
in   87 fathoms off Garrock            Head in Frith of Clyde, will show               tho

 the reading noted.         The calculated reading which it ought to have
shown on the above assumption is put down, and it will be seen
how closely the two agree.
    This instrument        is especially adapted          for surveying-work      where
 lines of sounding in comparatively deep water have to be run                         for
considerable distances, as in the English or Irish Channels, or the
North     Sea.    The sounding line or wire is arranged to pay over the
stern, and     arrangements         are made      for promptly heaving it in on
bottom being reached.              The engines are kept going at a convenient
and uniform rate, and the revolution                 counteracted; it is then easy
with good organisat ion to take soundings every hundred, two hundred,
five hundred, or thousand           revolutions.       In the want of      a revolution-
counter,    which, however,         ought to be fitted to every marine engine,
equally good results can be obtained                if  the engineer     pays attentiou
to keep his engine         going uniformly, checking its rate at frequent
intervals by counting the revolutions in a minute, by making the
soundings at regular intervals of time.                  The number of revolutions
made     by tho engines        in   a vessel    of known capabilities is a very
accurate means of ascertaining the distance                  run, and   if this method
 were adopted       the deep sounding of            a  survey could be worked off
with great expedition and accuracy.
    There is one property of this sounding-machine which must not
be lost sight of, namely, that         it registers the sum total of the increments
of pressure.       If it is to  give the depth correctly it must both descend
and ascend        without     interruption, and in the work for which it is
designed     this condition is always fulfilled.              Suppose,   for instance, it
bo sunk to 20 fathoms and                 bo then drawn up to 10 fathoms, the
 corresponding quantity of air will be eliminated.                   If it is now again
 sunk to 20 fathoms,         the    place of the air which left while it was
 rising from 20 to 10 fathoms,             will be taken by water, and         if it now
 be brought to the surface           it will of    course    register a depth greater
 than 20 fathoms.
     It follows from the principle of this instrument that the value of
 its graduation scale will vary to a certain extent with the barometric
 pressure.     For   purposes      of navigation the error so caused is neglige-
 able,   but   if  used    for    surveying      purposes      a  correction    must be
 applied.
     The instrument is graduated for            a barometric     pressure of 30 inches.

   4.  On the Compressibility of Glass.              By J. Y. Buchanan.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The experiments      related   in this   paper    were undertaken with a
view to determine,      by actual    observation, the effect produced           on
solids by hydraulic     pressure.    The instrument used consists             of a
hydraulic    pump, which communicates          with    a steel receiver    capable
of holding    instruments of considerable        size, and also with a second
receiver   of peculiar form.       This  receiver    consists   essentially   of a
steel tube terminated at each end by thick glass tubes iitted tightly.
It  is tapped    at the centre with two holes, the one to establish           con
nection with the pump and the other to admit               a pressure-gauge      or
manometer.       The steel tube may be of any length, being limited
only by the extent of laboratory accommodation               at disposal.     The
tube which     I  am using at present       has a length of a little over six
feet and an internal diameter of about three-tenths           of an inch.     The
solid to be experimented      on must be in the form of rod or wire, and
must, at the ends, at least, be sufficiently small to be able to enter
the   terminal glass tubes, which have         a bore    of 008 inch, and an
external diameter     of 0"42 inch.      The length of the rod or wire is
such that, when it rests in the steel tube, its ends are visible in the
glass terminations.
   The experiment is conducted           as  follows   : —A   microscope      with
micrometic eyepiece      is brought to bear on each end of the rod or
wire.    These microscopes     stand on substantial platforms, altogether
independent of the hydraulic apparatus.            The pressure is now raised
to the desired height, as indicated       by the manometer,        and the euds
of the rod are observed and their position with reference to the micro
meter noted.     The pressure is then carefully relieved, and         a displace
ment    of both ends is seen to take place and its amplitude noted.
The sum of the displacements        of the ends, regard being had to their

the glass rod, when                the    pressure    at its surface          is reduced        by the
observed       amount, and consequently also of the compression                                   when
the process is reversed.                  As, in the case of non-crystalline                    bodies
like glass, there is no reason why a given pressure should produce a
greater      effect    in    one direction          than in another, we may, without
sensible error, put the cubical compression                        at three times the linear
contraction for the same pressure.
   The rod experimented on was made                               of lead      glass,    drawn          by
Messrs Ford of Edinburgh,                    and was 75' 05 inches              long.        The tem
perature      of the water in the hydraulic                      machine varied from 12-5°
to 13 '5° C.        The pressure varied from             1     to 240 atmospheres.             Ninety-
one separate observations                 were     made, and the general              result    is,   that
the linear compressibility of the glass under experiment                                is   0"96, and
its cubic compressibility 2'92 per million per atmosphere.
       5.   Suggestions               Art of Signalling. By Alexander
                                 on the
                           Macfarlaue, M.A., D.Sc., F.B.S.E.
                                            (Abstract.)
   After considering               the analogy       which exists between               the     arts        of
writing      and      of signalling,         the     author proceeded           to discuss what
alphabet       is     the    most     suitable where the             physical         agent     is     not
electricity.          If    we choose       for elementary         signals two qualities of
the agent of communication                   A     and   15,   which can be produced in-
dependently of one another,                   then     the agent      can be put into four
states,     viz., 1st, having the quality A, but not the quality                               B;      2d,
having the quality               B,   but not the quality         A ;   3d, having both the
qualities     A     and     B;   4th, having neither of the                  qualities   A and B.
One of these states           is   required to separate letter from letter, and word
from word       ;     the fourth state where the agent                  is   undifferentiated,              is
the one naturally             adapted       for the purpose.            From the remaining
three states we can get               3   permutations of one signal,             9   permutations
of two signals, 27 permutations of three signals.                        Without going                 to   a
higher permutation than that of three signals, we get 39 symbols,*
   *
       Three of these would probably require to be omitted                   as repeating      the same
signal   three times.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                     699
which arc sufficient for the numerals                  and all the letters         contained
in the Morse alphabet,             less by one.           These     symbols wo suppose
assigned     to the letters according to their frequency of occurrence                      as
given in that alphabet.
    In  tho ease of the Morse system we have only three                       states of the
agent   ;  the third of the above           states is not, or cannot be, made use
of.    As   one is required for the purpose                 of spacing,      only two are
left to form symbols.            To form equivalents for tho 39                      symbols
spoken of above,           it requires        2   permutations         of one signal,        4
permutations of two signals,               8  permutations of three,            15   of four,
and 10 of live.        Thus in the former              case   102 signals are required
to form tho alphabet, in the latter 144.
    If  the    elementary     signals of tho           Morse       system    are    made    to
depend      on a    difference      in quantity,         then the above          qualitative
system possesses other two advantages.                     Its signals,   as they    ditfer in
quality, can each be made to occupy tho minimum time necessary
for a signal to be observed, whereas                   in the other        case   the longer
signal occupies thrice the time of the shorter                   ;  secondly,    elementary
signals differing in quantity require, though belonging to the same
letter, to     be  separated     by an interval, whereas               those    differing in
quality do not.
    By   assuming     that each of the qualitative signals can be sent in
the same       period of time         as  the   short signals,        also that the time
required in the Morse quantitative system                       for the space between
tho elements of a letter is equal to that period, and the time required
for  a space     between     the    letters to     thrice that period,        I   have been
able to calculate      the relative times           required by the two systems to
signal    the    words London,           Edinburgh,         Dublin.        The     respective
ratios are 2-8,     2"6,  and   2-9.      We    may therefore         conclude,     assuming

 f<.   Note on the Wire Microphone.                        By R. M. Ferguson, Ph.D.
       At our    last meeting           Professor     Chrystal       showed        us that     a   fine
platinum wire attached to                 a   stretched    disc of skin could act as an
electric    telephone         receiver     for     the sounds        of   a    violin.      The wire
was included in       a      galvanic circuit, and the variations of current were
made by      a   microphone attached to the violin.                       The account he gave
of this interesting experiment was that the receiving wire became
extended        by the heat of the current either as                      it   was established or
suddenly increased by the microphone, and correspondingly shortened
on the current ceasing.                 These extensions        and contractions were ren
dered      audible by the disc.               A     similar demonstration with a like
commentary         was       made       by Mr
                                  Preece to the Royal Society of
London, an account  of which was published in "Nature " (June 10).
Mr Preeco got his wires to speak.   At the first May meeting of this
Society in 1878      I       discussed     the subject of the sounds emitted by fine
wires, giving passage to intermittent currents.                   I       found that the ordin
ary thread telephone gave us an easy means of hearing these sounds
in non-magnetic          metals.         Do   la   Rive had heard them in 1845, but
since his time no one had been able                       to hear them, and they were
almost looked on as apocryphal.                    I   attached      the thread of the             skin
or paper telephone transversely to the sounding wire, and not directly,
as     Professor Chrystal has done, for the simple reason that                             I   found
that the transverse method gave equally good results with very much
less trouble.       The cause in both cases seemed to me the same, viz.,
an internal molecular click which marked the setting                             in and     stoppage
of the current.              In   the   kindly      reference   that Professor              Chrystal
made to my communication he considered                          it   strange that his simple
explanation should have been overlooked, that the sounds should be
set down as having conditions the same as those of heat and yet the

simplest and most certain effect of heat passed over.                  I must confess
that the communication deserved that criticism, for the possibility of
longitudinal extensions and contractions is not once referred to.                   At
the same time     I  may say that      I thought then,     as   I  do now, that such
extensions and contractions are not the cause of these sounds, and
the object of this note is to give the ground for such a belief.                      I
may shortly recapitulate        why    I  thought so then.
   In  the first place  I was     satisfied   with the account given by De la
Rive.     He looked upon      the sounds as a magnetic            phenomenon.      The
wire became somehow magnetised and demagnetised                     by the beginning
and end of the current, and the molecules             of the wire, in taking and
losing the magnetic     set,  hit against each other and emitted the sounds
in question.     He thought that such was the           case   from the exceptional
position that iron occupied among the metals he worked with, and
from the exactly similar action           of wires within      a magnetising spiral
through which an intermittent current was sent, and those giving
direct passage to the same current.              The Bell telephone gave me an
additional confirmation of this view.               Any   one who listens to the
sounds emitted      by discs of different metals          when the telephoae         is
excited by    a strong discontinuous current and then listens to those
given out by wires of the same metals when excited by direct pas
sage of ths same current, as revealed by the thread telephone,                  cannot
fail to be struck by the perfect correspondence              of the results in both
cases.    If  parity of performance         can give any ground for suspecting
the same cause, then       if  the action of the Bell discs be attributed to
magnetism,     so must also be the action of these sounding wires.                This
seemed to me at the time convincing enough.
   But in addition to De la Rive's magnetic                   theory,    it seemed to
me that the sounds        originated within the wires, and that they did
not need to expend their blows on anything external before sounds
were   produced.      They could be heard when the wires were lying
loosely on a table      by    the aid of a telephone           with    a   wire thread
soldered    to them.      When thrust into          the   passage of the ear the
wires could be heard distinctly            without any devico         for magnifying
their   loudness.     An    arc of wire suspended          from the thread of a
telephone,    with   each end dipping          into adjoining cups of mercury,
sounded     as loud    as   if abutting       on something solid.            Again,  it
seemed to me       unlikely that    a   wire should receive and divest itself

of its he.it       as   suddenly       as      it did of its       electric charge.             A wire takes
a sensible          time     to warm lip to the                    balance     of internal gain and
external loss of heat and also to lose the heat it has acquired.                                               Now,
unless tho increments and                       decrements          of length are in the strictest
sense momentary, they cannot affect a telephone                                        disc.         The clear
click that a wire emits when                          a    current begins or          ceases         in   it,   both
exactly equal in loudness,                      seemed to me too sharp for the compara
tively sluggish course of expansion and contraction by heat and cold.
If   Professor Chrystal's theory be correct,                            it    can only be the              initial
increment and decrement of heat that count in this phenomenon,
and not subsequent gradual gain or loss.                                  Rapidity of alternation                    is
by no means necessary, for one close or break in                                a    second      is   as clearly
rendered as 500.                 The extension theory thus appears to me to sub
stitute      a   thermal for     a   magnetic             onset, and to make         it    as   likely that          a
sounding clash of molecules accompanies                                 it.
     It     struck me on considering Professor Chrystal's reasoning on the
experiment he exhibited, that                        if    the sound be really in the wire, the
skin disc,        if    placed   in   the middle instead of at the end of it, would
still     sound.        We should           have thus two telephonic receivers, one on
each side of the disc.                    If   the sound was due to the push and                                pull
of tho wire on getting longer and shorter,                                     the    two wires would
eliminate the effect the one of the other, but                                if   to internal            commo
tion, little change would                      be observed         whether we had           a    sounder on
one side or on both.                  So far          as  I      have been able        to ascertain the
latter       is   the    case.   I        arranged          an     experiment in the                  following
way     : — wrefyhrto         is   a      composite              thread consisting          of       very       fine
platinum wire and fine                    cotton thread —            ef   and yh are the platinum
parts.            The thread         is   kept stretched             by two equal weights ic,w.
Tho middle of the thread                       is   attached to the skin or paper disc of an
ordinary mechanical telephone                              dd.     The thread         is    symmetrically
made up on each side of the disc,                            ef   and    yh being exactly equal                      in
every way.              At   the ends of the platinum wires, wires of copper are
soldered          which dip           into          the    mercury cups Mm and n,                         cz    is    a
Bunsen battery of six cells.                                        current interrupter               or micro

used        for my last          communication, vibrating                       some six             times       per
second.       I     do not suppose                  that this deliberate beat,                  as   compared
with Professor Chrystal's microphone,                               which vibrated from 200 to

»fl)0 times a second, can affect the                          result, as what holds for one beat
holds for all.              I   have not beside me a delicate                        microphone,             but    so
far   as    I   could judge from the rough one in my possession                                        there was
no difference           in action between the break and it.                               ABCD          is a key
the handle of which, by virtue of its elasticity, rests on the stud                                                  T!,
but   it    can be pressed            down on D and thus disconnected                                      from B.
The thread             is   stretched      on two rods of glass rr, and the telephone
may     be      held in the hand or placed on                            a    supporting board.                    The
current can take two courses according to the position of tho handle

as far as         A     from which             it   passes to       D    through          K   to   I   and    z.    In
the first course both the wires                          gh   and   ef   are included, in the latter
only gh,          ef   being 'shunted out.               To keep the resistance                    the same in
the latter case,            a    platinum wire po, of the same length and thick
ness as </,            is   interposed.             We   have in the first case, as                I        view    it,
two opposing receivers                         on the extension theory or two sounders                              on
the internal            click theory.               In   the second           case    we have          a    receiver
the same as that of Professor Chrystal.                                  The sound emitted by the
disc    is      much the same in loudness                           when both wires sound                          and
when only one does                   ;    if    anything,     I     fancy      it    is   in favour of the
opposing wires.                  There         is   also a slight change              in sound.               When
the  experiment    so arranged that the wire itself passes through
                                is
the disc, and we have    continuous wire from
                                      a         to   and when the               h             e,
key    is    readjusted          to take off the current from m and                            lead    it    back to
I,    of course through               a    portion of wire equal to that shunted out
           vol.   x.                                                                                   4r

704                     Proceeding of         the   Royal Society
the sound is very much            enhanced,      arising no doubt from the                    wire
coming in         direct contact      with     the     disc.     To     see   if   the    dipping
copper wires had any influence on the sound,                      I   first held them fixed
in the hand and found no change.                  I   then took out the mercury and
put in    a  solution of common salt using copper                      electrodes      ; the disc
sounded       for  a beat or    two and then ceased, but when the dipping
parts were of platinum the beats were quite regular.                             In this latter
case the sound        was accompanied          by   a  slight hissing arising from the
action of the disengaged              gases, but this            was      quite removed on
holding the wires.            The sound       got when brine or acidulated water
is put in the cups is not so loud as with mercury, in consequence                                of
 the diminution        of current strength.
    We    do not get the same loudness                  with this arrangement               of the
 disc   in the middle        as  when only one wire                is    tightened and the
 other left loose, for the simple reason that the tightness and conse
 quent elasticity which is favourable to the action of the telephone
 cannot     bo so easilA       got at with a disc balanced                between two equal
 pulls.     However,      as   the common         disc     is stretched        more      perfectly
the sound rises, so as to leave no doubt, that                       if  the exact tightness
were got, the two-pull           telephone      would       be as good as the one            with
the single pull.         Much may        be:  said     of the necessary imperfection
attending the two-pull telephone.                    The threads          on each side        may
 not bo precisely in       a  straight line, the friction on the rods may not
 be exactly      alike, and that coupled with the comparative                       fixity of  the
 disc may make a slight difference                 of pull on opposite              sides.    But
 taking all these into account, one would expect that                             as the    condi
 tions approach perfection there would be                   a corresponding silence, but
 such is not the case.          You   may take         the telephone         into your hand,
 move    it gently about in all directions              to secure a position where the
 loudness      is less, but such      is not to be found.                  So far, then, as       I
 can interpret this two-pull          telephone,        it is something         else than the
 pull of the wire that emits            the sound, and the single pull                     experi
 ment by no means            proves   the existence           of sudden        extensions and
 contractions in the wires.              I   do not, on the other hand, say that
 my two-pull        experiment disproves them.                  The conduct of a wire
 expanding instantaneously in every part may produce an effect like
 a  molecular click,         but   if  so   its action must be something very
 different from the simple pull supposed.                       A   stretched        disc with   a

 stretched         thread seems to be capable                      of rendering all kinds of vibra
 tions as well         as those         that come normal to its surface.
     I   also tried        if   heat or cold on the sounding wires would alter their
 powers.          I   endeavoured                to apply ice, but unsuccessfully.                         It     was
 difficult to devise an experiment in which it could be applied and
 removed          so quickly           as    to produce          a contrast.          It    is also probable
that the difference of temperature                              between      that of ordinary air and
the freezing point may hardly be great enough to become sensible to
the      ear.     With      the Ihvnsen lamp it was, however, different.                                     It   can
be easily applied and                       easily withdrawn.              I    clamped          between          two
binding           screws        about        2i inches of No.                   25    platinum           wire.         I
attached          a thinner platinum wire to                       it,   which acted          as       the thread
of   a     parchment telephone                        pulled     transversely.             On applying the
lamp the sound became sensibly louder and remained                                             so at     a   whito
heat.           On cooling       it    again fell off.             In    the same manner           I     listened
to the effect of           a    No.     IS       soft iron wire.          There was          a     singular in
crease of loudness               just up             to the     point below which iron became
visibly         hot, then there was               a    decided     falling off       as the       wire readied
a   full    red, but       it   still continued sounding                  so far as could be judged
under the loudness that                     it   had before the lamp was applied.                          When
the lamp was withdrawn                        the sounds          waxed and grew less in reverse
order.          When the telephone threads were wires of copper and iron
the same was observed.                           When       the sound        begins        to diminish the
iron     is     quite hard, so          it       is   not due to the softening of the iron,
which may to some extent account for the falling off at                                       a    white heat.
In results like         these      it       is   possible       to discuss      the question of mole
cular impact          ccrmm      expansion, on              a   new footing.           In    the case of the
platinum the result               is   much as one would expect, for the rate of                                  in
crease of its electric resistance                        and of its expansion are generally
allowed to increase at high temperatures.                                      The increase of sound
may thus be associated with the one as well as with the other.                                               Iron,
however,         is   exceptional.               1Je    la Rive      thought that the sounds of
wires were         in proportion to electric resistance                         except       in    the case of
iron which stood quite by itself.                              Here, again, in reference                 to high
temperatures          it   is   quite peculiar.                This Society          has more than once
learned         from Professor Tait, and those who have worked with him,
of the critical temperature                      of iron about       a   dull   red heat,         in   reference
to the specific heat of electricity, thermal and electric                                     conductivity,

   Subepiphysal Bone              Growth. — Two processes must        be noticed in
this connection.
    1st,   The     replacement        of the neck of the cartilaginous      head   or
epiphysis by cancellous             tissue  as an accompaniment       to the rise of
the epiphysis caused by the growth of the cartilage forming its neck.
   The cartilage is channelled by the advancing marrow, the rows of
cartilage   capsules being opened up.
   The opening up of the rows of cartilage capsules results                from the
presence of      a  capillary blood-vessel       forming the head of the column
of marrow which lies in immediate                 contact with the next unopened
capsule (Ranvier).             The close proximity into which the pabulum is
thus brought with the cartilage               corpuscle   in the unopened    capsule
nearest    it   causes     it   to grow    rapidly   and absorb    the surrounding
cartilage,    this occurring, quickest in the direction of least resistance
that is, towards the marrow.
   The cartilage capsules communicate                with  each other by means of
fine channels,       a  fact already hinted at by Budge.
   The osseous tissue which is deposited               upon the cartilage   spicules,
or septa which          result from the channelling of the cartilage,          forms
the cancellous       tissue   ;  this forms  a stable base  otf which the epiphysis

rises  by growth of the cartilaginous zone immediately above                       the
primary cancellous      spaces.
    2nd, The     extension of the shaft         occurs     by opposition       to its
extremity, thus keeping          up with the recession           of the   epiphysis.
The extension of the shaft in length does not             lift  the head.
    The area of proliferation in which these changes occur at the end
of the shaft lies in an angular groove            at the point where the neck
joins the epiphysis, called by Ranvier encorhe d'osttification.
    This author describes fibres in the outer part of the encoche,                that
is the periosteum,       which    stretched    from    the     periosteum to the
cartilaginous head in which they became lost.
    The existence of these is undoubted, and very general.

function of resorping bone, occur in certain well-marked situations                    ;
their origin is from the perivascular connective              tissue, i.e., within a
short distance     of the line of ossification under the epiphysis, and
extending over a considerable area, they diminish                   the number of
spicules   opening up the cancelli.          Under the head           of bones, the

3.   On the Wire Telephone            and its Application            to the .Study
    of the Properties of strongly Magnetic Metals.                         By Pro
    fessor Chrystal.
    Four distinct   sources of sound were noticed            in  the course of the
experiments.
    1. The variation of the longitudinal         tension of the wire, owing to
variation in the heating, still appears to be the most likely explana
 tion of the action      of the wire telephone,       when     a  very fine wire of
 ordinary metal is used.          Experiments       were tried with        induction
 coils of various sizes, the violin and microphone being put into the
 primary circuit and the fine wire telephone           into the secondary.           It
 was found that the sound diminished            as the spark-giving power of
 the coil increased.       With Professor Tait's        large    induction    coil no
 sound   at  all could    be obtained, when the            secondary     was   closed
 through the most sensitive wire        I possess.

708                                  Proceedings           of    the    Roy id Society
      2.    It   was           found, however, that when the secondary                                       circuit was
broken, loud sounds were emitted at the pools of the mercury break.
These        sounds             appear      to be duo             to electrostatic               action.         They are
most probably of the same nature as those                                                obtaiued iu Thomson's
singing condenser, Edison's condenser telephone,                                              &c.
      3.    If   the wire of the wire telephone                               be placed across the                lines of
force in a strong                    magnetic        Held, very loud and pure sounds                              are ob
tained when                a   current interrupted by                   a   tuning-fork is passed through
it.        These       sounds          can be obtained with                       very thick wires of any
metal.           If    a tolerably thin wire be used, although the sound is not
much louder, the amplitude of the vibration increases                                                   ;    as much as
2     mm. was observed.
      4.    Experiments                were        also     made        with         a    view to explain                the
anomalous             behaviour of iron wires established                                  by De la Rive and
Dr      Ferguson.
      Experiments with soft iron wires showed that the sounds did not,
in the       ca*e          of iron, depend                in the same way on the length and
thickness             as   they do in the                 case   of ordinary metals, and that their
quality is essentially different.                            The note of the interrupter is often
not heard at all, but instead, a variety of other notes are produced,
some of them very high accompanied                                      with      a fizzing       or buzzing noise.
      The sound depends on the temperature                                       of the wire, being loudest
about        a    dull         red    heat,       just    above        the       temperature           at which          the
abnormal extension and contraction and the re-glow are usually ob
served.           At higher            temperatures              the sound falls off very rapidly.
      These results              suggested          that the sound                 is a consequence                 of the
magnetism              of the iron            ;    for, in the case of soft iron, the magnetic
susceptibility is at                   a   maximum about the temperature                                    above       men
tioned, and falls off very rapidly at higher temperatures.
      Experiments                with      steel     wires settled                the     question,         for it was
found that when the steel was made white hot and then tempered,
so as to         deprive it of its permanent                           magnetism           and make it hard,               it
gave no sound                    at all in the wire                telephone.              On magnetising                 it,
however,          by stroking once or twice with                                 a   bar magnet,            it   sounded
quite distinctly, giving                    a     high note and              a   soft fizzing sound.
      The effect of heating                   a     magnetised              steel wire      is    as   follows      :— At
first the sound falls off, first the fizzing disappears,                                            then      the       high
ii«,n   ;   then comes an interval of silence;                                    then,     as    the temperature

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                  709
increases,    the  high note comes in again             ;  then the fizzing        sound,
which     quickly rises to      a deep buzz      accompanied         by several     notes,
among      which may be heard the note of the interrupting                         tuning
fork   ; as   the temperature       goes on increasing, these sounds die out
again in the corresponding order, and when the whole wire is bright
red, absolutely nothing can be heard.
    All   these   effects are explained        by the magnetism           of the steel.
 The first effect of heat is to destroy the iiermanent mainetism, which
 about 2.50° C. is practically insensible ; above this temperature the
susceptibility    for induced       magnetixm     increases      very fast, reaches       a
 maximum about dull red, and then falls off again.
    Advantage was taken of Professor Tait's thermoelectric diagram
 to verify the close connection between            the magnetic,        thermoelectric,
 and other characteristic physical properties              of iron and its power of
 producing sounds,        w hen   traversed    by  a   varying current of electri
 city.    The agreement was found to be very striking.
    Similar experiments        were made with nickel, which is remarkable
 for the low temperature        at which it loses its magnetic           susceptibility.
 The behaviour of       a  nickel strip in the wire telephone            was exactly    in
 accordance     with its magnetic         properties.       The results     of thermo-
 metric and thermoelectric measurements,              rendered the agreement          still
 more remarkable.
    Cobalt, when magnetised             and   heated,     gave   first  a  minimum of
 sound and then an increase           ;  but no maximum was reached at the
 highest temperature         (a bright    red), to which       I   exposed   it.     This,
again, is what is to bo expected from its magnetic properties.
    Both with cobalt,         and   with steel which had been softened                 by
 heating to a high temperature,            the effects duo to permanent            and to
 induced magnetism          interfere,   so  that no period of absolute           silence
 appears.      Occasionally this interference         produces      very strong beats.
 A full  account of the experiments          above alluded to        will be published
 in  "Nature" (vol. xxii. No. 561, p. 303— July 29, 1880).
    In the thermo-electric measurement above referred to I                       had the
 able assistance of     Dr Knott,       whose   experience     in such work is well
 known     to the  Society.      The curves from which the above references
 were drawn were constructed by him, and                     will    bo given     in the

       Scotland.       Communicated         by Professor Geikie.

    The species enumerated          in this paper belong        to the two orders
Phillopoda and Decapoda.
    Of the Phyllopods, the author describes two species of Cerat ioearis
(Salter), which differ from their Upper Silurian allies in the enor
mously-developed abdomen             and   in the small size of the carapace,
also in the comparative        insignificance of the side spines        of the tail
compared      with the telson.      As far    as the author is aware, theso are
the first obtained from the Calciferous             Sandstone     series, although
carapaces of Cerai ioearis have         been got from the Mountain Lime
stone of England.        (C. Scorpioides,    11 to 2 inches long; C. elongatus,
5 to 8 inches long.)
    Of  the    Decapods,     seven    new   species   are described,      viz., five
belonging to the genus Anthrapalamion (Salter), one belonging to
the genus      Palceocrangon      (Salter).     These do      not differ    in  any
essential    respect   from the recent        Macrurous      Decapods,    and   one
belonging to      Palneocaris (Meek and Worthen) — a              genus which, as
far as the author is aware, has hitherto only been got from the
Illinois Coalfield, in     the   United   States, and is represented        by only
one species, the Palceocaris typus (Meek and Worthen).                     He pro
poses to call the present one        P.  Scoticus.    This   is a most interesting
creature,    for the carapace      extends     only over    the   cephalic region,
while the thoracic segments are all free and movable, yet its cephalic
appendages      and the character of the tail show it to           be most    nearly
allied to the Macrurous Decapods.

    The   work     described    in this    paper    consists    of rather careful
measurements,       but under low dispersion only, of the spectra of
twenty    gas- vacuum    tubes, generally of different gases and illuminated
      vol.. x.                                                          4 y

 method     of viewing.
      A comparison     of the different spectra thus obtained follows, and
 some curious results are elicited               as to the prevalence      of certain
 impurities among       gases,  as   well as alterations and even transforma
 tions of some of thom with time and               use.
     These facts are contained        chiefly in Appendix         1 and  Appendix    2 ;
 while   a third appendix, kindly contributed by Professor Alexander
 Herschel, contains       some further observations           of his with the same
apparatus     but higher dispersion introduced.              See his account of the
same.

   4.   On the Diffusion of an Impalpable Powder into a Solid
         Body.     By E. Sydney Marsden, D.Sc., F.R.S.E., &c.
     In a note   on " The Effect of Heat on an Infusible,                 Impalpable
Powder," by Professor          1'.  G. Tait, in the Proceedings of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, vol. ix.           p.    298, for the year       1876-77, Pro
fessor   Tait points out that        such a powder becomes very fluid under
the action of heat, and behaves in many respects in the same way as
a   liquid   would do — viz., convection currents               are distinctly   to bo
observed,     and small particles of the powder are thrown up from the
surface,    in the same manner          as we perceive        little drops   of water
thrown up from the surface of a glass of soda-water.                   And Professor
Tait    then asks      the   question — If,       supposing we        had two     such
infusible, impalpable powders,           would they diffuse into one another
as do gases     and  liquids    ?    This   is a question which as yet has          not
been answered.         Professor Tait and          I  have been engaged       in  some
experiments       on   the   subject for some            time, but the diflieulties
(chemical     and physical) to be overcome              are much greater       than at
iiist sight    appear,    and at present we are unable to say definitely
whether they do so or not.            But    I  think   an answer may be obtained
from another source.          In   some recent experiments          I had occasion to
have a number of Berlin porcelain               crucibles and amorphous         carbon
in an impalpable powder kept in contact with each other at very
high temperatures        for from ten to twelve hours, with the following
effect,   that, although       the    crucibles did        not become     fused, but

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                               713
  retained their exact original form, yet the carbon found its way to
  a considerable       distance  into the crucible, and some of the particles
  penetrated       the crucible throughout.            This   was not a case, therefore,
  of fusion      and mechanical       mixture.
       On examining a section of the crucible under the microscope,                     the
  particles of carbon can be distinctly seen disseminated through the
  silica and alumina of the crucible, and thickest in the glaze and
  outer parts        which are nearest          to the carbon.        We    also notice    a
  number of " tricites" all along             the juncture of the alumina         with  the
  glaze of the crucible, arising from the devitrification                   of the glaze,
  and    a number of particles of larger size which are contained in the
  original crucible.        On examining           a  section   of the crucible before
  being used we        see nothing in the form of little black particles dis
 seminated        throughout, and are thus able to recognise                   more   com
 pletely these black specks            as carbon,     the result of diffusion.
      Now    carbon, so far as we know, has no chemical                   action on silica
 or alumina, and consequently it cannot have been taken into the
 crucible by chemical          action.        This, then, is    a  distinct   case  of the
 diffusion of an impalpable powder into               a solid body in    a softened state.
 And it     has the advantage         that, the solid body being transparent, we
 can,    by examining it with the microscope,                   see  what has actually
 taken place.         And   here   it   gives us an insight into another matter.
 It   is evident that this is precisely          what takes place in the conversion
 of bar iron into steel by the cementation                   process.    The carbon      in
 the    state of an impalpable powder diffuses                  into the bars of iron
 whilst they are in the softened state, the operation taking                    a  number
of days before it is completed.                Thus it seems to me to explain the
up to the present time unsettled question of the conversion of iron
into steel by the cementation              process, and to render unnecessary          the
" Occlsuion of        Oases" theory.
     In order to      make   absolutely certain of the fact that carbon               had
really penetrated        into the crucible,        I took a portion of the crucible,
pounded it down, and treated it with hydrofluoric acid for some days.
I   then    filtered off the insoluble residue             which was left, and after
treating it successively        with hydrochloric acid and soda, ultimately,
on largely diluting,         got the carlwn (in an exceedingly fino state)
suspended         in  the   water,     and     by decantation, and filtering           the
decanted       fluid, got it on to       a filter.    Its quantity, however, in this

714                   Proceedings     of the Royal Society
extreme state of division        was not large enough            for me to get it off
the filter and examine         it further   ;   but after the treatment          which
it  had received   — it still remaining      a   brownish-black        powder — there
can be no doubt of its being carbon.
    A similar   case   of diffusion takes place on a small scale when we
hold a cold porcelain lid over           a   bunsen     flame,    when,    as  is well-
known, we obtain a black deposit under the glaze of the porcelain
without the latter being fused.           Here the carbon in the impalpable
condition diffuses itself into the porcelain,           but aided by the convec
tion currents of the gases of the lamp.

     The little group of Social Ascidians is here placed next to the
 Asc!DIad,e     as a    fourth family of Ascidice simplices.          The old name
 Clavelinid.e       is retained,     the only change       being that, instead      of
occupying     a position intermediate between the Simple and Compound
Ascidians, they will now be included in the former group.                     As the
explanation of my reasons for making this change in classification
necessitates    frequent reference       to former observations        and theories,
it  is simpler, and seems more advantageous,              to give the argument      in
the form     of a  brief outline of the history of the group.

                                 of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                                                    717
         The first Social Ascidians                    known to science were two species of
 Clavelina, viz.,              C. borealis      and C. lepadiformis.
         The lirst of these, Clavelina                      borealis,         was described                under the
 name Ascidia                 elavata by Pallas* in 1774, and was referred                                        to by
 Bruguieref              in 1789.         It     was    afterwards, in 1815, described                               at
greater length under the same name by                                   Cuvier,J who united it with
Ascidia (now Ciona) intestinalis                                  to form his fourth                 tribe of the
genus Ascidia.
         The       second      species,    Clavelina               lepadiformis,         was       observed          by
Muller§             and described         by him in 1780 under the name of Ascidia
lepadiformis             ; P,ruguiere||         (1789) mentions this species also.
         In   181 6 SavignylT founded the genus Clavelina for the reception
of these two species, which ho separated from Phalhusia (Ascidia)
on account of their being pedunculated. He still retained them,
however,            in the Simple Ascidians.                        In his third memoir                     (p.    109)
he gives            an account of Clavelina                       borealis,    and states (p. 110) that
" Les veritables rapports                       des Clavelines            sont avec les Phallusies."
In his systematic table                         (p.   171)        he places          Clavelina        as    the    last
genus of the Simple                  Ascidians next to Phalbwia, and immediately
following the Phallusiai                   Ciona, (C. intestinal is).
         In   the same year (1816)               Lamarck**              places these two species, C.
elavata and C. lepadiformis, in the genus Ascidia.
         It   is   evident,    then, that those of the older naturalists to whom
any of the Clavelinid-E were known included them unhesitatingly
in       the Simple Ascidians.                    It   must be remembered,                     however,            that
although Gaertner was acquainted                                  with Botryllm and Distomvs in
1774, ami Renieri (179:5) was to                        a         certain extent aware of the true
nature of some of these forms,                          yet the Compound Ascidians                                were
hardly recognised               as such    till after         the appearance            of Savigny's well-
known memoirs.                   By (Juvier, Savigny, and Lamarck, however, to all
of whom the Compound Ascidians were well known, Clavelina was
considered           a   Simple Aseidian closely allied to Ciona intestinalis.

    In   1834,  J. J.   Lister, F.R.S.,* published a paper entitled "Some
Observations         on   the     Structure     and    Functions      of Tubular       and
 Cellular Polypi and of Ascidiae," in which he gave an account                            of
a  small species of Ascidian, afterwards               described     by Wiegmannf         as
 Perophora listen.
    Lister pointed out the condition in which the individuals lived,
the fact that each possessed a complete set of organs of its own, but
that all     were     connected       by a common          circulatory     system   ;  and
stated    that " it   increases by sprouts        :  the two streams         of the stem
run through the bud before its organs are developed."}
     Clavelina    remained        in the Ascvlice        simplices    till 1842, when
Milne-Edwards          published        his   celebrated      " Observations sur les
 Ascidies composees des cotes de la Manche."§
    In this elaborate work ho gives an account of several species of
 Clavelina,    and     proposes       that that genus, along          with Perophora,
should be separated from both Simple and Compound Ascidians, and
form an independent intermediate group,                       to which      he gives the
name     of Ascidia: sociales.            This group       he defines     as   comprising
ascidians     which reproduce           by buds     as  well as by     eggs,   and which
live united by common               radiciform prolongations, but which other
wise are free of all adhesion            to one another.         "On    reserverait   alors
le nom A' Ascidies simples             pour les Ascidies qui no         se   rcproduisent
point par bourgeons, et qui no vivent pas reunies                      en groupes,      par
l'intermediairc d'une portion commune du tissu tegumentaire.
     Enfin, les Ascidies composeei           se rapprocheraient       de cette division
nouvelle par leur mode de multiplication,                   mais s'en distingueraient
par    1'existence     d'un seul corps         tegumentaire        commun      a tous    les
individus      dont    se   compose       chaque     colonie   ;  tandis que chez les
premiers,     chaque      individu      possible    une tunique tegumentaire            qui
 lui  est propre."||
     Milne-Edwards'       ground for separating the Social from the Simple
 Ascidians was twofold          ;  first the union of the individuals by stolons,
 and secondly the power they possess of reproducing by gemmation.
 Of course these two points are really only one,                       as   the  union    is
                   *

simply the result of the gemmation,                   and taken alone         is  not   a
characteristic of any importance.*
    The power of reproducing by gemmation                    is of more value,       and
seems at first sight to form a distinction              between   the    ClavelinidvE
and the other Simple Ascidians;             this, however, is more apparent than
real.      The buds on the stolons of the Clavelinid,e are developed
from the ends of the blood-vessels,               and    are at first merely slight
enlargements         similar to and comparable         with the knobs on the end
twigs of the vessels in the test of an Ascidia ' ; these last vessels
being       homologous       with   those    in  tho    stolons of the       Clavelina.
In Ascidia         the vessels    do   not project      beyond the       test,   but   in
Molgida        they   are  prolonged considerably           as  hair-like   simple     or
branched processes,! and in Ciona, at the base of the test, projections
exactly like the stolons of Clavelina, having the same structure
and     containing similar blood-vessels,           frequently grow out over the
object to which the individual is attached.
    It   thus appears that all the apparatus              necessary    for budding is
present in the Simple Ascidians as well as in the so-called Social, and
that in the former it may even go the length of forming stolons, but
these have never been seen to develop                into new individuals.
     PhilippiJ in        1843 gave a short account of an Ascidian                he had
found      at  Naples, and which he called Jihop'dwa iwtpolitana.                   This
form is elongated,        somewhat     like  a  Clavelina in shape; the branchial
 aperture, however, is eight-lobed, and the atrial six-lobed as in Ascidia.
 " Im     obern     Drittheil  etwa, wo die Verdickung           anfiingt merk licher
zu werden,        sassen in einem unregelmiissigen           Kranz zweispaltigo und
dreispaltige Auswuchse, jungen                Ascidien     nicht   uniihnlich."      Tho

the heart is placed         on the right side of tho intestinal loop, and tho
    *
       If the mere fact of tho union of individuals, irrespective of the cause of
 that union, is to be considered an important point, then aggregations of true
 and undoubted Simple Ascidians of the genera Ascidia and Cynthia must also
bo considered colonies of Social Ascidians, as they were in the case of Slycla
grossularia by Van lieneden in 1S47 (Mem. de l'Acad. roy. de Belgique,
 t. xx.).     It is now well known that these aggregations are merely caused by
the proximity and the coalescence of the tests, and indicate no relationship
 whatever between the different individuals.

 is provided with strong papillee.               The dorsal lamina finally is formed
 of languets.
    Tins is a very interesting form, being clearly intermediate in its
 characters     between       Clavelina and Cixma.             The external         shape and
 the condition of the dorsal lamina would allow of its being                            placed
 in either genus.          The presence of thorax and abdomen,                        and the
 position of the heart and ovary, ally it to Clavelina, while the lobes
  round the branchial and atrial apertures, and the papillae                           on the
 branchial     sac, show     its relationship to the Ascidiad.b.                Finally,    the
 bud-like projections from the test,               a careful      investigation of which
 would have        been     valuable,       seem     in the figure        very    hke young
 individuals, and, if they         are    so,   indicate    gemmation        probably from
 the blood-vessels       of the test.
    Adams*       in 1858 placed           Philippi's Dhopahea in             the old genus
 Clavelina.       This,   I  think, is quite wrong.             Clavelina has no lobes
round its apertures,           and    no     papillae     on   its branchial sac, while
Rhopahva has both            ; still the fact showed          that the resemblance           of
this form to the Clavelinid.e                was detected,        although it had been
described      by Philippi      as a  Simple Ascidian.
    Bronnf       (1862) follows Milne-Edwards,                 and divides the Ascidice
into shnplices, sociales, and composite.
    Claris \ (1876) unites the Ascidiad.e                 and the    Clavelimd.e        as one

Compound, including Clavelina and Perophora in the Synascidice.
This     he   does   chiefly on account              of their property of budding,
although he admits that budding alone is not sufficient to separate
the Social from the            Simple Ascidians.             He gives       as   the charac

       The first of these characters           he had admitted to be insufficient
  alone, and      I  am unable     to recognise     the value of the other two.             It
  is    difficult to understand how the shape of the stigmata                      can be a
 characteristic of much value, and the statement                     that oval stigmata
 are characteristic of the          Syiutscidice     may be easily refuted,        as many
  Simple Ascidians          have    oval stigmata,        while   a   species of Colella
  (Aplidium       petlunculatum,      Q. and (J.), an undoubted Synascidian, has
 very long slit-like stigmata with parallel sides.                The stage of develop
 ment in which the embryo is hatched cannot be considered                          of much
 importance,        as it seems to vary in closely-allied           forms   ; and    Giant's
 generalisation that only in Compound Ascidians                         does tho    embryo
 remain in the egg-membrane               till  far advanced      in   development,      will
 certainly not hold,         as  Kuptl'er*     describes and figures the embryo of
 Molgula macroxiphonica                as  being    still, when       almost completely
 developed,       covered by the       " eihaut."      This is also the    case  in several
 others of the few Simple Ascidians, the development of which has
 been observed.
       In conclusion, it    appears that the power of reproducing by gemma
 tion is tho only difference of more than generic rank between" Clavelina
 and Ciena, while Eelc.inaxcidia,              a new     genus    of the     Claveliniiuj
 might, were it not for the fact that it reproduces                      by building, and
 that the individuals are united into colonies, be included in Ciona.
      In Clacclina in an adult colony,           the stolons    connecting the bases of
 the individuals often atrophy and in places entirely disappear,                    leaving
 the individuals         without any connection.             They    are  now practically
 Simple Ascidians.             In Ecttinascidia,       tho   same seems to happen            ;
 and     I believe   that  if  a Ciona inlcotinalw,       a solitary Clacclina lepadi-
fonnis,       and a solitary Eetcinancidia          turhinata were submitted to             a
 naturalist who did not know the several species, he would declare
that they were all Simple Ascidians, that the Eclcinafcidia and the
 Ciona were species of the same genus, and that the Clacclina was                           a
nearly allied one.            This would        be the natural        arrangement      were
it not for the budding, which, however,                     should be considered          of
sufficient importance to characterise              a  family, and, therefore,       I uuite
those       Simple Ascidians        which reproduce         by gemmation        and    form

by    gemmation,       and having no papillae           on     its   branchial sac, bo

7.   Description of New Astronomical Tables for the Computa
              tion of Anomalies. By Mr Edward Sang.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The planets     move     round the sun in ellipses,          in such a manner
that the     radii vectores     di scribe   areas    proportional     to the   times.
Now, by meaus of parallel lines, we can always project an ellipse
upon   a  plane surface    so as to make      the projection      circular, and thus
we have     to consider the motion of a point in the circumference of a
circle, describing round an excentric point areas proportional to the
times.    If  we take S for the excentric point, that is for the projection
 of the sun, and suppose Q to be the projection of the planet's place,
 the area  ASQ    is proportional to the time elapsed since the perihelion
 passage.    The angle      ACQ     is called,    very inappropriately,       the ex
 centric anomaly     ;  I prefer to call     it  the angle     of position.     If  we
 suppose   a  point         to  move     uniformly      along the     circumference,
 with the periodic time of the planet, and to have reached                   M when
                                                  the   actual    projection   of the
                                                  planet is at Q, it is clear that
                                                  the    sector     AOM     must    bo
                                                  equivalent to the area ASQ.
                                                  The angle AOM is the mean
                                                  anomaly.
                                                      Having     drawn     ESF     per
                                                  pendicular       to the    diameter
                                                  ASOa, join QE and QF; then
                                                  it is evident that the surface
                                                  EQFA      is halved by the      com
                                                   pound line ASQ ; wherefore
  the area ASQ passed over by the radius vector is half the sum or
  half the difference of the circular segments QAF and QE, according
  as Q lies beyond AE or within it.
     Denoting the arc AE by e, and the arc of position AQ by p, and

                             of Edinburgh, Session 187D-80.                                 727
 observing         that the      area    AOM is equivalent            to   ASQ,      we   have,
 denoting the segment             AOM by m, —
                           2nt = segin,     (p  + r) + segm. (p     - e) ,
 and thus the determination of                  m   from p, or of     p from      m, is to be
 accomplished by help of             a table    of circular segments, which must bu
 measured, not in parts of the square of the radius, but in degrees of
 the surface of the circle.
     For     the   purpose     of rendering this           exceedingly simple formula
 available for actual calculation, a table was constructed                       of the sines
for   each minute of the quadrant, measured                     in degrees of arc      ; by its
help the values            of the circular segments              for each minute of the
 whole circumference were                  written      out,   true to within one           ten-
 thousandth part of           a second     of the modern division.
    When         we   have     got   a   tolerable first approximation,             this table
enables us to compute               the position corresponding to             a  given mean
aimmaly by          a  simple proportion.
    In    order      to  guide us        to a first     assumption, tables         were    con
structed of the           mean     anomalies       corresponding to each degree of
position from 0°C. to 200°               C,   and for every value of        e  from 0° C. to
100°    C, with        their differences        and    variations, true to the nearest
second     ;   and thus, in every possible              case,  the solution      of Kepler's
problem is          obtained      in   a   few    minutes, true to far within the
hundredth part of            a second     of the new division.
    For    the     construction of these tables,              one million       six hundred
thousand figures were written, and of these the three volumes placed
on    the     table    contain     about twelve          hundred     thousand.         If   the
ancient division          of the quadrant had been used, the labour would
have been more than doubled.

    Some    thirty years     ago,    when    I    was   attending Professor       De
 Morgan's class,   my brother, Francis              Guthrie,  who    had recently
 ceased to attend them (and who is now professor               of mathematics       at
 the   South African University,         Cape     Town),    showed    me   the   fast
                             that the greatest necessary number of colours
                             to be used in colouring a map so as to avoid
                             identity of colour in lineally contiguous dis

                                 With my brother's permission                I  sub
 mitted the theorem to Professor De Morgan, who
                                                               expressed himself
 very pleased with it ; accepted it as new ; and, as           I am informed by
                                              those      who   subsequently       at
                                              tended     his classes, was in the

                                              he had got his information.
                                                   If I  remember     rightly, the
                      proof which my brother gave did not seem alto
                      gether      satisfactory to himself;      but  I  must refer
                      to him       those  interested    in the subject.     I  have
                      at various intervals          urged   my brother to com

                      little   success.
                          It  is clear that, at all events when unrestricted
                      by continuity of curvature,         the maximum number
of solids having superficial contact each with all is infinite.               Thus,

10. Remarks on the previous Communication.                                                  By Prof. Tait.
                                              (Ahxtract.)
     In    a paper read to the Society on 15th March last (ante, p. 501),
I    gave a series of proofs of the theorem                          that four colours suffice for
a map.        All        of these were long, and                1    felt that, while more than
sufficient to prove the truth of the theorem, they gave little insight
into its real nature and bearings.                        A   somewhat           similar remark may,
I    think,   be made about            Mr Kempe's proof.
     But a remark incidentally                     made       in the abstract               of my former
paper       has    led me to          a    totally       different mode                of attacking          the
question,     which puts its nature in                   a clearer         light.       I   have therefore
withdrawn           my former paper,               as    in   great      part superseded               by the
present one.
     The remark referred to is to the                     efl'ect    that,      if   an even number of
points be joined, so that three (and only three) lines meet in each,
these lines may be coloured with three colours only, so that no
two conterminous lines shall have the same colour.                                       (When an odd
number of the points forms                         a    group, connected               by one line only
with the rest, the theorem is not true.)
   This follows immediately from the main theorem                                                 when it is
applied to a map in which                   the boundaries meet                 in threes (and the
excepted          case    cannot      then present            itself).       For we have ouly to
colour such          a    map      with     the colours             A, B, C, D.               Then      if   the
common        boundaries of            A   and     B,    as   also of C and D, be coloured
a;    those of      A    and C, and of B and D, (3; and those of                                   A and      T),
and of B and C, y            ,   it   is clear that the three boundaries which meet
in any one point will have the three colours                               a,    /3,   y.
     The proof of the elementary                        theorem       is    given easily           by induc
tion   ;   and then the proof that four colours                              suffice        for   a   map    fol
lows almost immediately from the theorem, by an inversion of the
demonstration just given.
     Wo     escape the excepted             case       by taking the points                 as the    summits
of   a   polyhedron, all of which are trihedral                        ;     and when the figure               is
a    pentagonal      dodecahedron           the theorem             leads to Hamilton's Icusiau
Game.

            11.       Note on the Wire Telephone                                as a   Transmitter.
                                       By James Blyth, M.A.
  It    was shown some time ago by                              Dr Ferguson, and more recently
by Professor Chrystal and Mr Preece, that                                        a fine   wire attached to      a
mechanical telephone                    can act very well as a receiver in a telephonic
circuit, provided                 a make        and     break,       or some form            of microphone
transmitter, be employed.                         None of these experimenters, however,
have said anything about the action of such a wire as a transmitter.
Being struck by the convertibility,                               in   general, of all forms          of   tele-
phono receivers                   into transmitters, and vice versa, it occurred to                         me
to try how far this wire telephone,                               as      it   has been called, could be
made        to act           as    a   transmitter to an ordinary Bell telephone                             as
receiver.              I   was much interested                  to find that           it could act in that
capacity          wonderfully           well,     as    thereby        a       new element      of some im
portance              is introduced into the discussion of the real cause                                    or
causes of the action of the wire telephone whether as receiver or
as transmitter.
   In my first experiments                             a battery           of four        Bunsen    cells was
included in                a telephone      circuit of small resistance.                     At the sending
station, which we shall call A, an arrangement                                            was made whereby
different lengths of various kinds and thicknesses                                          of wire could    be
inserted          in the circuit.            At    first these wires were inserted                   by being
soldered              to    the    copper    terminals, in order to keep clear of loose
contacts          ;    but it was afterwards found that all error arising from
this source could be avoided by simply clamping the wires firmly
between               two binding screws.                   This       method,       from its greater con
venience,             was therefore         afterwards adopted.                    To the middle of the
inserted wire, and at right angles to                               it,   was attached      a   tine iron wire
about       15 inches long, the other end of which was connected                                        to the
centre       of the parchment disc of                           a   mechanical telephone.              When
this wire was stretched                      moderately tight the transmitting                        arrange
ment was complete.                      At   the receiving station, which we shall                          call
B,     an    ordinary double-ear                  Bell      telephone            of small resistance       was
employed.
   When               a    lino iron wire about             9     inches long was inserted in the
circuit at A, any musical sound uttered                                         into the mechanical tele
phone was most distinctly reproduced at B.                                             Speech could also bo

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1879-80.                              731
so transmitted, and in one case              I managed to do this so successfully
that  a  listener was able to write down an unknown sentence spoken
into the mechanical         telephone.
    I  found also that certain            lengths of the fine iron wire suited
certain voices better than others.
    Still using      the same tine wire at         A, I  removed      one by one the
culls from the battery         till only     one remained,     and found that this
did not produce any marked effect on the intensity of the sound                        as
heard at B.        The hist cell was then removed,           and the circuit joined
up, and even then a loud sound uttered at                 A could     be faintly heard
at B.      The only, at least obvious, reason for this etfeet appears to
be, that the vibrations         of   the iron wire across the lines of force due
to the earth's magnetism           produces     a  current sufhciently strong and
variable to work        a telephone.
    The battery        being   again     included in the        circuit,  a  horse-shoe
magnet with the line of its poles               at right angles       to the wire was
suspended       over and quite close to the wire.            This   caused the sounds
littered at    A   to be reproduced        at B with distinctly       greater intensity
than when no magnet was present.                    To  make     sure of this a con
tinuous note was sounded at A, and the magnet alternately removed
and brought up to the            wfire.     When this    was done       a marked     rise
and fall in the intensity of the sound heard in the receiving telephone
was observed.
    It is to   be noticed that, in the case of the line iron wire, the sounds
appeared to be transmitted equally well whether the wire attached
to the mechanical        telephone      was joined to the middle of, and at right
angles to, the inserted wire, or to its end, and in the same direction as
itself.     This observation is of          importance,   as  it does away, in great
part at least, with the idea that the effect is produced by variation
in the resistance of the fine wire caused merely by the bending to
and fro at its points of attachment to the circuit wires.
    When      the tine iron wire was replaced,          all other things remaining
the same, by a thick iron wire (No. 12), wdiich had been previously
rubbed with       a magnet, the      sound heard at B was very faint, although
audible.       It  came out, however, very distinctly            where the iron wire
was heated by a flame to a dull red heat.
    With     a  thickish platinum wire inserted at            A  the sound produced
at  B   was very faint      ; but on putting in about           twelve inches of fine

732                          Proceedings    of the Royal Society
platinum wire, the result was almost                as good as     that obtained from
the fine iron wire itself.           This is rather    a   puzzling result to explain,
as  it cannot        arise from magnetisation      of the metal,     as  is probably the
ease,   in part a least, with the iron wire.
    Fine wires of copper and aluminum transmitted no sound what
ever, although they were treated               precisely in the same way           as the
iron aud plantinum wires.
    A short strip of cobalt         inserted   in place of the fine wire at       A  gave
a  very distinct result, although the sound was not                   so  loud as in the
case   of the iron wire.           This, however,     may bo due to smallness of
the vibrations arising from the stiffness of the strip.
    From all these experiments it is obvious that, some how or other,
rapid variations of the current strength are produced in the circuit,
and    the problem is to explain how these variations are produced.
Now      the current strength can only be varied in two ways                  — either by
varying the eleetro-motive            force or by altering the resistance          of the
circuit     ;  and no doubt, in this case, both ways come into play to a
certain extent.            The former comes into play, inasmuch            as the electro
motive force will be varied by the motion of the fine wire in the
magnetic         field caused by itself and by the earth's magnetism.                 The
latter will also come into play, inasmuch               as change     of resistance will
arise from at least three             distinct sources.        These are (1) varying
magnetisation in the wire,               especially   the iron wire, produced by
strain    ;   (2) variations in the temperature of the wire caused by the
cooling effect of the air as the wire vibrates; (3) alterations of the
resistance caused by the varying strain to which a vibrating wire is
exposed.           It   is  possible to arrive at something like             a  numerical
estimate        of this     last cause of alteration         for any particular      note
transmitted         ;  for, knowing the mass of the vibrating wire, its            initial
tension,       its number of vibrations per second, wo can find the varia
tions in the strain to which it is subject               ;  and  if we can know how
varying strain is connected              with change of resistance,            as may   be
got from         Sir William Thomson's          recent     paper on that subject, we
have    all    the elements necessary for making the calculation.
    It  is right that       I should mention     that, in making the experiments,
I  had the valuable aid of Professor Chrystal in the twofold way of
helping me to make exact observations,                    and   of suggesting     various
changes of experiment to bring out or eliminate particular effects.
