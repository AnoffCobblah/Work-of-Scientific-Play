                                 [Plates  1 & 2.]
   When any portion of     a conducting-wire which joins the two poles of
a voltaic battery is increased in size, the resistance of the circuit is
diminished and a greater current flows through the wire ; and as any
increase in the cross section of any portion of the wire causes a corre
sponding increase in the current, it is clear that there is no part of the
conducting-wire through which some portion of the current does not
flow from the one pole to the other \ and the outer boundary of such a
wire will be a line of flow.
   A line of flow is a line drawn in a conductor which indicates at every
point of it the direction of the current at that point. A portion of the
conductor completely enclosed by lines of flow may be termed a tube
of flow.
   If a portion of the wire be beaten out into a flat disk, or if a sheet of
metal or tinfoil be employed, it will still be true that there is no part of
it to which the lines of flow do not extend, although the amount of
current will be weak at points of the disk which are far removed from
the shortest line of flow.
   If instead of a variable wire or disk the circuit consist in part of a
conducting liquid whose cross section is greater than the surface of the
electrodes in the liquid, the lines of flow extend throughout the liquid ;
and an increase in the cross section of the liquid diminishes to some
extent the resistance of the circuit.

   The lines of flow diverge from the electrodes or points where the
current enters and leaves the liquid, and lie closer and closer together
as they lie nearer to the shortest line of flow joining the electrodes.
   The whole of the conductor, whether it be a disk or a liquid, may be
regarded as being made up of tubes of flow, or of bundles of lines of
flow, each tube ending in conical points filling up the same solid angle at
the electrodes, and conveying a given quantity of electricity from one
battery-electrode to the other.
  These tubes increase in diameter at points further and further from
the electrodes ; and the strength of current at a given point   e. the        (;.
quantity of current flowing through    perpendicular section of unit area)
                                                  a
will     be inversely   cross section of the tube of flow passing through
                         as   th«»
that point.  In passing from one electrode to the other along any line of
flow there will be   gradual fall of potential, and the lines of flow will
                            a
be cut atright angles by surfaces in which the potential  the same for  is
every point of the same surface.
  On attaching two wires to a galvanometer, and placing their free ends
on the same equipotential surface, no current will flow through the
galvanometer.
  If, then, two electrodes in connexion with the two poles of battery        a
be fixed in contact with two points of     disk of tinfoil, or with two
                                                        a
points in       a   conducting       liquid, and two other electrodes   be attached   to
a delicate galvanometer, by keeping one of these fixed and tracing
with the other we may determine the forms of equipotential curves or
surfaces in the disk of tinfoil or in the liquid by joining all the positions
of the tracing-pole which give no current through the galvanometer.
    It   will   be convenient        to call the electrodes which are connected with
the battery the battery-electrodes, and those connected with the galvano
meter the galvanometer-electrodes.     By means of the tracing-electrode
points of the same potential as the fixed galvanometer-electrode may be
marked on the tinfoil            ;   and the curve joining them will be an equipo
tential curve.
                                         Experimental   Work.
   About five years ago, at the suggestion of Mr. J. T. Bottomley, the
tracing out of equipotential curves on sheets of tinfoil was first set as an
exercise for our more advanced students in the Physical Laboratory.                   I
have been assisted in the experimental work contained in this paper by
Messrs. Jacob, Cochrane, Day, and Harrison, students in the Physical
Laboratory of King's College.
   To trace the curves, one electrode of   Thomson's reflecting galvano
                                                        a
meter was attached to      small screw or pin, fixed in contact with or
                                     a
passing through the tinfoil disk; and the other galvanometer-electrode
was attached to    small tube of the same size as the screw, with the end
                        a
 of which contact could be made at any point of the disk. In the centre

                   Equipotential Curves and Surfaces, §c.                         3
 of this small tube a needle was held by a spring ; and when the required
 point was found, by pressing down the spring a hole could be made in
 the tinfoil, thus marking the position of the tracing-electrode.
    The best form of contact is probably by means of needle-points, on
 which    shoulders of metal 2 or 3 millims. in diameter are soldered, and
 which are pressed tight on the tinfoil.          By placing a sheet of paper
 underneath the tinfoil disk the forms of equipotential curves are at once
 pricked out, and may afterwards be drawn.            For illustration in lectures
 the sheet of tinfoil may be placed in front of a lamp, and the forms of
equipotential curves or lines of flow may bo thrown on a screen.            If the
 curves be traced on a circular disk of the size of or smaller than the
condensing-lens, the whole series of equipotential curves on it may be
thrown upon the screen at the same time.
     Case 1. Plate 1. fig. 1 represents a sheet of tinfoil 310 millims.
 square, in which A and B, the battery-poles, are 120 millims. apart ;
 and the line AB is nearly parallel to a side, and passes through the
centre O of the square ; the point O is equidistant from the two poles.
    Not far from the centre of the sheet, and in the smaller curves through
an angle varying from 60° to 90° about the electrodes, these curves
coincide with circles    ; and  in other parts of the curves, when the influence
of the edge is taken into account, by supposing the distribution due to
charges in the positions of the electric images, as will be afterwards
 explained, the agreement with the curves as given by theory is remarkably
exact.
    If  a large  sheet of tinfoil be taken, and the battery-electrodes bo
placed   far away from the edge of the sheet, then at all points not near
the edge of the sheet the forms of the equipotential curves will be very
nearly the same as in a sheet of infinite extent.
    In all such cases (as will be afterwards shown) the equipotential curves,
when there are only two battery-electrodes in connexion with the sheet,
are circles having their centres on the straight line passing through
the two electrodes ; and the lines of flow are also arcs of circles which
pass through the two poles.
    Case 2.  Plate 2. fig. 2 represents a circular sheet of tinfoil, 210 millims.
in diameter, with the electrodes on the circumference, and at a distance
from one another equal to the radius.              The electrodes were small
binding-screws placed as closely as possible to the edge of the disk.
The differences of potential between two successive equipotential curves
have been measured by the deflections of the needle of the galvanometer.
    The deflections were as follows     : —

   It  will be seen that the fall of potential from k to d is greater than
the fall of potential from d to h. This may arise from a difference in
the resistances of the contacts with the two battery-electrodes.
   The radii of the circles are 28, 56, 290, 82, 28, and 12 millims., be
ginning from the point k ; and the distances between them, measured
along the line joining the electrodes, are 20, 13, 15, 19,            15, 10, and
12 millims.
   The distances 13, 15, 19, 15,       10 correspond to equal differences of
potential   ; and hence   the resistances  of the portions of the disk between
these consecutive equipotential curves are equal to one another. In
this   case there was    considerable resistance     between the binding-screw
and the tinfoil disk at the point of contact       ; but this does not alter the
forms of the equipotential curves.
    Case 3.   Plate 2. fig. 3 represents a large sheet of tinfoil 18 inches
square, with one electrode in the centre, by which the current enters the
sheet, and four similar electrodes at four corners of a square, each being 3
inches from the central electrode, by which the currents leave the sheet.
The electrodes were needles, with shoulders of brass 3 millims. in diameter
soldered on them.       The four negative electrodes may be united together
beneath the board on which the tinfoil is placed, by strips of copper
screwed to the electrodes by a small nut on each needle.                  On the
needles which pass through the tinfoil are shoulders which come down
tight on the tinfoil so as to make good contact.          For these curves two
cells of Grove were used ; and the difference of potential between two
successive curves causes a deflection of 50 divisions of the scale. The
resistances of the portions of this disk between successive equipotential
curves are equal to one another.
    Case 4.   The curves in Plate    2. fig. 4, lying within the octant BAH,
are equipotential    curves, when one positive electrode A is at the corner
of  a square sheet   of tinfoil of which AH and AM are the edges, and one
negative electrode at B, at a distance of 3 inches from A, the line AB
bisecting the angle between the two edges.              The curves between the
lines AB and AM have not been drawn in the figure.
    The potential at any point in this sheet is that due to the electrodes,
together with the three images of each formed by the rectangular edges ;
and hence the curves should be the same as in the previous case.              On
comparing the curves it will be seen that that is the case.
    The curves, with two exceptions, are drawn at distances corresponding
to equal differences of potential ; so that, omitting the interpolated
curves, the resistances of the portions of the sheet between two consecu
tive equipotential curves are equal to one another.
    This figure also represents the equipotential           curves  for a square
 sheet   BAB,, of which AB and AB, are the              edges,  with one positive

electrode at           A, and two negative electrodes at B and                   B1 on the edges      of
the sheet.
   We may also regard the case with one positive electrode at the centre
and four negative electrodes at the corners of a square as equivalent to
two sets, each set consisting of one positive and two negative electrodes,
one on each side of               it,
                        at equal distances along the same straight line on
a   sheet either unlimited or limited by that straight line.
     Case 5. The curves for this arrangement of electrodes are drawn in
Plate      1. fig.     5; the distance from the positive                  to each     negative elec
trode      is   76 millims., or       inches, as in Gases
                                        3                      and3        4,   the electrodes being
near the centre of            a   very large sheet of tinfoil.

as nearly as possible at  distance of 53J millims. from the centre.

    The result of this case shows that in the case of one and four elec
trodes   (Plate 2. fig.    we may expect the curves which cut the axis
                                    3)
at a distance of about 54 millims. from the centre to be hyperbolas.

perbola, having its foci in the positions of the negative electrodes      and                    ;
we find, on measuring this curve as well as the curve on the outside of
it, that near the vertex the curves are accurately hyperbolas.         This                           is
also  true  of the  corresponding curves   in fig. 4. The  curves first drawn
in fig.     were drawn at equal distances of 10 millims. apart along the
            5
axis, reckoning from the centre and the differences of potential for these
                                                   ;

138 including the effect due to contact of the electrode.   Other curves
were afterwards interpolated in the neighbourhood   of the position of the
rectangular hyperbola and around the negative electrodes.

the curves in the neighbourhood of the axis to be similar to those which
could have beeu traced on a sheet of infinite extent.
    The third equipotential curve from the negative pole C is the rect
angular hyperbola, and its vertex          0 divides the distance AC      ;  so that
                              AO is to AB     as 1  to V2.

    Around the centre the curves are very nearly ellipses of small eccen
 tricity, the focus being at the centre of the disk.           If a is the radius      of
                                                                             2r

 at right angles at the point Q, and each cutting the edge of the disk at
 an angle of 45°, the radius of the disk being 3-75 inches.
     When the fixed galvanometer-electrode is at L, it is difficult to find a
 succession       of  points   forming   a   continuous    equipotential     curve ; the
 tracing-electrode        may at one time be placed on the boundary of the
 shaded portion of the figure, and at another may be placed on the axis
 near the point Q, without causing any current through the galvano
 meter.
     On placing the fixed galvanometer-electrode at Q, the tracing-elec
 trode marks out two straight lines in the neighbourhood of that point of
 the same potential as the point Q, and each cutting the edge of the disk
  at an angle of 45° at that point.
     The uncertainty in tracing this equipotential            curve is explained, as
  will   be presently shown (p. 25), by the fact that each       of the galvanometer-
  electrodes was rather more than          1 millimetre in diameter.
     The equipotential curves which lie further from the centre cut the
  edge of the disk at right angles.

     If two platinum wires sealed in glass tubes, with only a short piece of
  wire projecting from the sealed end, be immersed in a liquid, the other
  ends being connected with the poles of •a battery, we shall have a close
  approximation       to the case of currents flowing from one point to another
  within a liquid ; and by means of two other platinum wires similarly
  arranged but attached to a galvanometer, we may trace out the forms of
  equipotential surfaces within the liquid.
     If dilute    sulphuric acid   be employed     there will  be polarization     on the
  electrodes    ; but by reversing the current alternately, and making contact

 only for    a short    time, the polarization may bo kept small on the gal
 vanometer-electrodes,       provided they are not moved far away from the
 same equipotential surface.
     After  a few preliminary experiments to determine how far the method
 was practicable,    I   began a definite series of experiments in March 1872.
 For the experiments in dilute sulphuric acid, in sulphate of copper, and in
 sulphate of zinc,    I  have employed a rectangular wooden box, 1 foot long,
 8 inches broad, and 8 inches deep. On the edges of the box are fastened
 paper millimetre-scales ; a piece is cut out of the middle of the ends of
 the box, and a sliding piece fitted in to carry the battery-electrodes.
 These sliding pieces are capable of motion parallel to the sides of tho
 box, so as to place the battery-electrodes at different distances from one
 another (see Plate 1. fig. 8).      The galvanometer-electrodes were placed
 firmly  in  brass tubes,   which were accurately placed on T pieces of wood
 so as to be in a line with the point of intersection of two edges of the
 T  piece, and to be vertical when the T pieces are placed on the edges of
 the box.     By this means the rectangular coordinates of the point could
 at once be read off on the sides and ends of the box.
    The first experiments were made with the points at a depth of
 10 centims. below the surface, tho box being nearly full of liquid.
    In making the experiments the current was reversed, and the readings
 of the galvanometer taken on both sides of zero for each position of tho
 electrodes.
    The battery employed was 20 Leclanche           cells, the resistance of each
 cell  being   nearly    3  ohms,  and   the  electromotive   force about 1| of
 Daniell's cell. The strength of the battery-current was measured by a
 tangent -galvanometer, of the form of Ilelmholtz's double galvanometer ;
the deflection of the needles during these first experiments was gene
rally 40°.     The galvanometer-electrodes could bo brought up to within
 1 centim. of the centre of the box.
    The object of the first experiments was to determine the. changes of
potential for equal changes of distance in a direction parallel to the sides
of the box.
    The battery-electrodes were placed at 2 millims. distance from tho
end of the box, i. e. at a distance of 300 millims. from one another.
The line joining them was one axis of coordinates, tho other axis being
the upper edge of one end of tho box.            One of the galvanometer-elec
trodes was placed at the point (150, 50), and the other was first placed
at (30, 50), and moved 1 centim. at a time in a direction parallel to the
sides of tho box. The deflections were taken at each point, and are
recorded in the following Table : —

    The column of differences gives the differences of potential               between
the equipotential surfaces passing through the successive positions of
the tracing-electrode.       These positions are points at equal distances of
10 millims. apart, along a horizontal straight line parallel to the sides of
the box at a distance of 50 millims. from the axis.
    The difference between the mean and each of the two deflections to
right and left may be taken to be the current due to polarization. This
was very small, the deflections being 6 at the beginning, 6-5 at the middle,
and 10 at the end of the experiments.
    Toward the end of the experiments, at (250, 50) there was an increase
of 2 in the deflections because the current was kept on for five minutes.
From these results it appears that with momentary currents and reversing
at each observation, the variation in the polarization current, even in
dilute sulphuric acid, may be kept very small.               The sudden change in
the polarization    at  (50, 250)  reduced     the   deflection of the tangent-gal
vanometer from 46° to 41°.
    The value of the deflection recorded is the mean of two or more
deflections in each direction, but these were very generally the same.
    To reduce, if possible, the effect of polarization,      I employed sulphate of
copper and gutta-percha-covered           copper wire 3-6 millims in diameter,
 with 4 millims. projecting beyond the covering for the battery-electrodes.
 In the galvanometer-electrodes, which were of the same covered wire,
 there were 2 millims. of wire projecting beyond the covering ; all the
 electrodes were immersed to a depth of 75 millims. The battery-electrodes
 were placed at distances of 10 millims. from the ends of the box, so
 that they were 284 millims. apart.
    The fixed galvanometer-electrode was placed at (152, 50) ; then on
 varying the position of the other electrode, it is found that for all posi
 tions in a plane parallel to the ends of the box, and dividing it into two

equal parts, there              is no deflection; but at (151, 50), i.e. at a distance of
1   miJlim. from this plane,              there is a deflection of 10 divisions of the
scale.  Hence the plane which is equidistant from the electrodes is
shown  to be an equipotential surface. This is the surface at which
the potential is zero.
    Case 7. Plate 2. fig. 9 represents three sections of three equipotential
 surfaces, one through the point (50, 10), another through the point (80,
 10), and a third through the point (100, 10), the battery-electrodes being
 placed at distances of 10 millims. from the ends of the box and 284
 miUims. apart.
    When the battery-electrodes are so near to the ends of the box, the
distribution of the electric currents, and therefore the forms of the equi
potential surfaces, will not be the same as in a conductor which is un
limited in every direction ; hence in comparing these experimental results
with theory it is necessary to take into account the influence of the ends
and sides of the box.
    If we measure the distances from each point of a curve to the battery-
electrodes and to the positions of their electric images due to the sides
and ends of the box, and if for each point we subtract the sum of the
reciprocals of the distances of the negative electrode and its images from
the sum of the reciprocals of the distances of the positive electrode and
 its images, we get a series of numbers which differ very little from one
another.
    If r,   r',   r"   . . .   . represent the distances from the positive electrode and
its images,        and r,, r{,      r" ....   represent the distances from the negative

    The last points taken on the curve are nearer to the side and also to
 the end of the box than to the nearest electrode ; hence for these points
 corrections should be applied depending on the changes of potential due
 to the side and end of the box.
     It also appears very clearly from this series of values that, by re
 versing the battery-current at each observation, the polarization of the
 galvanometer-electrodes        may be kept small and very nearly constant
 throughout     a  long series of experiments.

     Case 10. The rectangular box was also employed to determine the forms
  of the cylindrical equipotential surfaces when the electrodes are straight
  rods and extend throughout the depth of the liquid.           Sulphate of zinc was
  employed    for   these  experiments,    and  the  electrodes    were amalgamated
  zinc rods.    Plate 2. fig. 12 represents the sections of the equipotential
  surfaces when one battery- electrode is at "A, the centre of the box, and
  the other at B, the middle point of one side.

   These electrodes are 100 millirns. apart.      The galvanometer-electrodes
in these experiments could not be brought within less than 5 millirns. of
the axis of the curves.
   The curves drawn represent the sections of equipotential cylindrical
surfaces which are at distances of 10 millirns. apart, measured along a
line which is parallel to and 5 millirns. distant from the axis.
   The case of a circular cylinder containing sulphate of copper, with the
battery-electrodes at the two ends of a diameter, has also been worked
out experimentally ; and the equipotential surfaces are circular cylinders
cutting the sides of the vessel at right angles. Mercury was tried for
these experiments ; but from its almost perfect conducting-power it was
very difficult to determine two vertical lines in it which were precisely of
the same potential.
   Case 11. Another case was worked out experimentally with line-elec
trodes in sulphate of zinc.    One positive electrode was placed at the middle
point of one side of the rectangular box, and two negative electrodes were
placed symmetrically at the same distance from the positive electrode ; so
that the lines joining the positive to the two negative electrodes were at
right angles to one another.       This corresponds to the case drawn in
Plate 2. fig. 4 ; and the sections of the surfaces at points which are not
near the side of the box are the same as the curves in figs. 3 or 4 of
Plate 2. Having previously determined the forms of these curves in the
tinfoil experiments, it was very easy to move the tracing-electrode from
one point to another on the same equipotential curve, by making use of
the curves previously drawn as guides for the electrode.
 Comparison of Experimental results with   the Tliwry of Electrical Distribution.
   To examine the forms of the equipotential curves and surfaces with a
view to determine how far the results of experiment agree with and are
accounted for by the theory of distribution of electricity in a plane and
in space of three dimensions, take first the case of a plane of unlimited
extent in every direction, when two battery-electrodes are joined to two
points in the plane, so that there are equal and opposite currents at
those points.     The potential at any point P of the plane is equal to
C— A (log r log rt), where r, r, are the distances of the point P from
              —
the two battery-electrodes A and B. Hence the condition for an equi
potential curve is logr— log rl=logc,orr = cr1, where c is some constant.
This equation indicates that the bisector of the angle at any point P
between the lines   r and r, cuts the line joining the two battery-electrodes
in the  same point, which is a point on the equipotential curve.
   If 2a is the distance between the electrodes, the distances from     A   and  B

    The lines of flow cut the equipotential curves at right angles, or the
radius of one of these circles is the tangent to a line of flow ; hence it
follows (Euclid, Book        III.  Prop. 8) that the lines of flow are arcs of
circles passing through         the  points A and B, the positions of the elec
trodes.     This result may be arrived at by a method which is also appli
cable to the case of unequal charges at several points in a plane.
    Let us take the equation to the equipotential curves in the form
(x— ay + ya=e'{(x+ay+ij2}.               Differentiating and eliminating e we get

showing that the lines of flow are circles passing through the positions
of the two electrodes.         Comparing this result with the curves drawn by
experiment      in Plate  1.  fig. 1, we see that for all parts of the disk which
may be considered to be beyond the influence of the edge of the disk,
there is a very close agreement between theory and experiment ; and the
 influence of the edge of the disk will be such that the equipotential
 curves    will cut the edge    of the disk at right angles.
    When the conducting-sheet is not of infinite extent, but of very con
 siderable extent in every direction, the expression C— A (logr— logr,) will
 still be a close approximation to the potential at any point, provided the
electrodes are not far from the centre of the sheet.               Hence on such a

sheet under these conditions the portions of equipotential                    curves      and
lines of flow which are not near the edges of the sheet                      will   be   very
nearly circular.       This we have   seen to be the case   in the experiments on
tinfoil (see Plate 1. fig. 1).
   When the lines approach near the edge of the disk, or when the elec
trodes are near the edge, then the form of the equipotential curve is
generally altered, because the edge of the disk will generally cut some of
the lines of flow of the infinite plane.        We may conceive of the lines of
flow as distinct from one another, but as filling up the whole of the
disk ;  if,then, we make     a  section of the disk along    aline of flow we do
not alter the distribution of electricity on the disk, and so do not alter
the forms of the equipotential curves.          But in that case, since the two
parts  of the  disk are   entirely separate  from   one another, one of the parts
may be taken away without causing any change in the law of distribution
of the electric currents in the other.
   If, then, we cut away from an indefinite sheet               aportion which             is
bounded by    line3 of  flow,  we shall not  alter the form  of the  equipotential
curves but, since we thereby increase the resistance of each portion, we
      ;
shall increase the difference of potential between the two electrodes,
and the distances between successive equipotential curves corresponding
to given differences of potential will be diminished.

hoff by joining the galvanometer-wires to two points of the plane sheet
which are at different potential, and balancing the current which would
flow through those wires, by introducing         a thermoelectric pile into the
galvanometer-circuit.        M. Verdet says " M. Kirchhoff n'a etudie par

  If in an infinite plane there be any number of electrodes, the equi
potential curves and lines of flow may be drawn by the method explained
by Professor Maxwell *, by drawing circles of equal differences of poten
tial around each charge, and joining their point of intersection in such a
way that for all the points taken the sum of the potentials is constant.

curve for the four equal electrodes A, A,, B, B, ; also that the potential
at any point of this circle is the same as the potential at the centre O
would be if there were only a positive electrode at A and a negative
electrode at B,, which is the same as one half the potential at the centre,
0, due to the four electrodes.
     If we
        take two of these electrodes, B, Bt, and through C draw another
chord through two other electrodes on the circle, and draw the equi-
potential circle for this set of four electrodes, we shall find that all such
circles cut both the circles AA, B and EE, mutually at right angles, and
that the circle EE, is         a   line of flow for all such systems of four elec
trodes on the circle      AA,, B,B.
     The circles    DD„ EE,,         and        AA,B will                intersect        mutually at right

  This will appear if it is shown that AA, and BB, intersect on the
common chord of the circles DD, and AA,B ; for in that case the tan
gent to DD, drawn from C is equal to the radius of EE,.

20                           Prof. W. G. Adams on the Forms of
circle which passes through the two electrodes and cuts the circular disk
at right angles, we shall not alter the forms of the equipotential curves
within either of the separate disks bounded by the arcs of these two
circles.
     In all these cases        the boundary-line will be made up of lines of flow, and
the equipotential             curves will generally cut the edge of the disk at right
angles.   Or    in an unlimited sheet, each of two battery-electrodes be
                     if,
divided into two, so that equal currents flow through each point, and                           if
these four electrodes be so arranged that they all lie on the circumfer
ence of  circle, then the forms of the equipotential curves will be the
           a
same as      in the        case of   a   circular disk which       has its centre at the   point of
intersectionof the chords joining the two positive electrodes and the
two negative electrodes respectively, and whose radius    equal to the           is
tangent drawn from this point to the circle on which the electrodes lie.
In the case of the circular disk, the positive electrode outside the disk
becomes the    virtual electric image of the other positive electrode, and the
outside negative electrode becomes the electric image of the other nega
tive electrode.    The edge of the disk cuts the other circle at right angles,
and   isa line of flow for the four equal electrodes in the unlimited sheet.
Hence no alteration       made in the forms of the lines of flow
                                is                                     cutting         by
the sheet along this edge.
   This will apply to the case of any two unlike equal electrodes within
a circular disk when there are any number of electrodes connected with
the disk   ;   for
                 we take all these electrodes and their electric images,
                     if
and suppose them to be kept continually charged, each image like its
point, then in the unlimited sheet the line in the position of the edge of
the disk will be a line of flow for every set of two unlike electrodes and
their images, and therefore for all of them when taken together.
    Hence,     by
              cutting along the edge of the circular disk to which such
images are  due,  no change    made in the lines of flow or in the equi
                                               is
potential curves.   In fig. A and are like electrodes.

   When the currents entering or leaving the disk at the several elec
trodes are not all equal, since the sum of the currents entering the disk
must be equal to those leaving                      it,
                                    they may all be divided up into sets of

two unlike equal currents                 ;    and hence for all cases of currents entering

                     Equipotemial Curves and Surfaces,       fyc.            21
   and leaving a   circular disk, the edge is in the position of a line of flow
   for all the electrodes  and their images in the unlimited sheet. At. an
   electrode  and its image the currents are equal, and must be supposed to
   be both  entering or both leaving the sheet.
      In the case when the two equal sets of two unlike electrodes in the
  unlimited sheet lie at the corners of a rectangle, then the straight lines
  joining the like poles are bisected at right angles by a straight line, which
  is a line of flow.
     Hence, if the sheet be cut along this straight line, no alteration is
  made in the lines of flow on either side of it ; and the pair of unlike
  electrodes on one side of it become the images of the electrodes on the
  other side.
     In the case of a plane sheet limited by two lines at right angles, three
 electrical images of each electrode will be formed by the two rectangular
  intersecting sides ; and these images will be arranged in a circle about the
 point of intersection, in the same positions as the optical images formed
 by two plane mirrors at right angles to one another.
     The equipotential curves in this case will be the same as those in an
 infinite sheet when there are four equal electrodes of each kind — the four
 positive electrodes taking the positions of the one positive electrode and
 its three images,    and the four negative electrodes being similarly placed.
     A particular and an interesting case arises when one of the electrodes
 is on the edge of the circular disk ; the electric image of this electrode
 then    coincides with the electrode    itself ; and the case in an unlimited
 sheet   which corresponds to this is that where a current enters the sheet
 at one point, and leaves it by equal currents at two other points, the
 three points lying on a circle which touches the radius of the disk, i. e.
 cuts the disk at right angles, at the point where the current enters the
 sheet.
                                      Fig.  4.
     When a current enters a circular disk at one point on the edge, and
leaves it by equal currents at two other points, the corresponding case in
an unlimited sheet is that where a current enters the sheet at one point
and leaves by equal currents at four other points lying two and two on

22                  Prof. W. G. Adams on the Forms of
circles which touch one another at the point where the current enters
the sheet (fig. 4).
   If , in an indefinite sheet (Plate 2. fig. 3), one of the battery-electrodes
be separated into four parts and attached to the tinfoil at the four
corners of a square, and if the other battery-electrode be attached at the
centre of the square, then the current at the centre will be four times
the current at each corner of the square ; and the forms of the equipo-
tential curves will be the same as when there are only two, unlike equal
electrodes in a sheet limited in two directions by straight lines meeting
at the centre and parallel to the sides of the square, the three elec
trical images in the limited sheet being in the same positions as three of
the electrodes in the unlimited sheet.
   This is a particular case of the last, when an electrode and its image
lie at the ends of a diameter of the circle, and are equally distant from
the point at which the current enters the sheet (fig. 5).
                                     Fig. 5.
   The   case with one positive electrode at the centre and four negative
electrodes at the corners of a square in an unlimited sheet may also be
regarded as equivalent to two sets of electrodes, each set consisting of
one positive electrode at the corner of a square and two negative elec
trodes at equal distances along the two edges measured from that corner
when the sheet is cut along these two edges.
   The curves are also the same as in a sheet limited by two edges at
right angles to one another, when one electrode is at the corner and
the other on the diagonal of the square sheet, the electrodes being at the
same distance as in the two previous cases.
   The curves in Plate 2. fig. 4 are drawn on such a sheet with one posi
tive electrode at  A   and a negative electrode at B, at a distance of 3 inches
from A, the whole sheet of tinfoil being      18 inches square.
   It   may also be regarded as a particular case of two sets of electrodes
in an unlimited sheet, where there are three electrodes in each set at
equal distances along the same straight line, the current entering at the
middle one and flowing out at the other two electrodes.         Since the circle

                    Equipotential     Curves and Surfaces,      l$c.               23
is not a line of flow for such a system of electrodes, we cannot have this
system of equipotential curves and lines of flow in a circular disk.
   A particular solution of this case, the equipotential curve for zero
potential, is a rectangular hyperbola, having its centre and two foci at
the three electrodes (see Plate 1. fig. 5).
   In the case of a circular disk the electric image of the centre may be
regarded as a point at an infinite distance, so that the distance of the
 image from any point of the circular disk remains constant.
    If, then, one electrode be at the centre and the other at the circum
ference of a circular disk (Plate 1. fig. 6), the corresponding case in the
unlimited sheet is that where the current flowing in at the circumference
is double the current flowing out at the centre, we may conceive of it as
a case where there is one electrode at an infinite distance, equal to and
of like kind with the electrode at the centre.
    In such a case           the   potential    at  any  point is    expressed      by
 C+Alogr— 2Alogrj
    Hence for an equipotential curve
                                          =
                                             2fiart
 where o is the radius of the circle (which is introduced for the sake of
 making the equation homogeneous), and p is some ratio which is con
 stant for the same curve.
     With polar coordinates about the centre, taking a as the radius of the
 circle, we get
                           r2 + a5 — 2ar cos 9 = 2fiar,
                           r*—2a,r (jti+cose)+a* = 0
     If /i=  or >2, the curve is a closed curve, and, when           r is small  com
 pared with a, the curve nearly coincides           with an ellipse of eccentricity

 Hence       expresses the      percentage of error in the value of          r if  the
 ellipse be taken instead of the curve.
     In a circular disk of 100 millims. in radius the distance between the
 curve and the ellipse at a distance of 25 millims. from the centre of the
 disk is only about 1-5 millim.                                             •
     When   ft is less than 2 and greater than (V2— 1), the curves are of
 double curvature, and have points of inflection.
     From the equation of the curve we obtain
                         {r— a (p+cos 0)}     -ja+cr sin 6=0.

and the two branches of the curve are each inclined at an angle of 45°
to the edge of the disk.
   The polar equation to this curve is very much simplified when this
double point is taken as the origin of coordinates.
     The polar equation then              becomes
            rs + 4as   —   4arcos   0 =   4a   ^r' + a1 — 2ar cos   0 . r4     — 8ar3cos0

     From this result it is         easy to see that there is no point of inflection in
the curve     ; so   that each      branch of the curve is continuous and remains on
the same side of its tangent.
   From the above equations the curve may be traced. It consists of
two loops, which form a continuous curve, the two branches cutting one
another at right angles in passing through the double point on the edge
of the disk.
   The complete equipotential curves for the unlimited sheet may also be
readily traced from the above equations to those curves by giving different
values to ft (see Plate 1. fig. 7).
   Neglecting the part of the curve outside the disk, the equation to the
curve may be put under the form

  the disk.
      This is a point of very great importance in connexion with the tracing
  of equipotential curves on tinfoil or copper disks ; and the uncertainty in
  the experimental determination of points in the neighbourhood of the
   singular point (see Case 6, p. 6) is entirely explained.

   In  order to draw     the curves near the singular point correctly, both
galvanometer-electrodes must be placed in contact with the disk in the
neighbourhood of the singular point.
             Electrical Distribution in Space of    three dimensions.

   The equipotential surfaces will then be surfaces of revolution about
the straight line joining the two charged spheres.          For an equipotential
curve we shall have       — - = -.

   On referring to the experiments with battery-electrodes immersed to
a considerable depth in a conducting liquid, so as not to be near the
boundary of the liquid, we see that the same equation is true for the
equipotential surfaces when a steady current flows in at one electrode
and out at the other.
   The equation to an equipotential      surface  will be  of the form
                                  1-1 = 1

   Take a section of the surface through the axis, and refer the section to
rectangular coordinates.
   Let the axis of revolution    be the axis of x, and a line equidistant from
the electrodes be the axis of y, then the equation to the curve is

   This will be the equation to the line of flow in any plane through the
two electrodes.
   These lines of flow coincide with the lines of force in non-conducting
space with equal and opposite charges in the positions of the two elec
trodes.    They also coincide with the magnetic lines of force when the
two poles are in the same positions as the electrodes.            From this equa
tion the form of the lines of flow may be readily drawn.
   Let AB be the two electrodes, O the middle point of AB, and OE
bisect AB at right angles.
   Let £ be a point on the line of force. Describe a semicircle on AB

plane passing through the axis of revolution of the lines of flow.    The
equipotential surfaces will all cut every such plane at right angles.
   Hence we may suppose the conducting-mass on one side of such                                                  a
plane to be removed without changing the form of the equipotential
surfaces.   The resistance of the conductor between the two electrodes
will then          be doubled.

vessel with two plane sides parallel to the line joining the electrodes, the
forms of the equipotential surfaces will be the same when the electrodes
are on the line where the surface of the liquid meets one Bide of the box,

    Suppose the electrodes to be in the same straight line at A, B, C, D ; and
 let AB=2a, and CD =26; the positive electrodes at A and C, and the

 equipotential surface through the axis referred to rectangular coordinates,

 or
                          cos 0 — cos 0 + cos 0, — cos 0,   = c,
 where 0, 0i, 0, 0, are the angles which the radii make with the line on
 which the electrodes lie.
    If we   examine the equation
                          cos 0+ cos 0,— cos     0— cos 0,=c,
 which gives the lines of flow where four electrodes are arranged symme
 trically along a straight line, we see that when c is greater than 2, the
 curve does not cut either of the two planes given by the equations
                      cos  0+cos 0,=O, or       cos 0+cos 0,=O,
 but lies entirely between them, and that           it cuts the aids at the two inte
 rior electrodes.    The curve
                           cos  0+cos   0, — cos  f — cos 0, = 2
 meets the plane cos 0 + cos 0,=O where it cuts the axis            ; for cos 0= — 1,
 and cos 0,= — 1 for this point.
    When    008  0+008 0,-008^ — cos 0, is less than 2, the curve cuts the
 planes cos 0+cos ©,=0 and cos 0 + cos 0,=O at some distance from the
axis, and cuts the axis at the point from which 0, is measured, i. e. it
 cuts the axis at the two exterior electrodes.
    The curve      cos 0 + cos     0l— cos 0— cos 0,=2 has very close contact
with the plane     cos 0 + cos 0,=O, since the distance between them depends
on the differences of 'small quantities of the second order.               Hence in a
rectangular box, when the two electrodes are near to, but not in contact
with the ends, the lines of flow and equipotential surfaces should very
closely coincide with the lines of flow and equipotential surfaces in space,
supposing that two additional like equal electrodes are placed at the
electric images of the electrodes.           (See Cases 7 and 8, on pp. 9 and 10.)
    The value of the constant, c, in the above equation will determine
directly the cosine of the angle at which the curve cuts the axis.
    For at the axis     cos  0=   — 1, cos   0,= — 1, and either cos   0= — 1 when  c
is less than 2, in which case cos 0, = c— 1, and the curve cuts the axis at
the exterior electrodes at an angle cos-1 (c— 1),
or       cos 0,=1 when c is greater than 2, in which case cos 0=c— 3,
and the curve cuts the axis at the interior electrodes at an angle
                                     cos-1   (c-3).
    As in the   case of   two electrodes, if any two planes, both intersecting
along the line of the electrodes, be taken as bounding surfaces of the
conducting liquid, there will be no change in the forms of the lines of
flow and the equipotential surfaces.            The resistance of the liquid will be
inversely proportional       to  the angle   between   two such bounding planes.

      A   case of this kind occurs when the electrodes lie on the straight line
 where the surface of the liquid meets the plane vertical side of the vessel
 containing it.
                    Electrical Distribution with Linear Electrodes.
     Next consider the case in which the electrodes are parallel straight
lines, extending throughout the liquid. With one electrode, the potential
at any point at a distance r from it is
                                        C+A    log r.
     When there are several electrodes, the potential is
                            C+A     log   r+B   log r, + &c.
    If    the currents flowing    into the liquid at the several electrodes   are all
equal, the potential fa
                              C+A     (log   r+log r,+ &c)      ;
and for an equipotential surface we have
                              r r' r"  . . .  =c r, r
                                                      '

where dashes below the letter indicate negative electrodes.
     This equation is the same as that obtained for a plane conductor of
small thickness, which has been already considered ; and the forms of the
equipotential surfaces are cylindrical.              The disk of tinfoil may be con
sidered as a particular case of the solid with electrodes throughout the
 whole thickness when that thickness is supposed to be small.
     For two linear electrodes with equal and opposite currents, the equi
potential surfaces will be circular cylinders, and the lines of flow will
also be circular cylinders cutting them at right angles.
     The particular cases of circular and other disks which have already
 been considered will give the sections of the equipotential surfaces for
 the corresponding        cases with linear electrodes in the liquid, and will
 completely determine them.
      Supposing the surface of the liquid to be of unlimited extent, and
 that a current enters by one line electrode, and leaves by equal currents
 at two negative electrodes, the forms of the cylindrical surfaces will be
 given by the equation
                                         r'=cr1ri.
      When the positive electrode is at the middle point of one side of the
 rectangular box used in the experiments, and an equal negative electrode
 is within the box and near the same side, as in Case 10, the forms of the
  equipotential surfaces will be given by the equation
                                          r*=cryr1;
  r,,  r2
           are the distances of the point from the negative electrode and from
  its image.
      This equation    will give the form of the surfaces accurately only when

the opposite side and the two ends of the box are far enough off that
they may be regarded as practically at an infinite distance from the
electrodes.
   When e=l, the equation becomes ri=rl ra :              so that the section of
the cylindrical surface is a rectangular hyperbola.
   A   curve determined      by experiment is drawn in Plate 2. fig. 12, very
near    to the position of this hyperbola ; but as one of the electrodes
was at the centre of the box, the forms of the equipotential curves will
be   slightly changed,     because  of the influence of the opposite side and
ends of the box.
   At   the vertex the two curves coincide, and, measured along the latus
rectum of the hyperbola, the distance between them is only 5 millims.
Since the distance between the battery-electrodes is one half the breadth
of the box, the influence of the opposite side and ends of the box will be
quite sufficient to account for so small a difference.          Thus we see that
with linear electrodes there is a very satisfactory agreement between
theory and experiment.
   The equipotential curves for Case 10, with linear electrodes in the
liquid, are theoretically the same as those for Case 5, with points on a
sheet of tinfoil for electrodes.       A comparison of the figures (Plate 1.
fig.  5 and   Plate 2. fig. 12)  which  are laid down from the experimental
results   shows how closely they agree, and may be taken to be an inde
pendent proof of the accuracy of the theory of electrical distribution.

    The President expressed his regret, which would be shared by the
 Society, that intelligence had been received by the Admiralty of the
 decease, at sea, of Dr. von Willemoes-Suhm, a distinguished                    young
 Naturalist attached to the Scientific Staff of the ' Challenger ' Expedition.
    The Presents received were laid on the table, and thanks ordered for
 them.
    A direct-vision compound prism by Mere, the gift of Mr. Gassiot, was
 presented to the Society.        It is regarded by the maker as one of remark
 able excellence, and is composed of a central prism, of large angle, formed
 of peculiarly heavy lead glass, with opposed prisms of crown glass
 cemented to its two faces.         It is capable of taking in a pencil of rays of
 284  lines in width. The indices of refraction, in the heavy glass, of Fraun-
 hofer s lines C, D, E, F are given by M. Mere as follows : —
                                      C. =l-7389.

                                   left Yokohama on the 16th of June, and ran
an easterly course between the parallels of 35° and 40° north latitude,
as far as the meridian of 155° east.             "We then turned nearly directly
southwards and reached Honolulu on the 27th of July.                    The weather
throughout     was   sufficiently   favourable  ; shortly  after leaving Yokohama
there was a good deal of swell, which interfered somewhat with our
dredging-operations and caused the loss of a good deal of time ; we esta
blished, however, 24 observing stations, at each of which most of the de
sired observations were made. On the 17th of June we sounded in 1875
fathoms, with a bottom of bluish-grey clay and a bottom-temperature                   of
1°'7  C,   40 miles to the south-east of No-Sima Lighthouse. The trawl was
put over, and it brought up a large quantity of the bottom, which showed
the clay was in a peculiar concretionary state, run together into coherent
lumps, which were bored in all directions by an Annelid of the Aphrodita-
cean group.      In many cases the Annelids were still in the burrows.
Among the clay there were large lumps of grey pumice. The trawl con

and a large number of Echinoderms, chiefly flexible sea-urchins, ophiurids,
and starfishes of the genus Brisinga.      The hydroid zoophytes were repre
sented by a very remarkable species, apparently referable to the genus
Monocaulon of Sars, a Corymorpfta-like solitary polyp with adelocodonic
gonophores ; but instead of being of the proportions usual in its group,
the stem in one of our specimens measured upwards of seven feet in height,
while the polyp-head was nine inches in diameter across the proximal row
of tentacles.    We afterwards got another fine example of the same     species
at a depth of 2900 fathoms (Station 248). The temperature of the surface
of the sea stood during the day at nearly 23° C, considerably above the
temperature of the air; anda serial sounding gave the isotherm of 10°C. at
a depth of little more than 200 fathoms. We were therefore evidently under
the thermic influence of the Japan current, which was found by observa
tion to be running in an easterly direction at a rate of 1^ knot an hour.
The thermometers registered a uniform temperature of l°-7 C. from a
depth of 1000 fathoms to the bottom.          About twenty Albatrosses, of a
nearly uniform brown plumage with whitish heads (probably the young of
the common North-Pacific species in their second year's plumage), followed
the ship.
   On the following day there was a stiff breeze from the southward,
with a heavy sea. We sounded, however, successfully in 3950 fathoms,
our deepest sounding in the North Pacific — position by dead reckoning lat.
34° 43' N., long. 144° 2' E., with a bottom of " red clay."      The gale con
tinued on the 19th, and the weather prevented our attempting to trawl ;
but a sounding in 3025 fathoms and serial temperatures to 1500 fathoms
were obtained.     At both of the two latter stations the high surface-tem
perature  was   maintained  ; and the position   of the isotherm of 10° C. at
station 239, at a depth of nearly 300 fathoms, indicates that up to this
point, at all events, there was no diminution in the influence of the
                                                                       " Kuro-
Siwo."
   On the 21st we sounded in 2900 fathoms, with a bottom of " red clay."
An attempt was made to trawl ; but the sea was still running high, and
in hauling in the line parted.
   The temperature-observations gave a singular result.           The surface-
temperature    had fallen to  18°-2 C, and  the belt of water above 10° C. was
reduced in depth to considerably less than 100 fathoms, while all the iso
therms, at all events to a depth of 400 fathoms, rose in proportion.
There seems to be little doubt, from a comparison of the American tem
perature-results with our own, that this sudden diminution of tempera
ture is due to a cold surface-flow from the sea of Okhotsk, probably
through Pico Channel or Vries Strait. Very likely its effect may not be
found to be constant ; and at this season it possibly attains its maximum
from the melting of the snow over the vast region drained by the Amoor
and the Udi and Siberian rivers with a southern outflow.

The trawl brought up a quantity of lumps of pumice, more or less altered
and more or less coated with manganese.     Animals of all the invertebrate
groups were abundant, free, and attached to the stones ; but the assemblage
was in no way remarkable.    At this station the effect of the cold current
was already almost  entirely lost, the isotherm of 10° C. having resumed
its position at        of about 200 fathoms.

     On the 26th of June we sounded in 2800 fathoms.        Temperature-
soundings were taken to the usual depth ; and the dredging-line was then
veered to about 3000 fathoms with a cwt. lead and one towing-net at the
end, two nets 250 fathoms from the end, and two more at a distance of
about 1000 fathoms.      The line with the nets was slowly dragged along
for a time with the drift of the ship and hauled in. On carefully washing
the nets   and examining their contents several forms were met with which
apparently do not occur on the surface, particularly a number of species
of a group which              is,
                        so far as we know, entirely undescribed.     It seems

     July 3. — We sounded in 2530 fathoms, with a bottom of reddish-brown
ooze (" red clay "), and took temperature-soundings ; we afterwards veered
the dredging-line to 1500 fathoms with tow-nets, and got many speci
mens of the usual deep-water Protozoa.
     July 5. — We sent down the trawl and afterwards sounded in 2900
fathoms, and took serial temperatures. In the trawl, along with many other
deep-sea forms, there was one fine specimen of the large solitary hydroid
already referred to (Station 237).
     On the 7th we sounded in 3000 fathoms, with the usual bottom of red
clay ; on the 9th in 3050 fathoms, and on the 10th in 2950 fathoms.         The
results   of  the dredgings  for the last few stations had been so uniform, and
the operation was rendered so critical by the heavy swell from the westward,
that we did not consider it necessary to repeat it on every occasion.
     On the 12th of July the trawl was lowered at a depth of 2740 fathoms.
The net contained very few animals, and was greatly torn and frayed ;
but in a kind of pocket formed by an accidental folding of the net there
were about a cwt. of black mammillated concretions, which, when they
were poured out on the deck, had very much the appearance of potatoes.
The external surface of the concretion was slightly rough, and a number
of small animal forms, particularly a minute rhizopod in a membranous
tube, nestled in the crevices.        The nature of these concretions will be
discussed hereafter.
     On the 14th of     July  we reached the point lat. 38° 9' N., long. 156°
25'    W., whence we turned southwards         towards the Sandwich Islands.
For the last few stations the temperature of the water had       been  gradually
sinking, and the influence of the Japan current dying out ; the isotherm
of 10° C. was now only 100 fathoms below the surface. The depth at
 this point was 3115 fathoms ; we put over the small dredge, as the nature
 of the bottom had latterly been so destructive to the trawl, and brought
 up manganese nodules, with a few small sponges and Bryozoa.
      On the 17th of July we sounded in 3025 fathoms, the bottom still
 " red clay," and on the 19th in 2850 fathoms. A serial

 at the latter station     to 1500 fathoms showed a considerable rise in the
 temperatures near the surface, the isotherm of 10° C. having again sunk
 to a depth of 200 fathoms, and that of 15° C. corresponding with the 100-

 fathoms    ;  the small dredge was lowered and brought up a large quantity
 of the ooze, very smooth and tenacious, but containing scarcely a trace of
  living things.    The serial temperature-soundings indicated a still further
  rise in the temperature of the upper layers, due doubtless to progress
  southwards.

   On the 23rd we sounded in 2875 fathoms, and on the 24th in 2775,
the bottom in both cases having much the same character which it had
maintained throughout the cruise.           The Albatrosses, which had followed
the ship, to the number of from fourteen to twenty daily, since we left
Japan, left us to-day. We saw one or two Boatswain Birds {Phaeton rubri-
cauda), and a Turnstone (Strtpsilaa interpres) flew about the ship for some
hours, lighting on the combings and the rigging. On the 26th we sounded
in 2225 fathoms ; and on the morning of the 27th we passed into the
strait between the islands of Molokai and Oahu, and trawled on hard
ground in 310 fathoms, with but little success. In the evening we anchored
in the harbour of Honolulu.
   This cruise naturally divides itself into two parts : — a section about 3170
nautical miles in length, including the stations from No. 237 to No. 253,
very slightly to the northward of east, between the parallels of 35° and
38°  N.  lat. ; and a meridional     section of 1128 nautical miles, along the
meridian of 155° "W. long.         The first of these sections corresponds very
closely in relative position with the section in the Atlantic between Sandy
Hook and the Acpres, and the points of resemblance and difference
between them, when fully worked out, must prove most instructive.             The
two sections cross the two great deflections to the northward of the
equatorial current, in the Atlantic the Gulf-stream, and in the Pacific the
" Kuro-Siwo ; " and the thermic influence of the two currents is fairly
contrasted.      The influence of the Gulf-stream, if not absolutely greater
(and this is a point which it will be somewhat difficult to determine), is at
all events much more concentrated and effective, owing to the continuity
of the coast-line of the American continent, to the way in which the
water of the equatorial current is driven into the Gulf of Mexico and
superheated there, afterwards to be kept together and ejected in a defined
stream through the Strait of Florida, and to the absence of periodical
winds in the Atlantic. In the Pacific, on the other hand, the main flow
of the equatorial current is weakened among the passages of the Malayan
archipelago ; and although a large part of it is directed northwards by
the broken barrier formed by the Fiji Islands, the New Hebrides, and
                                                                                  '
Papua, it almost at once enters the region of the monsoons, where it is
thwarted for half the year ; and it can only be regarded as comparable
with that portion of the reflux of the Atlantic equatorial current which
passes outside the "West-Indian Islands.         Nevertheless it passes the south
coast of Japan as a very palpable and apparently a permanent current,
exercising a very perceptible thermic influence to a depth of at least 300
fathoms.
   In traversing    the Pacific the influence of the Japan current appears to
be  gradually   lost ; while  I am still inclined to believe that in the Atlantic
the Gulf-stream is banked down against and reflected from the western
coast of Europe.        It is a question of great complexity ; but it seems to
me that it is consistent with our experience that the temperature of the

water of the ocean at any one place is due, in a great measure, to the tempe
rature of the source of that water — not entirely due, for in passing through
a long distance the temperature of even the greatest masses of water is
certainly gradually altered by conduction and mixture.
  The suggestions of Dr. Carpenter and Mr. Buchanan that the existence
of   a deep layer of warm water ^n           the Atlantic          might be connected in
someway with the mean annual temperature                      of the area and the absence
of ocean-currents, are very suggestive ; and                 I
                                               looked forward with great
interest to an opportunity of testing them in the corresponding position
in the Pacific. But there seems to be no trace of any thing of the kind ;
as the influence of the equatorial    reflux becomes weaker the temperatures
fall uniformly.

than in kind,        I

 the Atlantic, an indraught from the Southern Sea. The more the question
 is investigated the less evidence there seems to me to be of any general
 ocean circulation depending upon differences of specific gravity.     It seems
  certain that, both in the Atlantic and in the Pacific, the bottom-water is
                                         I
  constantly moving northwards ; and am now very much inclined to refer
  this movement to an excess of precipitation over the water-hemisphere,
  a portion of the vapour formed in the northern hemisphere being carried
  southwards and precipitated in the vast southern area of low barometric
  pressure.    1 hope to enter fully into the discussion of this matter on a
  future occasion. The temperature of the water is greatly lower in the Pacific
  for the first thousand fathoms than in the Atlantic in the corresponding
  latitude of 35° N. There is one very remarkable difference between the
   two basins : while in the Atlantic it seems certain that the temperature
  sinks gradually, though very slightly, for the last thousand fathoms to
  the bottom, it appears that in the Pacific the minimum temperature of
  l°-7 C. is reached at a depth not greater than 1400 fathoms, and that from
  that depth to the bottom the temperature is the same.
     The soundings from Yokohama to Honolulu are remarkably uniform
  in depth, the twenty-two soundings on one line, which. are unaffected by
  the neighbourhood of land, giving an average of 2858 fathoms.             The
  nature of the bottom is also very uniform ;   and, according to  the  nomen
  clature which we have adopted, it is, in each case, noted on the chart as
  " red clay." It is usually, however, somewhat greyer in colour than the
  typical " red clay," and contains a large proportion of the tests of sili
  ceous organisms (a proportion which increases with increasing depth), and
  a considerable quantity of pumice in different states of comminution
  and decomposition.      The clay contains scarcely a trace of carbonate of
  lime, although the surface swarms with ooze-forming foraminifera.          In
  some cases the trawl came up half full of large lumps of pumice, which
  seemed to have been drifted about till they were water-logged, and to be
  softening and becoming decomposed ; these pieces of decomposing pumice
  were often coated and pervaded throughout with oxide of manganese.
  Over the whole area the red clay was full of concretions, consisting
 mainly of peroxide of manganese, round, oval, or mammillated -and very
 irregular, varying in size from a grain of mustard-seed to a large potato.
 When these concretions are broken up, they are found to consist of con
 centric layers having a radiating fibrous arrangement, and usually starting
 from a nucleus consisting of some foreign body, such as a piece of pumice,
 a shark's tooth, or a fragment of any organism — as, for instance, in one
 case a piece of a Hexactinnelid sponge of the genus Aphrocallistes, which
 was preserved as a very beautiful fossil in the centre.     The concretions
appear to form loose among the soft clay ; the singular point is the amount
of this manganese formation, and the vast area which it covers.
    We were particularly successful, during this cruise, in getting good
samples of the fauna from great depths ; and we found that the fauna of

the North Pacific, at depths of from 2000 to 3000 fathoms, although not
very abundant in species, is by no means meagre.               In each of six
dredgings and trawlings at depths greater than 2000 fathoms we found,
along with a few Fishes, a fair representation of all the larger invertebrate
groups ; and in one dredging, No. 253, at a depth of 3125 fathoms, we
took a small Sponge, a species of Cornularia, an Actinia, an Annelid in a
tube, and a Bryozoon.      We were again struck with the wonderful uni
formity of the fauna at these depths ; if not exactly the same species, very
similar representatives of the same genera occur in all parts of the world.

II. "On      the Physiological Action         of Vanadium."           By John
      Priestley, Piatt Physiological Scholar, the Owens College,
      Manchester.      Communicated by Prof. Gamgee, F.R.S.                  Re
      ceived June 18, 1875.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The author has divided his paper into four sections.
   In the first the subject is introduced by a brief statement of the rela
tionships of vanadium to other elements of the same and of allied
groups ; and the main object of the research is set forth, viz. by an ex
tended investigation to endeavour to fix the physiological relationships of
vanadium to the closely allied elements arsenic and phosphorus, so as
to throw some light on the relations which probably exist between the
chemical and physiological properties of the elements.              The tribasic
sodium vanadate (NasV04) is stated to have been the compound of vana
dium made use of throughout the research, and the reasons of the pre
ference are given.
   In the second section      the action   of solutions   of sodium vanadate
upon simple organisms is shortly illustrated by the details of four sets
of experiments, from which the conclusion is drawn that all solutions,
except those which are extremely dilute (i. e. which contain only so much
salt as corresponds to 'Ol-^S per cent, of Va O,), act injuriously upon the
simpler organisms.
   In the third section the effects of vanadium in the above combination
on complex organisms are discussed under two heads, viz.         : —
      A. The general action on the animal system when introduced               by

1875.]               Physiological   Action of Vanadium.                      41
         subcutaneous injection, by injection into veins, or by injection into
         the alimentary canal.
     B. the special action on the various functions of the animal body.
  Under      A thirty-one experiments are detailed, in which frogs, a pigeon,
guineapigs, rabbits, dogs, and cats were made use of.        From these experi
ments it is gathered : —
     (1) That vanadium is a poisonous substance.
     (2) That the symptoms of poisoning are, in general, similar whatever
         the method of the introduction of the salt into the animal system.
     (3) That the symptoms of poisoning which appeared in one or other
         of the various classes of animals above mentioned are : — paralysis
         of motion ; convulsions, local or general ; rapidly supervening
         drowsiness, or indifference    to external circumstances   ; congestion
         of alimentary mucous membranes ; discharge of sanguinolent fluid
         fteces ; presence of glairy, fluid mucus in the intestines after death ;
         certain changes in respiration and, coincidently, a fall in tem
         perature ; drowisness and feebleness of pulse.         In addition, the
         heart was always irritable after death, consciousness and sensibility
         to pain seemed unimpaired, and no diminution could be detected
         in the powers of muscle and nerve to respond to stimulation.
     (4) That the lethal dose for rabbits lies between 9-18 mgr. and
          14-66 mgr. of Va Os per kilog. of rabbit.
   Under B the author details a number of experiments undertaken with
the view to gain more exact information as to the action of the salt of
vanadium upon particular functions.           The methods of experiment and
the precautions observed are fully described ; and the action on the fol
lowing functions is discussed, viz. : —
     (i) On the function of muscular tissue (after direct local applica
         tion of the salt) ; and
      (ii) On the function of nervous tissue (after direct local application
         of the salt). Five series of experiments are recorded, from which
         it appears that, under the conditions of the experiments, func
          tional death of muscular and nervous tissue speedily follows
         even when the solutions used contain no more salt than corre
          sponds to "05 per cent, of Va 05.
     (iii) On the function of circulation.        Twelve experiments are re
         corded   in which either subcutaneous or venous injection was       em
          ployed, the experiments being performed on —
             (a) Normal rabbits,
             (6) Rabbits with divided vagi,
             (c) Babbits with divided cords,
             (d) A frog with heart exposed and the nervous structures          in
                  front of the atlanto-occipital articulation destroyed.

 42               Rev. S. Haughton on the Law            of Fatigue.        [Nov. 18,
          From these it is gathered that sodium vanadate causes —
               (1) A diminution of blood-pressure which is not continuous,
          but intermits during the operation of the poison ;
               (2) A disappearance of respiration-curves ;
               (3) A diminution aud irregularity of pulse, which is also inter
          mittent.
               The results are discussed and considered to be due to an action
          of the poison on the vaso-motor centre and on the intracardiac
          nervous mechanism,
       (iv) On the function of respiration.           Subcutaneous or venous injec
          tion was again employed in the cases of seven rabbits, normal or
          with divided vagi. The results show that sodium vanadate causes —
               (1) A stimulation, followed by
               (2) A depression, of respiration, the latter being not continuous
          but intermittent ; they are discussed and considered to be due to
          an action of the poison upon the respiratory nervous centre.
       (v) On the functions of muscle and nerve. Subcutaneous injection
          was employed in the nineteen experiments described, which were

          illustrating diagram matically the      action  of the salt.  The results of
          these experiments are found to be the same as those given under
          A, where the general symptoms of poisoning by sodium vana
          date are enumerated; and it is concluded, from the facts here
          stated, that the cause of the nervous symptoms is an action of the
          vanadate upon the central system of the spinal cord and medulla
          oblongata, and not upon nerve-trunks of peripheral terminations
          or upon muscle.

 III.   "On      some      Elementary Principles in Animal Mechanics.
       No. VII. The Law of Fatigue."                       By the Rev. Samuel
       Haughton, M.D. (Dubl.), D.C.L. (Oxon.), F.R.S., Fellow of
       Trinity College, Dublin. Received June 21, 1875.
   The approximate law of muscular action, which               I have called the law
of fatigue, is thus expressed : — " When              the same muscle (or group of
muscles)    is  kept  in constant  action until fatigue sets in, the total work done
multiplied by the rate of work is constant."
   The following experiments, in illustration of this law, were performed
in Trinity College during the spring of the present year.
   1 instructed      a number    of medical students, chosen at random, to raise
dumbbells of varying weight, one in each hand, in the tranverse plane,
with hands supinated, raising and lowering the weights in equal times
regulated by the beat of a pendulum.              This process was continued until

 1875.]         Rev. S. Haughton on the        Law of Fatigue.               43
the distress of the fatigue produced became intolerable, and the number
of times each weight was lifted was noted.        The students were required
to count   " one — two" in time to the  beat of the pendulum, so as to prevent
them from counting the total number of lifts of the weight.           Professor
Macalister assisted me in these experiments ; and one of us counted the
number of lifts, while the other compelled the experimenters         to observe
the conditions of the experiment, which were :— «¦
   1. To keep time with the pendulum.
   2. To raise the weight in the transverse plane.
   3. To supinate the hands.
   4. To abstain from all bending of the knees or spinal column.
   The last three conditions are essential, in order to confine the work
done strictly to the same muscles, which, in this case, are the acromial
deltoid and mpraspinatm muscles, whose average weight in the living sub
ject is about 5-5 oz. av.
   The experimenter must be carefully watched, in order to ensure the
observance of these conditions ; for he is impelled instinctively and uncon
sciously, by pain, to bring in other muscular fibres to aid those which are
suffering from the constrained and regulated motion.            If this be per
mitted, the law of fatigue will appear to be violated ; for of the muscular
fibres actually employed in doing work, some are quite tired out and
others not ; whereas the law of fatigue applies only to groups of muscles
all of which are completely exhausted.
   For each experiment     I  chose twenty students at random, using alto
gether about fifty different students ; and no individual was experimented
upon again until an interval of forty-eight hours had elapsed.              The
object of this arrangement was to avoid the effects     of " training." In my
             I
first Table give the mean result of twenty different students ; and in my
second Table    I have selected one student, set aside for the purpose, and
experimented upon once a week, so as to prevent the influence of
" training." In all cases there were three well-marked stages : —
    1. The work done with     ease.
    2. Accompanied    by respiratory distress.
    3. Accompanied    by pain in the muscles used.
   During the last stage great care must be taken to prevent changes in
the posture and mode of motion, by which additional muscular fibres
 may come in aid of the fibres nearly fatigued.
    Let "W" denote the total work done, and T the time of doing it ; then,
by the law of fatigue,
                               =  constant                                   (1)

muscular action.     I have    elsewhere* shown that the law of fatigue corre
sponds with other experiments based on different data.

  I. " On     the Replacement        of Electro-positive hy Electro-negative
        Metals   in a  Voltaic   Cell."  By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.,

     It is well known that one metal exerts a greater chemical force than
 another, and is capable of displacing it from its combinations.        Among
 those metals with which we are familiar, potassium is looked upon as the
 most powerful ; and it is a certain fact that calcium, barium, strontium,
 aluminium, and magnesium have been isolated by its agency. It could
 scarcely be expected, therefore, that any other metal could directly replace
 potassium.      H such should happen, we would have an instance of rever
 sal, and should expect to find, on examination of the conditions, an agent
 capable of doing just the reverse work of what is usually assigned to affinity.
     It is also well known that in a simple voltaic cell, such as zinc con

 48                 Messrs. Gladstone and Tribe on the                    [Nov. 25,
 nocted with platinum in dilute hydrochloric acid, the more powerful or
 electro-positive metal zinc displaces the hydrogen that is in combination
 with chlorine, and the hydrogen makes its appearance against the less
 powerful or electro-negative      metal platinum.      The chemical theory of
 galvanism supposes that the force originates in the chemical action which
 takes place between the zinc and the acid ; the contact theory supposes
 that it originates in some unexplained manner in the opposite electrical
 condition of the two metals induced by their contact.             If  the chemical
 theory be the true one, it is evident that a zinc-platinum cell can only be
 come active when the binary liquid contains hydrogen or some metal
 which is less powerful than zinc.       If, for instance, we were to employ a
 potassium salt instead   of a hydrogen compound, it is inconceivable, on the
 pure chemical theory, that there should be any action at all.
    Such an action, however, does take place if we substitute an aqueous
 solution of the chloride of potassium for the hydrochloric acid ; the zinc
 combines with the chlorine, and the potassium is set free in some form,
 against the platinum, manifesting itself by the presence of free alkali and
 hydrogen gas.     The same holds good with aqueous solutions of chloride
 of sodium or ammonium, or barium, strontium, calcium, or magnesium.
    This action is slow ; but if magnesium be used instead of zinc, it takes
 place sufficiently rapidly to be easily observed, and we have therefore
 studied the action of platinum and magnesium in connexion.
                     Experiments with Potassium Chloride.
    The solution employed was neutral to test-paper, and contained 5 grms.
of salt in 100 cub. centims. of water. A strip of magnesium connected with
one of platinum was immersed in such a way that the two metals remained
about } inch apart.     Bubbles of gas immediately made their appearance
on the platinum ;    and a strip of red litmus-paper being placed in various
parts of the solution, became strongly blue in the vicinity of the platinum
plate, whereas but the faintest trace of alkaline reaction was observable
near the magnesium plate ; magnesium was found in solution.
    A similar experiment was made in a cell which was divided in the
middle by means of parchment-paper.           The strip of platinum in one divi
sion was connected with    the  strip of magnesium in the other by means of a
wire, and allowed to remain for an hour, when they were removed.               The
liquid in the division which had contained the magnesium was slightly
turbid and faintly alkaline, but did not give the slightest precipitate when
poured into a solution of magnesium sulphate.          The liquid in the division
that had contained the platinum plate was, on the contrary, clear and
strongly alkaline ; and it precipitated magnesium hydrate from the neutral
solution of that metal.      This conclusively showed the presence of some
alkaline hydrate other than magnesium hydrate, and which could not have
been any thing else than potassium hydrate.            The liquid in the second
division was about eight times      as alkaline as that  in the first.

    We conceive that the explanation of this reaction is that the po
 tassium chloride in solution is itself electrolyzed. The occurrence of hydro
gen against the platinum plate might be ascribed to the electrolysis of the
 water, the resistance of which was diminished by the dissolved salt ; but
this alone in no way accounts for the simultaneous formation of free alkali.
 If any objector should contend that the nascent hydrogen had decomposed
 chloride of potassium, that would still leave the removal of the acid un
explained  ; and as the liberated potassium would instantly decompose an
equivalent of water, we should have a chemical reaction resulting in nothing
but the restoration of the original state of things,
           H + KCl + Hp = HC1       + KHO + H = KC1 + H/) + H.
    It might be supposed that the force produced by the contact of the two
metals would expend itself upon the decomposition of a small amount of po
tassium salt, and that then the action would cease. But experiment shows
the action just described to be continuous.        Several determinations were
made of the alkali in the divided-cell experiment described above, at 30
minutes' and at 60 minutes' duration.       The results were far from uniform ;
but on the average the double period showed an increase of 70 per cent.
Better observations were obtained when the hydrogen evolved was taken as
the measure of the action.      The wire connecting the strips of magnesium
and platinum    was caused  to  pass through the whole length of a graduated
tube, which was filled with the solution and inverted in it as in the annexed
diagram.     Hydrogen   was evolved at once, and a certain volume was col-

                                  Sodium Chloride.
    Similar experiments were made with a neutral solution of chloride of
sodium containing 5 per cent, of salt.         Judging by one experiment with
 the divided-cell arrangement, the sodium salt was decomposed somewhat
 more quickly than the potassium salt, as might be anticipated.
    Volta, in his original pile, employed a solution of common salt as the
 exciting liquid. It seems to have been generally assumed, at least in late
 years, that it is the water alone that is decomposed ; but as a matter of
 fact the plates become alkaline.
                                Ammonium     Chloride.
    On employing a 5-per cent, solution of ammonium chloride, free ammo
 nia and hydrogen were obtained at the platinum plate. On causing the
 platinum to dip into a little mercury during the reaction the mercury in
 creased in bulk, owing to the formation of the so-called ammonium
 amalgam.
                   Chlorides of Metals    of the Alkaline Earths.
    The chlorides of barium, strontium, and calcium are easily decomposed
 by magnesium in connexion with platinum.            The hydrates pass into the
 liquid until it is saturated, when they precipitate.        Of course hydrogen
 escapes at the same time from the platinum plate.
                                 Other Combinations.
    As might   be expected, these actions are not confined to chlorides.      The
 sulphates and nitrates of potassium and sodium give similar results in the
 magnesium connected with platinum, an alkaline hydrate always appearing
 against the platinum plate.
    If one metal in conjunction with another more electro-negative than
itself will decompose the salt of a more positive metal in aqueous solution,

  it may   be expected, a fortiori, that  it can decompose one of its own salts.
  Instances of this are not wanting.
     Magnesium     connected with platinum      will decompose a magnesium salt,
  the almost insoluble hydrate     of magnesium being found adhering to the
  negative metal.      The deposition of zinc on the plates of an old-fashioned
  battery,  when   the  battery is pretty well exhausted, is a well-known phe
 nomenon.       In our experiments with copper and silver in conjunction in
 a solution of nitrate of copper, we never succeeded in reducing the gal
 vanic action to nil by our utmost efforts to exclude all oxygen : and the
  whole of the present inquiry originated in an experiment described by us
 before the Physical Society, that mercury and gold in conjunction would
 decompose mercuric chloride with the deposition not only of the lower
 chloride, but also of metallic mercury upon the gold.

 II. " On the Production         of Glycosuria by the Effect of Oxygenated
        Blood on the Liver/' (Supplement to Communication pre
        sented June 17th, 1875.)             By F. W. Pavy, M.D., F.R.S.
        Received August 12th, 1875.
     In  my former communication        I  showed that the injection of defibri-
 nated arterial blood into the portal system occasioned the immediate
 production     of marked glycosuria.       In the present supplement to it      I
 purpose treating of the production of glycosuria by other conditions, lead
ing to the portal blood being surcharged with oxygen. There are also cer
tain collateral considerations which       I shall afterwards proceed to refer to.
     After noticing the fact which has been mentioned, it occurred to me
to try the effect of endeavouring to saturate the blood with oxygen,
through the medium of respiration, to an extent beyond the capacity ex
isting in the systemic capillaries for reducing it to its ordinary venous
condition.
     I first directed my efforts to attain the object desired by causing an
unimal to breathe oxygen instead of air.
     The oxygen employed was obtained from a mixture of chlorate of
potash and peroxide of manganese.             I constructed a vulcanized india-
rubber mouthpiece, to fit tightly over the muzzle of the dog and exclude
the entrance of air. This tapered off and was connected with a piece of
vulcanized tubing, which passed to a balloon containing the oxygen for
use.      A valvular arrangement was provided to allow only the oxygen
from the balloon to enter the chest during inspiration, and to cause the
                                                                    e 2

 expired gas to be expelled without re-entering the balloon.            In this way
 the respiration of oxygen could be easily kept up as desired.
     I found that when the gas was breathed without being purified, it
 acted as a powerful irritant upon the respiratory passages —exciting
 cough, difficulty of breathing (apparently from spasmodic contraction of
 the bronchial tubes), and a profuse flow of mucous secretion.            The cough
 and excessive secretion continued for two or three days and showed that
  bronchitis had been set up.      I  at first attributed these symptoms to the
 presence   of  chlorine,  for the  gas possessed what appeared to be a chlo-
 rinous odour.      On testing for chlorine, however, no reaction was pro
 curable.    Ozone was then looked for, and a strongly marked indication of
 its presence obtained. Acting upon this information, the gas was passed
 over peroxide of manganese in a granulated state, and was found to be
 completely deprived of both chlorinous odour and irritating effect upon
 the respiratory passages.

                                 It could now be breathed without any incon
 venience whatever being noticeable.          Passage through water also to some
 extent diminished its odour and irritant action.          While, therefore, ozone
acts as a powerful irritant upon the air-passages, oxygen is devoid of any
 irritating property.
    The observations above recorded were made in 1874.               In the second

                       that the chemical part of the question has recently
formed the subject of discussion by others. Special properties are spoken
of as belonging to the gas evolved from a mixture of chlorate of potash
and peroxide of manganese ; and while some attribute these to the presence
of chlorine, Witt, in harmony with my own observations, affirms that
they are due to ozone and not to chlorine.
                                          I
    With these preliminary remarks come to the description of the results
obtained by the respiration of oxygen in relation to the subject of this
communication .
                                                                   I
    Amongst several experiments conducted upon the dog, have met with
the production of saccharine urine upon two occasions, while in the case
of the others   a negative   result was yielded.
    In  one of the successful instances the animal was breathing the gas for
55 minutes.     It took deep inspirations, and no irritation was excited, nor
did any subsequent ill-effect arise.        Indeed all that was specially notice
able, besides the deep breathing, was that at the end of the 55 minutes
a state   of apnoea was induced, such as is known to be occasioned by in
creased respiratory action.      It was from this occurrence that the inhala
tion of oxygen was discontinued, as          I felt apprehensive about the issue.
In   the course of a short time, however, the animal began to breathe in a
natural way, and showed no signs of disturbance. The urine was examined
at the commencement of the experiment, and gave no reaction of sugar.
At the end of the 55 minutes there was also no decided indication of the
presence of sugar    ; but half an hour later    it contained  9-6 grains  of sugar

 1875.]        Dr. F. W. Pavy on the Production of Glycosuria.               53
to the fluid ounce ; half an hour later still, 10-48 grains ; and again 40
minutes after this, 6'31 grains to the fluid ounce. At the completion of
the inhalation some blood was collected from the jugular vein, and found
to possess an intermediate colour between arterial and venous.          On ex
amination for sugar a strong reaction was obtainable ; and through ob
serving this, although no decided indication of the presence of sugar
existed in the urine at the time,     I was led to anticipate that it would be
found, as proved-to be the case, later on.
   In  the other successful experiment the inhalation was carried on in a
deep and active manner for half an hour without any irritation of the
air-passages being produced.       When discontinued, the urine was found
to contain a trace of sugar ; and half an hour later sugar was present to
the extent of 5-71 grains to the fluid ounce.
   From observation      I  have been led to believe that the issue in these
experiments     with  oxygen depends upon the manner in which the process
of respiration happens to be carried on.     I have frequently noticed that the
movements of the chest have been performed in a signally sluggish way. In
each of the experiments, on the other hand, where the production of glyco
suria occurred, the breathing was carried on in a strikingly deep and active
manner. It is known that the muscular operation of respiration is ordinarily
conducted with an inverse degree of activity to its effect upon the blood.
Through the accommodating relation existing, the more effective the oxy
genation of the blood, the less actively are the movements of respiration
performed ; and thus, although the animal may be supplied with oxygen
instead of air, it does not follow that any altered result should occur.
                         I                                   I
In illustration of this may state that upon one occasion placed a guinea-
pig in a sealed glass jar and kept a free current of purified oxygen passing
through for the space of seven hours, without producing the slightest per
ceptible effect either at the time or afterwards upon the animal.
   Some of my experiments with oxygen have been conducted upon frogs ;
and the plan adopted has been to place the animal in a glass jar sealed
at the bottom with water, and to pass a current of the gas continuously
through it for varying lengths of time. The urine is readily obtained by
pressure over the bladder; and by using a small test-tube the amount
collected from one animal may be quite sufficient for testing.        Many of
the experiments have been attended with a negative result ; but in some
a faint though     distinctly appreciable and in others a fairly strong reac
tion of sugar has been obtained. Three or four hours' time has sufficed
for this effect to be noticed.
   Finding that    I was dependent in the above mode of experimenting upon
the chance    manner,   as it seemed, in which the process of respiration was
carried on,   I determined to resort to the performance of artificial respira
tion for the purpose of removing the uncertainty that existed.             The
artificial -respiration apparatus which for many years past       I  have been
in the habit of using in my laboratory was constructed after my own

design, and consists of two bellows so arranged and adapted with vulcan
ized tubing connected with a canula for ligaturing into the trachea, that
in working the one inflates and the other exhausts the lungs.              Valves
are provided so as to determine this result ; and with these in good order
I  have found, in common with what has been noticed by others, that
respiration can be so effectively performed as to sufficiently          surcharge
the blood with oxygen to induce a state of apnoea.
    Now by means of the performance of artificial respiration with the
                                                   I
artificial-respiration apparatus referred to, have succeeded in producing
strongly saccharine urine, and this with the employment of atmospheric
air. In one experiment upon a dog, where the artificial respiration was
carried on for an hour, the urine, ten minutes after its cessation, gave a
strong reaction of sugar.         In another experiment with the artificial re
spiration   continued   an   hour   and twenty minutes, the urine, which was
collected ten minutes after its cessation, was also strongly charged with
sugar, and thirty five minutes later showed on analysis the presence of
 II  grains to the fluid ounce. In each case, for the sake of precision,
urine was collected and tested at the commencement of the experiment,
and found to be free from sugar.
    I am indebted to Dr. Lauder Brunton for directing my attention to a
recorded existence of the production of glycosuria by the performance of
artificial respiration.     Tieffenbach (Centralblatt fur die medieinischen
Wissenschaften, 1869, p. 181), in referring to the production of glycosuria
in curarized rabbits subjected to artificial respiration, says that he also
once obtained the same result without the previous poisoning.                This
seems to have been      a  mere passing observation, while my own experi
ments were elicited by a train of reasoning and without the knowledge
of any previously published result existing.          I am not disconcerted, how
ever, to find that    I have been thus anticipated ; for it is only with the
question of fact that     I feel concerned ; and it is a satisfaction to learn
that the result    I  have obtained is confirmed by the independent obser
vation of another.
                                                             I
    In the course of experimenting upon this subject, discovered that the
inhalation of the fumes of burning puff-ball (Lycoperdon giganteum) is
rapidly productive of strongly marked glycosuria ; and from certain phe
nomena which      I  observed,   I at first attributed the result to an imperfect
dearterialization of the blood.       I  noticed, for instance, when a dog was
brought under the anaesthetic influence of puff-ball smoke that there was
fulness and throbbing of the arteries, that the tongue became intensely red,
and that the veins underneath were in a turgid state and filled with red
instead of dark-coloured blood.        I  thought   I saw in these phenomena the
effects of a general vaso-motor paralysis, resulting in the blood being
allowed to flow through the capillaries without becoming properly de-
arterialized, in the same manner as it is known to do locally after section
of certain parts of the sympathetic.

                                      I
    Through Dr. Richardson, have since learnt that the active agent of
 puff-ball smoke was some time back shown, by Thornton Herepath and
 Snow, to consist of carbonic oxide, a gas which reddens blood in the
 same manner as oxygen, but which, unlike oxygen, is not easily displaced
 by the agency of other gases.   Now, Dr. Richardson having noticed*
 that the inhalation of carbonic oxide is followed by glycosuria, our
 respective observations coincide, and            I
                                         have no reason to doubt that the
 circumstances are otherwise than identical ; indeed a comparison of the
 effects of puff-ball smoke and carbonic oxide enables me to support the
 conclusion that the action of the former is dependent on the presence of
 the latter.  There is the same kind of anaesthesia, the same red state of the
 blood contained in the venous system, and the same rapid occurrence of
 strongly marked glycosuria.    No matter whether puff-ball smoke or arti
ficially procured carbonic oxide may be used, within ten minutes or a
quarter of an hour after the production of anaesthesia, sugar may be
recognizable to a notable extent in the urine ; and a little later have          I
upon some occasions found that my analyses have indicated the presence
of as much as upwards of 30 grains to the fluid ounce.
   Such is the result to which            I
                                  desire to direct attention ; and  will         I
proceed to explain in what way it appears to me to stand connected with
the subject under consideration.
     It is
        seen that a gas which produces the same physical effect on the
blood as oxygen likewise determines the production of glycosuria.      The
bright scarlet colour belonging to arterial blood is also the colour which
is given to blood by the presence of carbonic oxide ; and, furthermore, Dr.
Gramgee has shown that the spectral properties of the compound of
colouring-matter and carbonic oxide are identical with those of oxidized
blood.         There is this difference, however, noticeable, which seems to tell
in   astriking way in relation to glycosuria. The combination of colouring-
 matter and oxygen (oxy-haemoglobin) is so feebly maintained that a re
 ducing action is readily exerted by the influence of carbonic acid, and
 hence the facility with which oxidized is converted into deoxidized
blood. In the case of carbonic oxide, however, the gas is so much more
 strongly held, that it is not similarly susceptible of being readily displaced
by other gases.     As a result of its inhalation the blood becomes charged
with     it,
          and, by virtue of the property alluded to, retains       while traver
                                                                            it
sing   the  systemic capillaries.    In  consequence   of  this  retention       it   is
allowed to reach the liver, and there produce the effect which results in
glycosuria.     It    to the capacity of retention that
                        is                                     assume may be

ascribed the speedy occurrence of glycosuria which follows its inhalation             ;
and think
     I            may be surmised, seeing that oxygenated blood acts in
                   it                                                                 a

atmospheric air, would be the same, as far as the urine is concerned, as
that of carbonic oxide.          On account of the facility with which the
abstraction of oxygen is effected, we obtain our escape from being glyco-
siiric under the process of oxygen inhalation naturally carried on. The
capacity of abstraction, however, is not unlimited, and, as has been shown
in this communication, glycosuria may be induced by artificially surcharg
ing the blood with inhaled oxygen.
    As yet     I  have only assumed, without adducing any experimental
evidence upon the point, that the production of glycosuria by the inhala
tion of carbonic oxide is due to the direct action of the blood impregnated
with the gas upon the liver. It might be urged that the effect is attribu
table to hyperoemia of the liver, the hyperemia being brought about either
through the state of the arteries of the organ, or that of the chylo-poietic
vessels in general leading to increased pressure in the portal system.
An appeal to experiment        has afforded a decided answer to these sugges
tions.
    In  the first place  I ligatured the hepatic artery of an animal while
under     the effects of chloroform, and afterwards subjected it to the
influence of puff-ball smoke.        Before exposure to the inhalation of the
puff-ball    smoke, the urine  was ascertained   to be free from sugar. Twenty
minutes      after the cessation of the inhalation the urine contained 11J
 grains   of  sugar to the fluid ounce.    The hepatic artery being tied, direct
arterial hyperemia of the liver was out of the question as a cause
of the glycosuria.
    In the next place I directed my attention to the question of the possi
 bility of the effect being due to hyperemia of the liver occurring as a
 result of an increased activity of the circulation through the chylo-
 poietic viscera, and thence an increased flow of blood through the portal
 vein. It was difficult certainly to realize that any thing like the hypersemic
 state producible through the arterial system could be induced through
 the medium of the portal vein, looking at the position of the vessel with
 its delicate walled radicles and a capillary circulation behind. But how
 ever this might be,     I determined    to submit the point to experimental
 inquiry.
     If hyperemia of the liver from an increased afflux of portal blood con
 stituted the cause of the glycosuria, it ought to be averted on cutting off
 a considerable portion of the flow through the chylo-poietic viscera.
     In  one experiment    to accomplish    this  I tied  the superior mesenteric
 artery of a dog, while the animal was under the influence of chloroform,
 and half an hour afterwards caused it to inhale a mixture of carbonic
 oxide and air, in the proportion of one part of the former to nineteen of
 the latter.      Notwithstanding this extent of dilution it was found neces
 sary to allow the animal to breathe pure air from time to time, to prevent
 a fatal result occurring.      The inhalation was carried on in the manner
  stated for half an hour. Some urine was collected at the commencement,

 1875.]        Dr. F. W. Pavy     on the Production     of Glycosuria.          57
and found to give no reaction with the copper test, while that collected
at its termination was freely charged with sugar.          Urine was again col
lected half an hour later, and sufficient having been obtained for a
quantitative analysis, sugar was found to be present to the extent of 20
grains to the fluid ounce.
                                                                I
   In another experiment, conducted in a similar manner, tied the cceliac
axis and obtained a similar result.       The urine collected a quarter of an
                                                                              '
hour after the process of inhalation was highly charged with sugar.
    In  each  of the above experiments the perfect deligation of the arteries
was verified by dissection after death ; and with the amount of blood
allowed to reach the portal vein so diminished, the liver must have re
ceived very much less than its ordinary supply.       I consider the conclusion
to be warranted that it is by virtue of its presence in the blood (and
probably     through   the combination    which  possesses   the same physical
properties    as oxy-b.£emoglobin) that carbonic oxide determines the escape
of sugar from the liver and thence the production of glycosuria.
   The fundamental point of physiological interest brought forward in
this communication is that the passage of oxygenated blood through the
liver excites the transformation of its amyloid substance into sugar.
Although     I  abstain at present from committing myself to any settled
conclusion regarding the precise modus operandi, yet the evidence before
me leads me to think that the effect is due to the action of the oxidized
blood as a ferment, and not to the direct influence of oxygen ; and under
this view the inhalation of carbonic oxide may lead to the result observed,
by the compound with haemoglobin, which possesses corresponding phy
sical properties to oxy-hsemoglobin, acting in a similar way.      I am inclined
also to think that the production of sugar is only one part of the event
occurring.
    It is a noteworthy fact that in the puff-ball and carbonic oxide ex
periments there was a strikingly rapid disappearance of amyloid substance
from the liver. Under ordinary circumstances the decoction of the liver
is milky, from the presence of amyloid substance, but under the conditions
referred to the decoction was found nearly or quite clear.          Even in the
space of about an hour       I have in some instances observed the decoction
yielded   to  possess no  sign of milkiness ; and there was other evidence to
show that the amyloid substance had disappeared.
    On giving attention to the position where amyloid         substance is dis
coverable, it appears to be especially where a limited amount of oxygen
exists that it is present.     There is no organ in the body supplied with
venous blood like the liver, and in correspondence there is no structure
which is charged to a similar extent with amyloid substance. During the
first portion of intra-uterine life the liver is free from amyloid substance,
while the liquor amnii and the fluid of the allantois contain sugar. May
this not arise from the oxygenated blood of the umbilical vein causing
the amyloid substance, which might otherwise accumulate in the liver,

to pass into sugar, and thence determine a saccharine condition of these
liquids ? At a later period of f cetal life the liver becomes charged with
amyloid substance, and sugar is no longer discoverable in the liquids
named.   But now the chylo-poietic viscera have attained considerable
development, and would send venous blood through the portal vein to the
liver. It is a specially notable fact, in relation to this point, that the
liver and chylo-poietic viscera do not correspond in their state of develop
ment at different periods of foetal life.   If they did there would be no
alteration in the relative supply of portal and umbilical blood to the
former as time advanced. The liver, on the contrary, at an early stage is
vastly out of proportion in size to even every other part of the organism.
In the human foetus, at the third or fourth week of embryonic life, it
is said to constitute one half of the weight of the whole body*. At the
commencement, then, the chief supply of blood to the liver must be from
the umbilical vein. Subsequently, as the developmental relation becomes
altered and the chylo-poietic viscera attain significant dimensions, the
supply of venous blood must correspondingly increase. This may be ac
cepted as a necessary deduction without reference to the precise anato
mical disposal of the umbilical vein in relation to the liver. Under the
view propounded, what before stood as an incomprehensible                    phenomenon
becomes         susceptible of rational explanation.
   While the presence of amyloid substance is confined, or almost en
tirely confined, in the adult to the liver, it is known to have a somewhat
wide extent of distribution amongst foetal structures.    Now in harmony
with this the tissues of the foetus, unlike those of the adult, are supplied
with a mixture of venous and arterial blood.
    The lungs and muscles are found to represent two structures besides the
liver in which amyloid substance has been encountered in the adult; but
examination shows that when it happens to be here physiologically recogni
zable it is only so to a comparatively inconsiderable extent, and this under
circumstances involving a reduced supply of arterial blood. For instance,
it is especially in muscles that have been kept in a state of rest, and in those
of the hybernating animal during hybernation, that the substance has
been noticed         to be discoverable, and            it has been observed to disappear
under a state of activity.    The lung-tissue during hybernation                 has been
found to yield        it,
                  but fails to do so when activity   resumed.        is

   Dr. Michael Foster     has shown that amyloid substance exists largely   in
the bodies    of certain Entozoa, as, for instance, the round worm and the
tapeworm.       Again we have a condition which harmonizes with the other
conditions under which its accumulation is observed to take place ; for
situated as these animals are in the intestinal canal, their position is one
which is peculiarly restrictive of a supply of oxygen.      My own observa
tions have revealed its extensive existence in the mantle of the mussel,
and Bernard has recognized it in the larv» of flies.       These instances, if
not specially illustrative of the point under consideration, nevertheless
appear to me to stand in conformity with the previous evidence.
   Looking at all the considerations which have been here brought
            I
forward, think we may generalize and say that the amyloid substance
is a body which tends to accumulate in certain animal structures under
the existence of a limited supply of oxygen, and that it is in consequence
of the liver exceptionally receiving the supply of venous blood it does, that
the special condition belonging to it is attributable.  I have shown that the
undue transmission of oxygenated blood to the organ at once induces
an altered state, which is rendered evident by the production of glycosuria.
   I consider    that another link  has been added to the chain   of evidence
against the glycogenic theory, which      I  have never wavered in regarding
as untenable since the communication         of my former researches to the
Royal Society.

    Introduction.  — The author having undertaken the examination of the
 Deep-sea Corals dredged during the voyage of H.M.S. ' Challenger,' was
 led to the study of the structure of corals generally, and especially to the
examination of the Milleporiche, which seemed of peculiar interest, since
they had been determined by Professor Agassiz to be Hydroids, and had
been regarded by him as living representatives of the Palaeozoic Rugosa.
 Millepora alcicornis was obtained and examined at Bermuda, and another
species of Millepora at Zamboangan, Mindanas, Philippine Islands. The
examination      of these Millepores was found to be beset with great    diffi

which it is hoped will be obtained at the Sandwich Islands. At Zamboan-
gan, Heliopora ccerulca was obtained, and found at once to be an Alcyona-
rian.     Its structure is described in full in the paper. Another Alcyona-
rian of the genus Sarcophyton (Lesson) was examined for purpose of
comparison. It proved to present special features of interest, and a gene
ral description of its anatomy also is therefore given. Notes are further
appended on the anatomy of a species of Pocillopora obtained at Zam-
boangan, and that of a Stylasteracean dredged off the Meangis Islands
in 500 fathoms.
    Literature of the Subject. — Few original works relating to the subjects
                                                                        '
treated of in this paper were available for reference on board the Chal
lenger.'     A review of what has been able to be gathered of the recent
literature relating to the Tabulate and Eugose Corals and the Alcyona-
rians is given, and also a history of the various systematic arrangements
to which the Tabulata and Bugosa have been subjected.
    Professor Agassiz published his opinion as to the hydroid affinities of
the MilleporidsB in 1859 (" Les Animaux des Millepores sont des Aea-
lephes et non des Polypes," Bibl. Univ. de Geneve, Arch . des Sci., Mai 1 859) ,
and figured the animals of the Millepora alcicornis in his ' Contribution
to the Natural History of the United States,' vol. iii. plate 15. Pourtales
observed the animals in company with Agassiz.          He says that one which
he saw was      " shorter than they are represented to be in the figure, and
had five tentacular masses rather than tentacles." M. -Edwards considered
Professor Agassiz's evidence as to the hydroid nature of Millepora insuffi
cient, as does also Professor AUman.
    Professors Claus, Pourtales, Verrill, and many other authors accept
Agassiz's conclusion with regard to the Milleporidae, but do not accept bis
views with regard to the Bugosa.
    Professor Verrill (SUliman's American Journal, 1872, vol. iii. pp. 187,
194) found that Pocillopora, a genus with extremely well-marked tabulse,
was a true Hexactinian, and showed that the presence of tabulse, the cha
racter relied on by Professor Agassiz, was of little importance.          Pour
tales and L. Ludwig have come to the conclusion that the tetrameral
arrangement in the Bugosa is merely apparent, and that the original
arrangement in the young coral was hexameral.          Professor Martin Dun
can   arrived  at similar conclusions from the examination of Quynia annulata.
Kunth, however, still adheres to the tetrameral primary division. Lind-
strom, the first discoverer of the opercular apparatus of certain Bugosa,
compares these structures with skeletal structures of Prinmoa.              The
latest paper on the classification of Corals is by M. Dollfus (Comptes
Bendus de l'Acad. des Sciences, t. lxxx. no. 10, 8 Mars 1875, pp. 681-
683). M. Dollfus connects together the genera Helwlites and Propora with
Heliopora     and Seriatopora by means of Pocillopora,    considering all these

 he considers to be a Bryozoon.
    Methods employed. — The corals examined were hardened in alcohol or
 chromic acid, decalcified, and cut into fine vertical and horizontal sections.
 Sections   of the hard parts were rubbed down in the usual manner.
  Portions of Heliopora ccerulea were also examined in the fresh state.
     On the Structure of Heliopora cterulea. — Heliopora ccerulea was found
  growing in abundance on reefs near Zamboangan at low tide.                        The
  polyps were never seen expanded, though pieces of the coral were care
 fully transferred to a glass vessel without being removed from the water.
 The living coral is perforated in all directions by a parasitic Annelid
 (Leucodora).     The corallum of Heliopora is remarkable for the tubular
 character of its coenenchym, which consists of a series of tubes arranged
 side by side at right angles to the surface of the coral, open above but
                                                             "
 closed below by successive transverse partitions or tabula." The caHcles
 are tubes essentially similar to the tubes of the coenenchym, but larger.
 They are said by M.-Edwards to have twelve septa appearing as plications
 of the wall of their cavities. The number is, however, very variable.
 The tabulae of the calicle are exactly similar in structure to those of the
 coenenchym.      The hard tissue is composed of doubly refracting calcareous
 matter, which has a half -crystalline, half-fibrous structure.               It is dis
 posed in a series of systems vertically to the surface of the corallum, the
 axes of which systems lie in the interspaces between the ccenenchymal
 tubes.    In each system the fibres of hard tissue are disposed radially
 around the central vertical axes, and at the same time with an upward
 inclination at an equal angle all around.
    The colony of Heliopora is developed entirely by budding.                      In s
 growing point of the corallum the ccenenchymal tubes are widely open
and polygonal in outline.         New calicles are formed by the junction of a
number of tubes around a central tube or tubes arrested in growth
which form a base. The outer walls only of the surrounding tubes con
tinue to grow and form the lateral wall of the calicle. The newly
formed calicle thus has tubular prolongations at its base, and the so-
called septa are, in the main, due to the circumstance that the wall is
composed of a series of fused curved outer walls of tubes.                   The calca
reous matter is deposited in a finely fibrous calciferous tissue, connected
apparently with the formation of which is a layer of connective tissue
which everywhere covers the hard parts.
    There is no trace of the corallum of Heliopora being composed of fused
spicules as in the case of Corallium and Tubipora *.
   * The fact that the corallum is so formed in Tuhipora seems to have been hitherto
unknown (Claus, ' Grundziige der Zoologie,' 3e Aufl. p. 204). It is plainly shown at the
mouth of any growing tube in spirit specimens.       Professor Wyville Thomson drew
my attention to the fact, an account of which he thinks has been published by Pro
fessor Perceval Wright in the ' Annals and Magazine of Natural History.'

 62                        Mr. H. N. Moseley           on the            [Nov. 25,
    The deep blue colouring of the corallum of Heliopora is due to an
 amorphous colouring-matter insoluble in strong hydrochloric acid, but
 soluble in acidified alcohol.     It forms an intensely blue solution of a sul
 phate of copper colour, which transmits            the blue and part of the green
 only of the spectrum.
    In the soft tissues of Heliopora an ectoderm, entoderm, and mesoderm
 are to be distinguished.      The ectoderm is composed of club-shaped cells ;
 it has the usual disposition.        Small oval nematocysts are present in it
 and in the upper part of the mesodermic layer beneath.             The mesoderm
 consists of   three  histological   elements,     homogeneous connective tissue,
 layers of    connective-tissue    cells, and finely fibrous calciferous tissue.
 Prolongations    of the  two  former    form sacs lining the ccenenchymal tubes
 and calicles.    The sacs are further lined by the entoderm, which consists
 of spherical cells containing yellow pigment, as in other Alcyonarians.
 Only a surface-layer in Heliopora is living. Hardly any soft tissue is to
 be found in the tubes beneath the last-formed tabula.             The sacs lining
 the tubes do not communicate anywhere directly with the exterior, but
 are connected with one another above, and with the calicular cavities,
 by wide transverse canals.         The superficial tissues are permeated by
 smaller canals.     The polyps of Heliopora have eight mesenteries and
 eight lobed   tentacles.   In the contracted state of the polyp the tentacles
 are completely introverted, and rest in the inter-mesenterial               spaces.
 The stomach is like that of any other Alcyonarian. Retractor muscles are
 present, which are disposed with regard to the mesenterial plates as in
 Pennatulids, showing a " Dorsalfach
                                              " and "
                                                        Ventralfach." No definite
protractor muscles were observed to be present. No regular arrangement
of the eight mesenteries with regard to the twelve so-called septa could
be found.      Eight mesenterial filaments are present, two of which appear
to be longer than the others.          In three individuals only of the single
colony   examined    were   ova  found    — in one four ova, in the others only
one. The ova are attached to the mesenteries.                 The four ova were
attached to four separate mesenteries.             No male elements were found.
The colonies are probably unisexual.            The arrangement of the polyps in
                            irregular               " Dorsalfach " seems
the colony   is  somewhat               ; but  the                        always to
be uppermost in the vertical plates of which the coral consists, the polyps
being thus placed back to back.
    On the Structure of Sarcophyton,       sp. — An Alcyonarian was obtained at
the Admiralty Islands which agrees in every respect with Lesson's genus
Sarcophyton (M.-Edwards, Hist. Nat. des Corall. t. i. p. 22).              A genus
called Sarcophyton is, however, cited by Claus as having been formed by
Sars.   The Alcyonarian is mushroom-shaped.               Two kinds of individuals,
zooids and polyps, compose the colony ; the stem is composed of large
tubes (" sinus"), the prolongations of polyp-cavities.         The polyps offer no
marked peculiarities ; their retractor and protractor muscles are arranged
as in Pennatulids with regard to the mesenteries.              They have two me

 1875.]           Structure and Relations        of certain Corals.             C3
 senterial filaments      longer than the rest.      The zooids have eight short
mesenteries, four of which, the        " dorsal
                                                 "
                                                   and " ventral," are deeper than
the rest.     They have two mesenterial filaments, the dorsal only. They
have no tubercles and no generative organs.           They have a simple globular
stomach, communicating          by a short tube with the exterior, and lined with
long cilia.     A   sarcosome of transparent homogeneous connective-tissue,
 containing    small ramified nucleate corpuscles, connects the polyp- and
 zooid-cavities    ; these cavities are connected by vertical and horizontal
 systems of canals.         The vertical canals are continuous with the bottoms
 of the zooid-cavities ; they form networks of canals in the sarcosome.
The sarcosome contains elongate tuberculate spicules of the usual form,
which are largest and most thickly set in the stem of the Sareophyton.
Smaller spicules are present in the tentacles of the polyps.           The spicules
show a special sheath of transparent tissue, in which structure was not
seen. The " Dorsalfacher of the polyps and zooids have a general direc
                                  "
tion towards the central axis of the stem and centre of the pileus ; but both
polyps and zooids are often more or less twisted on their axes.
    On the Structure of Millepora. — The examination of Millepora is beset
with serious difficulties ; the present notes are merely preliminary. The
calcareous coenenchymal tissue of Millepora differs extremely from that
of Heliopora in being reticulate, not tubular : in histological structure
it is similar to Heliopora.         The coral has only a thin superficial layer of
soft living tissue, composed of a network of canals filled with cells re
sembling those of the canals of Alcyonarians, and covered externally with
nematocysts.         Two kinds of nematocysts, small and large, are present :
the small ones are confined to the tentacles.             Two kinds of polyps are
present, large and small.           Tentacles are present in both kinds ; they
appear    to  be four    in  number  and compound.       They are simply retracted
by means of muscular fibres, which are arranged round the base of the
cylindrical stomach radially, but, as far as has yet been seen, without any
disposition in definite groups.         No mesenteries have been seen.
     On the Structure of Pocillopora (P. acuta). — The corallum is very
dense and composed of definite prisms of calcareous matter, which show a
transverse banding, somewhat like that of striped muscular fibres.              The
 polyps have twelve tentacles, six large and six small, and twelve mesen
 teries with long mesenterial filaments coiled up.            A very thin layer of
 living tissue covers the corallum ; it is devoid of canals.
     On the Structure of Stylaster. — A Stylaster dredged in 500 fathoms was
 found to have the tentacles disposed between the calcareous septa, as was
 shown to be the case        in AUopora oeulina by Sars (Forh. Selsk. Chr. 1872,
 p. 115).      The   septa are twenty-two in number, and the tentacles also
 twenty -two. The stomach has a conical projecting mouth or proboscis,
 as seen by Sars in Allopora oeulina.           It has apparently no inferior out
 let. There are no well-defined mesenteries, and no mesenterial filaments.
 A very open network of soft tissue surrounds the stomach and tube

   64                        Mr. H. N. Moseley           on the               [Nov. 25,
  leading to it from the circle of the tentacles.            Suspended in this reticu
  late tissue are the testes, large sacs filled with spermatic cells disposed
  sometimes in one, sometimes in two vertical rows ; they occupy the
  interior of the ampullae. These corals are dioecious.           Cryptohdia resembles
  Stylaster most closely    in structure, and is also dioecious.
       Vegetable Parasites. — The corallum of both Millepora and Pocillopora
  is permeated by fine ramified canals, formed by parasitic vegetable organ
  isms of the same nature as those described by Dr. Carpenter and Professor
  Kolliker as occurring in the shells of mollusks &c.                   The organisms
  were found in abundant fructification ; they are green, but otherwise
 appear to be fungi, as are the parasites of shells &c.               Similar parasites
 are to be found in various coralla from widely distant parts of the world.
                                      Conclusions.
      Heliopora  is most undoubtedly        an Alcyonarian.         The number of its
 mesenteries, and the distribution with regard               to them of the retractor
 muscles, the form and number of its tentacles, are decisive evidence in
 the matter ; and this evidence is borne out by almost every item of histo
 logical structure.     In the peculiar manner in which the retraction of the
 tentacles takes place, viz. by introversion, Heliopora seems to differ from
 all other Alcyonarians except Corallium*.                 From both Corallium and
 Tubipora, Heliopora differs in that the hard tissue of its corallum shows
 no signs of being composed of fused spicules, but in its histological struc
 ture most closely resembles Zoantharian Corals.                "With the Milleporidae
 and with the Pocilloporidse and Seriatoporidae Heliopora is allied solely
 on account of its possession of tabulae.              Now that an Alcyonarian is
 added to the list of various Anthozoa possessing these peculiar structures,
 their presence becomes of less classif actory importance even than Professor
 Verrill proved it to    be.     There can hardly be a doubt that Seriatopora
 will prove to be, like Pocillopora, a Zoantharian ; and Millepora is certainly
 very different in structure from Heliopora.             Heliopora thus stands quite
 alone amongst modern forms ; and in the peculiar structure of its cellular
ccenenchym it is so remarkable that it is unlikely that on examination of
the soft parts of other corals, at present known from their coralla only,
any near relatives of it will be discovered. Amongst extinct forms, how
ever, Heliopora has several close allies, and the genus itself existed in the
Cretaceous period.       The genus Polytremacis differs apparently only in the
more perfect development of the so-called septa, which reach to the
centres of the tabulae.        The genus occurs in the Chalk, Greensand, and
in Eocene formations.         Heliopora has, further, a very closely allied pa'aeo-
zoic representative in Heliolites, in which the ccenenchymal tubes are pro
vided with very closely placed tabulae.

   The    three genera Heliopora,          Polytremacis, and Heliolites differ from
one another      to   so   slight   a degree that  they are placed under the one
genus Heliopora  by Quenstedt.    To            include these three genera, a new
family of Alcyonarians must be formed, for which the term Helioporidaa
appears most suitable, which family may from the recent species be thus
characterized    :   —
                                    Family Heliopoeid^e.
    A compact corallum present, composed of a fibre-crystalline calcareous
tissue as in Madreporaria. Corallum consisting of an abundant tubular
ccenenchym, and with calicles having an irregular number of lateral
ridges resembling septa.   Calicles and ccenenchymal tubes closed below
by a succession of transverse partitions. Polyps completely retractile,
with tentacles when in retraction introverted. Mouths of the sacs lining
the ccenenchymal tubes closed with a layer of soft tissue, but communi
cating with one another and with the calicular cavities by a system of
transverse canals.
    The structure of the ccenenchym of the Helioporidae is entirely unique
amongst Anthozoa ; no other form has a ccenenchym composed thus of
a series of long tubes packed side by side, and lying parallel to the
calicular tubes and at right angles to the surface.      It is to be remarked
that the tubes are like the calicles in being open above, that they have
walls composed in exactly the same manner as those of the calicles, and
that they are closed below at intervals in the same way by exactly similar
tabulae. Further, the soft tissues lining the cavities of the ccenenchymal
tubes are identical in structure with those lining the calicular cavities,
and the same transverse system of canals connects the summits of the
tubes with one another and with the summits of the calicular cavities.
    It seems by no means improbable that the ccenenchym here is com
posed of the tubes of absorbed polyps or zooids which have lost the
rudimentary organs, which they still possess in such a form as Sarcophy-
ton, and have become mere tubular cavities, whose openings to the ex
terior even have been obliterated; it seems impossible otherwise to
account for the presence of the successions of tabula) in the ccenenchymal
tubes.    The foregoing considerations are suggested by the circumstance
that a series of fossil corals, grouped by M.-Edwards under the Tabulata,
appear most probably to have been Alcyonarians as well as Heliopora.
   The genus Chcetetes was considered by Keyserling to have belonged to
 the Alcyonarians, because of the absence of septa in           it,
                                                             and the mode in

Zoantharians,    because of its close resemblance to the Favositidae, in

                                          is

ever, must now be considered           character of less importance than

      66                        Mr. H. N. Moseley         on the              [Nov. 25,
      number, with the membranous mesenteries. In Stylaster and Cryptohelia,
      the calcareous septa are obviously formed as infoldings of the margin of
      the calicles.     Here the septa are between, instead of opposite to the
      tentacles  ; and membranous mesenteries appear to be absent, or at all
     events rudimentary only.         In the Favositid® the septa seem to have been
     no more perfect than they are in Heliopora, and to have been most
     variable in number, but often twelve, as also in Heliopora.            M.-Edwards
     describes from 10 to 12 septa in Favosites gothlandica.              In Miehelinia
    favosa 30 to 40 subequal septal stria are to be made out at the upper
     margin of the wall of the calicle.        I  cannot refer to specimens ; but it
     seems not unlikely that the s?pta in the Favositidae were pseudo-septa as
    in Heliopora, and that these coralla were formed by Alcyonarians, the per
    forations    in the walls having transmitted transverse canals like those of
    Heliopora&ndSarcophyton,a.nd the corolla being free of tabular cceneuchym,
    because none of the polyps were aborted as in Heliopora.              Some Favosi-
   tida? seem to have formed         a compound     colony, consisting of polyps and
   zooids, as Favosites Forbesii, where a few large cells are seen set amongst
    numerous surrounding small ones.             Heliolites seems to a certain extent
    to form a transition stage between a condition such as that in Favosites
    Forbesii and the condition in Heliopora ; for in Heliolites, the more ancient
   form, the coenenchymal tubes are regularly hexagonal, and apparently
   much more nearly equal in breadth to the calicles than in Heliopora.             In
   the growing points of Heliopora the hard parts are made up of a series
   of open, often hexagonal tubes, and resemble             Favosites in their surface
  aspect.       In   Heliopora   the transverse   canals   pass  over notches in the
  summits of the walls of the coenenchymal tubes and calicles, in order to
  place these cavities in communication with one another. In Favosites the
  calcareous tissue surrounded         the transverse canals, and the perforations
  in the walls of the calicles were thus produced.
       If Favosites was an Alcyonarian, Chaetetes was of course also of that
  group.      The genus Alveolites amongst the Favositidas is peculiar for the
  possession of three tooth-like prominences as the only representatives
  of septa. One tooth, well developed, is situate inside the calicle ; on
  that side of each calicle which lies externally in the colony, and opposed
 to this on the tip of the calicle next the interior of the colony, are a
 pair of rudimentary teeth.            This arrangement reminds us at once of
 the distinction       of dorsal   and  ventral mesenterial interspaces in Alcyo
 narians, and the direction of all the " Dorsalfacher" in Sarcophyton and
 Heliopora towards the central axis of the colony.              In Alveolites the two
                                          "
 teeth seem to correspond to the Dorsalfach," and the single one to the
 " Ventralfach," the two teeth having occupied the space devoid of retractor
muscles.        Ktilliker describes a series of teeth as existing at the margin
of the calicle in Renilla, which follow a constant law in their relation
to the septa. When only one tooth is present it is opposite the " Dorsal
                                                "
fach ;" when three, one is opposite the Dorsalfach," and the two others

1875.]            Structure and Relations         of certain Corals.              67
opposite the lateral "Ventralfach." In Alveolites the one tooth is ventral
instead of dorsal.         In Syringopora the septa seem to be very much of
the same nature as in Heliopora ¦ and in Heliopora, as already described,
the tabulae are not merely transverse floors, but the bottoms of cups of
hard tissue fitted inside the older tubes and calicles. In Syringopora,
this condition of the tabulae is much more marked, and the coralluin
appears as if formed of a series of calicles fitted one within another.
     A difficulty appears to arise from the peculiar mode of the develop
ment of the calicles by budding in Heliopora, the foldings of the walls
of the calicles being due, to a considerable extent at least, to the forma
tion of these walls from a circle of ccenenchymal tubes.              The septa are,
however,      not  entirely   formed   in this  way.     It  would of  course be of
great interest to see whether the primitive calicle, in the developing
 Heliopora colony, forms calcareous septa.
     Heliopora having so commonly twelve septa, and in conjunction with
 these eight mesenteries, it was at first thought that here some key
 would be found to the elucidation of the question of the relations of the
 tetrameral     corals to the Hexactinians ; but no definite arrangement of
 the eight mesenteries to the twelve septa could be discovered.              Ludwig
 and Pourtales have concluded that the tetrameral condition in the
 Bugosa is the result of a modification of an originally hexameral arrange
 ment — that the Bugosa are, in fact, modifications of the Hexactinian type.
 Kunth, however, using similar methods, has come to an opposite con
 clusion.      Now that it is known that an Alcyonarian exists which con
 structs a solid calcareous corallum, in histological structure scarcely, if
 at all, to be distinguished from that of many Madreporaria, and that
 this Alcyonarian also possesses marked calcareous septa, which septa
 show, notwithstanding the octameral arrangement of the mesenteries, a
  hexameral disposition in being often twelve in number, it seems that
 the question of the affinities of the Bugosa may fairly be reopened. The
 presence of well-marked           calcareous septa in Cryptohelia and other
  Stylasteridae (which septa are equal to the tentacles in number, but
 nevertheless to be regarded, like those of Heliopora, as pseudo-septa)
  is significant.   The marked tetrameral arrangement of the septa in Bugosa,
  and   the  presence in many forms of tabular, are certainly characters not
  opposed to the alliance of these corals with the Alcyonarians ; and the fact
  that paired series of opercula occur in certain Bugosa, which are com
  pared by Lindstrom, their discoverer, to the skeletal structures of certain
  Primnoat, seems to be evidence in favour of such an alliance of the very
  strongest kind.       In no Madreporaria do paired hard structures, at all re
  sembling those     of  Primnoa or of Qoniophyllum pyramidale, occur.           The
 opercular     structures    in  the  coralla  of  Cryptohelia   and  Lepidopora can
 scarcely be regarded        as  comparable    with  the  opercula of  Bugosa.   The
 structures are merely folds of the lip of the calicle, and are continuous
with it and immovable, not movable separate articulate structures.             Many
                                                                        f2

 dopora, and Errina.   The peculiarities in the structure of the soft parts,
 and the relations of the tentacles to the septa, described in this paper
 as occurring in a Stylaster and a Cryptohelia, and the similar facts
 observed by Sars in the genus Allopora, strengthen the facts brought
forward by Pourtales, with regard to the coralla, in a very potent man
ner.      I
         hope to make a close study of the structure of Stylaster.     The
apparent  absence of  mesenteries is most remarkable,  and   a similar con
dition appears to occur also in Millepora.      The number of tentacles
and septa in the Stylasteridae seems hardly to follow the usual hexameral
law.   In the species of Stylaster examined by me there are invariably
twenty-two septa and twenty-two tentacles.         In Stylaster erubescens,
Pourtales describes the septa as being in number from nine to twelve,
most frequently eleven. In Allopora miniata the septa are from seven to
ten, generally eight. Gryptohelia has commonly sixteen.
   With regard to the affinities of the Milleporida), no certain conclusion
can be arrived at from the few facts yet ascertained.        hope to obtain I
specimens at Hawaii in sexually mature condition.

     Since the above was written                I have   been   able to refer at   Honolulu to
Prof. Lacaze-Duthiers's              '
                                         Histoire ISaturelle du Corail.'        I therefore   add
a few notes.
   In Corallium  the contracted polyp presents externally at the surface
eight lobes coloured red. "When the polyp is expanded, these lobes form
a coloured cup with eight dentations at its margin, which surrounds the
lower part of the expanded colourless polyp (see pi. 2 of Prof. Lacaze-
Duthiers's work). The eight lobes described as closing the mouth of the
calicle in the contracted polyp of Heliopora probably occupy a similar
position, and have a similar appearance in the expanded condition of the
polyp.
     In           the pinnae or barbules of the tentacles are all severally

this appears  not   to be the case.   In the hard  tissue of Corallium, boring
vegetable parasites occur, as observed in Millepora and Pocillopora,
I    have further been able to refer to Dana's great work on Corals in
the splendid collection of scientific works in the Government Library at
Honolulu, and to other works relating to Heliopora.
  Dana states (U.S. Expl. Exped. vol. vii. Zoophytes, J. D. Dana, Philad.
1846, p. 539) that the blue colour of Heliopora     of animal origin and
                                                                    is
appears indistinguishable from the genus Crypiohelia of the same authors.  Endohelia
is founded on a Japanese species. The 'Challenger' dredged a coral certainly not dig*

was not analyzed by Mr. Gilliman.
    In the Atlas of the ' Voyage de l'Astrolabe,' Zoophytes, pi. 20. figs. 12,
13, 14, the expanded polyps of Heliopora ccemdea are figured by MM.
Hombron and Jacquinot. In fig. 14 sixteen very short, simple, conical
 tentacles are shown, in fig. 13 only fifteen tentacles.         The figures are
 evidently very erroneous.       The corresponding description       I  have been
 unable to refer to, the volume containing it being wanting in the Hawaiian
 Government copy.
    In  the Zoology of the ' Voyage de l'Uranie,' Quoy and Gaimard, Paris,
  1824, p. 656, is a description of the polyps of Heliopora (Pocillopora)
 casrulea.
    The expanded polyps have radiated tentacles, and are said to entirely
 hide the corallum when they are in an expanded condition. Experiments
  proved that communication between the animals is somewhat imperfect,
 since a stimulus applied to any part of the colony caused only the polyps
 in that immediate neighbourhood to retract themselves.

 but without any representation of the polyps.

    The President then addressed the Society     as  follows  : —
      Gentlemen,
The year that     has elapsed since our last Anniversary has been a me
morable one     under  both pleasurable and painful aspects: on the one
hand we have lost by death a greater number of and more illustrious
Fellows than during any year within our recollection ; on the other, our
 Bphere of activity has been enlarged in various directions, so that, if it
has been the saddest, it has been also the most busy year known to any
of us.
    Our losses, numbering no less than thirty-two, include two most
 eminent geologists, Sir Charles Lyell and Sir William Logan; two
 physicists in the foremost rank, Sir Charles Wheatstone and the Rev.
 Prof. Willis ; the most learned pharmacist of his day, Mr. D. Hanbury ; a
 zoologist of great repute and long career of astonishing activity, Dr. J. E.
 Gray ; together with three men of great eminence in letters, and one for
 public services, The Right Honourable Sir Edward Ryan, The Very
 Reverend Dean Hook, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson, and Admiral Sherard
 Osborn.     On the foreign list   I  have to record the names of two great
 astronomers in Friedrich W. A. Argelander, of Bonn, and Heinrich
 Schwabe, of Dessau, and a distinguished geologist, Jean Baptiste J.
 D'Omalius d'Halloy, of Brussels.
    For evidences of our activity,  I  must refer to our publications and to
 the number of papers read at our Meetings ; to the labours of the
 Committees that have been employed on duties in connexion with Expedi
 tions, all more or less under the authority of Her Majesty's Govern
 ment, as the " Polar," the - Total Solar Eclipse," and the " Transit-of-
         "
 Venus Expeditions, or in duties such as appertain more directly to the
 business of the Society.
    On the recommendation of the Soiree Committee, in addition to the
 annual Conversazione, two very successful Evening Receptions of a less
 public character, to which the invitations were of necessity very limited,
 were held in our Library.    Their repetition during the present session will
 no doubt be considered     by the Committee,       and   if thought  desirable,
 will  be recommended    to the Council, who will, 1 am sure, heartily co
 operate with the Officers in any plan for promoting scientific reunions
 appreciated by the Fellows.

   1875.]                       Presidefit's Address.                            73
      The Library Committee has had under consideration the mode of
                        '
   publication of our Transactions,' so as to afford to specialists and the
  public the opportunity of obtaining copies of separate papers at the lowest
  cost. The result is a recommendation, adopted by the Council, that a
  certain number of copies of every paper — the paging as in the Transac
  tions being retained — shall be placed with the publishers, Messrs. Triibner
  and Co., for separate sale, without prejudice to the usual grant of free
  copies to the authors.      It has also been determined that the Parts of
  the Philosophical Transactions shall be published, with cut edges, in cloth
  boards, at no additional cost to the Fellows.
     The Catalogue of Scientific Papers for the decade 1864 to 1873 inclu
  sive is so near completion, that it will be ready for the printer in a few
  months.     It comprises at present ninety-five thousand titles, and will
 probably occupy two volumes, of the same dimensions as those already
 published.     As you are aware, the whole expense of preparing the Cata
 logue was borne by the Society, and the printing of the six volumes
 was undertaken by the Treasury, at the instance of Lord Palmerston
 and Mr. Gladstone.         An application will be made to Her Majesty's
 Government      for the means of printing the decade now all but ready ;
                                                                     I
 it will cost proportionally less than the former series, and cannot but
 believe that the means for so important an undertaking will, as before,
 be granted.
     The second volume of Dr. Klein's work           •
                                                       On the Anatomy of the
 Lymphatic System'        has been published, and one hundred copies have
 been distributed   by  the  Council. The cost of the illustrations of this and
 the former     volume was defrayed out of the fund of the Government
 Grant.
    Tou will observe in the Treasurer's printed balance-sheet that a larger
sum than heretofore is now paid for insurance against fire.            In entering
into occupation of our new house, your Council resolved on fully pro
tecting the Society (so far as is possible by insurance), and an efficient
valuation of our property was made, the Library, containing more than
thirty-eight thousand books, being taken at £18,000, and the Portraits
and Busts at .£4000.
    Notice has been received from the Society's Solicitors that the portion
of the Dircks' Estate to which we are entitled — has at last been set free,
and that the amount (about £1000) will shortly be paid to our Trea
surer.
    The Handley Bequest is,      I regret to say, still sub judice in Chancery.
    A portion of the Society's land at Acton, comprising 145 square yards,
required for the site of a Parsonage, has been sold to the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners for a sum of £350.
    Tou have learned, with mingled feelings of regret and of satisfaction,
that our late most eminent Fellow, Sir Charles Wheatstone, has, with that
devotion to science and to the Society that distinguished           his long and

   74                         Anniversary    Meeting.                [Nov. 30,
  intimate connexion     with us, bequeathed    a sum of £500 in augmentation
  of the Donation Fund.
      The  Election Statutes. — At our Anniversary of last year the attention
  of the Meeting was called by Dr. Williams to the present limitation
  in the election of ordinary Fellows ; and though no action was taken
  at the time, the subject appeared to me to be one so deeply affecting
  the interests of the Society, that    I did not hesitate to take the earliest
  opportunity of submitting it to the deliberations of the Council.        This
  resulted in the appointment of a Committee to consider the whole ques
  tion of the " Election Statutes."
     In the mean time Dr. Williams addressed to myself a letter embody
  ing his views on the subject, which, having been printed and circulated
  throughout the Society, requires my acknowledgment from this Chair,
  and is entitled to the most full and careful consideration.        Therefore,
  while disclaiming the slightest intention to criticize the letter in a hostile
  spirit, and while fully appreciating the interest in the Society's welfare
  which caused Dr. Williams to raise the question of a revision of the Elec
  tion Statutes,    I  feel bound to remark that       I cannot think he had
  considered the question in all its aspects, or made allowance for the
 effects of that inability on his part, which he so candidly admits and
 regrets, to take, during forty years' Fellowship, any active part in the
 proceedings of the Society.
     Had it been otherwise, he would surely not, without some reservation,
 have instanced the reduction in the number of Fellows since the present
 rules have been in force as a loss to the Society which had not been anti
 cipated ; he would have been aware that the rules now in operation had
 been approved by the Society individually and collectively, and with
 ample deliberation, before their embodiment in the Statutes. He would also
 have known that it was with the full knowledge and intention that such
 a reduction    would and should result from this step that the rules were
 adopted, and that the rate and amount of reduction formed the subject of
 investigation and report by an eminent Fellow and Statistician, Mr. Gallo
 way   ; and lastly, that the rate of reduction, as then anticipated and taken
into account, has been slower than was calculated, and that our number
for some years to come will still be in excess of that which in 1847 was,
and 1 have reason to believe still is, thought large enough by the great
majority of our Fellows.
    Again, it is undoubtedly under a misapprehension that it is asserted
that the general result of the present limitation in the number annually
elected has been the " rejection of two thirds or more of the candidates."
The fact is that (putting aside the application of the term " rejection
                                                                           "
                                                                             to
that which, in the majority of cases, is merely "postponement") two thirds
of all whose names have been suspended have actually been elected, not
rejected ; and the average duration of suspension of the elected candidates

   has been under      two years.   Furthermore, from the one third who have not
   been elected are to be excluded the deaths, the withdrawals,      and those whose
   proposers have omitted to suspend their names a second year.             Subtract

                                           is not only a very small one, but is one
   which the Society would not, in my judgment, wish to have taken into
   Fellowship.
       It has been observed, and justly, "that the Fellows know little of the
   composition of the Scientific Committees," and that,
                                                               " if
                                                                    they are to judge
   by the composition of the Council, the choice seems limited."                 With
   regard to the first observation     I need hardly   remind you that the Council
   Minutes, in which the nomination and duties of the Committees and the
   names of their members are detailed, lie open daily to the inspection of the
   Fellows ; and with regard to the second, that Dr. "Williams himself
   would, were he to inquire, be surprised to know how few resident
   Fellows there are who, being competent, are both willing and able to
   serve on the Council.       I  have had some experience in public business,
  and can confidently affirm that, for number and duration of sittings,
   amount of work brought before them, and amount of thought devoted
   to that work,    I  know no labours of the kind more various, onerous, and
   engrossing than those of the Council and Committees of the Royal
   Society.    I  have had at various times during the last quarter of a century
  much experience of these Councils, and never knew a year in which,
   of the ten Members of the Council who, in accordance with the Charter,
  have to be replaced, there were not some who had attended a very limited
  number only of its meetings ; and as by a Minute of Council five names of
  Fellows who have never previously served must annually enter into the
  composition of the new Council, and as these five are, for the most part,
  chosen from comparatively new Fellows, it cannot be said that sufficient
  fresh blood is not annually incorporated.        But for the punctual attendance
 of the Members of Council, the Officers could not carry on the Society's
  business.      These latter meet punctually at 1 p.m. on every Council-day
 (sometimes at intervals of a week), and sit continuously until the Council
 breaks up, which is rarely before six.
     And if it is difficult to obtain Members to sit in the Council,          it is in
 my experience far more difficult to secure attendance at the Committees,
 which in many instances include no Councillor among their number. To
 go into the reason for this is here not necessary ; it is sufficient to
 say, that additions to the number of Fellows annually elected would
 not overcome the difficulty now in question.
     I  have but one remark to make further on this subject.            It is  asked,
 "Are we not straitened by our restrictive measures?" and              it is implied
that we are unable to meet the cost of illustrations to papers communi
cated by      Fellows. The following statements, given on the Auditors'
authority in my last year's Address, have escaped the attention of the
writer of the letter, viz. that " there was no cause for apprehension in

76                            Anniversary    Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
                                                              " there is no want
respect of the Society's funds or income," and that
of means for providing illustrations to papers communicated to us for
publication."
   I have  felt it to be my duty to you to enter with some detail into Dr.
Williams's earnest appeal to me. There remains to inform you of the
constitution of the Committee, and of the result of their labours.
   Most fortunately the services of five Fellows were obtainable for this
Committee, who were, of any in the Society, perhaps the most competent
to aid its deliberations — namely, Drs. Guy and Farr and Mr. Merrifield
as statisticians,   and    Mr. Justice    Grove  and   our late Secretary, Dr.
Sharpey, as having taken a very prominent part in the discussion which
in 1847 terminated in the adoption by the Society of that mode of election
which has been followed ever since, and has raised the Society to its
present position.      It is well perhaps that, in a matter so deeply affecting
the welfare of the Society,        I  should name the other members ; they
were Dr. Williams         himself,  and  Mr. John Evans, together with the
President and Officers, making a Committee of twelve in all.             The fol
lowing is the Eeport which they have made to the Council : —
   " Report      the Election Statutes Committee.  — The Committee appointed
              of
to consider whether      it is desirable or not to make any alterations in the
Statutes relating to the Election of Fellows, have given to the subject the
careful consideration demanded by the importance of these Statutes, not
only to the Royal Society, but to the general body of workers in science
in the kingdom.
   " The status of the Royal Society and the widespread recognition of the
value of its Fellowship render it highly desirable that, while on the one
hand no one shall be admitted to the Society who is not worthy of the
honour, on the other, no one who is worthy shall be excluded from the
Society, nor even suffer undue delay in entering it.
    " At the outset of their deliberations, the Committee unanimously agreed
 to recommend the maintenance of the principle of the existing Statutes ;
 that is to say, to leave in the hands of the Council, as at present, the
duty of selecting the Candidates to be presented to the Society for election.
    " They further agreed, nemine contradicente, that the number so selected
annually ought to be limited.
    " The only questions that remained therefore were,
                                                               ought the number
thus limited to be less than at present, greater than at present, or to
remain as it is ? And, practically, the choice was limited to the last two
alternatives.
    " As a preliminary to the discussion of   these alternatives, the Committee
thought it desirable to ascertain what may reasonably be expected to be
the strength of the Society if the present limitation remains in force.
    " The answers of the Fellows of the Society to a circular addressed to
them by the Committee, together with other statistical evidence as to the

1875.]                        President's Address.                            77
age at election and the average     duration of life of the Fellows, have been
carefully considered by several Members of the Committee who are
specially qualified to form a judgment on such matters ; and their con
clusion is that, under the present mode of election, the average number
of Fellows, exclusive of the Foreign Members,          may be expected to be
about 430.
    " Considering that the Eoyal Society is no longer, as at the time of its
foundation, the only scientific corporation in the kingdom, but that
numerous Societies have arisen devoted to one or other of the sciences, it
appears to be thought generally desirable that the Royal Society should
be distinguished by consisting of those persons who may be regarded as
the representatives of, or the most active and successful workers in, the
different departments of science, in association with promoters of scien
tific research and men of signal eminence in statesmanship, art, or letters.
    " The Committee have carefully considered whether the present limita
tion of annual selection to fifteen entails any undue delay in the election
of persons who answer to the foregoing description into the Eoyal
Society.      They find no ground for asserting that it does, and therefore
they have unanimously agreed to recommend that no change be made in
that number at present."
    I now    pass on to review the part taken by the Society in furtherance
of various Government and other expeditions.
    Tlu Polar    Expedition. —Early in   December last year a letter was re
 ceived from the Admiralty stating that Her Majesty's Government had
 determined to despatch an expedition to endeavour to reach the North
 Pole and to explore the coasts of Greenland and adjacent lands, asking at
 the same time for suggestions on the part of the Society in regard to
 carrying out the scientific conduct of the Expedition.
    The great importance of attaching Scientific Naturalists to such an
 expedition having been represented to the Government, the Society was
 informed in January last that the Lords Commissioners of the Ad
 miralty were prepared to appoint a Naturalist to each ship, and was asked
 to recommend two candidates who should be selected for their acquaint
 ance with as many branches of Natural History as possible.
     In pursuance of this intimation, your Council recommended to the        Ad
  miralty as Naturalists, Mr. Chichester Hart, M.A., of Trinity College,
  Dublin, and Captain Feilden.E.A., gentlemen well recommended to us for
  their acquirements, both as Naturalists and collectors, and having special
  qualifications for so arduous an enterprise ; and, further, applied for a grant
  of £250 to meet the expenses of editing a scientific manual for the use of the
  Naturalists and Officers generally. This application having been favour
                                         J
  ably entertained, Professor Eupert ones was requested to undertake the
  compilation and editing of the Biological and Geological portions of the

    78                          Anniversary    Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
   Manual, and Professor Adams, of King's College, the Physical. The
   Scientific Instructions to the Naturalists and Officers were contributed by
   the most competent persons (who, with two exceptions, were Fellows of
   the Society) whose services the Council could obtain.           The whole was
                                            '
   published in May, under the title of The Natural History, Geology, and
   Physics of the Arctic Regions,' and forms, with the Scientific Instructions,
   an octavo volume of more than eight hundred pages.
                                                   I
      In connexion with the Polar Expedition have to mention the cruise
   of H.M.S. ' Valorous,' which took out to Disco stores for the two ships.
   On the representation of Dr. Carpenter in a letter addressed to myself,
   an application was made by your Council to the Lords Commis
                                               '          '
   sioners of the Admiralty to employ the Valorous on her return voyage
  in making deep-sea and temperature -soundings in Davis's Straits and the
  North Atlantic, and to grant a passage to Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.R.S.,
  and an assistant, and thus      take advantage of so favourable an oppor
  tunity  for  continuing in  the Arctic Sea those scientific researches which he
  had so successfully conducted in H.M.S. ' Porcupine' in 1869 and 1870.
      The application was at once granted ; and although the voyage was far
  from prosperous, the weather having been tempestuous and the 'Valorous'
  having been in danger a few hours through striking on a sunken rock,
  the results have been generally satisfactory, and include many new species
  of pelagic animals. Captain Loftus Jones and Mr. Jeffreys dredged on the
  Greenland    coast from 70° 30'   N. lat. to the entrance of Davis's Straits,
 and in the Atlantic as      far as 25° 58' W. long., in depths of which the
 greatest was 1 785 fathoms ; and temperature-soundings            were taken at
 eleven out of the twenty stations indicated in the Admiralty Instructions.
     Among the valuable results obtained is the fact that the fauna of the
 Greenland seas agrees with its land flora in being mainly Norwegian,
 there being (with the exception of the Echinoderms) an absence of many
 North-American forms, which, as it appears, have not been found
 eastward of the meridian of Cape Chidley in Labrador.             A remarkable
 mollusk, previously dredged at a depth of about 1000 fathoms off the coast
 of Portugal by the ' Porcupine,' and which, when first found in a fossil
 state in the newer tertiaries of Sicily, was supposed to be an extinct type,
reappears in the deep waters of Davis's Straits ; and a Campanularia
was found, specifically identical with one discovered this year in
the opposite hemisphere, viz. in Kerguelen's Land, by Mr. Eaton, the
Naturalist of the Transit-of- Venus Expedition to that island.           A most
singular sponge-like     diatom,    named   by   Dr. Dickie   Synedra Jeffreysi,
with living Olobigerince entangled in the colloid connecting-matter of its
frustules, was taken in the towing-net.
    The existence of a remarkable elevation of the floor of the ocean was
ascertained in lat. 56° N., long 34° 42* W., where soundings of 690
fathoms were obtained between depths of 1450 fathoms on one side and
1230 fathoms on the other — an interesting fact when taken in connexion

     Naturalists   to the Transit-of- Venus Expeditions. — On the recommenda
  tion of the Council, as       I stated last year, Her Majesty's Government
  attached   a  Botanist   (who was also Geologist), a Zoologist, and a Cave
  Explorer to the Expeditions despatched to Rodriguez, and a Naturalist
  to the Kerguelen expedition.         These Naturalists have returned, Messrs.
  Balfour, Gulliver, and Slater from Eodriguez, and the Rev. A. E. Eaton
  from Kerguelen's Land, bringing collections and observations in all
  respects justifying the objects sought, and the Council's choice of agents
  for obtaining them.
     As regards Rodriguez, the most important result obtained (and it was
 a very unexpected one) is that, whereas in all preceding accounts of this
 island it has been described as consisting of a nucleus of granite with
  flanking beds of sandstone, limestone, and other aqueous rocks, and hence
  seemed to afford a rare example of a non-volcanic oceanic island, Mr. Bal
  four shows that neither granite nor sandstone there exist, and that it is
 composed wholly of igneous rocks, with patches of coralline limestone
  along the coast. It belongs therefore geologically as well as geographically
  to the Mascarene group, of which it is a distant outlier, and not to the
  Seychelles group, as had been erroneously suspected.
     The general characters of the Fauna and Flora of Rodriguez were found,
  in accordance with its geology, to approximate very closely to those of
  the Mauritian group, upwards of 300 miles to the westward, and not to
  partake of the distinctive features of the Seychelles, which are Indian
  rather than African. What differences there were from the former indi
  cated relationships with far distant countries, and some of them were
 extremely curious.
     The greatest interest      no doubt attaches to the extinct animals, chiefly
  Birds   and  Tortoises,  whose   remains are found in the caves of Rodriguez,
 and which, though extensively collected by Mr. Newton and described
  by himself, by Dr. Giinther, M. Milne-Edwards, and other authors,
  were still but very imperfectly known.       Of Birds Mr. Slater found remains
  of thirteen species, of which six are extinct ; one is found living in Bourbon
  alone, and one of the extinct species is new to science.         Of the famous
  Solitaire (the Rodriguez representative of the Dodo) materials for the
 construction of a complete skeleton were obtained, together with more
 complete specimens of other birds first described by M. Milne-Edwards
 from a few fragments.           The shells and bones of three extinct Tortoises
were obtained in great abundance, together with those of a large Skink
said to be still living in the island, but of which no certain information
could be obtained.

   80                            Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
     R3gardtng the circumstances under which the remains were preserved,
   Mr. Slater finds, from an examination        of twelve caves, that these were
  all formed by the action of water on coralline limestone, but that the beds
  of earth in which the bones were deposited, and which vary from two to
  nine feet in depth, are of basaltic material washed or blown into the
  caves.    Mr. Slater brings forward evidence in support of the hypothesis
  that the birds were entombed subsequent to the visits of Europeans, and
  that their entombment is due to their having taken shelter in the caves
  during the fires that ravaged great parts of the island    ; and that elsewhere
  the  Solitaire   has  been  extirpated by imported  cats and  pigs, the former
  of which, of large size and great ferocity, still abound.
     With regard to the Tortoises, the remains of which are extraordinarily
  numerous in the caves, there is evidence of their entombment having been
  subsequent to that of the Birds ; but the direct cause of their extinction is
  not apparent.        Another noteworthy fact is that, whereas the marshes of
  Mauritius have yielded the greatest number of Dodo remains, those of
  Rodriguez appear to contain no bones of its ally the Solitaire or of any
  other bird.
     Mr. Slater's fine collection was, by permission of the Council, exhibited
  at Professor      Flower's Soiree at the Eoyal College of Surgeons in July
  last, and attracted great attention.
     Mr. G-ulliver has brought home an extensive collection of the animals
 of the island, among which all classes are represented except some of the
 Vertebrates     ;  of these last the most numerous are the Birds, which had
 previously     been    described by Professor Newton. Ophidians are totally
 absent  ;  and Amphibia also, although there are swamps of some extent.
 The spiders seemed to abound ; and some new forms were collected, one
 with an arrangement of the eyes that is unique in the class ; and another
 spins a web so strong as to be used by the settlers as cobblers do
                                                                         " waxed
 ends."
    The representation        of winged insects by wingless allies, which is so
 remarkable a feature in other oceanic islands, is not alluded to by Mr.
 Gulliver   as characteristic     of the insect fauna of Rodriguez ; nor has he
observed any correlation          between the insects and flowering plants in
respect of the fertilization of the latter.
    Mr. Balfour's report on the Flora of Rodriguez is a very full one ; it
refers exclusively to living plants ; for though several of these are almost
extinct, no traces of fossil leaves or other parts of plants were found with
the birds' and tortoise bones or elsewhere.
    More than one half of the island appears to have been denuded by fires
of its indigenous vegetation, which has been replaced by introduced species
that are for the most part common social tropical weeds.             The soil is
now for the most part arid, whence even the Ferns, of which upwards of
20 species were found, are typical of dry regions.         About 300 flowering
plants were collected ; and, as usual in insular floras, the proportion of

 species to genera, aud of these to orders, is very much smaller        than in
 continental  areas.   Thirty-three species, belonging    to   as many genera,
are peculiar to the island, and two of them belong to new genera.
    It is a very remarkable fact that one of these new genera, belonging
to the Natural Order Turnerace®,          is most closely allied to a peculiar
 Panama genus ; and that          one of the new species has only a single
congener, which is a Pacific      island plant. There are three Palms, all of
them peculiar, and two Screw-pines (Pand-ani).        Dr. Balfour remarks the
extraordinary    number    of  plants   whose leaves vary in form at different
ages.     For other matter, much of it very curious,      I   must refer to the
three Eeports, which will in due time be published, with sufficient illus
trations.
    Mr. Eaton's valuable Report on the Natural History of Kerguelen's
Land having been already before you, and printed in our ' Proceedings,'
requires no further mention here.
    There remains to state that your Council has found reason to express
satisfaction with the Eeports and Collections of all the Naturalists ; that
complete catalogues of the specimens procured will appear in our pub
lications ; that the detailed descriptions and observations will also be
published, either by the Naturalists themselves or by competent persons ;
that the specimens will be distributed after a complete set has been
reserved for our National Collections ; and that the total expenditure
amounts to £1512, of which £1396 was contributed by Her Majesty's
 Government,     while the rest has been defrayed out of the Donation
Fund.
    The Total Solar Eclipse of April 1875. — Towards the close of last year
the desirability of observing the total ecb'pse of the Sun, which was to
take place in India, engaged the attention of your Council ; aud the
subject was under its consideration when a letter was received by me
from His Majesty the King of Siam, offering hospitality and assistance
 should the Eoyal Society deem it expedient to appoint scientific men to
observe it from His Majesty's dominions.
    Your Council being of opinion that both the importance of the occasion
 (totality during this eclipse being of longer duration than during any other
 that would be observed in the present century) and the liberal offer of
 His Majesty required careful consideration, appointed a committee of five
 astronomers and the Society's Officers to report upon the feasibility of
 undertaking such an expedition with a reasonable prospect of success.
 The Committee was advised that no time was to be lost in arriving at
 a conclusion,   as only four months would elapse before the occurrence
of the eclipse.
    The first step taken was to communicate with the First Lord of the
 Treasury and the Secretary of State for India, and ascertain whether,

should the attempt be made, Her Majesty's Government would be disposed
to cooperate with the Society.
    The answers were most favourable ; but still grave doubts were
entertained by several of the Committee as to whether it were possible to
make the necessary preparations and arrangements with sufficient com
pleteness to secure adequate results.
    After muA deliberation it was decided in the affirmative, the Com
mittee's decision being based on the following favouring circumstances: —
That confidence in its feasibility was expressed by those members of the
Committee who had themselves conducted or accompanied Eclipse Expedi
tions in foreign countries; that two eminent observers, Messrs. Janssen
and Tacchini, were already in India and their services available ; that Her
Majesty's Government would cooperate by proposing to Parliament a
grant in aid of £1000, which would be augmented by another of £300
from the Donation-Fund of the Society ; that the Secretary of State for
India and the Governor-General of India had promised active cooperation
 by sending an expedition to the Nicobar Islands, where, as well as in
 Siam, totality would be visible ; that both the Indian Government and
 the Admiralty had granted passage in their vessels, and that the Penin
 sular and Oriental Company had offered to give passage to the observers
 and their assistants at greatly reduced rates; that His Majesty the King
 of Siam would defray all expenses of the party sent to his territories ;
 and lastly, which perhaps weighed most with the Committee, was Mr.
 Lockyer's disinterested offer to superintend all the arrangements of
 observers and instruments, to prepare the instructions for their guidance
 abroad, and to make all the necessary telegraphic and other communica
 tions with India and the Straits Settlements previous to and during the
 progress of the Expedition.
    As in the case of former Eclipse Expeditions, invitations to take part
 in the observations were addressed to foreign men of science dis
 tinguished for their researches in solar physics ; but Professor Tacchini
 was the only one who could accept. At the same time Dr. Vogel, of
 Berlin, a well-known photographer, was asked to assist, and he accom
 panied the Expedition.
    A communication was received from M. Dumas, the perpetual Secretary
 of the Paris Academy of Sciences, with reference to Dr. Jaussen's pro
 posed observation of the Eclipse; and instructions were sent to Singa
 pore   that  every  assistance  should be afforded  to that  distinguished
 physicist.
    As a final result of these preliminary arrangements, there were two
 strong parties in position on the morning of the 6th of April, of whose
 members no less than six were sent out from England.         One party, a
 combination of Italian, Indian, and English, went to Camorta in the
 Nicobar Islands ; the other, French and English, made their way to
 Chulai Point in Siam. In the first party were Professor Tacchini,

 1875.]                     President's  Address.                           83
Captain Waterhouse, Professor Pedler, Dr. Vogel, and Messrs. Meldola
and Reynolds ; in the second were Dr. Janssen, Dr. Schuster, and Messrs.
Lott and Beasley, each amply provided with assistants.
    The Committee decided that at both stations the observations        should
be mainly    photographic ; and the instruments furnished had for their
object the registration of the violet spectrum of the corona and chro
mosphere as a whole, and that of the spectrum of an isolated portion of
the image.
    Ordinary photographs of the corona and of the polariscopic effects of
its light were also provided for.
    In spite of the most hopeful anticipations, the weather at Camorta
proved bad on the morning of the Eclipse, and, as has been observed on
former occasions, the reduction of the temperature, due to the withdrawal
of the sun's heat, produced a mass of cumulus cloud which prevented
a most thoroughly equipped party from making any observations whatever
during totality.
    The success of the Siam party has been also far less than was antici
pated. An unfortunate break-down in the Suez Canal, and some misun
derstanding, in consequence of which the promised Government steamer
was not forthcoming, caused delays which left so little time for the final
adjustment of the instruments when the observers at last reached their
station, that some records are altogether wanting ; and the attempt to
photograph the spectrum of an isolated portion of the chromosphere
proved a failure.
    The most important results obtained are (1) a series of photographs of
the corona, taken with a prism of small angle in front of the object-glass,
which show several rings and part of the form of the outer corona, and
(2) a series of views of the corona, chiefly taken at different times of ex
posure.     The discussion of the observations has not yet been taken in
hand ; but it is not too early to state that several results of great
interest and value have been secured.
    The King of Siam himself made a sketch of the corona and forwarded
it to the Society. In common with others which accompany the Reports,
 it does not differ very greatly from the figure photographed on the plate.
    I cannot conclude this short reference to one branch of our activity
during the past session without congratulating English Science upon the
 fact that the Eclipse was not suffered to pass unobserved, and with
 out expressing our obligations to all those whose names will be mentioned
at length in the Report, who both here and abroad at each stage of the
arrangements     afforded us valuable assistance, not forgetting the ob
 servers themselves, who in the service of science volunteered for a duty
 not without risk, and from the performance of which, indeed, some have
suffered in health.
     The 'Challenger' Expedition. — The third year ofthe' Challenger's' voyage
                                                                 G 2

has been no less     fruitful of results than the two preceding ; which is the
 more  satisfactory,   as she has lost the services of her indefatigable Com
 mander Captain jSares, who, as you are aware, has been summoned home
 to command the Polar Expedition.          Interesting discoveries seem literally
 to have crowded along the course of this vessel, and the scientific store
 houses of the deep to have been unlocked at the bidding of Professor
 Thomson and his busy and able staff.         It would be premature to estimate
as yet the probable importance to Biology, Geology, and Physical Geo
 graphy of the grand but still imperfect generalizations which are being
 drawn from the facts sent homo from the ship as to the nature and dis
tribution of those microscopic forms of pelagic life, the Foraminifera and
 Eadiolaria ; but there can be no doubt that our knowledge of the formation
 of Azoic clays and schists, and of the processes of metamorphism at great
                                                                        '
depths, is being greatly enlarged by the operations of the 'Challenger Expedi
tion. Nor are the discoveries in submarine geography of less interest — such
 as the finding   in the Melanesian Pacific areas which, though only partially
circumscribed by islands, exhibit biological and hydrographical phenomena
differing widely from those of the circumambient ocean.         In the depths of
the sea, as on the surface of the land, are contiguous areas peopled by very
different assemblages of living things.       As on the laud we ascend to meet
a colder temperature, accompanied by forms of life of wider distribution
than at lower elevations,      so in the  seas of warm and temperate      regions
we descend to meet with analogous conditions.           The ocean thus mirrors
one of the most striking features of the distribution of terrestrial life, and,
mirror-like, it turns the picture upside down. Furthermore, this ana
logy is confined to the warm and temperate zones of the sea : in the cold
zones this order of things is reversed ; there, as on land, we descend to
wanner temperatures, and the deepest sea is peopled by animals proper
to a much lower latitude.        The total result is a uniformity in the general
distribution of oceanic life that has no parallel on land ; and facts in the
migration of marine animals and plants that were formerly accounted for
by assuming that they possessed greater powers of withstanding changes
of temperature, are now accounted for by conditions more closely resem
bling those that obtain on the Land.
   From such considerations as these          it would follow that pelagic life
should    be less differentiated than terrestrial ; and no doubt it is so ;
and to a still more considerable degree is lacustrine and fluviatile life less
various lhan pelagic, in respect of plants especially.       On the other hand,
whereas both the mass and variety of vegetable life is much greater on
land, the bulk, but not the variety, of animal life is much greater in the
ocean.     It is no doubt owing to the infinite variety of food that terrestrial
animals have access to, rather than to the diversities of climate, soil, and
other conditions, that the land presents so much greater a variety of life
than the sea does.        It is true that local assemblages of marine plants
have their local faunas, as the Sargasso Sea and the vast Macrocystis

meadows of the southern ocean; but in such cases it is shelter, not food,
that has localized the assemblages.          But this reminds me that    I  am
 becoming discursive ; and      I will conclude my digression by referring to
 the rarity of its phytophagous animals, as being to me one of the most
 wonderful and inexplicable phenomena of oceanic life ; for with the
exception of those that live upon the ubiquitous pelagic Diatomaceae,
 there are very few marine animals of general distribution or of any size
 that feed on marine plants.

    The protracted absence of H.M.S. ' Challenger,' and the great "im
 portance in the interest of science that the Director of its Scientific Staff,
 Professor Wyville Thomson, should not leave the Expedition, has, by de
taching that gentleman from his duties in the Natural-History Chair of the
Edinburgh University for so much longer a period than was anticipated,
placed that University in a very difficult position, and obliged its Court to
appeal to the Society.      It was originally arranged that the duties of the
Chair should, for the first two years of Professor Thomson's absence, be
undertaken by Professor Carus, of Leipsic ; on the third, Professor Carus
being compelled to return to Germany, the University Court represented
to the Lords of the Council that, having regard to the fact that Professor
Thomson was withdrawn from his professorial duties by Her Majesty's
Government, and in accordance with the strong recommendation of the
Royal Society, it was not unreasonable to hope that both the Government
and the Society would come to their aid by permitting Professor Huxley to
deliver the University course of Lectures.          The Lords of the Council
having granted the permission, your Council did not hesitate to make
such arrangements as enabled Professor Huxley to absent himself from
the Society for the purpose required. The result has in no way inconveni
enced the Society; Professor Huxley managed to attend the Council-
Meetings, he conducted at a distance the editorial work that belonged to
him, and such of his duties as could be performed only on the spot were
kindly undertaken by Professor Stokes.
    I have only to add that Professor Thomson's return being further delayed
till July 1876, Professor Huxley's services have again been applied for
by the University Court ; and, having been granted by the Lords of the
Council, similar arrangements for his absence to those which oltained

    The Meteorological Committee. — The anomalous connexion between the
Royal Society and the Meteorological Office on the one hand, and between
that Office and the Government on the other, to which and its consequences
I  drew your attention in my last year's Address, is likely soon to be termi
nated, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury having appointed a
 Committee to inquire into the working of the present Office and the
value of the results hitherto obtained.
    Seeing that the operations of the     Committee    have- been generally in a
great measure tentative, and have         now extended over nine years, this
action of the Government is viewed        with satisfaction by the Committee,
 whose arduous services have been          entirely gratuitous  during this long
 period.     The value of their labour is indeed fully recognized in the
 Treasury Minute appointing the Committee, which expresses absolute
 confidence in its efficiency, but thinks that the time has arrived for fur
 ther inquiry.
    According to the instructions of the Treasury, the inquiry is to        be  di
 rected to two principal points of scientific interest, viz. : —
    (1) How far the statistics hitherto collected have led to the discovery
 or confirmation of Meteorological Laws.
    (2) How far the principles upon which storm-warnings are given have
 been justified by results.
    I need hardly observe that these questions open up a very wide field of
 inquiry of the highest importance to the meteorology of the future, whether
 in this country or elsewhere. There can be no question but that the
 Committee      has  rendered most important services to science and to the
 country   ; it is held in just estimation among continental     physicists, and
 its methods and results have been in a great measure adopted and followed
 by them, in many cases without modification.
    Still the geographical position of the British Isles is one that renders
  meteorological inquiry full of difficulty, and hence necessitates a very careful
 periodic supervision of the measures employed to advance its theories and
 to apply them to practice. Unlike the Atlantic States of America, we have
 no area to the westward of us (which is emphatically our storm-bearing
 quarter) upon which we can establish recording stations.        We can have no
 system like that of the American meteorologists, which would enable us
 to obtain that knowledge of the atmospheric disturbances over the Atlantic
 which they can procure of those which extend over the continental             area
 to the westward of their central Observatories.
    On the other hand, England       has advantages    for promoting the study
  of terrestrial meteorology that no other country has- — namely, her foreign
 possessions and Colonies, and the command of the telegraphs with which
 the ocean is in process of being crossed in every direction.                  We

 1875.]                      President's Address.                             87
have known what it is to read at our breakfast-tables       telegrams from all
parts  of the world   of the prices  of stocks and of political incidents of the
previous day; why should we not, then, obtain daily statistics of the cli
matic conditions of these and other remote regions, and inaugurate in
England a system of meteorological registration which, if its elements were
obtained from but a few well-selected spots, would instruct and interest
every intelligent person in the climate of the globe, and in the end lead
to scientific results of great value? We must remember that it is
not the policy of the Government of this country in its view of the pre
sent state of public feeling, and as expressed in the Minute appointing
the Committee, to give direct assistance to the study of any science
except with a view to the more immediate application of scientific
theories to practical purposes, in which the public rather than indi
viduals have a direct interest.      "Whatever may be thought of the wisdom
or soundness of this policy (and in the opinion of some eminent scientific
men it is wise and sound), we must shape our course accordingly, doing
our endeavour never to allow scientific investigation to be subordinated
to practical results ; but keeping it ever in advance, remembering too that
the Government estimation of the value of scientific investigation is
measured more by the amount of interest which it excites than by any
standard of its own ; whence it follows that the Government is not slow
in encouraging researches that interest and instruct the public, whether
or not they may be seen to lead to direct practical results.      Keeping these
facts in view,    I cannot but think that the Committee of the Treasury
will have the opportunity of recommending to Her Majesty's Govern
ment the adoption of measures that would greatly increase the scientific
efficiency and public interest of the Meteorological Office.
    The Gilchrist   Trust.— In my last year's Address        I  announced that
arrangements had been made by the Council for the administration, under
the authority of the Trustees of the Gilchrist bequest, of a grant of
.£1000 per annum in promoting original research, thus aiding in the ful
filment of the wishes of the Testator, that the proceeds of his large
fortune should be devoted " to the benefit, advancement, and propagation
of education and learning." The scheme for the administration of this
grant was approved by the Trustees and laid before you in detail ; but
since then its operation has been frustrated by a most unexpected judicial
decision formally given in the House of Lords as to the meaning to be
assigned to the terms of the Gilchrist bequest — namely, that
                                                                      " the pro
motion of original research
                                 "                              "
                                    could not be held to be       benefiting the
advancement and propagation of education and learning," for that it was
expressly laid down by the Law Lords that " learning is to be construed
as synonymous with education," and that the whole fund is to be devoted
to the propagation of knowledge.
   This is not the time or place to comment upon what must appear to us

88                           Anniversary     Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
to be a very strange limitation of the Testator's wishes ;      I can only hope
that a     more  enlightened posterity, the    outcome   of  a more   liberal and
scientific education than now obtains, will introduce into the theory and
                                                    " advancement of learning "
practice of the Law an interpretation of the
more in harmony with scientific ideas and the requirements of the age.
In the mean time it is much to be wished that the prize thus snatched
from bo high a purpose may yet be made to contribute in some way to
the advancement of original research ; and        I feel sure that it will be due
to no want of energy and goodwill on the part of the Trustees and of their
 Secretary,   Dr. Carpenter, nor of hearty cooperation on the part of the
 Royal Society,    if science reaps no benefit from the Gilchrist Trust.
     The Ghvernment Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments. — It affords me
 much pleasure to refer to an action on the part of Her Majesty's Govern
 ment which we may anticipate will lead to important results to the cultiva
 tion of Science in this country.       I mean the Loan Collection of scientific
 instruments which is to be formed at South Kensington in the course of
 the ensuing year.      The Lord President and Vice-President of the Council,
 in introducing this subject to the first meeting of the men of science to
 whom they have applied for assistance, shadowed forth their own views
 and hopes that the collection might prove the commencement of govern
 mental action with regard to one of the recommendations of the " Science
 Commission" — that, namely, dealing with the present want of a museum
 illustrating the sciences of experiment and observation.           The Govern
 ment has further suggested to the various continental governments the
 appointment of Commissions, composed of the most eminent men of
 science, to which we may confidently look for help in selecting the most
 important instruments that illustrate the history, the advancement, and
  the spread of science.
     In the proposed Exhibition not only are modern scientific methods and
 instruments and the various methods of practical instruction in science to
 be   fully dealt with, but it is also proposed that the history of science shall
 be illustrated by the actual instruments which have been employed, from
 the time of Galileo downwards, in those critical experiments and dis
 coveries which mark the principal stages along the road of progress.
     The men of science of this country have already responded so warmly
 to the appeal made to them, that it is not necessary for me to commend
 the proposed action to them        ; and  I may conclude my reference to this
 subject by the expression of a hope that our fellow-workers in other
 countries will not rest content with sending their instruments, but will
 accompany them to London, so as to enable us to assure them personally
 of our esteem.
     On the motion of Sir Thomas Watson, seconded by Sir Alexander
 Armstrong, it was resolved — " That the thanks of the Society be returned

 1875.]                         President's Address.                         89
to the President for his Address, and that he be requested to allow it to
be  printed."
   I now proceed      to the presentation of the Medals.
   The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor August "Wilhelra
Hofmann, P.B.S., of Berlin, for his numerous contributions to the
science of Chemistry,       and especially for his Researches   on the Deriva
tives of Ammonia.
   The researches of Dr. A. W. Hofmann, from first to last, are related
by a   strict logical connexion, from which (although in various side-paths
he has made truly interesting discoveries) he has never essentially deviated.
Indeed these researches may be considered as constituting one great and
prolonged research on the organic bases theoretically and experimentally
considered.      It is not, however, to be imagined that because, to a certain
extent, limited in its range, this work is of a special or technical order.
The subject covers a large area, and is calculated to lead the investigator
to the consideration of the most important chemical problems.             ,
   The memoirs of Dr. Hofmann in reference to the organic bases fall
under several heads: — (1) The researches on Aniline and the organic
bases contained in Coal-tar.        These researches are mainly included in the
period between 1843 and 1850.          (2) The investigations on the molecular
constitution of the organic bases derived by the substitution of the
Alcohol radicals in the molecule of Ammonia (1850-51). (3) The
Phosphorus bases and the Diatomic ammonias (1857-60).                  (4) The
investigations    on   Bosaniline  and  the various Colouring-matters derived
from Coal-tar (1860-70).
   In the course of the Aniline investigations Hofmann made an im
portant contribution to the Unitary theory of Chemistry.             Dumas had
shown     that the essential chemical properties of acetic acid were not
altered by the substitution in the acid-molecule of chlorine for hydrogen;
but no organic base had yet been discovered derived from another base
by a similar process.       Fritsche, indeed, had made a bromine-derivation
of aniline, in which three atoms of hydrogen were replaced by bromine ;
but the substance thus formed was a neutral (not basic) body.                It
occurred to Hofmann that the substitution had here gone too far, and
that for this reason the basic properties of aniline had disappeared.
Consequently, by an ingenious process (devised for the experiment), the
treatment     of chlorisatin by the hydrate of potash, he prepared mono-
chloraniline  — aniline, that is, in which one atom of hydrogen was re
placed by chlorine.       This body was a base, like aniline itself.  Hofmann
established its basic character by the preparation of many of its salts
(Liebig's ' Annalen,' vol. liii. p. 1, 1845).
   At the date when Hofmann's paper on the molecular constitution of the
volatile organic bases was presented to the Boyal Society (December
1849), Wurtz had just prepared, by a striking experiment, the primary

90                        Anniversary     Meeting.                        [Nov. 30,
monamines of the alcohol radicals   — that is,   a system   of   bases   in which one
third of the hydrogen of the ammonia was replaced by the hydrocarbon,
the existence of which (it may be noticed) had been predicted by Liebig
as a consequence of his views as to the composition of the organic bases.
The experiments of Hofmann were in the same direction as those of
Wurtz, but of far more general application.     By the action of the iodides
of the alcohol radicals upon ammonia, Hofmann replaced successively the
three atoms of hydrogen which its molecule contains by these hydro
carbons — a method fraught with important results, both theoretical and
practical, with which all chemists are familiar.
   Among other consequences, this method placed the theory of types on
a solid experimental foundation, which served as the basis of its future
development.     A critical test was given, by which the constitution of
any given
            " ammonia
                        " could be ascertained, the number of derivatives
                    " when
of the " ammonia            subjected to the action of iodide of ethyl cor
responding to the number of atoms of hydrogen which it still retained
unreplaced by hydrocarbon.      Hofmann applied this test to aniline, and
demonstrated, by the successive formation of ethyl-aniline and diethyl
amide, that this base belonged to the primary monamine class, containing
two atoms of hydrogen unreplaced by hydrocarbon.        To trace out, how
ever slightly, the consequences of this method would be a serious task
indeed.    It is sufficient to say that the views at present held by
chemists as to the molecular constitution of water, according to which
water is regarded, like ammonia, as a typical molecule, but containing
two atoms of hydrogen (instead of, as in the other case, three) replace
able by the alcohol radicals, are based upon experimental evidence for
which the very same instrument of research, the iodide of ethyl, and
methods in all respects analogous to those by which Hofmann thus
established the constitution of aniline were employed.
   According to these views triethylaniline represented ammonia in which
all possible substitutions of this order had been effected. However, Hof
mann applied his test to this substance, and obtained a most remarkable
result.  A molecule of iodide of ethyl combines with a molecule of this
substance, giving rise to the iodide of a molecular group, behaving like
potassium or sodium,
                       " a true organic metal in all its bearings." The
ground of this assertion  is,that this iodide of tetrethylammonium, when
treated with freshly precipitated oxide of silver,     decomposed with the
                                                       is
formation of an oxide of the " organic metal " possessing the main features
of potash.  This train of investigation has not as yet been adequately
pursued   but
          ;   the fundamental importance of this experiment, in reference
to our knowledge of the elemental bodies, cannot be doubted.
     The first memoir on the Phosphorus    bases,   in which the existence of       a
class of phosphorus bases analogous to the compound ammonias was
experimentally established, was published in conjunction with M. Cahours.
In three subsequent memoirs these compounds were further investigated

with the determination of the differences by which they were discrimi
nated from their nitrogen analogues.       We have here presented to us the
first example of a diatomic base formed by the action of bromide of ethy-
line or triethyl-phosphine, in which reaction (as in the similar case of the
diatomic alcohols) Hofmann successfully established the formation of
an intermediate monatomic bromide, the reaction taking place by two
distinct stages. In the third of these memoirs a new class of compound
bases is brought before us, containing both nitrogen and phosphorus.
Subsequently, in a series of somewhat less elaborate memoirs, the con
ception of the typical character of ammonia is greatly expanded by the
examination of the derivatives of two and three molecules of ammonia.
    As to the researches in reference to the colouring-matter derived from
coal-tar, it is only necessary to observe that his inquiries initiated and
rendered possible what is now a vast branch of industry. In reference
to rosaniline itself (the key of the system), he established the fact, long
unknown, that this substance was not an aniline compound at all, but
derived from the combination of aniline with toluidine.
    I may lastly mention, as a fitting conclusion to this series of discoveries,
an investigation of very wide interest, which has resulted in the con
struction of the normal cyanides (a) of the monatomic hydrocarbons,
formed by the action of chloroform on the primary monamines, which,
 together with water, are resolved into formic acid and the base whence
 they are derived; while their isomers (Class B), the nitrites, under
 similar conditions yield ammonia and their corresponding acids. Hofmann
 has also estabb'shed the existence of a new class of cyanates (ft) of the
 same monatomic hydrocarbons which, together with water, are resolved
into ammonia and their corresponding alcohols, the original class (a)
 being resolved under the same circumstances into carbonic acid and the
primary monamines, as in the experiment of Wurtz before referred to, the
 whole investigation standing in intimate connexion with Hofmann's
 previous work.
    To estimate the value of these results it is necessary to go through
 the vast mass of experimental evidence from which they are deduced,
 which constitutes a body of complete and exact information in reference
 to one general subject not easily paralleled in the history of Chemistry.
    The Medal was received by Dr. Hofmann.
    A Eoyal Medal has been awarded to Mr. William Crookes, F.K.S.,
 for his various chemical and physical researches, more especially for his
 discovery of Thallium, his investigation of its compounds, and determi
nation of its atomic weight ; and for his discovery of the repulsion
 referable to radiation.
    In the year 1861 Mr. Crookes communicated the discovery of a new
element, which he had detected by means of a green line exhibited in the
spectrum     of  certain  selenium   residues which   he was    examining    for

tellurium.      The element had as yet been found in extremely small
quantities only ; but yet he was able to prove chemically as well as
optically that it was a new substance, which, from some of its reactions,
he thought most probably belonged to the sulphur group           of elements,
and to which he gave the name Thallium.
    The investigation of this new substance was eagerly followed out ;
and by inquiries in various directions he succeeded in obtaining it in
larger quantities, though his supply was still most inconveniently small,
rendering it necessary to work the same material over and over again,
instead of carrying on the investigation of two or more of its compounds
simultaneously.        This investigation, which had led him to perceive that
the new body was a metal, which he isolated, was in progress when (in
the summer of 1862) he was induced to send in a preliminary notice of
his investigations to the Royal Society, instead of waiting, as he had
intended,    till the research was complete, in consequence of the publication
by   M. Lamy (who had been fortunate enough to meet with a compara
tively fertile source of the new substance) of a paper in which he described
several of its compounds and announced its metallic nature.          The com
plete memoir was presented to the Royal Society early in 1863, and is
                     '                            '
published in the Philosophical Transactions for that year.         It contains,
 among other things, a provisional determination of the atomic weight,
 giving   a mean result of 203-96.
    The    atomic weight of an element being a constant of fundamental
 importance, Mr. Crookes spared no pains in an accurate determination
of that of thallium.        This research, which extended over several years,
 is described in a highly elaborate memoir which was presented to the
                                                      '
 Eoyal Society in 1872, and is published in the Philosophical Transac
       '
 tions    for the following year. The various weighings which the investi
 gations required were performed and reduced with the most scrupulous
 regard to minute accuracy, as the utmost care was taken in the prepara
 tion of the chemicals.        Though only one method was employed, namely
 that of determining the weight of nitrate of thallium obtained from a
  known weight of the metal, the care with which the whole process was
 conducted, and the near agreement of the different experiments, are such
 as to lead us to regard the final mean 203-642 as most probably very
 near the truth.
    In   the course of the weighings which were executed in this research,
 Mr. Crookes noticed some minute anomalies depending on temperature
 which did not seem referable to currents of convection.          This led him
 into  a train of experimental research which resulted in the discovery of
 an action of radiation which, whatever be its real nature (a point still
 involved in mystery), and whether the action be direct or indirect, all
  who have seen or followed the experiments must allow to be most re
  markable.      An account of this research was published in the ' Philoso
                         '
  phical Transactions      for 1874.

  1875.]                    President's Address.                         93
    When delicate beams of straw and other materials, carrying pith balls
 or disks at their ends, were mounted so as to turn as freely as possible
 within glass vessels from which the air could be exhausted, it was found
 that at atmospheric pressure the approach of a hot body produced a
 movement usually indicative of an attraction, real or apparent, between
 the ball and the body, and that of a cold body a reverse movement.      In
these motions, however, it is evident that currents of convection play a
leading part ; nor does it appear by any means certain that the actions
may not be due to these and other well-known causes.       The same thing
continues when the air is partially exhausted, until, at a certain high
rarefaction varying according to circumstances, the motions cease, or
nearly so.    But on passing this, a new and unexpected phenomenon is
revealed, which is exhibited in perfection in chemical vacua, and in the
best vacua produced by the Sprengel pump with the improvements which
Mr. Crookes     has introduced  into it. The suspended body is now repelled
with striking energy when a source of radiant heat or light is presented
to it, or even, if the radiation be powerful, when it is held at some dis
tance, or when the sun's rays concentrated by a lens are thrown upon it.
The action has more recently been exhibited by Mr. Crookes in an ex
ceedingly striking form by means of a horizontal 4-armed fly delicately
mounted on a sharp point, and carrying at the ends of the arms pith
disks in vertical planes passing through the arms, the disks being
blackened on one face, on the same side for all. The motion depends in
this case on a differential  action on the black and white faces, the black
being repelled.
    It  is the mystery attending this phenomenon that gives it its great
importance.      There is evidently some action going on with which we are
not at present acquainted ; and there is no saying what a thorough in
vestigation   into the cause of the phenomenon may lead to.
    The Medal was received by Mr. Crookes.
    A  Eoyal Medal has been awarded to Dr. Thomas Oldham, F.R.S., for
 his long and important services in the Science of Geology, first while
Professor of Geology in Trinity College, Dublin, and Director of the Geo
 logical Survey of Ireland, and chiefly for the great work which he has
 so long conducted as Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India,
 iu which so much progress has been made that in a few years it will be
 possible to produce a Geological Map of India comparable to the Geological
 Map of England executed by the late Mr. Greenough ; also for a series
 of volumes of Geological Reports and Memoirs, including the ' Palajon-
 tologica Indica,' published under his direction.
     Professor Oldham is the author of more than twenty G eological Memoirs
 and Reports, published in the Journal of the Geological Society of Dublin,
 that of the Geological Society of London, the Journal of the Asiatic So

9t                           Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
ciety of Bengal, the Government Records         of the Geological Society of
India, and other serial publications.
   Among other work, many years ago (in 1843) he discovered the first
known fossils in the Cambrian rocks of Brayhead, to which, by the late
Professor Edward Forbes, the generic name of Oldhamia was given, — a
discovery which in its day created the same kind of impression among
geologists that the discovery of Eozoon produced when found by the late
Sir William Logan in the Laurentian rocks of Canada. He was also among
the earliest of the workers on the Geology of Ireland to show that above
the ice-scratched rocks of the island marine shells were found in clays and
gravels up to 600 feet above the level of the sea ; and arguing on this
discovery, he produced two maps showing the state of Ireland as a group
of islands when submerged to that depth, and also when submerged to a
depth of 1000 feet, which he considered himself justified in believing    to
have been the case.
   Some of his other memoirs give excellent accounts of the geology of
large tracts of India, in one of which he showed that theBajmahal Hills
consist of great lava-flows of trappean rocks, proved to have been ejected
as lavas by the fact that the sandstones with which they are interbedded
are always much altered by the trap that rests upon them, and unaltered
when they lie upon the traps.       His memoirs on the Cretaceous rocks of
parts of India also conveyed a great deal of new knowledge to European
geologists ; and the manner in which he has directed the Geological Sur
vey of that great country, from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin (still
going on"), deserves the gratitude of geologists in particular and of men of
science in general.
   The Medal was received by Professor Bamsay for Dr. Oldham.
   The Statutes relating to the election of Council and Officers were
then read, and Colonel Younghusband and Dr. Hector having been, with

       Report of the Kew Committee                for  the Year ending
                              October 31, 1875.
    Magnetic Work. — The year has been marked by the recommencement
 of regular work with the Magnetographs, which had been taken down
 for examination and repair by Mr. Adie, as described in the last Report.
 The scale-values having been redetermined, the instruments were set
 in action on the 1st of January, 1875, and therewith the second series
 of continuous photographic records of magnetic phenomena was inau
 gurated.
    The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
 continued, as usual, by Mr. G. M. Whipple, who also takes charge of the
 general magnetic work, in which he has had the assistance of Mr.
  Cullum and F. Figg.          The two Sergeants of the Royal Artillery,
 formerly in Sir E. Sabine's office at Woolwich, have been in regular
 attendance at    Kew throughout the year.
    The principal constants employed in the computations for the Tables

used in the reduction   of the monthly absolute observations which had
been determined by Mr. Welsh have been re-examined.        A memorandum
containing the results of the observations in question for the twelve
months ending Sept. 30, 1875, has been prepared, and is appended to
this Report ; and it is the intention of the Committee to furnish similar
statistics with each of their subsequent Eeports.
   A paper embodying the results of absolute determinations for the six
years ending with March 1875 has been prepared and submitted to the
Society; it forms a continuation of the similar paper for the pre
ceding six years, ending March 1869, which was submitted by Dr. B.
Stewart, and is printed in the ' Proceedings of the Society,' vol. xviii.
   The Magnetic Seductions for the current year have been kept up nearly
to date. As regards the arrears of work shown in the tabular statement
appended to the Eeport of the Kew Committee of the British Associa
tion for 1870-71, no progress had been made in dealing with any of the ele
ments (with the exception of the tabulation of the Declination curves) up
to the month of April last, owing to the insufficiency of the regular staff
to deal with such a mass of materials ; at that period, however, an extra
assistant was engaged to undertake    the reduction of these arrears.      By
this means good progress has been     made with the first portion of this
                         of the " fair and " subsidiary " tabulations for
work, the preparation                 "
the years 1871-1873.
   Magnetic data have been supplied to Sir W. Thomson,         LL.D., Dr.
Atkinson, Capt. Ettrick Creak, R.N., Mr. Woodward, and          Mr. H. A.
Rowland.
   The TJnifilar and Dip-circle lent to the Eev. S. J. Perry for use at
 Kerguelen Island on the Transit-of- Venus Expedition, as mentioned in
last Eeport, have been returned by that gentleman.    A Unifilar lent from
Kew, in the year 1869, to Capt. Elagin, Imperial Russian Navy, was
returned by him in February of this year, and at his request the con
stants were redetermined     and the results  forwarded  to him.    He has
left  a Dip-circle at Kew to be repaired.
   Meteorological Work. — The several self-recording  instruments    for the
continuous registration respectively of Pressure, Temperature, Humidity,
Wind (Direction and Velocity), and Rain have been maintained in regular
operation as usual under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker, assisted by T.
Gunter.      The daily standard eye-observations for the control of the
automatic records have been made regularly.
   In addition to the regular work of Kew as one of the self-recording
Observatories in connexion with the Meteorological Office, the duty of
examining and checking the work of all the seven Observatories of the
same character has been carried on, in accordance with the method de
scribed in the Report of the British Association for 1869. This portion
of the work has been performed by Messrs. Cullum, Hawkesworth, and
Deane.     In the month of August application was made to the Observa

104                    Report of the Kew Committee.
tory by the Meteorological Office for the services of one of the staff to
take temporary charge of the Valencia Observatory, owing to the serious
illness of the Superintendent of that Station, the Bev. Thomas Kerr, who
has since died.    Mr. Cullum at once consented to undertake the duty,
and he has remained at Valencia up to the present time.        This change
has necessarily weakened the working power of Kew in the special de
partment now under consideration ; and in consequence a certain amount
of arrears have accumulated, but these will be ere long cleared off.
    The only change as regards the photographic instruments has been the
substitution of copper chimneys for the gas-jets for the glass chimneys
formerly in use, an alteration which has proved to be beneficial.
    The result of a careful comparison of the thermogram tabulations at
the several observatories, obtained by the use of the fiducial lines traced
on the curves by photography, with the standard readings, has shown
that the original glass scales supplied (the values for which had been
determined at Kew in 1868) were not in all instances sufficiently exact,
and new scales have accordingly been supplied where requisite.
    Electrometer. — The Self-recording Electrometer continues in operation.
 Some imperfection, of which the cause was not clearly ascertained, inter
rupted the continuity of the action of the instrument in August ; but this
was overcome and the record resumed.         Experiments for obtaining the
scale-value have been made by the use of a battery of 100 Bunsen's cells.
    Mr. Ellis, Superintendent of the Meteorological and Magnetic De
partment at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, has visited Kew, by
direction of the Astronomer Eoyal, in order to examine the instru
ment, in the view of the possible procuring of a similar apparatus for
Greenwich.

ferred to Greenwich for the use of the Astronomer Boyal has been
 reported by him to be ready for immediate return to Kew.
    The re-examination of the measurements of the Kew sun-pictures, as
noticed in the last Eeport, has been steadily carried on throughout the
year (at the expense of Mr. De La Eue, D.C.L.) by Mr. Whipple, assisted
 by Mr. M'Laughlin, who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose.
    The eye-observations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath
Schwabe, have been made daily by Mr. Foster, when possible, as de
scribed in the Eeport for 1872, in order, for the present, to maintain
the continuity of the Kew record of sun-spots.
    Extra Observations. — The experiments with a Photometer for measur
ing the total intensity of daylight, which has been designed by Prof. H.
 E. Eoscoe, Ph.D., have been continued during the year, as mentioned
in last Eeport.       The original instrument provided by Prof. Eoscoe
having proved defective, it was replaced by another, which remains on
 trial.

in Kew Gardens were resumed in November 1874, after an interval of                a
few months, and were continued            until March, when the experiments
were concluded, having lasted over nearly two years.           The results have
 been sent to the Meteorological Office, at the expense of which Depart
 ment the investigation was conducted.
    A   commencement has been made of the observation of Solar Radiation
 at Kew     ; and Thermometers for that purpose (" Black bulbs in vacuo,"
 by different makers) have been placed in the grounds and read regularly.
    The Registering Sundial invented by Mr.            J.  F. Campbell, F.G.S.,
 which has been in operation for several years at the Office of the Local
 Government Board, 8 Richmond Terrace, Whitehall,               has  been   trans
 ferred to Kew, and is in action at the Observatory.             It consists of a
 glass sphere and wooden bowl, and the effect is measured by the amount
 of wood charred by the sun's action in the course of six months.              Ex
 periments are in progress to obtain a satisfactory daily record of the
 duration of the sun's heating-action by a similar method.
                     — This department of the Observatory continues to ex
     Verifications.
 hibit increased activity, and, in more than one respect, important steps
 have been taken with the view of augmenting its efficiency.
    The following magnetic instruments were verified : —
               2 Unifilars for the Arctic Expedition.
               2 Declinometers   for the Arctic Expedition.
               2 Barrow's Dip-circles for the Arctic Expedition.
               3 Fox's Circles for the Arctic Expedition.

               1 Dip-needle for H.M.S. Challenger.'
  Constants were determined for 3 Magnets for the Admiralty.
    The set of Magnetographs ordered by Capt. C. Pujazon for the Marine
  Observatory of San Fernando, near Cadiz, have been constructed, and,
 after verification at Kew, have been forwarded.
     A similar set of Magnetographs has been ordered by Dr. Vogel for
  the new Astrophysical Observatory at Potsdam, near Berlin.
     A Unifilar and Dip-circle have been obtained for Padre F. Denza, of
  the Observatory of Moncalieri, and have been forwarded to him after
  verification.
     The following meteorological instruments           have been verified, this
  portion     of the   work  being  entrusted  to Mr. T.  "W. Baker, assisted by

   In  addition, 272 Thermometers        have been tested at the melting-point
of mercury.
   The Committee are glad to say that this department of the operations
at Kew shows a very satisfactory increase in utility, as is proved by the
following statement, showing the fees paid for the verification of
Barometers and Thermometers during the three years 1873-75 : —

   The increase has been mainly under the head of instruments received
from opticians.
   The Committee have it in contemplation to improve the utility of Kew
for the verification of instruments by opening an office in London for
their receipt, so as to relieve opticians from the trouble of sending the
instruments to Kew and fetching them back again.
    13 Standard Thermometers         have been calibrated and divided at      Kew.
   The following is the list of miscellaneous           instruments    which   have
been verified   : —
               Hydrometers                                        150

    A  Thermograph     has  been    tested and its scale-values    determined for
the Mauritius Observatory.
    A double box Sextant, together with a Transit-Theodolite, has been
obtained, verified, and forwarded to Major Knight in India.
    The apparatus      devised by Mr. F. Galton for facilitating the veri
fication of Thermometers, which was mentioned in the last Beport, has
been    erected at Kew, and has been found of great service, especially
in the way of affording means of maintaining high temperatures for a
considerable length of time.
    A number of tubes of exceptional range, for the construction of
 Standard Thermometers, have been added to those at present in stock.
    With reference to the testing of Anemometers, as mentioned in last
Beport, with the hope that the experiments with artificial rotation would
be resumed on a future occasion, it has been found that the large expense

                         Report of the Keio Committee.                     107
which would be entailed to provide a suitable apparatus for use at Kew
would exceed the resources of the Observatory.           These investigations
have therefore not been carried out hitherto.
    It  has  appeared desirable to replace the Cathetometer used in con
nexion with the Standard Barometer by a new instrument ; and accord
ingly such     an apparatus is in process of construction.   As soon as this
is completed it is intended to institute a comparison between the Stan
dard Barometers at Kew and Greenwich, the Astronomer Boyal having
 most readily consented to such an operation.
    Information on meteorological results has been supplied to Mr. G.        J.
 Symons, the Secretary of the Northern Institute of Mining Engineers,
 Mr.   K. J.   Marks, and the Editor of the ' Illustrated London News.'
    Pendulum Apparatus. — In the use made of the Kew pendulum vacuum-
 chamber by Capt. Heaviside, B.E., in the course of the year 1874, it was
 found that a certain amount of deterioration in the joints had taken
 place.     These have since been newly ground and rendered air-tight so as
 to  be ready   for use.
     Mr. C. J. Peirce, of the United States Coast Survey, having made
 through the Admiralty an application to the Boyal Society to be
 allowed to swing his pendulums at Kew, has at once received permis
 sion, and the experiments will be undertaken in the course of the ensuing
 year.
     Two Iron Tripods, which had been formerly used for swinging in
 variable pendulums, and had remained in. store at Kew, were granted by
 the Committee to the Hydrographer for the service of the Arctic Ex
 pedition.      They were repaired at the expense of the Admiralty ; and
 while one of them still remains at Kew, the other has been supplied to
 the Expedition, together with the wooden clock-supports ; at the same
 time an Astronomical Clock (Shelton, No. 35) was also supplied to the
 Hydrographic Office.
     Chronometer Testing. — It has been under deliberation during the year
 whether or not it would be advisable to institute at Kew an Office for
 the testing    and rating of Chronometers,    of  a similar character to that
 conducted at Bidston Observatory by Mr.       J.  Hartnup.
     The President and Council of the British Horological Institute have
 expressed themselves favourably to the proposal in a scientific point of
 view ; but as yet no decision has been arrived at by the Committee.
     Instruction given. — Four Officers from the Arctic Expedition attended
 at   Kew for instruction in the     use  of Magnetic instruments, and two
 others for instruction in the swinging of pendulums and in the use of
 the Transit-Instrument.       The final observations of these gentlemen were
 recorded for making Kew a base station.           Certain modifications in the
 absolute Magnetic instruments, designed by Mr. Whipple for adaptation
 for use in high latitudes, have been effected to the satisfaction of the
  Hydrographer.

 was most kindly presented to the Committee by his executors in the
 month of April.
    The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus, such as the Whitworth
 Lathe and Planing-Machine, procured by Grants from either the
 Government-Grant Fund or the Donation-Fund, for the use of the
 Kew Observatory, have been kept in thorough order ; and many of them
 are in constant and others in occasional use at the Observatory.

                               APPENDIX.
 Magnetic Observations    made at the Kew Observatory,   Lat. 51° 28' 6" N.,
    Long.  Oh 1" lo'-l W.,for    the year October 1874 to September   1875.
   The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked KC1, and
the Kew 9-inch TJnifilar Magnetometer by Jones, the property of the
Magnetic Office, directed by General Sir E. Sabine.
   The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose.
   The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33, the needles
1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3£ inches in length.
   The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
   These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the units in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English values to metric values being 0-46108.
   The moment of inertia of the magnet with its stirrup was determined
in 1858 by the late Mr. Welsh, as were also the coefficients applied in
corrections for temperature variations and terrestrial induction.
   The value of log ir'JK employed in the reduction is 1-64457 at tem
perature 60°.
   The induction-coefficient  /* is 0-000194.
   The correction of the magnetic power for temperature       t0 to an adopted
standard temperature of 35° Fahr. is
                0-0001194(<o-35)     + 0-000,000,213(<o-35)a.
   The true distances between the centres of the deflecting 'and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar
marked 1-0 ft. and 1-3 ft., are 1-000075 ft. and 1-300097 ft. respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force of
the suspension-thread subsequently.
   No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer             or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.
   The value of the constant P, employed in the formula of reduction
-_£(l_»),i.-«H»U*
   In  each observation   of absolute Declination the instrumental    readings
have been referred to marks made        upon  the stone obelisk  erected about

112                   Report of the Kew Committee.
a quarter  of a mile north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the
orientation of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was determined
by the late Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.

        Received August 30, 1874. Revised October 2, 1875.

 magnetic rotation of      a vertical bar-magnet or conducting-wire          upon its

122                           Mr. G. Gore         on the Rotations                    [Dec. 9,
axis by Ampere, Faraday, Sturgeon, and others, the magnet or wire has
either been immersed a large portion of its depth in mercury, or its
middle part has been connected by a wire with a surrounding annular
channel filled with mercury, and the electric current passed into or out of
the magnet or wire by means of that liquid, and the mercury has
formed an essential part of the arrangement.
     2.   In       treatises on electro-magnetism, either no explanation
               different
or different ones are given of the cause of the rotation of the magnet or
wire.    The most usual cause assigned is the action of the portion of
current in the mercury and the fixed conductor immersed in it upon the
current in the rotating wire or magnet                     ;   and the correctness of this ex
planation is proved by the simultaneous                        movement of the mercury in the
opposite direction.
  De la Rive, in his Treatise                 on Electricity (English edition, 1853, vol.
i. page 259), very correctly remarks,
                                      " It must not be supposed that the
phenomenon of rotation is due, as has been erroneously stated, to the
action upon the magnet of the portions of the current that traverse                           it,
or that traverse the conducting-wires attached to the magnet and move
with it. In fact, how could a solid system be set in motion by a force
emanating from      portion of the very system itself, and connected with
                         a
itin an indissoluble manner      The action can only arise from a part of
                                          ?
the current which    independent of the system that moves.
                             is                              This part
                                  not connected with the magnet that                          is is
the portion of the circuit which                is
set in rotation, and which consequently      situated independent of the
                                                                is
system in motion.    This kind of action has been calculated by M. Ampere
in   perfectly rigorous manner."

  3. Although the action of the portion of the current in the mercury and
the fixed conductor in contact with      upon the movable current in the

                                     is   a
cumstances          cooperate to produce the rotation, and which are
                    which
themselves capable, without assistance, of producing it. "Wiedemann*
and myself   have shown that an electric current passing from one end to
                t
the other of   magnetized iron rod or wire having dissimilar poles at its
                    a
two extremities produces torsion of the wire (the two ends of the wire
moving of course in opposite directions), and that reversing the direction
either of the current or of the magnetic polarity, reverses the direction of
the twist. In all published cases of rotation of bar-magnets on their
axes by the influence of electric currents, the two ends of the magnet have
had dissimilar poles.    By meditating upon certain facts connected with
this subject,     concluded that, by passing
                   I                               current from one end to
                                                                     a

that conclusion.

    4. Upon a thin wooden tube 15 oentims. long and 7 millims. bore                    I
wound a cotton-covered copper wire 1*7 millim. diameter from one
end of the tube to the middle, then reversed the' direction of winding
and continued to the other end and back to the middle, again reversed
and coiled to the first end of the tube; by which arrangement the
passage of a current through the coils produced two similar poles at the
ends of the tube, and two others of the opposite kind at the middle.
    The tube being now fixed in a vertical position, a straight iron wire
15 oentims. long and 1*8 millim. diameter, pointed at its lower end and
surmounted      by a brass mercury-cup 5 millims. diameter, containing a
drop of mercury, was supported entirely within the tube and free to
rotate, by a similar cup (surmounting a fixed vertical brass rod), at the
lower end of the tube, the upper end of the axial wire being kept in
position by a vertical brass rod fixed above the coil and terminated at its
lower end by a sharp point of platinum in the mercury-cup.
    A current from 6 one-pint Grove's elements arranged as 3 being
now passed through the coil, brass rods, and axial wire, the latter rotated
rapidly.
    With   a downward     current through the axial wire, and north poles * at
the ends of the tube, the upper end of the wire rotated in the same
 direction as the hands of a watch.              Eeversing the direction of the
 current either in the coil or iron rod, reversed of course the direction of
 motion.     The rotation in this case was not due to obliquity of coil-
 current, because that was neutralized by the second layer of coils ; nor to
 portions of transverse currents proceeding to or from the brass rods,
 because each of those portions was 10 centims. distant from the ends of
 the axial wire ; nor was it due to the portions of current entering or
 leaving the coil, because they entered and left at the same part and in
 parallel directions, and thus neutralized each other's effect. A copper wire
 substituted for the iron one would not rotate, probably because copper is
 so little capable of acquiring longitudinal magnetism.
     5. To ascertain if the rotation was merely due to an action of the
 current in the coil upon either the axial current or longitudinal magnetism
 of the iron, or whether the coil-current simply performed the function of
 longitudinally magnetizing the axial wire,        I  took an iron wire 23 centims.
 long and 2-7 millims. diameter, sharp-pointed at its lower end, soldered
 to its upper end a double wire of cotton-covered copper, each wire being
 1-7 millim. diameter, coiled the double wire upon the axial rod in two
 layers (so as to enable two similar poles to be formed at the extremities
 of the axis), and terminated the copper wires by a little brass mercury-cup
    * By a North pole I mean that which points to the South, and hy a South one that
 which seeks the North.    Because if we call that end of a magnet the north which is
 repelled by the south pole of the earth and attracted by the north pole, we call by dis
 similar and opposite names two things which are essentially alike, and by similar
 names two things which are essentially different and opposite.

          above                                        By supporting this
apparatus as the axial wire in the previous experiment, and passing the
current, rotation occurred, showing that the chief use at least of the coil-
current was to impart longitudinal magnetism to the axial wire, and that
the rotation was not simply due to any reaction between the coil and that
wire. Reversing the direction of the current did not reverse the direction
of rotation.                                                      I
               In another experiment similar to this, formed about 12
centims. in length of the middle part of the axial wire of copper instead
of iron, and obtained similar rotation ; but as copper is only slightly
capable of acquiring longitudinal magnetism from a coil-current sur
rounding          it,
                precisely similar apparatus having an axial wire composed
                    a
entirely of that metal would not rotate.
   These experiments and the following ones produce          striking effect in
                                                                  a
a lecture, because the rotation appears to be produced without reaction
of the moving part of the apparatus upon any external or fixed body.
      To determine whether the longitudinal element of the coil-current
     6.
obtained by obliquity of winding of the wire might be substituted for
the longitudinal current through the magnet,           took an iron wire 13

soldered near to that end one extremity of        cotton-covered copper wire

1*7 millim.  in diameter, coiled the   latter in one direction to the middle
part of the iron wire, then reversed the direction of winding and coiled
to the other end of the iron, and terminated the coil by       little brass cup
                                                                      a
just above the upper end of the iron wire as before. By supporting this
apparatus as in the previous experiments, and passing the current, rapid
rotation took place, proving that longitudinal current in the iron itself
                                           a
was not necessary.

end of the coil wire direct to the brass cup, continued I
the copper wire vertically downwards to the bottom of
the coil, to neutralize the effect of obliquity of winding;
then carried     outwards and upwards in the form of

the current rotation occurred freely, showing that the
longitudinal current was not essential to the motion.
This experiment, and that described in paragraph      ap    4,
pears to prove that the rotation     not an effect of any
                                          is
obliquity or spiral arrangement of the axes of the magne
tized iron molecules with regard to the axis of the wire, produced      the  by
combined action of the transverse and longitudinal elements of the
current in the coil, because the latter element was neutralized, but that it
is an effect of the tangential poleless magnetism in the fixed wires above

1875.]                       of Bar-magnets and Conduding-wires.                       125
and below upon the longitudinal magnetism of the movable iron axis
and its coil.
   8. As an electric solenoid, however, possesses in some degree many of
the properties of a magnet, its longitudinal magnetism, though feeble,
must have operated in some of the previous experiments ; and therefore       I
now tried to obtain rotation of one by the action of vertical currents.
Upon a very thin wooden tube 15 centims. long and 12 millims. external
diameter        I
             coiled a single stout cotton-covered copper wire from one end
to the other, reversing the direction of winding at the middle of the tube,
and surmounting the upper end of the wire by a small brass cup con
taining mercury.      The lower end of the wire was sharply pointed, and
the coil was   supported as in the previous experiment.     By passing the
current from 6 one-pint Grove's elements arranged as 3, faint signs of
rotation were observed.
   9. In each of these cases of rotation an upward vertical current
entering a lower south pole or leaving an upper one caused the upper
end of the rod to rotate in the direction of the hands of a watch, and a
downward current entering or leaving a north pole also produced that
direction of motion, and reversing the poles in either case reversed the
effect.
   10.     In   each        of these instances of rotation, without the aid of   a current
near the middle of the magnet, the coil being so constructed that the
current in it could not be reversed without reversing that in the fixed
conductors near              it,
                   reversing the direction of the current did not reverse
that of the rotation, because the two acting influences were reversed
together and therefore each apparatus had its own direction of rotation,
            ;
either right-handed or left-handed (kt\)*, according to the direction in
which its coils were wound.    It follows from this that    current the  a
direction   of which       alternately reversed will drive the apparatus quite
                                   is
as well as one   in one   uniform   direction.
    11. As the rotation was apparently due to the influence of the tangential
poleless magnetism of the portions of vertical current in the fixed con
ductors upon the longitudinal magnetism of the vertical iron axis and its
coils,

lower brass rod another fixed coil, similar to the upper one, but of an
opposite direction of polarity, and passed the current again ; still more
rapid rotation in the same direction took place, and the effect was very
striking. In this latter instance two south poles free to move were
opposed to two fixed north poles, and in each instance the current was
passed upwards.     In the second experiment also the longitudinal
magnetic      influence      of   each  opposed iron axis and coil acted upon the
tangential     magnetism          of the longitudinal element of the end of the
copper coil-current opposed to                it,
                               and thus both the longitudinal and the
tangential magnetism of each of the four opposed ends cooperated to
produce   a   most effective result.
  With     a thicker        axial wire        in the moving coil the rotation was not   so
rapid and with an axial wire of the usual thickness, but a double layer
      ;
of copper-wire coils, and the current passing through the axial wire, the
rapidity of rotation was not much altered, probably because the increased
weight and friction counteracted the effect of the increased magnetism.
By substituting for the right-handed movable coil with south poles at
its extremities, in these experiments,      left-handed one with north poles

the current in the movable coil, acting upon the longitudinal magnetism
of the fixed iron axis and its coil, tended to produce rotation in one
direction, and the longitudinal magnetism of the movable axis and its
coil, acting upon the longitudinal element of the current in the fixed coil,
tended to produce rotation in the opposite direction.

and obtained rotation freely     in this case the motion was probably nearly
                                     :
wholly due to the action of the longitudinal magnetism of the adjacent
ends of the fixed axial wires and their coils upon the tangential magnetism
produced in the movable copper wire by the axial current.        Each of these
rotations agreed in direction with those of the movable coil.
   13. The apparatus represented in fig.            was employed for nearly

 end of which rested upon the top of a tall brass rod inside the brass
 pillar. The upper and lower fixed coils or rods E and F were insulated
 from the brass clips G- and H, and the battery was attached to the
 binding-screws    I  and J. K    is a binding-screw for connecting with the
 upper   coil or rod.
     14. I also obtained   rotation of the iron wire whilst the wire was m a
 horizontal   position, its ends resting in hollows in the ends of the iron
 axes of the two fixed coils, and the ends of those axes and of the movable
 wire lying upon the surface of pools of mercury in small watch-glasses.
 The movable iron wire was enclos8fii in the axis of a thin iron tube
 within a fixed coil, having appropriate and similar poles at its ends.
 The current from the thermopile produced very rapid rotation.           This

128      Mr. G. Gore      on the Rotations           of Bar-magnets,   fyc.       [Dec. 9,
result   proves   that   the rotations   are not due to terrestrial magnetic
influence.
    15. As the directions   of magnetic polarity, electric current, and rota
tion agree with those in the different forms of Ampere's experiment,
and as in most, if not all, of the previously known cases of rotation of a
bar-magnet or conducting-wire         on its axis an electric current passes
through    the  end of  the  bar   or  wire, it is evident that those rotations
were due, not only to the portions of current in the mercury and fixed
conductors connected with it near the middle of the magnet or wire, but
also to the influence of the currents in the fixed conductors near the ends
of the magnet or wire.

     The materials for this paper were obtained during the ' Challenger's
cruise from Japan to the Sandwich Islands in 35° lat. N., when very
curious Nauplii, some of them 12 millims. long, were caught, which were
identified at once as belonging to the nauplial form to which Dohrn has
                                    " Archizoea."     In the daytime these larvro
given the generic name of
were scarcer, but at night so common that large bottles could be filled
with them. The question (which had been left open by Dohrn) to which
 cirriped these extraordinary Nauplii might belong was solved when
large quantities of Lepas fascicularis were seen passing the ship for more
 than a week.        It was then possible to keep these barnacles alive and to
 bring up in      our globes such stages of the large Nauplii as had also been
taken on the surface.         Then, again, when catching the surface-animals,
 free-swimming pupse were found, which were seen to settle on dead
  Veldlce and assume the form of Lepas fascicularis, so that the whole
 development of this species could be worked out.
     Reasons      are given why this barnacle belongs to the species Lepas
fascicularis ; and a description is given of some parts of the mouth, which
 slightly differ from those described by Darwin in the same species.
              I.  Development  of the egg and   of the youngest Xauplius.
     The conclusions to which an investigation into the development of the
 ovum, and into the changes which occur in it after its formation up to
 the time when the Nauplius comes out, has led are the following : —
     1. The youngest eggs, seen in the caica of the ovarian tubes, are
 transparent cells with nucleus and nucleolus.
     2. The germinal vesicle, as well as the ovum, grows by taking up
 elements of yelk.
     3. All the ova found in the ovary of a barnacle are in the same stage
 of development.         When mature ova are to be seen in the tube, small
 undeveloped ova may be seen here and there in the caeca, which act very
 likely as mother cells for further breeding-purposes.
     4. The spermatozoa, when fully developed, are simple hair-like
 filaments.
     5.  The mature ovum, as contained in the breeding-lamellae, shows no
 trace of the vesicula germinalis nor of its nucleolus.            Some highly re
 fractive   granules may be seen       here and there among the yelk-globules.
 The ovum is oval in form.
     6.  The segmentation is very irregular, but       seems to be complete.

130                       Dr. R. von Willemoes-Suhm on the                        [Dec. 9,
    7. Ab soon as the segmentation begins, large transparent                 cells are seen
separating themselves from the yelk-globnles,               and increasing in number
as the segmentation goes on.
    8. These cells form a blastoderm round the yelk.                   No primitive streak
could be seen   but its presence is not denied, as the object is not favour
                      ;
able for these observations.
   9. The blastoderm loses its cellular structure and gives way to a
granular skin.            On both sides of     a   longitudinal groove three pairs of
appendages begin to be visible.
   10. The test of the ovum extends as the embryo develops.   The latter
is very likely still enveloped by a thin blastodermic cuticle, which is
clearly visible at the ends of tail and antenna, when it comes out.
   11. The development of the Nauplius in the ovum of this Lepas shows
very much the same stages as those described by Buchholz in Balanus
improvisus.
                                II. Tlu      Nauplius   stages.
    1.The Nauplius of Lepas fascieularis has, when leaving the egg, a
length of 0-35 millim. It moults at least five times, and has before
throwing off for the last time the Nauplial appendages a length of
12 millims.
   2. The first stage of the Nauplius has been seen by Darwin, who
describes       it,
             and also          by
                           Burmeister.
   3. After the first two moults the Nauplius gets         large dorsal spine
                                                                       a
and enters    series of stages, one of which has been described in another
                 a
Lepas      by
           Dohrn  as Archizoea gigas.
   4. Beasons are given why Archizoea gigas           nearly certain to be
                                                                  is
the Nauplius of Lepas australis,      species closely
                                              a       allied  to Lepas fasci
eularis, and representing      south of the equator.
                                    it                  Archizoea gigas was
caught, together   with the  large Cyprides  of Lepas  australis,  during the
 Challenger's antarctic cruise.

  5. The tail and the caudal spine of the newly hatched Nauplius are
pushed in like the tubes of     telescope, and covered by
                                         a                thin cuticle,     a
which may be the blastodermic one.   The same envelops also the lateral
horns, but has not been seen at the end of the appendages.          The
carapax   as yet quite smooth,
            is                 with the lateral horns hanging down.
    6.    After the first moult the tail and its spines, which have             been pushed
out, have   considerable length, and the lateral horns are erected.
                a                                                    Only
a single pair of small spines     to be seen on the carapax.
                                         is                    The glands
inside are unicellular.
     7.The Nauplius after the second moult has, besides the dorsal spine,
a  series of processes all round the edges of the carapax, to which the
unicellular glands send their ducts. Besides the oesophagus, two glands,
which formerly were indicated by an agglomeration of cells, become
visible.  These glands are very likely those which, in the Cypris stage,

terminate in the sucker of the antenna, and are known under the name
of cement-glands.        Mouth and anus are present. One pair of movable
spines on the tail.      First " Archizoea stage."
    8. Length of Nauplius in the fourth stage 6 millims. Three or four
movable spines on the tail, with the six of the next stage shining through
the chitinous coverings.        The glands of the carapax are in connexion
with nerves, and present a large network.             No nerve-terminations on
the lateral horns nor on the feelers.        All the processes of the carapax,
as well as the lateral horns, have openings at the top for letting out the
secretions of the glands.
    9. Length of Nauplius in the fifth and last stage 12 millims.              Six
movable spines on the tail.
    Large masses of fat are assembling in the carapax, and the Cypris-
 shell is forming underneath it. The first pair of appendages develops
inside the antennae of the Cypris, the sucker being formed in the fourth
joint, the second of the future antenna.           Large compound eyes become
 visible on both sides of the central eye.
    10. The carapax of the Naupliut has now a diameter of 2 millims.
 The appendages are very much like those of Archizoea gigas, in which
 Dohrn, however, has taken the third pair of appendages for the second,
 and the second for the third.
    11. A specimen of the supposed larva of Lepas australis (Dohrn's
 Archizoea gigas) is figured in the stage just before the metamorphosis
 into the Cypris stage takes place ; the two large compound eyes have
 already developed.
                          III.  The Cypris or pupa     stage.
    1.  The Cypris of the Atlantic, C.fascicvlaris,    has been already described
 by    Claus,   who   has   established  the  homology    of its parts with the
 Copepods.
    2. Darwin      has described the very large Cypris of Lepas australis
 (length   3  millims.),  which is in every way similar to that of the present
 species  —  a further proof of the probability of the suggestion that Dohrn's
 large   Nauplii   are the larvae of that species.
    3. Our Cypris has a length of 1*3 millim.
    4.  A description is given of the antennae with the suckers and their
 glands, the development of which from the glands in the labrum has been
 mentioned already.        The parts of the mouth (small labrum and three
 pairs of maxillae and maxillipeds) and the natatory feet, as well as the
caudal appendages with the anus at their base, are figured and described.
The organs of sense, the digestive organs, and the shell-gland, which is
now very conspicuous, offer scarcely any thing that has not been seen
already by Darwin and Claus in the Cyprides of the different species of
Lepas.

          IV. The      metamorphosis     of the Cypris into the  young Lepas.
    1.  The   pupae are chiefly caught at the very surface         of the  sea, where
they swarm round the dead Velellas, on which they settle.                 They rarely
take to a colony of old barnacles.
    2. Soon after settling the new cirri are formed underneath the nata
tory feet, the head grows out, the eyes are absorbed, and under the
 Claris-shell the primordial valves of the young Lepas appear, which
persist during its whole life.             The Cypm-shell, with the old natatory
feet, is then thrown off.
    3. The young Lepas begins to form the complete shell, and fastens
itself more and more by the copious secretions of its glands, which run
through the outdrawn and enlarged head into the fixing-antennae.
    4. The cirri of the young Lepas develop a larger number of joints, the
shell begins to lose its transparency, the body inside turns over a little,
as has been described by Darwin, and the young Lepas is complete.
                                          Conclusion .
    1.   As the young stages of the Lepadidae are pelagic, it is only
possible to work out their development at sea, and there at certain
 seasons.     We found only       onee before the large   Nauplii of Lepas australis.
The development of no one of the Lepadidae has hitherto been known in
full ; and it seems that even the adult larva? of our commonest barnacles,
6uch as L. anatifera and L. aserifera, are as yet unknown.
    2.   The Nauplius         stages   of Lepas fascicularis have not a different
morphological       value from those of Balanus and other genera ; therefore
 there is no reason for giving to this stage a particular name. The term
 " Archizova "
                   may remain as a remembrance of Dohrn's interesting
 discovery,    but  cannot be applied to the larva? of other Lepadida?.

     Since we left Australia       I have investigated   the metamorphoses of some
  Crustacea     which    have been      constantly caught by us on the surface of
 the tropical and subtropical parts of the Pacific.             Though these investi
 gations will be continued,          I have now arrived at certain results which       I
 think will not be uninteresting to zoologists.                The genera to which
  these remarks refer are Amphion, Sergestes, and Leucifer.

but in which caudal appendages are already developed.

the last pair of legs.

"We have caught two very interesting mature animals which are certainly
closely allied to Amphion.    One of these has enormously long eye-stalks,

                        a        millims., are just as long as the whole

especially remarkable for the antepenultimate joints of its pereiopods,
being large paddle-shaped organs, terminated by         very small end-joint.
                                                                           a

that of Amphion.       They certainly belong both to the same genus, and
may be called Amphiones until more than one specimen of each has been
obtained.
   To me these Amphionidae are especially interesting, as can compare                I
them with the larvae of Sergestes and Leucifer, the former of which have
also got eight pairs of branched legs and the central eye which persists
in the Amphionidae.       There are good reasons for the statement that the
larvaB of Leucifer and Sergestes pass through an Amphion stage; and this,
it  seems to me, throws       good deal of light on the relations and systema

134          On the Development         of some Pelagic Decapods.          [Dec. 16,
mode of development is very simple.               After the first moulting the larva
gets six more branched legs and loses many spines.                     It enters the
Amphion stage, then moults, throws the branched legs off, gets branchial,
and becomes a young Sergestes.            Only after this last moulting the central
eye,  hitherto   present,  disappears.
   And very similar to that of Sergestes is the development of Leucifer.
Here the earliest Zoea of a species from the Western Pacific has got at
first no eyes, then sessile ones come out, and the animal then presents
the form which Dana has called Erichthina demissa, and which Claus
suspected to be not a Stomatopod but a Schizopod larva.                    After the
second moulting      this  Erichthina     gets   stalked eyes and  very long setae on
all its appendages, becoming a rather long, very delicate Zoea. It now
enters the Amphion stage, but never gets more than four pairs of pereio-
pods, and loses another pair of these when it moults for the youngest
Leucifer stage, in which two pairs of pereiopods are absent.
   The next question, after having found this out, was, of course, whether
Amphion, Sergestes, and Leucifer leave the egg as a Zoea, or whether
there is a preceding Nauplius stage.              My own impression is that in the
two first-named genera        this  is  not the case, as the youngest Zoeas which
I  caught had all the same size, and as none of them was without the
large lateral stalked eyes.        As for Leucifer, the question appears to me
to be doubtful ; for it is, from what           I  have seen, quite possible that my
youngest Zoea, which has only got a central eye, may be preceded by a
Nauplius. Of course the simplest thing would be to get the eggs ; but
there is the difficulty, for Amphion is caught very rarely, and has never
been obtained at any other time but between 8 and 12 p.m., when it is
extremely difficult by lamplight to find out the youngest stages. Sergestes
larvse are commoner, appearing also in the daytime, and Leucifer is
sometimes caught in abundance.              I  hope, therefore, that  I shall succeed
in completing my researches about this question, especially as far as the
two latter genera are concerned.

I. " On    the Development of the Spinal Nerves in Elasmobranch
      Fishes."     By F. M. Balfour, B.A., F.L.S., Fellow of Trinity
       College, Cambridge.      Communicated by Dr. Michael Foster,
      F.R.S., Praelector in Physiology in Trinity College, Cam
      bridge.     Received October 5, 1875.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The author commences by stating that the observations recorded in his
paper have been made upon the three following genera of Elasmobranchs
— SeyUium, Pristiurus, and Torpedo.
    The majority of his observations were made upon specimens procured
for him through the agency of the Zoological Station at Naples ; but he has
also been supplied in a most liberal manner with Scyllium embryos by
the Directors of the Brighton Aquarium, through the kindness of Mr.
Henry Lee. He finds that Torpedo embryos are by far more suitable than
any other genera he has employed for the investigation of the development
of the nerves.
    The author then gives a detailed account of his observations upon the
development of the spinal nerves in all the genera above mentioned.      The
following are the chief results at which he has arrived.
    The posterior and anterior roots of the spinal nerves arise as inde
pendent outgrowths from the involuted epiblast of the neural canal.
    The outgrowths for the two roots are at first quite independent of each
other, and only unite at a late period of development.
    The posterior roots are the first to develop. An outgrowth arises on
each side from the dorsal summit of the neural canal, which the author
believes to be unbroken throughout its whole length.        The outgrowths
on the two sides are at first in contact with each other ; and from each
there springs a series of processes equal in number to the muscle-plates.
    These processes are the rudiments of the posterior nerve-roots.     They
grow ventral wards in contact with the side of the spinal cord.
    After the formation of the posterior rudiments, the original outgrowths
 from the spinal cord cease to be attached to it along its whole length, and
 remain in connexion with it at a series of points only, each of which cor
 responds to a posterior root.
    The result of these changes is the formation of a series of nerve-roots,
 each attached to the dorsal summit of the neural canal, and all of them
 united  together dorsally by a continuous commissure, which is the rem
 nant of the primitive outgrowth from the summit of the neural canal.
    Subsequently the points of attachment of the posterior roots travel
 down the sides of the spinal cord, and finally remain fixed at about one
 third of the distance from its dorsal summit.   At the same  time the nerve-
 rudiments    undergo histological changes, by which each becomes divided
 into a root,  a ganglion, and a nerve.

 136                 Mr. W. K. Parker       on the Structure         [Dee. 16,
    At a still later period the nerve given off from the ganglion unites with
the anterior nerve-root.
    The development of the anterior nerve-roots is far simpler than that of
the posterior.
    Some little time after the appearance of the posterior roots there spring,
on each side, from the ventral corner of the spinal cord, a series of conical
outgrowths. These correspond in number with the muscle-plates, and are
the rudiments of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves.
    These outgrowths are not vertically below the posterior roots, a feature
which remains permanent in the adult.
    The points of attachment of the anterior roots undergo no change of
position like those of the posterior roots ; and after they have attained a
considerable size they unite with the latter.
    The author has also observed that the posterior roots of some and pro
bably of all the cranial nerves develop in the same way as the posterior
roots of the spinal nerves, and points out the bearing of this upon the
morphological relations between the spinal and cranial nerves.
    The remainder of the paper consists of a series of speculations upon
the bearing of the above-mentioned facts upon various physiological and
morphological problems.       These, for the most part, do not admit of being
abstracted.
    One point the author mentions is the probable homology of the commis
sure he has detected uniting the dorsal ends of the posterior nerve-roots
with the commissure he has described in a previous paper ("A preliminary
Account of the Development of the Elasmobranch Fishes," Quart. Journ.
of Micros. Science, October 1874, plate 15. fig. 14), which at first unites all
the branches of the vagus nerve, and which is subsequently represented by
their common junction before uniting with the medulla oblongata.
II. " On      the Structure and Development             of the Skull in the
       Batrachia."— Part      II.    By W. K. Parker, F.R.S.         Received

                                    (Abstract.)
    In the present communication      I   wish to correct, as much as possible,
what now seems to be erroneous        in my former account of the Batrachian
skull (that of the frog, Phil. Trans. 1871), and also to describe and
illustrate the stages in the skulls of three kinds of toads.
    Happily for me, Professor Huxley took up this subject at the begin
ning of last year; and       I   had frequent opportunities     of working, as
well as for discussion, with him.
    It was soon made plain to me that in my former account of the
behaviour of the visceral arches        I  had been wrong in describing the
hyoid arch of the      third  stage  as  composed of an upper and a lower
piece.

     The supposed tipper piece was merely the outer edge of the arch in
front, the mandibular arch ; and therefore all reasonings upon the meta
morphosis, afterwards, of such a coalesced segment fall to the ground.
     Professor Huxley showed me, and my new researches told the same
tale, that the hyoid arch does not coalesce at all with the mandibular ;
that the " columella," whether answering to the " hyomandibular" of a
fish or not, has no existence as cartilage, even in young frogs and toads
that have taken to land life ; afterwards, when they are one third larger,
this cartilage appears.
     Professor Huxley, and my own observations agree with his, also
 showed me that the stapes is not formed by the separation of a plate of
already formed cartilage, but chondrifies later than the auditory sac and
 much earlier than the columella : in the Urodela it is formed by the seg
 menting off of a flap of the chondrified capsule.           Our mutual researches,
 after these errors were made evident to me, gradually brought us into
 greater harmony in our interpretation ; and the working out by Professor
 Huxley of Menobranchiis, and by myself of others of the Urodela, has
 been of great service in making clear the meaning of the more complex
 skull of the Anura,
      Being well provided with materials for working at the common
 toad's skull, and, through the kindness of friends*, for various stages of
 the two " aglossal" toads, namely Dactylethra and Pipa, it came to pass
 that    I was in a good position for searching out this subject further, with
 new light and new material.
      Moreover these are not the only types of the Batrachia that have more
 recently engaged my attention ; but the great bull-frog and the paradox
 ical frog have also had various stages of their skulls laboured at by me.
 These would have swelled my paper to too great a size ;                I  hope to offer
 them when the tree-frogs, Bombinator toads, and other kinds have been
 studied.
      In this  paper   I have given, first of all, correcter figures of the nasal
 labyrinth of the adult frog.        Before my former paper was in print            I had
 seen that in the bull-frog the       " trabecular cornua" kept their distinctness
  on the front nasal wall. Professor Huxley has discovered rhinal processes
 in liana    esculenta and   in Rana temporaria.      He also showed       me a  distinct
 nucleus of cartilage in front of the nasal         sac.    There are two such carti
                                                                                 " upper
  lages on each side, as     I  soon found, the modified and subdivided
  labials;" these are shown in the new figures.
      By comparison of the skull of the Anura with that of the tailed Am
  phibia, a better idea can be had of the relations of the mandibular pier
     *  I am indebted  to Professor Huxley for adult skulls of Dactylethra and Pipa ; to
  Dr. Dobeon, P.L.8., of Netley, for another adult Dactylethra ; to Mr. T. J. Moore, of the
   Liverpool Free Library and Museum, for four stages of the larval Dactylethra ; to Dr.

      VOL. XT IT.                                                              L

138                      Mr. W. K. Parker        on the Structure           [Dec. 16,
with the auditory capsule : newer and more correct names of the attaching
processes of the
                        " suspensorium " are here given, in accordance with the
nomenclature adopted by Professor Huxley in his memoir on Meno-
branchus (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1874, p. 186).
     For instance, the band which connects the mandibular arch primarily
with the trabecular is now called the " pedicle," and the secondary pro
cess which binds on the ear-sac is the
                                                      " otic process."    There is no
"                           "
                               over the orbito-nasal nerve, as in the salamandrian
    ascending process
forms     ;  and the apex of the pedicle losing its distinctness, its lower part
forms       a condyle which articulates with the outer face of the auditory
mass below.
     The apparent distinctness of this part in the young frog kept up the
illusion as to its being a part borrowed from the next arch. It was called
by me the
                 " infra-hyomandibular."
     The cartilage which        I erroneously supposed to be the rudiment of the
" columella " lies over the portio dura nerve ; it was called by me the
" supra-hyomandibular."              It is in reality the rudiment of the cartilagi
nous ear-ring.
     All this, thanks        largely   to my friend and fellow worker, is made
 plain now.
     In  frogs    it is not quite easy to recognize the supero-anterior element
of the      double hyoid arch     of osseous fishes in the columella ; in toads it is
 easier.
     In  the frog a small cartilaginous segment is cut off from the proximal
 end of the shaft of the columella, and lies between it and the stapes. In
 toads the proximal element is the longer of the two, and is distinguished
 by being ossified separately, and not by subdivision of the cartilage.
     Hence it is not a wild supposition that the proximal shaft-bone may
 be the
             " hyomandibular " and the distal the " symplectic," its unossified
 end being dilated as the
                                   " extrastapedial."
     In osseous fishes we have this supero-anterior            bar in the hyoid region
 ossified by        two   centres,   but   no  stapes ;  in  the TJrodela the stapes,
 but, as a rule, no supero-anterior bar ; in toads we have both, whilst in
 frogs the apex of the upper pier is a free nucleus of cartilage.
      The primordial cartilaginous skull of the common toad is here worked
 out, the subjects being tadpoles only one third of an inch in length ;
 their black colour and granular texture made them most difficult ob
 jects to interpret, and cost me much anxious labour.
      Then in a series of stages comparable with those of the common frog
  I  have traced the metamorphosis of the facial arches, so that the skull of
  the two common kinds of Batrachia will now be intelligible.
      In the tadpole of Dactylethra there is much that is new and strange ;
  there are neither suctorial mouth nor horny jaws.                  The upper labial
  forms the edge of a broad mouth with an underhung lower jaw, the
 head being extremely depressed, as in certain siluroids and in the frog-
  fish (Lophius).

 1875.]          and Development       of the Batrachian Skull.                  139
     The labial " tape"   coalesces   with the trabecule, and is continued on
each side as a long cartilaginous string, which forms the pith of a ten
tacle which reaches as far as the end of the abdomen.
    The branchial orifices are both open right and left (not the left only,
as in the common kinds), and the fore Jimbs show their rudiments outside
the opercular fold. m
    All the details of this, the flattest and most foliaceous of all chondro-
crania described, are of the utmost interest, but cannot be described
here.
     In  this type young toads with four large legs have no trace of a
cartilaginous
                 " columella ;" and yet in the adult that structure is by far
the largest    I  have yet seen, the " extrastapedial
                                                           "
                                                              itself being shaped
like a waterlily-leaf, and is relatively of the size of the whole auditory
ring of the bull-frog.
     This species has only one vomer and no bony palatines ; its original
labial band forms a pair of nasal pouches, and it acquires four more pairs
of these cartilages above and loses the lower pair.
     Dactylethra has the upper element of the
                                                      " girdle-bone " a "
                                                                             super-
             "
ethmoidal      plate ; but the  ossification of the chondrocranium     itself is not
in the ethmoidal but in the sphenoidal region. The huge tympano-
 Eustachian vaults open by one orifice in the pharynx; its "interhyal"
 is a ligament attached in the normal position ; it has two true tympanic
 bones on each side (like those of certain birds), besides the large carti
 laginous annulus, and its squamosal and quadrato-jugal              are more like
 those of a tortoise than of an ordinary Batrachian.
     Its quadrate bone is ossified, as in Ganoid and Teleostean fishes and
 tailed Amphibia.
     But the Surinam toad      (Pipa monstrosa) is a rarer creature than even
 Dactylethra, with which it agrees in being tongueless.
     The embryo is wound like a tape round the large yelk-mass ; it has a
  gaping broad mouth, with neither labial cartilages, nor horny jaws, nor
  " claspers." It has very small opercula, which do not cover the very
 early formed limbs : it has gill-arches and branchial vessels ; but these
 are not branched, for there are no gill-tufts or processes that               I  can
 discover.
     The cartilaginous skull of the embryonic Pipa is a very flat leafy
  structure, like that of the larval Dactylethra, but differing from it in
  many respects.      At this stage the fenestra ovalis is forming, but there is
 neither stapes nor columella ; at this time there is a large " cerato-hyal "
 in 'the usual place for a Batrachian larva, namely articulated to the man
 dibular pier not far above the condyle of the quadrate.
     In ripe young Pipas the metamorphosis is complete, although the
 shape of the adult skull is not attained.          Ossification is already rela
 tively nearly perfect ; three pairs of labials now supplement the defici
  encies of the nasal capsule, which is but little chondrified, and in the
                                                                      l2

auditory region the occipital arch and the two auditory capsules are one
continuous tract of bone.
    The stapes is perfect, and so is the columella with its two shaft-bones
in each stem ; its extrastapedial is like that of Dactylethra.
    The mandible is perfect, the cerato-hyals completely gone, and the
branchials are metamorphosed as completely (save that the       " thyro-hyals"
are not ossified) as in the adults of other Batrachia.
    The frontals and parietals have already coalesced ; in front there are
nasals, preorbitals, and septo-maxillaries, a pair of each ; but there is no
vomer ; there is a pair of styloid palatine bones.
    The premaxillaries and maxillaries lie entirely on the under or palatine
 surface  ;  there is no quadrato-jugal.
    In the adult the bones are very coarse, fibrous, and with strong ridges
 and deep excavations, as in certain osseous fishes.      There is no " girdle-
        "
 bone ;     the quadrate is now well ossified, and so is Meckel's cartilage,
the   " articulare
                    "
                      having grafted itself upon the rod.
    In neither   of these aglossal toads is there  a  " mento-Meckelian" bone
formed at the symphysis.
    In the adult Pipa the " occipito-otic" masses are stretched far out as
large bony arms, on the end of which is the exquisite tympanic apparatus.
 Both in young and old the superoccipital region is well ossified over as a
 complete bony arch, and now, in the adult, the occipital condyles look
 outwards ; the basioccipital region is a narrow synchondrosial tract.
    These are some of the most noteworthy things in Dactylethra and in
 Pipa.     The common toad shows most important differences from the
 common frog ; but these aglossal types are rich in morphological variation
 and full of morphological meaning.
    The satisfaction accruing to my own mind from the working out of
 these three (as well as other) types of the Batrachian skull will act as a
 strong stimulus to keep me a few years longer at the morphology of that
 group.
     As the attachment of the mandibular arch to the skull is      complex: and
 very important,     I venture to add a few remarks upon it.
 On the   " Suspensorium " or Pier           Mandibular Arch in
                                      of the                      the Amphibia
                                     generally.
     The Amphibia agree with three groups of fishes (namely, the " Mar-
 sipobranchii," the ChimsBroids, and the " Dipnoi ") in having their suspen
 sorium confluent with the skull.
    The simplest form of such a confluence has been shown in the present
 paper in the early condition of chondrocranium of the common toad,
 where the apex or dorsal end of the mandibular arch, during chondri-
 fication, unites with the outer side of the trabecular arch near its
 dorsal end.       Afterwards, in the same type, this confluence is much
more complex.

  1875.]         and Development       of the Batrachian Skull.               141
    For  a longer period in the   Urodela the suspensorium is quite separate
 from the trabecula ; as a rule it soon forms three attachments ; but in
 this group, as in the Anura, it never unites by confluence with the next
 or hyoid arch.
    Each of these groups has its typical method of attaching the suspen
 sorium, and each has types that show remarkable modifications.
    In Menobranckus and Sana (Huxley, he. cit.) we hare the two proper
 types of this structure in the adult.
    In the former, the Sauro-batrachian,        the apex of the mandibular arch
 unites with the trabecula near its apex on its outside by a process, the
 " pedicle," which lies beneath the trigeminal nerve.
    A second  or " ascending " process mounts over part of that nerve,
                                                                            espe
cially arching over the orbito-nasal and the Vidian branch of the facial nerve,
and it unites with the top of the alisphenoidal crest of the trabecula.
   A third, the " otic process," grows upwards and backwards, and unites
with the outside of the auditory capsule ; it is pedate, and its thick end
runs in front of the ampulla of the horizontal canal.
   In the typical adult Batrachian suspensorium the primary union of
the apex of the mandibular pier is afterwards lost, this part becoming
mere fibrous tissue ; but the lower part of the pedicle grows into a thick
triangular process of cartilage with its base upwards, and this base
becomes the " condyle of the pedicle ; it articulates with the side of the
                                            "
auditory capsule antero-inferiorly.          This condyle has its counterpart
in some of   the Urodela   as a  swelling  of  the pedicle near the origin of the
otic process below (Huxley, " On Menobranchus," plate 29. fig. 2).
   In the adult frog the suspensorium is united by a gliding joint to the
auditory capsule below, and by fusion of cartilage above and behind.
   As far as my observations go, Siredon agrees with Menobranchus ; in
Salamandra the swelling answering to the " condyle of the pedicle" is
very small, and the pedicle is suppressed. In the lowest type also, namely
Proteus anguinus, the ascending process only is present, and the otic pro
cess is small.     Some of the Batrachia differ from the frog in having
the lower part of the "pedicle" greatly enlarged at first, but very small
afterwards, forming a very small condyloid part ; whilst the apex is not
absorbed, but unites with the auditory capsule.             This is seen in Bufo
vulgaris.
   Moreover in that type and in Dactylethra, when the legs are well
developed, the otic process projects inwards in front of the auditory cap
sule. In Pseudis paradoxa this is very distinct as a thick, finger-shaped,
free process, which    passes   inwards   as  far   as the neck of  the foremost
ampulla.
   The last is an instructive condition,     as  it partly breaks down the fence
between the two groups of Amphibia ; for in the Urodela the otic process
is pedate, the toe projecting to nearly the same extent inwards as in
                                           "
Pseudis,    The term " suspensorium           must not be applied to the part

which carries both the mandible and the hyoid arch in most fishes — sharks,
rays, ganoids, and teleosteans.
    This part, the " hyomandibular," belongs to the second or hyoid arch,
and has no representative in most of the Sauro-batrachia, nor in the Ba-
trachia during their larval state.
    In Proteus, however, contrary to what is seen in the other tailed forms,
the proximal hyoid element is as massive as the mandibular pier, its
immediate " serial homologue."           This " hyomandibular " of Proteus is
attached by ligament to the suspensorium, the stapes, and the auditory
capsule ; it is not tilted upwards and forwards like its counterpart in the
 skate or osseous fish, but agrees      with that of the shark in being directly
articulated   to the cerato-hyal.       This, however, does not take place by
direct superposition ; but the hyomandibular is bevelled largely on its
inner face, and overlaps the cerato-hyal.          Had it been tilted upwards and
 forwards it would have applied itself to the outer face of the suspensorium
in the manner of the flat fore end of the Batrachian " columella," the
 extrastapedial.
    Such a structure   occurring in some low-generalized tailless amphibian
 could only be interpreted as the lump of organic clay out of which the
 columella had to be fashioned.
    Every anomaly in a frog or toad that shows how thin the middle wall
 of partition is between the two groups will increase to me the probability
 that the hyomandibular of the Proteus is the Batrachian columella " writ
 large"*.
       On signs of Vertebral Segmentation seen in      the cephalic part  of the
                                      Notochord.
    In   my paper on the skull of the fowl (plate 82. fig. 3. nc)            I   have
 figured the notochord in the third stage as having three partially formed
 segments.     The most distinct of these is the hindermost, and it is ossified.
 That osseous tract is the homologue of an early vertebral " centrum ; "
 and  if  the other  two spindle-shaped        regions were to ossify separately
 there would    be three rudimentary       cranial centra.
    In  toads of the first summer (sixth stage of this paper) the shrinking
 notochord has become submoniliform,             as in the chick, but it does not
 ossify.
    In the Salamandrian Amphibia, however, the notochord acquires a
 bony sheath in front ; and in Seironota perspicillata larva? half an inch in
 length show two very well marked cranial centra, the front one with a
 perfect osseous sheath, whilst the hinder segment has bony grains
 scattered   over the notochordal sheath.           This last has the hourglass-
 shape, and corresponds accurately in form with the rudimentary centrum
 of the first cervical vertebra.
    The dorsal ends of the trabecules occupy the apex of the notochord, and
                     * It is small in Spelerpes and Desmognathus,

in these larva of Seironota the hinder half of the front notochordal segment
is not invested by cartilage.           But the hinder, feebly ossified segment has
a cartilaginous plate on each side, which is already ossifying (as the ex-
occipital), and these ossifying cartilages are seen to be the accurate
counterparts      of the " neurapophyses" of the first cervical vertebra.
     Afterwards these cartilages grow forward and coalesce with the dorsal
ends of the trabeculee.
     These facts are in perfect harmony with what                I  have been asserting
for    some years past, namely, that the basioccipital            is not the hindermost
centrum of a series of cranial vertebras, but a single bone in the place of a
series, the distinctness        of which supposed series is lost, their segmenta
tion being       suppressed.         The modified anterior end of the vertebral
column forms the occipital arch. There are no developed cranial vertebra
in front of the " epencephalic," which used to figure as the hindermost
of four.

     The movements of         some    of the Medusae (e. g. Sarsia) appear to be as
voluntary as are those         of insects.    Some of the discophorous species of
naked-eyed Medusae*, when threatened with injury, manifest peculiar
 movements, which are quite distinct from the ordinary locomotor con
tractions.      These movements consist in a very strong and protracted
systole,   followed    by a slow and gradual diastole.           This spasm-like series
 of movements is never performed by any Medusa except when the
animal is being injured or threatened with injury.

     § 1. In the case of all the naked-eyed Medusas which               I have this year
 been able to procure (viz. thirteen species belonging to six of the most
 divergent genera)      I  find it to be true that excision of the extreme peri
 phery of     a nectocalyx      is followed by immediate, total, and permanent
 paralysis of the entire organ.            The severed margin, on the other hand,
 continues its rhythmical contractions as vigorously as when it was still in
 situ, and this for many hours after the operation.                Among hundreds of
 observations     I have   only met with one exception to the otherwise uniform
result of this operation.           The exception occurred in an individual belong
ing to the species Staurophora laciniata.
    * I adhere to  Forbes's classification only because I have not happened to meet with
any individuals   of the family Lucernariadje.

locomotor centres are aggregated in the margin of the swimming-organ                                ;
for in the case of this species  frequently happens that the paralysis
                                                it
caused by excision of the margin    permanent.     is

causes  greater degree of paralysis than does excision of the intermediate

sufficient to cause temporary and sometimes permanent paralysis, the
latter operation never causes either.  That all parts of the marginal
tissue between the eye-specks, however, are capable of originating impulses
to contraction,   proved by the fact that the smallest atom of this tissue,
                           is
when left in situ after all the rest of the margin has been removed,                                is
frequently sufficient to animate the entire nectocalyx.

marginal supply of locomotor centres into the marginal bodies        even                      is
more decided than      in the case of Sarsia. Indeed have no evidence
                                it   is                                  I

remarks made in      while stating the effects of removing the entire margin
                           §    2,
of gonocalyces, are equally applicable to the effects of removing the litho
cysts alone.     may add that in the case of Aurelia aurita, which from
                     I
its flattened shape admits of the fairest experiments being made in this
connexion, all the spontaneity of the margin, and so in many cases of the
entire animal,          is   without question seated exclusively in the lithocysts*.

                                III. Stimulation.
    § 1. All the tissues of all the Medusas are keenly sensitive to all kinds
of stimulation. When a swimming-organ is paralyzed by the operation
above described, it invariably responds to a single stimulation by once
performing that movement which it would have performed in response to
that stimulation had it still been in an unmutilated state.
    § 2. (a) To electrical stimulation, both of the direct and of the induced
current, the severed margins and the swimming-organs from which they
have just been removed are responsive.         There is an important differ
ence, however, between the two cases, in that while the severed margins
continue responsive to induction-shocks after they have ceased to be
affected by make and break of the direct current, the reverse is true of
the mutilated swimming-organs — these continuing responsive to malco
and break of the direct current after they have ceased to be affected by
strong induction-shocks, or even by Faradaic electricity with the secondary
coil pushed to zero (one cell).
     (6) By means of a DuBois-Eeymond induction-apparatus              and of
needle-point   terminals (the needle being passed through a small piece of
 cork as a support, and the cork being fixed to stage-forceps on the
 mechanical stage of a Boss microscope),     I was able to investigate the dis
 tribution of excitable tracts in Sarsia.    I found that there is an uninter
 rupted increase of excitability from the apex to the base of the nectocalyx,
 that the positions occupied by the radial tubes are tracts of comparatively
 high excitability, that the eye-specks are the most excitable portions of
 the margin, and that of the eye-specks the vesicular half is more excitable
 than is the pigment half.
     (c) When the marginal rim of any Medusa is removed in a continuous
 piece, with the exception of one small part, the result, of course, is a
 long strip of marginal tissue, which is free at all points save at the end
 which is left attached in situ. Upon now irritating the distal end of this
 marginal strip, a wave of contraction may invariably be seen to start from
 the point at which the irritation is applied, and with some rapidity to
 traverse the entire strip. When this contractile wave arrives at the
 proximal or attached end of the strip, it delivers its influence into the
 swimming-organ, which thereupon contracts in exactly the same manner
 as it does when itself directly irritated.    Of course spontaneous contrac
 tions are always originating in some portion or other of the severed strip ;
 and these give rise to contractile waves and to contractions of the swim
  ming-organ just in the same way as do the disturbances originated by
  stimuli.   In such of the discophorous species of naked-eyed Medusae,
 however, as respond to stimulation by the peculiar spasmodic movements
 of the nectocalyx already described, the difference between the effects
 upon the nectocalyx of contractile waves which originate in the severed
 strip spontaneously, and those which there originate in answer to stiniula

                  a very marked character ;
nectocalyx are as easily and as certainly excited by irritating any part of
the severed strip as they are by irritating the substance of the nectocalyx
itself.
     From this description it will readily       that a Medusa, when thus
                                                       be seen
operated upon, supplies all the conditions required for conducting experi
ments in electrotonus : the animal in this form                         is,

deal of labour over this part of my subject, but with no very satisfactory
results.  In the case of Staurophora laciniata, however, have sometimes       I
obtained decided indications of kathelectrotonus, but never any of anelec-
trotonus.     cannot yet speak decidedly with respect to Pfliiger's law.

in the comparative sensitiveness they show to make and break of the
current, upon the whole conform to the rules which are followed                                by   the
excitable tissues of other animals.
     /3.   Different species of Medusa? manifest                  differences   in the degree of
their sensitiveness to electrical stimulation.   In all cases, however, the
degree of sensitiveness     wonderfully high.

                                              is    portion of    strip of

severed margin,          the nectocalyx sometimes manifests                        uneasy motions
during      the   time the current  ispassing this, however,
                                                   ;                          is   perhaps due to
variations in the intensity of the current.
      When the intrapolar portion of the severed margin of S. laciniata
     2.
happens to be spontaneously contracting prior to the passage of the con
stant current, the moment this current     thrown in such spontaneous

contractions usually cease, and are seldom resumed until the current
is again broken, when they are almost sure to recommence.        This
inhibitory effect may be produced      great number of times in suc

   n. When the swimming-bell of Sarsia has had its margin removed, and
so (as proved by hundreds of experiments) has been entirely deprived of

hour.       I never but once saw a similar motion in a perfect animal, and
this was in the case of a specimen which was being poisoned with iron-
rust.       The motion may,      I   think, be explained by supposing that the
various systems of muscles are contracting without coordination ; but why
they should sometimes do this in response to electrical stimulation, and
why, when they do this, they should continue the action so long, these
questions      I  cannot answer.      In no other genus of the Medusae have        I
ever seen a       similar or corresponding action performed ; and even in the
 genus Sarsia its occurrence is comparatively rare.            It never begins spon
 taneously,      and  it appears  to   be most  readily  evoked   by submitting the
 paralyzed nectocalyx to a number of shocks, either from the direct or
 the induced current, in somewhat rapid succession.              When it does occur
 it is always continuous, i. e. it never spontaneously recommences after
 having once ceased.          When its period of duration is prolonged, the
 shivering motions become feebler and feebler, until they eventually fade
 away into quiescence.         The animal is then quite insensible to all further
 stimulation: the tissues appear to have died from exhaustion.                 These
 shivering motions may also be caused in Sarsia by slightly acidulating the
 water in which the mutilated nectocalyx is suspended.
      § 3. In their behaviour towards chemical stimuli, the excitable tis
  sues of all the Medusae conform in every respect to the rules which are
  followed by the nervo-muscular tissues of higher animals. Both the severed
  margins and the mutilated swimming-organs,                as well, I  may add, as
  severed polypites and tentacles, respond to applications of various acids,
  solutions of various metallic salts, alcohol, ether, glycerine, &c. Fresh
  water is quickly fatal to Medusae.
      § 4. My observations upon thermal           stimulation  are, for the present,
  reserved.
                                        IV. Section.
      §  1.  The extent to which the swimming-organs            of Medusae may     be
  mutilated without suffering de
   struction of their physiological
  continuity is in the highest degree
   astonishing.
      (a) Suppose the annexed dia
   gram to represent Sarsia in pro
   jection, the lines being cuts. It is
  evident     that a stimulus    origina
   ting at any point a in the mar
  gin cannot radiate its influence
   throughout the nectocalyx, except
   by traversing the course of the
   dotted line    ; yet in a specimen so
   cut the spontaneous contractions
    are as synchronous over the entire nectocalyx as they are in unmutilated

148                          Mr.   (x.  J.  Romanes on the                  [Dec. 16,
specimens.        Further, if the margin be now removed, the paralyzed bell
will respond to stimuli applied at any part, just as readily and simul
taneously over its whole extent as it would do were thero no system of
interdigitating cuts present.
   (6) If the margin of Sarsia be removed in a continuous strip, with the ex
ception of one end left attached tn situ, and if the section be then continued
in the form of a spiral having two or more turns from the base to the apex
of the cone, the contractile waves originating in the free portions of the
severed margin pass into the spiral upon reaching its point of origin,
and then run round and round the spiral from the base to the apex
of the cone. If the marginal strip be now removed altogether, the
paralyzed bell will respond to stimuli applied to any part of the spiral.
   (c) If seven lithocysts be removed from the gonocalyx of Aurelia aurita,
and if the remaining one be made the point of origin of a spiral section,
which is then carried round and round the disk-shaped gonocalyx, the
result is a long strip of contractile tissue, the contractile waves always
originating in the lithocyst at the end of the strip, and then running along
the strip until they deliver themselves into the remainder of the gono
calyx, which thereupon contracts.             The length and width of such contrac
tile strips are very important factors in determining whether the waves
pass all the way along the strip or become blocked at some point in its
length.      Nevertheless these are very far from being the only factors,
there being immense individual differences in the endurance of the con
tractile tissue under this form of section.               Sometimes the waves will
become blocked when the strip is only an inch or less in length ; while at
 other times the waves will pass freely from end to end of a contractile
strip which is only an inch wide and a yard long.
   § 2. How are the impulses transmitted from the locomotor centres of
Medusa) to the contractile tissues of their swimming-organs ? Have we
any evidence of more or less definite lines of discharge being present ? or
must we conclude that the contractile tissues are, throughout their extent,
of a functionally homogeneous nature ?
    (a) The fact that the contractile tissues endure such severe section
without losing their physiological continuity, appears to settle this question
in favour of the last-mentioned alternative.                 Nevertheless there is a
weighty body of evidence to be adduced on the other side.                 In the first
place, the extreme variations in their tolerance of spiral section which
are manifested by different individuals of the species Aurelia auritu
appear to be irreconcilable with the hypothesis of the tissue concerned
being functionally homogeneous.                But the following invariable fact is
still more   difficult   to reconcile    with  this hypothesis, viz. at whatever point
in a   contractile  strip tliat is being progressively elongated    by section the con
tractile wave becomes blocked, the blocking is sure to take place completely       and
exclusively at that point.        In   view of these facts, therefore, at the present
stage   of my inquiries,     I provisionally accept the hypothesis of more or less

1875.]                    Locomotor System       of Medusa.                    149
definite     lines of discharge being present in the swimming-organs             of
Medusae.        I have hitherto  failed, however, to detect any such lines histo
logically.
    (6)   After the waves have become completely blocked in a contractile
atrip,    it sometimes happens that the blocking is overcome, the waves
again passing into the remainder of the gonocalyx as freely as they did
before the section reached the point at which the blocking occurred.
 Sometimes, under these circumstances, the strip will admit of being
further elongated for some distance before the waves are again blocked ;
 and occasionally it happens that the second blockage is also thrown
 down.       I  have once seen four such successive blockages successively
 overcome.
     It  will be seen that these facts militate against the supposition of
 lines   of discharge being present.         I  think, however, that there is a
 theory by which these facts admit of being satisfactorily reconciled with
 that supposition.       But this whole subject awaits further and extensive
 investigation.
     (c) Pressure     exerted upon any transverse line in a contractile strip
 causes blocking of the waves at that line.         If the pressure be slight, the
 blocking will be temporary ; but if severe or long-continued, the blocking
 will probably      be permanent.      Even the slight strains caused   by handling
 contractile strips in the air are often sufficient      to show the rate of the
  waves, and sometimes to block them.
  V. Additional Facts tending to show the identity of the Locomotor         Centres
                      of Medusa with Nervous Tissue in general.
     §  1.  Having placed several hundred Sarsia in a large bell-jar,       I  com
  pletely shut out the daylight from the room in which the jar was placed.
  By means of a dark-lantern and a concentrating-lens,         I then cast a beam
  of light through the water in which the Sarsia were swimming.               From
  all parts of the bell-jar the Sarsia crowded into the path of the beam.
  The presence of a visual sense in the case of this genus is therefore
 unquestionable.
     Having removed twelve vigorous specimens from the large bell-jar and
                                      I
  placed them in a smaller one, excised the so-called eye-specks from nine
  of the number.        The three unmutilated individuals sought the light as
  before   ; but the other nine swam hither and thither without paying it
  any   regard.     I conclude, therefore, that the visual faculty is lodged exclu
  sively in the marginal bodies.
     Lastly,    I brought a heated iron, just ceasing to be red, close against
  the glass side of the large bell- jar ; but no one of its numerous occupants
  approached the heated metal. Therefore the rays by which the Sarsia had
  been affected in the previous experiment were the properly luminous rays,
  and not the calorific ones.
      § 2.  (a) The ansesthesiating influence of chloroform and ether is most

 150                    On the Locomotor System of Medusa.                       [Dec. 16,
decided, both       in the case of the naked- and of the covered-eyed MedusaB.
The    first   indications     of approaching torpor are (a) decrease in the rate
of the pulsations and (6) diminution of their vigour.                   These indications
rapidly     become      more   and   more  marked,    so  that  shortly after they first
set   in the period of diastole is very much prolonged and the systoles,
when they occur, are of the feeblest character.               Eventually the pulsations
altogether cease ; and shortly after this stage of perfect quiescence has
been reached, the Medusa is quite insensible to all stimulation.                  Recovery
in normal sea-water is very rapid, occupying only a few seconds in the
case   of Sarsia     ; but, like the reverse process of ansesthesiation,        it is clearly
of   a gradual nature.
    (6) Morphia is as decided in its action upon Medusae as is chloroform.
The processes of anaasthesiation and of subsequent recovery are very
similar to those just described, except that both processes occupy a some
what longer time.
    (c) Strychnia exerts a very marked influence upon MedusaB.                        Of the
species    I  have     met with   Cyancea capillata  is  the  most  suitable  for   showing
the effects of this poison, from the fact that, in water kept at a constant
temperature, the normal pulsations of this animal are as regular as are
those of a heart.          Shortly after a solution of strychnia has been added to
the water in which a specimen of C. capillata is contained, unmistakable
signs of irregularity in the pulsation of the animal supervene.                   This irre
gularity     then   increases    more  and  more,   until   at last  it grows into well-
marked convulsions.              The convulsions manifest themselves in the form
of extreme deviations from the rhythmical character of the normal con
tractions, amounting, in fact, to nothing less than tonic spasms. It is
further of importance to remark that the convulsions are very plainly of
a paroxysmal nature —prolonged periods of uninterrupted convulsions
being every now and then relieved by shorter periods of repose, during
which the Medusa remains perfectly motionless in a fully expanded form.
 C. capillata will live for many hours when under the influence of strychnia,
but eventually death supervenes.             The animal dies in full diastole.
    (d)   Curare     was   administered by the following method.            I    placed the
Medusa in a flat-shaped beaker filled to the brim with sea-water. This
beaker     I  then placed in a large basin filled with sea- water up to the level
of the water in the beaker. Having next divided the Medusa across its
whole diameter, with the exception of a small piece of marginal tissue to
act as a connecting-link between the two resulting halves,                  I  transferred
one of these halves to the water in the basin, leaving the other half still
                                 I
in the beaker. Lastly, poisoned the water in the beaker with successive
doses of urari solution.           The species best suited for this experiment is
Stauroplwra laciniata.
   The effects of curare thus administered are most marked and beautiful.
Previous to the administration of the poison both halves of the divided
Medusa are, of course, contracting vigorously — the contractile waves now

 running from the half in the basin to the half in the beaker, and now
 vice versd.    But after the half in the beaker has been effectually poisoned
all motion in it completely ceases, the unpoisoned half, however, continu
ing to contract independently.       If the poisoned half be now irritated, by-
 nipping with the forceps or otherwise, it does not itself move, but the
 other or unpoisoned half immediately responds to the stimulation.        If S.
 laciniuta be the species of Medusa employed, this result is particularly
 well marked, from the fact that the unpoisoned half responds to the sti
 mulation by performing the highly distinctive spasmodic movements
 already described.     I have also satisfied myself that curare asserts its
 peculiar influence upon individuals of the covered-eyed Medusae. In all
 cases overpoisoning paralyzes the excitable as well as the motor system.
                                  I
 The strength of the solution used was 1 in 2500, and in this solution the
 poisoned half required to soak for half an hour.
    («) If any sized portion of a contractile strip cut from the gonocalyx
of A. aurita be immersed in a sea-water solution of any of the above-
mentioned anaesthesiating substances, the contractile waves in the poisoned
portion of the strip are first progressively slowed and finally blocked.
Upon now restoring the poisoned portion of the strip to normal sea-
water, the contractile    waves again begin to pass, and eventually do so as
freely   as before.
    If any of the nutrient tubes which cross such a contractile strip trans
 versely be injected with a solution of any of the narcotic poisons, the
contractile waves become blocked at the line occupied by that tube.        If a
discharging lithocyst be similarly injected, it ceases its discharges. From
the effects of chloroform and weak solution of morphia, however, it recovers
in the course of a night. Alcohol so injected at first causes an increase
in the frequency and potency of the discharges, and afterwards progressive
torpor. In time, however, the torpidity wears away, and finally the
Medusid returns to its normal state.
IV. " Note       on the Placentation of Hyrax." By William Turner,
       M.B. (Lond.), Professor of Anatomy, University of Edinburgh.
       Communicated by Prof. Huxley, Sec. B.S.                 Received De
       cember 13, 1875.
    In  his '
              Lectures on Comparative Anatomy,' vol. v. p. 326, Sir Everard
Home stated that the placenta in Hyrax capensis is annular, like that in
the cat ; and in vol. vi. he gave two drawings of the placenta (pis. 61 & 62),
in which he not only showed its zonary form, but figured, though he did
not describe, the sac of the allantois as equalling in length the bag of the
chorion.      Prof. Owen, in his description of the placenta of the elephant
(Phil.   Trans.  1857), refers to the placenta of Hyrax as similar in spongy
texture and vascularity to the annular placenta of the Carnivore, and

152           Mr. W. Turner         on the Placentation        of Hyrax.     [Dec. 16,
 nbsequently (Comp. Anat. Vertebrates, iii. p. 742) states that the -villi
are imbedded in a decidual substance, and the surface of attachment to
the uterus is less limited than in the elephant.                  Prof. Huxley, in his
Hunterian Lectures, 1863*, described the placenta of Hyrax as having
such an interblending of the foetal and maternal portions that it is as
truly deciduate as that of a rodent.             In his ' Manual of the Anatomy of
Vertebrated Animals,' 1871, he further points out that the maternal
vessels pass straight through the thickness of the placenta towards its
foetal surface, that the allantois spreads over the interior of the chorion
and gives rise to the broad zone-like placenta, and that the yelk-sac and
vitello-intestinal duct early disappear.
    In direct opposition to the views of these anatomists, M. H. Milne-
Edwards has recently stated t that there is nothing in the placenta of
Hyrax to indicate the presence of a caduca, and the allantois does not
 overstep the limits of the placental zone. The villi, he says, are mostly
simple, very analogous to those of an ordinary pachyderm.                        In the
 midst of the zone vascular vegetations are engaged in corresponding
 uterine cavities, but they adhere no more than do the analogous prolon
 gations in the ruminant to the crypts in which they are included ; they
 can be detached with the same facility without tearing through any thing,
 and without carrying away any portion of uterine tissue.                M. George, in
 an elaborate monograph on the genus Hyrax, published in June last J,
 figures not only the placenta, but the gravid uterus of this animal.               He
 says nothing, however, of the structure, which he was apparently                  pre
 cluded from examining, but adopts the view of             M. H. Milne-Edwards that
 it was non-deciduate.
     The antagonism between the views of the English and French ana
 tomists, not only as regards the structural details, but the conclusions as
 to the nature of the placentation, has rendered it advisable to have the
 placenta of Hyrax reexamined ; and, with great liberality, Prof. Huxley
 has placed at my disposal his specimen, which had been preserved in
  spirit of wine.     I  shall now describe what        I have seen.
     The uterus was two-horned.               Two well-developed ova, each about
 3| inches long, were in one cornu.                One ovum had been opened, the
  membranes and placenta examined, and the foetus removed ; the other
  ovum was entire.          The placenta was zonary, and varied in different
  parts  of  the  zone  from   between \ to | inch in breadth, whilst the average
  thickness    was -jL inch.       The non-placental areas of the chorion were
  smooth and translucent,        and, as in the Carnivora, branches of the umbi
  lical vessels ramified in them.         The zone on the chorion was intimately
  blended with a corresponding           zone    in the uterine mucosa. When the
  placenta was stripped off the uterus, not only was the mucosa in the

 placental zone removed along with the chorion, but for some distance on
 each side of the zone the mucosa tore away from the muscular coat of
 the uterus.
      The foetal surface of the placenta was smooth, and on it the umbilical
 vessels ramified before entering the villi of the chorion.              Some injection
 was passed into them, but it did not flow into their intra villous branches.
 The uterine surface of the artificially separated placenta was flocculent ;
 and the flocculi were seen, on microscopic examination, to consist of
 bundles of connective tissue intermingled with corpuscles, obviously the
 submucous connective tissue of the placental zone.
     A toughish membrane, continuous on each side with the mucosa of the
 non-placental area of the uterus, could without difficulty be peeled off the
 uterine surface of the placenta as a well-defined layer.              When examined
 microscopically, the surface of this membrane which lay next the uterus
was seen to resemble in structure the flocculi projecting from it ; whilst
the part next the placenta was much more abundantly cellular, and
stained readily with carmine.          The surface which had been in apposition
with the placenta was irregularly undulating, and divided into numerous
shallow crypt-like recesses, separated from each other by raised folds of
the membrane.         These crypts were lined by a layer of cells, the nuclei
of which were very distinct.          I regard this membrane as the serotina, or
modified uterine mucosa of the placental zone ; whilst the crypts, with
their epithelial lining, are the closed ends of the deep pits in which
the villi of the chorion are lodged.
    The substance of the placenta was then examined, with the object of
determining not only the form of the foetal villi, but if prolongations of
the maternal mucosa passed into the placenta between the villi.                   In ver
tical sections the villi appeared as if simple filamentous structures,
extending from the chorion to the crypt-like recesses in the serotina ; but
when portions of the placenta were teased out with needles, so that the
villi were not injured, although an occasional simple villus was seen, the
majority were broad, sinuous, leaf-like villi, with bud-like offshoots at
the free border, such as       I   have described and figured in the domestic
cat (Trans. Boy. Soc. Edinburgh, 1875).               In horizontal sections through
the placenta the sinuous outline of the villi presented so close a resem
blance to the cat, that it was difficult in this particular to distinguish
Hyrax from Felis. Under a magnifying-power of 320 diameters, a layer
of flattened cells, the nuclei of which were almost circular and bright
with transmitted light, was seen at the surface of the villus. Intermingled
with the foetal villi were laminar prolongations of the maternal mucosa,
which invested and closely followed the sinuosities of the villi, similar to
the arrangement         I have described and figured in the domestic cat*.
This intraplacental      maternal tissue was present not only in those sections

in which the serotina was in situ, but in others from which this membrane
had been peeled off. The maternal laminae were covered by a layer of
cells, obviously continuous with the cellular lining of the crypt-like
recesses on the free Burface of the serotina, and the lamina) themselves
were prolongations into the placenta of the folds of the mucosa which
 separated the crypts from each other.
     As the placenta of Hyrax, both in the form of its villi and in the mode
 in which they are interlocked between the intraplacental maternal lamina;,
 so closely resembles that of the domestic cat, and as these lamina? remain in
situ after the membrane, which       I have named the serotina, is peeled off
 the placenta, there can be no doubt that they are shed at the time of sepa
 ration of the placenta.      Hence Hyrax, in its placentation, is one of the
 Deciduata.      Whether the membrane just referred to is also shed during
 parturition is more difficult to say.     The fact that it peels off the uterus
 along with the placenta, when they are artificially separated, is not of
 itself sufficient evidence. In the cat the whole thickness of the mucosa
 in the placental zone peels off along with the placenta when that organ is
 artificially separated; whilst in normal parturition the deeper part of the
  connective tissue of the mucosa, with the remains of the blood-vessels
  and tubular glands, persists as a covering for the muscular coat, and
  forms a non-deciduous serotina.       It may be that in Hyrax, as in the cat,
  only the superficial part of this membrane is shed with the placenta,
  whilst the rest remains on the zone of the uterus ; but this can only be
  determined by the examination of a uterus immediately after par
  turition.
     The non-placental area of the mucosa contained tubular glands, which,
  relatively to the extent of the membrane, were not nearly so numerous as
  in the gravid mucosa of animals having a diffused or polycotyledonary
  placenta.    The glands were long, and the gland-stem was unbranched
  and almost straight ; the closed end was dilated, bent on itself, and seemed
  to give off a short branch. The secreting epithelium did not fill up the
  tube, but left a central lumen.
      When the chorion was cut through on either side of the placental zone,
  the sac of the allantois was opened into, and seen to extend up to the
  poles of the chorion.      At and close to the margin of the placenta the
  allantois was reflected on to the outer surface of the amnion, to which it
   obviously gave a complete investment, so that the bag of the amnion was
  suspended in the sac of the allantois by the bands of the latter membrane
  reflected on to its outer surface.      The amnion was large relatively to
  the sac of the allantois.    The umbilical cord was short and somewhat
  flattened.
     Numerous flattened plates, the largest of which were about T\f inch in
  diameter, projected from the inner surface of the amnion.           They were
 situated not only in the neighbourhood of the umbilical cord, but scat
  tered as far as thp poles.   Some were sessile, others slightly pedunculated ;

and as they were all covered by the epithelial lining of the amnion, they
were apparently developed between it and the layer of allantois which
covered its outer surface.        The plates were obviously composed of cells
the nuclei of which were distinct         ; but the toughness of the tissue, due
probably    to  the prolonged   action  of   the spirit in which the specimen had
been preserved, rendered it difficult to isolate them.             In position and
structure these plates apparently corresponded to the amniotic corpuscles
which   I  have described in Orca gladiator (Trans. Boy. Soc. Edinburgh,
1871).
   The non-gravid uterine cornu was enlarged and contained two masses
(one the size of a walnut, the other of a filbert) connected together by
an intermediate neck.        When examined microscopically they were seen
to contain tubular glands and blood-vessels, lying in a richly corpuscu-
lated connective tissue.       These masses were evidently the greatly hyper-
trophied    mucosa, which had become thickened in sympathy with the
changes in the gravid cornu.         There was no extension of the foetal mem
branes into this cornu, and its cavity seemed as if almost obliterated by
the great hypertrophy       of the mucous wall.
   Hyrax   agrees, therefore, with Felis, not only in the form and structure
of the placenta, but in the presence of a large allantoic sac.           It differs,
however, in the condition of the umbilical vesicle, which in Felis persists
during utero-gestation, but in Hyrax disappears apparently at an early
period.

   The extensive contributions which have recently been made to the
physical history of the ocean have shown the desirability of exact
knowledge of the relations of sea-water to heat. "We have accordingly
thought it worth while to make observations in order to determine the
law of the thermal expansion of sea-water.

    The only attempt hitherto     made to solve this problem which can lay
any real claim to consideration is due to the late Professor Hubbard, of
the United States National Observatory.         The results of his investiga
tion are contained in Maury's ' Sailing Directions,' 1858, vol. i. p. 237.
    Muncke, nearly fifty years ago, determined the expansion of an artificial
sea-water at various temperatures between 0° and 100° C; but our con
fidence in the results as applicable to natural sea-water is affected by the
circumstance that the solution was prepared from data furnished by the
imperfect analyses of Vogel and Bouillon La Grange.
    The observations of Despretz were confined to temperatures below
13°-27, as the main object of his inquiry was the determination of the
point of maximum density of sea-water. The subsequent investigations
of Neumann and Eossetti were equally limited, as they were undertaken
with the same view.
    The water used in our observations was collected from the Atlantic,
in lat. 50° 48' N. and long. 31° 14' W.; and its specific gravity at 0° C,
compared with distilled water at the same temperature, was found by the
bottle to be 1-02867.
    The method of experiment         was precisely the same as that already
 employed by one of us in determining the expansion of the liquid chlorides
 of phosphorus.         It was essentially that already used by Kopp and
Pierre   ; t. e.  the expansion was observed in thermometer-shaped vessels
 (so-called dilatometers), graduated and accurately calibrated.
    Threo of these instruments and two sets of thermometers were
 employed.        The latter were made by Casella ; the length of a degree in
 different instruments varied between 9 and 13 millims. ; they had been
 compared (the one set directly, the other indirectly) with Kew Standards.
    Three perfectly independent sets of observations were made with the
 water in the state in which it was collected ; and as Mr. Buchanan, of
           '
 H.M.S.       Challenger,' has found that the specific gravities of different
 sea-waters lie between the extreme values 1-0278 and 1-0240, and since, in
 order to be of value in the investigation of the physical condition of
 the ocean, the observations on their values and the formulas of reduction
 ought to be correct to the fourth decimal place, we diluted quantities of
 our sea-water with distilled water, so as to have specimens of approxi
 mately the specific gravities of 1-020 and 1-025 j and we concentrated a
 third quantity by evaporation until its specific gravity was increased to
 1-033, and made two series of independent observations on the expansion
 of each solution.
    As we wished to confine ourselves to circumstances to which sea-water
  s naturally exposed, we did not carry on our experiments at temperatures
higher than 40° C.
    Empirical formula) were calculated to express the results of each series
 of observations ; and in the original paper full details of the observations
 are given,      together  with Tables showing    the agreement between the

calculated and observed results, and also (after the necessary corrections
and reductions have been made) between the volumes calculated from the
formulas from different series of observations on the same solutions.
    Finally,   a general  formula of the form
was found, giving the relation between the volume (v), temperature (*),
 and specific gravity at 0° C. (s) of any solution of the same composition
 of sea-water the specific gravity of which at 0° C. lies between 1*020 and

heads of Columns HI. and IV. are the numbers of ciphers which must
be prefixed to the figures written in them in the unit place.
   In order to facilitate the use of the Table, we subjoin directions for its
application in the form of rules, and give a couple of examples.

and divide the number so obtained by that corresponding to the observed

the column) ; add the quotient to 1-02000, and the sum will be the specific
gravity required.

Therefore specific gravity at 0° C. =1-02780.
    We next discuss the discrepancies which occur between our own
results and those of Professor Hubbard ; and we point out various cir
cumstances in the methods employed in m aking and reducing the latter
observations which appear to us to explain in a great measure the
divergences which exist.

.1876.]          Action of Light on Tellurium and Selenium.              163
 II. "On     the Action of Light on Tellurium and Selenium."              By
     Prof. W. G. Adams, F.R.S. Received November 10, 1875.
    Two platinum wires were attached to the ends of a small bar of
 tellurium, about 1 inch in length, by heating the wires to a bright red
 heat and bringing them suddenly in contact, one with each end of the
 bar.    The platinum wires melted a small portion of the tellurium, and
 became imbedded in it.      The resistance of the bar and wires was about
 half an ohm.       The tellurium was placed in a box, and its resistance
 balanced ; then it was exposed to the light of a paraffin-lamp, just as in
 the experiments with selenium.       At first the light seemed to have no
 effect ; but in consequence of the heat from the lamp, the resistance of
 the tellurium was increased.
    On placing a rectangular vessel of water between the lamp and the
 tellurium and then exposing as before, there was no change of resistance
 in the tellurium, showing that if there was any diminution in the resist
 ance duo to the action of light it was entirely balanced by the increase in
 the resistance due to heating by the current and by the residual portion
 of the radiant heat.
    On replacing the rectangular vessel of water by a beaker of water, so
 as to focus the light of the lamp on the tellurium, there was found on
 exposure to be a diminution in the resistance of the tellurium, which gra
 dually increased until the galvanometer-needle was deflected through 30
 divisions of the scale.    The needle was then brought back to zero by
 altering one of the slide-resistances in the circuit. The agreement
 between the amounts of the change of resistance in several successive
 experiments, with intervals between them, was very close. Thus, in
 three experiments on October 8th,
          The change in the first experiment was 124 millims. of wire,
               „       „      second    „      „   120     „      „
               »       »      third     „      „   122     „      „
 showing a diminution in the resistance of the tellurium amounting to
 about one thousandth part of its whole resistance on exposure to the
light of the paraffin-lamp.
    On repeating the experiments with the tellurium which had not been
exposed to light for seven days, the tellurium was found to be much
more sensitive.      "When exposed at a distance of about half a metre, as
before, to the paraffin-lamp the needle was gradually deflected through
30 divisions of the scale, showing that the resistance of the tellurium
was now diminished as much without interposing the beaker of water as
it had previously been when the beaker was interposed.        On making no
change whatever, except placing the beaker of water between the lamp
and the tellurium, so as to focus the light on the tellurium, the deflection
of the needle gradually increased to 80 and then more slowly to 100 divi

eions.  On balancing this deflection, it was found that, to bring the needle
to zero, it was necessary to diminish the slide-resistance by 400 millims.
Thus the diminution produced in the resistance by exposure to the light
of the paraffin-lamp was ¦$£$ part of the whole resistance of the tellurium.
   On exposing the selenium bar used in my experiments to the direct
rays of the same paraffin-lamp at the distance of 1 metre, the resistance
of the selenium was diminished by one fifth of its whole resistance.
   From the above experiment we see that at the distance of half a metre
(that      is,   with light of four times the intensity) the change of resistance
in the tellurium under the             same conditions     only t^gis Par* °f i*8

  This paper may be           said to consist of two divisions.
                                                     The first contains
an account of some experiments and observations undertaken with view                                  a

 1876.J          Refraction   of Sound   by the Atmosphere.               165
 to ascertain how far the refraction of sound caused by the upward variation
 of temperature may be the cause of the difference in the distances to
 which sounds of the same intensity may be heard at different times.
    Some rockets, capable of rising 1000 feet and then exploding a cartridge
 containing 12 oz. of powder, having been procured, an effort was made
 to compare the distance at which the rockets could be heard with that at
 which a gun, firing  | lb. of powder and making a louder report than the
 rockets, could be heard under the same conditions of the atmosphere.      In
 the first instance the rockets and the gun were fired from a spot in
 Suffolk around which the country is tolerably flat, observers being
stationed at different distances.     Owing, however, to the effect of the
wind and the time required for the observers to proceed to the distant
stations, these experiments were not successful in establishing the com
 parative merits of the gun and the rockets.            They were, however,
important as showing that on hot calm days in July the reports of the
 rockets never failed to be distinctly audible at distances of 4 and 5 miles,
although the sun at the time was shining with full force on the ground
 and rendering the air near the surface so heterogeneous that distant
objects seen through it appeared to wave about and twinkle.
    The next attempt was made during a cruise on the east coast. After
three weeks cold and windy weather, the 19th of August was a fine day ;
and some experiments were made in Lynn Deeps, which revealed a very
extraordinary state of the atmosphere as regards the transmission of
sound.     A party rowed away from the yacht in one of her boats, it
having been arranged beforehand that either a rocket or a large pistol
was to be fired from the yacht when signalled for ; also that when those
on the yacht heard those in the boat call they should answer.        The boat
proceeded to a distance of 5 miles, until those on the yacht had com
pletely lost sight of it ; but all the time the calls from the boat were
distinctly heard by those on the yacht, although after they had lost sight
of the boat they ceased to answer the calls. On the boat also not only
were the reports of the pistol and rockets distinctly heard, but every
answer from the yacht was heard plainly. The last came after an
interval of 35 seconds, which gave the distance 3| miles. Nor was this
all ; but guns, and on one occasion the barking of a dog, on the shore
8 miles distant were distinctly heard, as were also the paddles of a
steamer 15 miles distant.
    The day was perfectly calm, there was no wind, the sky was quite clear,
and the sun was shining with great power — conditions which have been
described as most favourable to the stoppage of the sound by the hetero
geneity of the atmosphere, and which may also be described as most
favourable for great upward refraction. On this day, however, it was
observed that all the time distant objects loomed considerably, i.e. appeared
lifted. This showed that the air was colder near the surface of the sea
than   it was above.    It is to this circumstance    that the extraordinary

166         On the Refraction      of Sound   by the Atmosphere.         [Jan. 6,
distances to which sounds were heard on this day is supposed to be due.
The diminution in the temperature of the air being downwards, the sound,
instead of being lifted as it usually is, was brought down, and thus
intensified at the surface of the water, which, being perfectly smooth,
was thus converted into a sort of whispering-gallery.
     The report of the pistol and the sounds of the voice were attended with
echoes, but not so the reports of the rockets ; and it is suggested that
these so-called echoes may be found only to attend sounds having a
 greater intensity in one direction than in another.
     The second part of the paper refers to a phenomenon noticed by Arago
 in his report of the celebrated experiments on the velocity of sound made
 on the nights of the 21st and 22nd of June, 1822.
     It was then found that, although the guns fired at Montlhery could be
 distinctly heard at Villejuif (11 miles distant), those fired at Villejuif
 could not be heard at Montlhery without great attention, and at times
 (particularly on the second night) they were not heard at all — although
 on both nights the wind was blowing from Villejuif to Montlhery, the
 speed of the wind, which was very light, being about 1 foot per second.
 No explanation of this phenomenon was offered by the observers, although
  it was much commented on. And on the second night the gun at Villejuif,
 which on the previous night had been pointed upward, was brought down
 in the hope that this might improve its audibility (this step, however, was
  found to render matters worse than before).
     From this lowering of the gun at Villejuif it seemed as though there
  was probably some difference in the conditions under which the guns at
 the two stations were placed, as if that at Villejuif was fired from a
 level, while that at Montlhery might be fired over a parapet.          An inspec
  tion  of the  district confirmed  this view ; for Villejuif is on a low flat hill,
  while Montlhery is on the top of a steep cone; and not only is it 80 feet
  above Villejuif, but it is surmounted by the mound of an old castle, which
  is supported by a vertical wall towards Villejuif and surrounded by a low
   rampart.     Hence it is suggested that in all probability the advantage of
  the gun at Montlhery was due to its being fired over this parapet, while
  that at Villejuif was fired from the level ground.
      The fact that the wind blowing from Villejuif did not reverse this
   advantage, suggested the possibility that at night, when the diminution of
  temperature is downward, a light wind may not produce the same effect
  upon sound as when the diminution of temperature is upward, as it
   generally is during the day.
      To ascertain if this is the case, some observations were made on some
   calm nights in May and June of the present year, from which it was
   found : —
      (1) That when the sky was cloudy and there was no dew, the sound of an
   electric bell 1 foot above the grass could always be heard further with the
   wind than against it ; but

      (2) that when the sky was clear and there was a heavy dew, the sound
    could invariably be heard as far against a light wind as with      and in             it,
    some cases much further.    On one occasion, when the temperature at                          1
    foot above the grass was 38° and at  feet 47°, and the speed of the wind

    was    1foot per second at    feet above the grass, the bell was heard 440
                                     5
    yards against the wind and only 270 with it.
       Since, therefore, on the nights of the experiments at Villejuif and
.   Montlhery  it     stated that the sky was clear, that there was dew, and
                     is
    the temperature recorded at the two stations shows the diminution to
    have been downwards,         argued that the effect of the wind to render
                                it   is
    the sound less audible at Villejuif was completely balanced    the down          by
    ward refraction of temperature.
       Another phenomenon recorded by Arago                        is,
                                                 that while the reports of
    the guns at Montlhery as heard at that station were attended with
    prolonged echoes, this was not the case with those at Villejuif. It                          is
    thought that this difference    sufficiently accounted for by the fact that
                                          is
    while Montlhery     surrounded by high hills with precipitous or wooded

Telegraph Engineers, and also in October last a written one to the Aca
demic des Sciences of Paris *, wherein we have stated that the length
of the spark in air appears to be in the direct ratio of the square of the
number of cells.
    Having completed the 2400 cells, and charged them up in a single day,
they were exactly in the same condition as to electromotive force and
internal resistance; consequently they afforded the means of testing
the truth of the law of the length of spark in a manner more effica
cious than had hitherto obtained, the more especially as by the use of
paraffin corks and other precautions we had obtained an excellent insu
lation.
    Our assistant, Mr. Pram, has constructed a discharger which permits
of the accurate measurement of the distance of the terminals to read to
•j-oVcr of an inch, and by estimation to the tenth of that quantity.                The
nut through which      the screw  (^^pof-an-inch thread) carrying one of the ter
minals works is divided into two parts, which are separated by a spiral
pressure-spring so as to prevent shake. In making measurements the ter
minals are separated to a greater quantity than the anticipated striking-
distance, and gradually approached until the spark passes ; the discharger
is then detached from the battery, and, after reading the scale, connected
up with a separate battery of 10 cells, with a detector-galvanometer in
circuit. The terminals are again approached until the motion of the
galvanometer indicates contact between them ; the scale is again read,
and the length of spark obtained by the difference             between the first and
second reading.

    Taking as the unit 600 cells, the spark of which was 0-0033, the length
of spark of 1200, 1800, 2400 would, according to theory, be that number
multiplied by the square of 2, 3, 4 respectively.

which numbers agree nearly with those obtained by experiment.
    The length of the spark is much influenced by the shape of the ter
minals ; those which we frequently employ consist of a point as one ter
minal and a plane for the other. Hitherto we have used copper terminals,

means of a double key discharger, or by a rapidly revolving commutator
 reversing up to 352 times in a second.                One terminal in the above
 determinations     consisted of a point of 30°, and the other of a slightly
 convex surface 0-46 inch in diameter.
    While making these measurements, we noticed in a nearly dark room
that when the point was negative a glow, in form like a paraboloid, was
 seen surrounding it long before the spark passed, and its appearance
 afforded, by its increasing brilliancy, useful information to guide us as to
 the more cautious approach of the terminals ; gradually the sugar-loaf -like
 glow extended to the positive terminal.              With 1800 cells the glow was
 seen when the terminals         were 0-0545 inch apart, the spark passing at
 0-0345 inch ; with 2400 cells the glow began at a distance of 0-0865 inch,
the spark passing at 0-0535 inch. Moreover it was noticed that the disk
(positive) became covered all over with a peach-like bloom, which became
stronger in the centre as the terminals were made to approach each other,
giving rise to Newton's iridescent rings.
    In order to study more readily the phenomena accompanying the glow
preceding the spark, the whole series of 5640 cells was used, the terminals
 being a point as before of 30° for one, and sometimes a flat disk 1-1 inch
in diameter or a slightly convex one of 0-8 inch in diameter for the
other.    In all cases a peach-like bloom deposited on the disk, which was
connected with the silver (positive) terminal ; and when the flat disk was
 used the deposit was notably          greater at the periphery and the centre
 than in other portions of it.        With this number of cells,
With the flat disk the glow occurred at 1-073 in., the spark at 0-139 in.

    To ascertain whether       a current really passed when the glow appeared,
various vacuum-tubes        were   interposed in circuit between the battery and
 one of the terminals j in all cases they were illuminated even before a
glow was perceptible on the negative pole           ; their interposition,  as was to
be expected, shortened        the spark and diminished the distance at which
the glow was perceptible.          For example, with a hydrogen tube, having a
capillary portion between two larger tubes, such as is used for spectrum
experiments, and offering a resistance of 190,000 ohms, the glow occurred
at 0-939 inch, the spark at 0-092 inch.
    A tube of 31 inches between the terminals, and offering a resistance of
350,000 ohms, was brilliantly illuminated when interposed between one
terminal and the battery ; when the terminals were separated the ex
treme range of the discharge was 1-2 inch, and before any glow was visible
at the negative electrode.          How much further between the electrodes it

    "We have alluded to the resistance offered by vacuum-tubes.            At first we
experienced considerable difficulty in measuring it.            For example, when
in a Wheatstone's bridge         the   resistance   of  the tube   was balanced by
inserted resistances, the galvanometer could only for a short time be
brought to rest, and it was then found that the cause of this was that
the tubes rapidly increased in resistance as the current passed. After a
time, however, they recovered their original resistance, sometimes rapidly,
sometimes only after the lapse of days.            The resistances were found not
to be dependent on the length of tube, but to a great extent on their
bore, capillary tubes offering a considerable resistance.              Ultimately it
was found that it was better to discard the indications of the galva
nometer, and to rely solely on the appearance of a luminosity in the tubes
placed on one side of Wheatstone's bridge as soon as the insertion of a
balancing resistance was made in the other.
    Later on we hope to have the honour of sending to the Society a more
detailed statement of our experiments in support of those now quoted,
 and in confirmation of our former paper on the cause of stratification in
 electric discharges in vacuo.
    In conclusion we venture to draw attention to the following consequences
 of the law of the length of spark being dependent on the ratio of the square
 of the number of cells of a voltaic battery, in the event of its being con
 firmed by experiment.         Taking as a basis the spark with 600 cells of the

"  On the Optical Deportment of the Atmosphere in reference
       to the Phenomena of Putrefaction and Infection."                By John
       Tyndall, F.R.S. Received January 24, 1876.
    The author refers in an Introduction to an inquiry on the decomposi
tion of vapours and the formation of active clouds by light, whereby he
was led to experiment on the floating matter of the air.           He refers to
the experiments of Schwann, Schroder, and Dusch, Schroder himself, to
those of the illustrious French chemist Pasteur, to the reasoning of
Lister and its experimental verification regarding the filtering-power
of the lungs ; from all of which he concluded, six years ago, that the
power of developing life by the air, and its power of scattering light,
would be found to go hand in hand.           He thought the simple expedient
of examining by means of a beam of light, while the eye was kept sen
sitive by darkness, the character of the medium in which their experi
ments were conducted could not fail to be useful to workers in this
field.    But the method has not been much turned to account ; and this
year he thought it worth while to devote some time to the more complete
demonstration of its utility.
    He also wished to free his mind, and if possible the minds of others,
from the uncertainty and confusion which now beset the doctrine of
" spontaneous                     Pasteur has pronounced it " a chimera," and
                  generation."
expressed the undoubting       conviction   that this being so it is possible to
remove parasitic diseases      from the earth. To the medical profession,
therefore, and through them to humanity at large, this question is one of
the last importance.      But the state of medical opinion regarding it is not
satisfactory.     In a recent Number of the ' British Medical Journal,' and
in answer to the question, " In what way is contagium generated and
communicated?" Messrs. Braidwood and Vacher reply that, notwith
standing "an almost incalculable amount of patient labour, the actual
results obtained, especially as regards the manner of generation of con
tagium, have been most disappointing.           Observers are even yet at vari
ance whether these minute particles, whose discovery we have just noticed,
and other disease-germs, are always produced from like bodies previously
existing, or whether they do not, under certain          favourable  conditions,
spring into existence de novo."
    With    a view to the possible   diminution of the uncertainty thus de
scribed, the author submits without further preface to the Boyal Society,
and especially to those who study the aetiology of disease, a description
of the mode of procedure followed in this inquiry and the results to
which    it has led.

forated in the middle by a hole 2 inches in diameter, closed air-tight by
a sheet of india-rubber.  This sheet is pierced in the middle by a pin,
and through the pin-hole      is passed the shank of a long pipette ending
above in a small funnel.      A circular tin collar, 2 inches in diameter and
1| inch high, surrounds the pipette, the       space between both being packed
with cotton-wool     moistened by glycerine.        Thus the pipette, in moving
up and down, is not only firmly clasped by the india-rubber, but it also
passes through a stuffing-box of sticky cotton-wool.   The width of the
aperture closed by the india-rubber secures the free lateral play of the
lower end of the pipette.  Into two other smaller apertures in the top of
the cupboard are inserted, air-tight, the open ends of two narrow tubes,
intended to connect the interior space with the atmosphere.    The tubes
are bent several times up and down, so as to intercept- and retain the
particles carried by such feeble currents as changes of temperature might
cause to set in between the outer and the inner air.
   The bottom of the box is pierced, sometimes with two rows, sometimes
with a single row of apertures, in which are fixed, air-tight, large test-tubes,
intended to contain the liquid to be exposed to the action of the mote-
less air.
   On the 10th of September the first case of this kind was closed. The
passage of a concentrated beam across it through its two side windows
then showed the air within it to be laden with floating matter.          On the
13th it was again examined.         Before the beam entered and after it
quitted the case its track was vivid in the air, but within the case it
vanished.    Three days of quiet sufficed to cause all the floating matter
to be deposited on the sides and bottom, where it was retained by a
coating of glycerine, with which the interior surface of the case had been
purposely varnished.    The test-tubes were then filled through the pipette,
boiled for five minutes in a bath of brine or oil, and abandoned to the
action of the moteless air.  During ebullition aqueous vapour rose from
the liquid into the chamber, where it was for the most part condensed,
the uncondensed portion escaping, at a low temperature, through the bent
tubes at the top. Before the brine was removed little stoppers of cotton
wool were inserted in the bent tubes, lest the entrance of the air into the
cooling chamber should at first be forcible enough to carry motes along
with it. As soon, however, as the ambient temperature was assumed by
the air within the case the cotton-wool stoppers were removed.

vapour, and all the other gaseous matters which mingle more or less

1876.]          Phenomena     of Putrefaction and Infection.               178
    Among vegetables experiments        have been made with hay, turnips,
tea, coffee, hops, repeated   in  various ways with both acid and alkaline
infusions.     Among    animal   substances are to be mentioned      many ex
periments    with urine ; while beef, mutton,      hare, rabbit, kidney, liver,
fowl, pheasant, grouse, haddock, sole, salmon, cod, turbot, mullet, herring,
whiting, eel, oyBter have been all subjected to experiment.
    The result is that infusions of these substances exposed to the common
air of the Eoyal Institution laboratory, maintained at a temperature of
from 60° to 70° Fahr., all fell into putrefaction in the course of from
two to four days. No matter where the infusions were placed, they
were infallibly smitten in the end. The number of the tubes containing
infusions was multiplied till it reached six hundred, but not one of them
escaped infection.
    In no single instance, on the other hand, did the air which had been
proved moteless by the searching beam prove itself, even when raised
to temperatures varying from 80° to 90°, to possess the least power
 of producing Bacterial life or the associated phenomena of putre
 faction.   The power of developing such life in atmospheric air, and
the power of scattering of light, are thus proved to be indissolubly
 united.
    The sole condition necessary to cause these long-dormant infusions to
 swarm with active life is the access of the floating matter of the air.
 After having remained for four months as pellucid as distilled water,
 the opening of the back door of the protecting case, and the consequent
admission of the mote-laden air, sufficed in three days to render the
infusions putrid and full of life.
    That such life arises from mechanically suspended particles is thus
reduced to ocular demonstration.
    Let us inquire a little more closely into the character of the particles
which produce the life. Pour eau de Cologne into water, a white precipi
 tate renders the liquid milky.     Or, imitating Briicke, dissolve clean gum
 mastic in alcohol, and drop it into water, the mastic is precipitated, and
 milkiness produced.     If the solution be very strong the mastic separates
 in curds ; but by gradually diluting the alcoholic solution we finally reach
 a point where the milkiness disappears, the liquid assuming, by reflected
 light, a bright cerulean hue. It is, in point of fact, the colour of the sky,
 and is due to a similar cause, namely, the scattering of light by particles,
 small in comparison to the size of the waves of light.
    When this liquid is examined by the highest microscopic power it
 seems as uniform as distilled water.       The mastic particles, though in
 numerable, entirely elude the microscope.      At right  angles to a luminous
 beam passing among the particles         they  discharge  perfectly  polarized
light.    The optical deportment of the floating matter of the air proves it
to be composed in part of particles of this excessively minute character.
 When the track of a parallel beam in dusty air is looked at horizontally

through a Nicol's prism, in a direction perpendicular to the beam, the
longer diagonal of the prism being vertical, a considerable portion of the
light from the finer matter is extinguished.    The coarser motes, on the
other hand, flash out with greater force, because of the increased dark
ness of the space around them. It is among the finest ultra-microscopic
particles that the author shows that the matter potential as regards the
development of Bacterial life is to be sought.
   But though they are beyond the reach of the microscope, the existence
 of these particles, foreign to the atmosphere but floating in            as           it,   is
certain as    they could be felt between the fingers or seen by the naked
              if
eye.   Supposing them to augment in magnitude until they come, not
only within range of the microscope, but within range of the unaided
senses. Let      be assumed that our knowledge of them under these cir
                   it
cumstances  remains   as defective as         now — that we do not know
                                                it     is
whether they are germs, particles of dead organic dust, or particles of
mineral matter.    Suppose   vessel (say
                                  a        flower-pot) to be at hand filled
                                                    a
with nutritious earth, with which we mix our unknown particles, and
that in forty-eight hours subsequently buds and blades of well-defined
cresses and grasses appear above the soil. Suppose the experiment when
repeated over and over again to yield the same unvarying result.  What
would be our conclusion     Should we regard those living plants as the
                              ?
products of dead dust or mineral particles, or should we regard them as
the offspring of living seeds     The reply
                                      ?         unavoidable. isWe should
undoubtedly consider the experiment with the flower-pot as clearing up
our preexisting ignorance   we should regard the fact of their producing
                              ;
cresses and grasses as proof positive that the particles sown in the earth
of the pot were the           seeds     of the plants             which   have   grown from
them.    It   would     be simply     monstrous      to conclude that they had been
" spontaneously generated."
    This reasoning applies word for word to the development of Bacteria
from that floating matter which the electric beam reveals in the air, and
in the absence of which no Bacterial life has been generated. There
seems no flaw in this reasoning       and
                                       ;       so simple as to render
                                               it is                     unlikely it
that   the notion  of Bacterial  life  developed  from   dead dust  can ever gain
currency among the members of           great scientific profession.

    A novel mode of experiment has been here pursued, and                 may be  it
urged that the conditions laid down             by
                                               other investigators in this field,
which have     led to  different results,  have   not been strictly adhered to.
To secure accuracy in relation to these differences, the latest words of                           a
writer on this question, who has materially influenced medical thought
                                                           " We know," he says,

" that boiled turnip- or hay-infusions exposed to ordinary air, exposed to

course of from two to six days."         Who the " we " are who possess this

knowledge is not stated.            The author is certainly not among        the
 number, though he has sought anxiously for knowledge of the kind.           He
thus tests the statements in succession.
     And first, with regard to filtered air. A group of twelve large test-tubes
was caused to pass air-tight through a slab of wood. The wood was coated
with cement, in which, while hot, a heated " propagating-glass " resem
 bling  a large bell-jar was imbedded.      The air within the jar was pumped
 out several times, air filtered through a plug of cotton-wool being per
 mitted   to supply its place.      The test-tubes contained infusions of hay,
 turnip,   beef, and mutton —three of each, twelve in all.         They are as
clear and cloudless at the present moment as they were upon the day of
their introduction ; while twelve similar tubes, prepared at the same
time, in precisely the same way, and exposed to the ordinary air, are
clogged with mycelium, mould, and Bacteria.
    With regard to the calcined air, a similar propagating-glass was caused
to cover twelve other tubes filled with the same infusions. The " glass
                                                                               "
was exhausted and carefully filled with air which had passed through a
red-hot platinum tube containing a roll of red-hot platinum gauze.
Tested by the searching beam, the calcined air was found quite free
from floating matter. Not a speck has invaded the limpidity of the
infusions exposed to it, while twelve similar tubes placed outside have
fallen into rottenness.
    The experiments with calcined air took another form.          Six years ago
it was found that, to render the laboratory air free from floating matter,
it was only necessary to permit a platinum wire heated to whiteness to
act upon it for a sufficient time.      Shades containing pear-juice, damson-
juice,  infusions  of  hay and  turnip,  and water of yeast were freed from
their floating matter in this way.          The infusions were subsequently
boiled and permitted to remain in contact with the calcined air. They
are quite clear to the present hour, while the same infusions exposed
to common air became mouldy and rotten long ago.
    It has been affirmed by other writers on this question that turnip- and
hay-infusions rendered slightly alkaline           are particularly prone to
exhibit the phenomena of spontaneous generation.          This was not found
to be the case in the present investigation.        Many such infusions have
been prepared, and they have continued for months without sensible
alteration.
    Finally, with regard to infusions wholly withdrawn from air, a group
of test-tubes containing different infusions was boiled under a bell- jar first
filled with filtered air, and from which the air was subsequently removed
as far as possible by a good air-pump.        They are now as pellucid as they
were at the time of their preparation more than two months ago, while
a group of corresponding       tubes exposed to the laboratory air have all
fallen into rottenness.
    There is still another form of experiment on which great weight has been

176                           Prof.   J.   Tyndall on the                    [Jan. 13,
laid —that of hermetically sealed tubes. On the 6th of last April a dis
cussion on the
                 " Germ-Theory of Disease " was opened before the Patho
logical Society of London. The meeting was attended by many distinguished
medical men, some of whom were profoundly influenced by the arguments,
and none of whom disputed the facts brought forward against the theory on
that occasion. The following important summary of these was then given
by Dr. Bastian : — "With the view of settling these questions, therefore, we
may carefully prepare an infusion from some animal tissue, be it muscle,
kidney, or liver ; we may place it in a flask whose neck is drawn out and
narrowed     in the blowpipe-flame, we may boil the fluid,            seal   the vessel
during ebullition, and, keeping it in         a warm place, may await        the result,
as   I have often     done.   After   a variable   time, the previously heated fluid
within the hermetically       sealed flask    swarms more or less plentifully with
Bacteria and allied organisms."
  Previous to reading this statement the author had operated upon 16 tubes
of hay- and turnip-infusions, and upon 21 tubes of beef, mackerel, eel,
oyster, oatmeal, malt, and potato, hermetically sealed while boiling, not by
the blowpipe, but by the far more handy spirit-lamp flame. In no case
was any appearance whatever of Bacteria or allied organisms observed.
The perusal of the discussion just referred to caused the author to tarn again
to muscle, liver, and kidney, with a view of varying and multiplying the
evidence.    Fowl, pheasant, snipe, partridge, plover, wild duck, beef,
mutton,          tongue, lungs, brains, sweetbread, tripe, the crystalline
            heart.,
lens, vitreous humour, herring, haddock, mullet, codfish, sole, were all
embraced in the experiments.    There was neither mistake nor ambiguity
about the result. One hundred and thirty-nine of the flasks operated on
were submitted to the Fellows ; and not one of this cloud of witnesses
offered the least countenance   to the assertion that liquids within flasks,
boiled and hermetically sealed, swarm, subsequently, more or less plenti
fully with Bacteria and allied organisms.
   The evidence furnished by this mass of experiments, that Dr. Bastian
must have permitted errors either of preparation or observation to invade
his work,    is,it  submitted, very strong.
                      is                     But to err      human
                                                                 is   and in  ;
an inquiry  so difficult and fraught with such momentous issues,         not   it   is
error, but the persistence in error          by

to be deprecated. The author shows by illustrations the risks of error
run    by
        himself.  On the 21st of October he opened the back door of                      a
case containing six test-tubes filled with an infusion of turnip which had
remained perfectly clear for three weeks, while three days sufficed to
crowd six similar tubes exposed to mote-laden air with Bacteria. With                    a
small pipette he took specimens from the pellucid tubes, and placed them
under the microscope.      One of them yielded       field of Bacterial life,
                                                          a
monstrous in its copiousness.     For long time he tried vainly to detect
                                             a
any source of error, and was perfectly prepared to abandon the unvarying
inference from all the other experiments, and to accept the result as a

 clear exception   to what   had previously    appeared to be a general law.
The cause of his perplexity was finally traced       to the tiniest speck of an
infusion containing Bacteria, which had clung         by capillary attraction     to
the point of one of his pipettes.
    Again, three tubes containing infusions of        turnip, hay, and mutton
were boiled, on the 2nd of November, under a          bell-jar containing air so
carefully filtered that the most searching examination by a concentrated
beam failed to reveal a particle of floating matter.        At the present time
every one of the tubes is thick with mycelium          and covered with mould.
Here, surely, we have a case of spontaneous generation.            Let us look to
its history.
    After the air has been expelled from a boiling liquid        it is difficult to
continue the ebullition without " bumping."        The liquid   remains still for
intervals and then rises with sudden energy.        It did so   in the  case now
under consideration ; and one of the tubes boiled over,         the liquid over
spreading the resinous surface in which the bell-jar was imbedded.             Tor
three weeks the infusions had remained perfectly clear.           At the end of
this time, with a view of renewing the air of the jar, it was exhausted,
and refilled by fresh air which had passed through a plug of cotton-wool.
As the air entered, two small spots of Penicillium, resting on the
liquid which     had  boiled over,   attracted  attention.     It   was   at once
remarked that the experiment was a dangerous one, as the entering air
would probably detach some of the spores of the Penicillium and diffuse
them in the bell-jar.       This was therefore filled very slowly, so as to
render   the disturbance    a minimum.       Next day, however, a tuft of
mycelium was observed at the ^bottom of one of the three tubes, namely
that containing the hay-infusion. It has by this time grown so as to fill
a large portion of the tube.      For nearly a month longer the two tubes
containing the turnip- and mutton-infusions maintained their trans
parency unimpaired.        Late in December the mutton-infusion, which
was in dangerous proximity to the outer mould, showed a tuft upon its
surface.     The beef-infusion continued bright and clear for nearly a
fortnight longer. The recent cold weather caused the author to add a third
gas-stove to the two which had previously warmed the room in which the
experiments are conducted.       The warmth played upon one side of the
bell-jar, causing currents     within  it ; and the day after the lighting
of the stove, the beef-infusion gave birth to a tuft of mycelium.                In
this case the small spots of       Penicillium   might have readily escaped
attention; and had they done so we should have had three cases of
"spontaneous generation" far more striking than many that have been
adduced.
    In further illustration of the danger incurred in this field of inquiry,
the author refers to the excellent paper of Dr. Roberts on Biogenesis, in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1874.         Dr. Eoberts fills the bulb of
                                                                    o2

178                       Prof.  J.  Tyndall on the              [Jan.  13,
an ordinary pipette up to about two thirds of its capacity with the
infusion to be examined. In the neck of the pipette he places a plug of
dry cotton-wool.     He then hermetically seals the neck, and dips the bulb
into boiling water or hot oil, where he permits it to remain for the
requisite time.    Here we have no disturbance from ebullition and no
loss by evaporation.    The bulb is removed from the hot water and per
mitted to cool. The sealed end of the neck is then filed off, the cotton
wool alone interposing between the infusion and the atmosphere.
    The arrangement is beautiful, but it has one weak point. Cotton-wool
free from germs is not to be found, and the plug employed by Dr.
Eoberts infallibly contained them. In the gentle movement of the air to
and fro, as the temperature changed, or by any shock, jar, or motion to
which the pipette might be subjected, we have certainly a cause sufficient
to detach a germ now and then from the cotton-wool which, falling
into the infusion, would produce its effect. Probably also condensation
occurred at times in the neck of the pipette, the water of condensation
carrying back from the cotton-wool the seeds of life. The fact of fertili
zation being so rare as Dr. Roberts found it to be, is a proof of the care
with which his experiments were conducted.        But he did find cases of
fertilization after prolonged exposure to the boiling temperature; and
this caused him to come to the conclusion that under certain rare con
ditions spontaneous generation may occur. He also found that an
alkalized hay-infusion was so difficult to sterilize that it was capable of
withstanding the boiling temperature for hours without losing its power
of generating life. The most careful experiments have been made with
this infusion. Dr. Roberts is certainly correct in assigning to it superior
nutritive power. But in the present inquiry five minutes' boiling sufficed
 to completely sterilize the liquid.
    Summing up this portion of his inquiry, the author remarks that he
 will hardly be charged with any desire to. limit the power and potency of
 matter in regard to life. But holding the notions he does upon this
 point, it is all the more incumbent on him to affirm that, as far as
 inquiry has hitherto penetrated, life has never been proved to appear
 independently of antecedent life.
    Though the author had no reason to doubt the general diffusion of
 germs in the atmosphere, he thought it desirable to place the point
 beyond question.      At Down Mr. Darwin and Mr. Francis Darwin, at
 High Elms Sir John Lubbock, at Sherwood, near Tunbridge Wells, Mr.
 Siemens, at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, Mr. Rollo Russell, at
 lleathfield Park Miss Hamilton, at Greenwich Hospital Mr. Hirst, at
 Kew Dr. Hooker, and at the Crystal Palace Mr. Price kindly took charge
 of infusions, every one of which was invaded, many by astounding swarms
 of organisms.    To obtain more definite insight regarding the diffusion of
 atmospheric germs a square wooden tray was pierced with 100 holes, into

1870.]           Phenomena of Putrefaction and Infection.                  179
each   of which was dropped a short test-tube.       On October 23 thirty of
 these tubes were filled with an infusion of hay, thirty-five with an
infusion of turnip, and thirty-five with an infusion of beef.       The tubes
with their infusions had     been previously  boiled, ten at a time, in an oil-
bath.     One hundred circles were marked on paper, so as to form a map
of the tray, and every day the state of each tube was registered upon the
corresponding circle.     In the following description the term " cloudy "
is used to denote the first stage of turbidity, distinct but not strong ;
the term " muddy
                     " is
                           used to denote thick turbidity.
    One tube of the 100 was first singled out and rendered muddy.            It
belonged to the beef group, and it was a whole day in advance of all the
other tubes.    The progress of putrefaction was first registered on the
26th of October.     The " map " then taken may be thus described : —
    Hay. — Of the thirty specimens exposed one had become " muddy —
                                                                           "

 other causes. Every one of the other tubes containing the hay-infusion
 showed spots of mould upon the clear liquid.
    Turnip. — Four of the thirty-five tubes were very muddy, two of them
 being in the row next the stove, one four rows distant, and the remain

 There was no mould on any of the tubes.
    Beef.
          — One tube of the thirty-five was quite muddy, in the seventh
 row from the stove. There were three cloudy tubes, while seven of them
 bore spots of mould.
    As a general rule organic infusions exposed to the air during the
 autumn remained for two days or more perfectly clear. Doubtless from
 the first germs fell into them, but they required time to be hatched. This
 period of clearness may be called the
                                          " period of latency," and indeed it
 exactly corresponds with what is understood by this term in medicine.
 Towards the end of the period of latency the fall into a state of disease
 is comparatively sudden, the infusion passing from perfect clearness to
 cloudiness more or less dense in a few hours.
    Thus the tube placed in Mr. Darwin's possession was clear at 8.30
 a.m. on the 19th of October, and cloudy at 4.30 p.m.            Seven hours,
 moreover, after the first record of our tray of tubes, a marked change
 had occurred.    It may be thus described : — Instead of one, eight of the
 tubes containing      hay-infusion had fallen into uniform muddiness.
 Twenty    others  had  produced Bacterial slime, which had fallen to the
 bottom, every tube containing the slime being covered by mould.         Three
 tubes only remained clear, but with mould upon their surfaces.            The
 muddy turnip-tubes had increased from four to ten ; seven tubes were
 clouded, while eighteen of them remained clear, with here and there a
 speck of mould on the surface.       Of the beef, six were cloudy and one

thickly muddy, while spots of mould had formed on the majority of the
remaining tubes.        Fifteen hours subsequent to this observation, viz. on
the morning of the 27th of October, all the tubes containing hay-infusion
were smitten, though in different degrees, some of them being much
more turbid than others.         Of the turnip-tubes, three only remained un-
smitten, and two of these had mould upon their surfaces.                Only one of
the thirty-five beef-infusions remained intact.            A change of occupancy,
moreover, had occurred in the tube which first gave way.              Its muddiness
remained grey for a day and a half, then it changed to bright yellow-
green, and it maintained this colour to the end.                 On the 27th every
tube of the hundred was smitten, the majority with uniform turbidity,
some, however, with mould above and slime below, the intermediate
liquid being tolerably clear. The whole process bore a striking resem
blance to tho propagation of a plague among a population,                the attacks
being successive and of different degrees of virulence.
    From the irregular manner in which the tubes are infected we may
infer that, as regards quantity, the distribution of the germs in the air is
not uniform. The singling out, moreover, of one tube of the hundred
by the particular Bacteria that develop a green pigment shows that, as
regards quality, tho distribution is not uniform. The same absence of
uniformity was manifested in the struggle for existence between tho
 Bacteria and the Penicillium.              In Bome tubes the former were
triumphant ; in other tubes, of the same infusion, the latter was
 triumphant. It would seem also as if a want of uniformity as regards
 vital vigour prevailed.       With the selfsame infusion the motions of tho
 Bacteria in some tubes were exceedingly languid, while in other tubes
 thoy resembled a rain of projectiles, being so rapid and violent as to
 be followed with difficulty by the eye.          Eeflecting on the whole of this,
 tho author     concludes that the germs float through the atmosphere in
 groups or clouds, with spaces more sparsely filled between them.                 The
 touching of a nutritive fluid by a Bacterial cloud would naturally have a
 different effect from the touching of it by the interspace between two
 clouds.    But   as in tho  case  of  a mottled   sky the various portions of the
 landscape are successively visited by shade, so, in the long run, were the
 various tubes of the tray touched by the Bacterial clouds, the final
 fertilization or infection of them all being the consequence. The author
 connects these results with the experiments of Pasteur on the non-
 continuity of the cause of so-called spontaneous generation, and with
 other experiments of his own *.
    * In hospital practice tho opening of   a wound during the passage of a Bacterial
cloud would have an effect very different from the opening of it in the interspace be
tween two clouds.     Certain caprices in the behaviour of dressed wounds may possibly
be accounted for in this way.

1876.]             Phenomena of Putrefaction and Infection.                        181
    On the 9th of November a second tray containing one hundred tubes,
filled with an infusion of mutton, was exposed to the air. On the
morning of the 11th six of the ten nearest the stove had given way to
putrefaction.       Three of the row most distant from the stove had yielded,
while here and there over the tray particular tubes were singled out and
smitten by the infection.            Of the whole tray of one hundred tubes,
twenty-seven       were   either   muddy or cloudy on the 11th.          Thus, doubt
less, in a contagious atmosphere, are individuals successivly struck down.
On the 12th all the tubes had given way, but the differences in their
contents were extraordinary.            All of them contained Bacteria, Bome few,
others in swarms.         In some tubes they were slow and sickly in their
motions, in some apparently dead, while in others they darted about with
rampant vigour.         These differences are to be referred to differences in
the germinal matter, for the same infusion was presented everywhere to
the air.      Here also we have a picture of what occurs during an epidemic,
the difference in number and energy of the Bacterial swarms resembling
the varying intensity of the disease.              It becomes obvious from these
experiments      that  of  two   individuals  of the same population exposed to a
contagious atmosphere, the one may be severely, the other lightly attacked,
though the two individuals may be as identical as regards susceptibility
as two samples of one and the same mutton-infusion.                 Experiments with
other trays are described in the paper, and calculations are made regard
ing the number of germs held in suspension by the air.
    The author traces still further the parallelism of these actions with

tained a letter on typhoid fever, signed " M.D.," in which occurred
the following remarkable statement : — " In one part of it [Edinburgh],
congregated together and inhabited by the lowest of the population,
there are, according to the Corporation return for 1874, no less than
 14,319 houses or dwellings — many under one roof, on the ' flat system

the excrementitious and other refuse of the inhabitants is collected in
pails or pans, and remains in their midst, generally in a partitioned-off
 corner of the living-room, until the next day, when it is taken down to
 the streets and emptied into the Corporation carts.                    Drunken and
 vicious though the population be, herded together like sheep, and with
 the filth collected and kept for 24 hours in their very midst, it is a
 remarkable fact that typhoid fever and diphtheria are simply unknown
 in these wretched hovels."
    This case has its analogue in the following experiment, which is re-

182        On the Phenomena of Putrefaction          and Infection.       [Jan. 13,
                             —
preservative of a class : On the 30th of November a quantity of animal
refuse, embracing beef, fish, rabbit, hare, was placed in two large test-
tubes opening into a protecting-chamber             containing six tubes.        On
December 13, when the refuse was in a state of noisome putrefaction,
infusions of whiting, turnip, beef, and mutton were placed in the other
four tubes.      They were boiled and abandoned to the action of the foul
" sewer-gas " emitted by their two putrid companions.                On Christmas-
day    these  four  infusions    were limpid.   The end   of  the pipette was then
dipped into one of the putrid tubes, and a quantity of matter, comparable
in smallness to the pock-lymph held on the point of a lancet, was
transferred to the turnip.         Its clearness was not sensibly affected at the
time ; but     on the  26th   it  was  turbid throughout.      On the 27th a speck
from the infected turnip was transferred to the whiting ; on the 28th
 disease had taken entire possession of the whiting.           To the present hour
 the beef- and mutton-tubes remain as limpid as distilled water.             Just as
 in the case of the living men and women in Edinburgh, no amount of
 fetid gas had the power of propagating the plague as long as the
 organisms which constitute the true contagium did not gain access to
 the infusions.
     The universal prevalence of the germinal matter of Bacteria in water
 has been demonstrated with the utmost evidence by the experiments of
 Dr. Burdon Sanderson. But the germs in water are in a very different
 condition,    as regards   readiness for development, from those in air.         In
 water they are thoroughly wetted, and ready, under the proper condi
  tions, to pass rapidly into the finished organism.           In air they are more
 or less desiccated, and require a period of preparation more or less long
  to bring them up to the starting-point of the water-germs. The rapidity
 of development in an infusion infected by either a speck of liquid con
 taining Bacteria or a drop of water is extraordinary.               On the 4th of
 January a thread of glass almost as fine as a hair was dipped into a
  cloudy turnip-infusion, and the tip only of the glass fibre was introduced
  into a large test-tube containing an infusion of red mullet.                Twelve
  hours subsequently the perfectly pellucid liquid was cloudy throughout.
  A second test-tube containing the same infusion was infected with a
  single drop of the distilled water furnished by Messrs. Hopkin and
  Williams ; twelve hours also sufficed to cloud the infusion thus treated.
  Precisely the same experiments were made with herring with the same
  result.    At this season of the year several days' exposure to the air are
  needed to produce the same effect.          On the 31st of December a strong
  turnip-infusion was prepared by digesting in distilled water at a tem
  perature of 120° Fahr.         The infusion was divided between four large
   test-tubes, in one of which it was left unboiled, in another boiled for five
  minutes, and in the two remaining ones boiled and after cooling infected
   with one drop of beef-infusion containing Bacteria.              In twenty-four
  hours the unboiled       tube and     the two infected     ones  were cloudy, the

1876.]             On certain cases of Electromotive Force.                183
unboiled    tube being the most turbid of the three.        The infusion here
was peculiarly limpid after digestion ; for turnip it was quite excep
tional, and no amount of searching with the microscope could reveal in
it at first the trace of   a living Bacterium ; still germs were there which,
suitably   nourished,  passed in a single day into Bacterial swarms without
number.      Five days have not sufficed to produce an effect approximately
equal to this in the boiled tube, which was uninfected but exposed to the
common laboratory air.
    There   cannot, moreover, be a doubt that the germs in the air differ
widely among themselves as regards preparedness for development. Some
are fresh, others old; some are dry, others moist.      Infected by such germs
the same infusion      would    require different lengths of time to develop
Bacterial life. This remark applies to and probably explains the different
degrees of rapidity with which epidemic disease acts upon different people.
In some the hatching-period, if it may be called such, is long, in some
short, the differences depending upon the different degrees of prepared
 ness of the contagium.
    The author refers with particular satisfaction to the untiring patience,
the admirable experimental skill, the veracity in thought, word, and deed
displayed throughout this first section of a large and complicated inquiry

     In  the following experiments the electromotive force was observed by
 a quadrant electrometer arranged for maximum sensibility; the con

nexions were made through the reversing-key ; and, excepting the time ob
servations for polarization, the readings were made twice at least on each
side of the zero-point.       A  single Daniell's element gave 105 divisions de
flection each way, so that      in the following the unit of electromotive force
is TJ-J. the electromotive force of Daniell's element.             In all cases the
electrodes were platinum wires dipping into the fluid under examination.
   In the experiments on polarization the circuit was readily closed for a
specified time by bringing the platinum wires into contact, and broken by
releasing them; the electromotive force could then be observed at any
instant after breaking the circuit.
   I. Strong sulphuric acid was poured into a test-tube, which dipped into
a porcelain crucible containing         caustic potash.     Thus the acid and alkali
were separated by    the  glass  of the  tube.  Platinum electrodes dipped into the
two liquids.     Electromotive force of 70 divisions was observed, the acid
being positive.     The crucible was heated by a spirit-lamp till the potash
began to boil, the electromotive force increased to 153.             The lamp was
removed and the crucible allowed to cool ; the electromotive force steadily
diminished to 78 in half an hour.              The tube was then discharged and
insulated to observe the rate at which the charge developed.
                                                            E.F.

   II. The tube, crucible, and wire were thoroughly washed with cold water
and replaced in position, but with water in place of both the acid and the
alkali.    The inside of the tube where the acid had been was now negative.
E. E.=16£. Heating to boiling the deflection increased to 150 divisions,
but sank to 2 on cooling.
   III.   The test-tube contained potash and dipped into water in the crucible.
When cold, E. F.=33, the potash being negative; when heated to boiling,
E. F.=36£.
   IV.    The tubo contained strong sulphuric acid and dipped into water ; a
deflection of less than three divisions was observed. When heated till the
water boiled, the reading was 35.           After cooling the deflection decreased
to 5.
   V. The test-tube was removed and           a small porcelain crucible introduced
in its place; sulphuric acid was poured into the outer crucible, potash into
the inner ; platinum electrodes dipped into the liquids. On heating till
the potash boiled, the electromotive force rose as high as 102.             The de
crease of the electromotive force as the liquids cooled was then observed.

   The author supposed these effects to be due to electrolytic action
through the glass, not suspecting the true cause, excepting in V.           But
Sir William Thomson pointed out to him that the rate of development
of the charge was greater than could occur through a substance of the
low conductivity of the most conducting glass, and that the circuit must
have been completed by conduction through a film of moisture on the
surface of the glass.      The next two experiments prove this to be the
case.
   VI. Drops of strong sulphuric acid and of caustic potash were placed
on a sheet of common window-glass, previously carefully cleaned, but ex
posed to the air of the room. Platinum electrodes, dipping into each drop,
communicated with the electrometer.
   1.  Drops half an inch apart, E. F. = 47.
   2.  The drops were connected by a thin trail of alkali drawn from the
drop of alkali ; E. P. = 105.
   3. Drops 5 inches apart, two minutes being allowed for the charge
to develop; E. P. = 12.
   4. A trail was drawn halfway from one drop to the other; E. F.=31.
   5. The trail of liquid was continued till but ^ inch of clear glass
separated the liquids ; E. F. = 43.
   6. The connecting trail was completed from one drop to the other ; E.
F. = 70. It was observed that the potash trail had dried up, leaving a line
of alkali between the drops.
   VII. A dry chip of deal 6 inches long was split at each end, and a platinum
wire let into each slit ; the two wires were moistened with sulphuric
acid and potash respectively at the points of contact with the wood ;
E.F. = 43.
   VIII.   Clean platinum wires were let into slits in a second dry chip of deal
 12 inches long ; these were connected for twenty minutes with the poles of a
battery of twoDaniell's elements, and then detached and connected through
the reversing-key with the electrometer.       As was expected an electromo
tive force opposite to that of the battery was observed, at first amounting
to 33 divisions.
   These experiments show that imperfect insulation, such as glass exposed
 to the air or wood, may cause errors in electrical experiments, not merely
by leakage, but by introducing unknown electromotive forces, arising either
from the imperfect insulators connecting different liquids, or from elec
trolytic polarization after a current has for some time been creeping through
or over the surface of the insulators.
    Several experiments were then tried on the direct action of liquids on
liquids ; two only are given here, because determinations have been made
by other methods by Becquerel and others.
   IX. In a previous experiment a plug of moist sand had been rammed into
the bend of a TJ-tube, and strong sulphuric acid and caustic potash poured
into the limbs.     When this tube was washed out, it was found that     a plug

dle of the bend.      Strong sulphuric acid and potash were again poured"
into the limbs, and were now only separated by a thin plug of sidphate
of potash.    Platinum electrodes dipped into the liquids. Electromotive

    The wires were again connected and the circuit left closed for about
 twenty-four hours. It was found that the plug had extended for about
 half an inch on the side of the sulphuric acid by the formation of crystals
 of sulphate of potash, but had not apparently changed where it was in
contact with the potash.

    Mx deab Sib, —    I   have the pleasure to send you, by Overland Parcel
 Post, for presentation to the Royal Society, two photographs on glass of
 the solar spectrum, showing the extreme red rays below A, obtained on
 a dry collodion plate prepared with bromide of silver stained with a blue

dye *, and exposed to diffused daylight for a moment before being placed
in the camera to receive the image of the spectrum.                I also send another
plate, also a dry bromide plate, stained with the same blue dye, and
prepared      at the same time and in the same manner as the other plates,
bnt not exposed to light and quite free from fog ; and you will observe
 that on this there is no trace of the reversed action in the red rays, and
 that the direct action only extends slightly below C.
     This power of the red rays of the spectrum to neutralize the action of
 white light on sensitive daguerreotype plates was frequently noticed by
 Sir J. Herschel, Draper, Fizeau, Claudet, and other daguerreotypists
 about thirty years ago, but, so far as            I  can ascertain, it has never been
 observed on collodion plates.           As collodion has so many advantages over
 the daguerreotype, it seems probable that this new extension of an old
 principle may have an important practical application in spectroscopic
 photography, particularly for the mapping of a part of the spectrum in
 which eye-observations can only be made with difficulty and under
 favourable circumstances.
     The apparatus used for obtaining two of these photographs consisted
 of  a Browning's chemical spectroscope, fitted with a very fine flint prism
 of  60°, and used in conjunction with one of Dallmeyer's rapid rectilinear
 lenses of 30" focus.        The rays of the sun were collected from a 9" helio
 trope, worked by hand, and thrown on the slit by means of a condensing-
 lens of 3" diameter and 25" focus.            The aperture of the slit varied from
  •003 to '005, as marked on the plate.
     The other single photograph was taken with a five-prism direct-vision
 spectroscope, by the same maker, also attached to the rapid rectilinear
 lens, and with the same arrangement of heliotrope and condenser.
     The plates were prepared with a bromized collodion made by Rouch,
  sensitized in a bath of pure nitrate of silver at 16 per cent., then well
  washed in several changes of water and treated with a watery solution
  of the blue dye, again washed to remove the superfluous colour, and then
  dried.    The colour of the prepared plates when dry was a light lavender.
  The development was by the alkaline method, followed by an intensifica
  tion with acid, silver, and pyrogallic acid. Before being placed in the
  dark slide, the plates on which the extreme red rays are shown received
  a momentary exposure to diffused daylight by quickly opening and
  shutting the window of the dark room.
     It will be observed that the best results have been obtained with long
  exposures of 30 or 40 minutes ; and               it is also necessary to work with
     * I enclose a specimen  of the dye.   I do not know its chemical name,  but it appears
  to belong to the aniline or some analogous   series, and was obtained in the native mar
  ket here.   Dissolved in alcohol it is of a fine deep blue, but the addition of water
  changes the tint to a rich violet or purple.
     [I have compared the specimen, as to its absorption-spectrum and the action of
  reagents, with authentic aniline blue, and the two appear to be identical, —0. Q. S.]

rather an open slit, which injures the definition very much, so that the
details of the many lines which       I have ascertained to exist in the portion
of the spectrum below A are not at all distinct ; but it is possible that
means may be found for obtaining better results with moderate exposure
and a fine slit ; and   I  hope to be able to continue the investigation with
this object in view.
    I  have not been able yet to ascertain in what manner the blue dye
acts ; but that it plays an important part in obtaining the results is
evident from the fact that on a dry bromide plate unstained the rever
sing effect of the red rays is not observed.           I  was led to use it from
observing, during the course of an investigation of Dr. H. Vogel's impor
tant discovery of the effect of certain dyes on the sensibility of dry
bromide-of -silver plates to the less refrangible rays, that on plates stained
with aniline red, orange, green, and blue, the       A   and other lines in the red
were often visible reversed      ;  and there were traces of reversed        action
below    A, but most markedly on the plates stained with the particular
blue dye referred to. As      I  had not observed it on the plain unstained
bromide plates,    I attributed    the effect to the action of the dyes, over
looking the fact that the plates were all slightly fogged.            On repeating
the experiments    with   the blue-stained    plates, prepared in a purified bath
and very free from fog, the reversed action was not perceptible ; and
recollecting the old daguerreotype experiments, the idea suggested itself of
trying whether it could be obtained by means of the preliminary expo
 sure to light.
     On examining my spectrum negatives,          I find that the same reversing
action in the red is also to be traced on a few plates prepared with
bromoiodized collodion, exposed wet and developed with the ordinary
iron developer ; but further experiments are required before           I can ascer
tain whether good results can be obtained in this manner.             The effect of
 staining the dry bromide films with other dyes has also to be investi
 gated.
     I would  further draw your attention        to the reversal of the blue and
violet   rays between    H   and    F.   I  have observed this effect on all dry
 bromide plates, whether stained or unstained.            It appears to be caused
chiefly by overexposure, but may also be partly due to the action of the
 alkaline developer.    On some plates it is more distinct and of greater
extent than on others.        I  am scarcely sufficiently acquainted with the
 subject to venture on an explanation of this action of the blue rays, but
 may remark that they would appear to lose by long and excessive action
 the decomposing power they first exert on the bromide-of-silver film, and
 to exercise instead the neutralizing and bleaching action of the red rays.
 On the single photograph this reversed action of both sets of rays is well
 illustrated, and the whole spectrum is reversed from H to below A, the
 minimum of action being about F.
     Should you consider the subject of sufficient interest,      I  trust you will

do me the favour       of bringing this communication to the notice of the
Society  ;  and  I need   not say that I shall be exceedingly glad of any sug
gestions for improving the method and utilizing it in making systematic
observations of any points which may be elucidated by its means.

   Deab Sib, — In continuation of my letter of last week               I  enclose a
sketch of the lines     in the extreme red rays,      as nearly as    I   can make
them out, from one of the photographs           I  have taken in the manner
described, and the only one in which      I have obtained the lines so clearly.
It was taken at 1.48 p.m. on the 8th October (just at the close of our
rainy season) with an exposure of 15 minutes, the same arrangement of
spectroscope being used as for taking the two negatives            I sent you last
mail.

   I  have since writing made a successful experiment in obtaining re
versed negatives on insolated, blue-stained, dry bromized collodion plates
by means of the reversing action of the red rays passing through ruby
glass, and also on similar plates prepared with bromized collodion
coloured a bright yellow with tincture of annatto.          I have also reason to
believe that it will not be impossible to obtain the same reversing action
through blue glass ; but further trials are requisite.
   I  may also add that      I have found that dry bromide plates prepared
with the collodion containing annatto are more highly sensitive to the
whole spectrum than any others ; so that         I  have obtained the C, B, a,
and  A lines quite distinctly on such plates unreversed, and also ono line
below  A   at about the same distance from it as a.

      and Council of the Royal Society on the Work done in the
      Meteorological Office since their appointment in 1866 to
      December 31, 1875."
   The business of the Office will be reviewed under the three           heads into
which it is subdivided, and which are as follows : —
                    I. Ocean Meteorology.

                            I. Ocean Meteorology.
   The most important task of the Committee at its first institution was

190                Report of the Meteorological     Committee.         [Jan. 20,
to examine and to take stock of all the instruments and materials for
work existing in the Office.
    Inquiry was made into the actual condition and employment of all
instruments      outstanding on the books, whereby several were recovered,
and several proved to be non-existent.         Since 1867 no instruments have
 been supplied, except     for the public service.
    The books in the Office, which have been kept since 1854, enable us
 to trace the history and corrections      of every instrument which has ever
 been purchased.
    The entire store of documents in the Office was carefully examined by
 Capt. Toynbee ; those that were worthless were set aside, and in the
remainder the quality of each element which they contained was marked.
    The Office then resumed the supply of instruments to observers at sea,
and reorganized the agencies at certain ports.          These agencies are paid
according to results.       The outcome of these operations is shown in the
Annual Reports.
   Among the most important benefits to the science attributable to the
action of the Committee has been the great improvement in the quality
of the logs sent in, owing to the care taken to select observers.
   The following figures show the total number of logs, and the number
of first-class logs, classed " excellent" which have been received each year
from the Mercantile Marine since the management of the Office has been
under the Meteorological Committee.

    The marked improvement shown in the last few years is doubtless
entirely due to a thoroughly systematic supervision by Captain Toynbee
of all logs received. In every case where improvement is considered
necessary, and reasonably practicable, the captain responsible for the log
has been communicated with, and in many cases induced to call at the
 Office for a personal interview.
    The high percentage of excellent logs in recent years is in no way to
be attributed      to a lower standard of excellence being used; on the
contrary, the standard of excellence may be considered to have increased
rather than to have diminished.
    It  seems   that greater weight should be attached to the relative values
above,    from the fact that the classification has been carried out by the

   The continuity of the observations and the hours at which observations

   At the same time it should be remarked that there is great difficulty
in securing a supply of observers, and that it is in contemplation to relax
in some measure the rigour of the tests applied to the observations.

           Pacific, like those on the two tropics in the Atlantic, and also

        of the Barometer, and Air and Sea Temperature for each
        Month and for the Tear in the Northern and Southern Halves
        of the Square, from which have been calculated the diurnal-
         range corrections for the district.
            This is the most elaborate paper ever published for any
        portion of the ocean ; and the large relative proportion of labour
         bestowed on the district is justified by the considerations that
         the amount of material existing for it is quite exceptional, and
        that it lies on the highroad between the North and South
         Atlantic, and is the meeting-place of the two trade-winds.
           The meteorologist thus finds the materials for a study of the
        conditions of wind, ocean-currents, weather, &c. in a region
        where two great currents of air are always meeting, with in
        formation as to the diurnal march of pressure and temperature
        in the region of the equator and at sea ; while the sailor finds,
        in the monthly charts, diagrams of what he may expect to
         encounter on his passage through the Square at any season ; and
        in the text containing the explanations he finds a discussion of
        the entire mass of information, and, as a final conclusion, advice
        as to the best route for crossing the Line in each month.
            The public will, however, be in a much better position to
        judge of the work of the Office when the Charts, &«. now
        in the press, for the nine squares (lat. 10° 8.-20° N., long.
         10°-40° W.), of which Square 3 forms the centre, are published.
        In these charts, as dealing with a larger area and stretching
        from shore to shore of the Atlantic, are given not only charts
        of the same character as those above described (though for
        larger areas, owing to comparative deficiency of material), but
        also diagrams showing the direction of wind in connexion with
        atmospherical pressure and temperature, and of ocean-currents
        with sea-temperature.
            There is also given a tabular statement contrasting the
        specific gravity of the sea in the easterly [going] or

1876.]         Report of the Meteorological Committee.                  193
           seaman's observation, such as the weather, the wind, the motion
           of the clouds in relation to the lower wind, the direction of the
           swell, the colour and luminosity of the sea, and the current
           rips; as well as information relating to the birds, fish, and
           insects that are met with, and the variation from month to
           month of the localities in which they are seen, and also appear
           ances of submarine volcanic action in certain localities.
   By these investigations it is believed that important light has been
thrown on several subjects of general as well as of special interest.
   1. As to the tendency of the wind blowing along a coast-line to draw
       round a cape.
  2. As to the relation of the surface-temperature and the currents of
       the sea near the equator to the westerly gales of high northern
        and southern latitudes in their respective winters ; as to the
        dipping of a cold current under a warm one, and the variation
       with the seasons in the amount of easterly current near the
       equator.
  3. As to a probable relation between the well-known rollers of Ascen
        sion and St. Helena and the winter gales of the North Atlantic,
       and a corresponding relation of the rollers on the west coast of
        Africa to the winter gales of high southern latitudes.
  4. As to the remarkable difference in direction of the wind in Decem
        ber on opposite sides of the Cape- Verde Islands, being easterly to
        the westward and north-north-east to the eastward of them.
   5. As to the remarkable unsteadiness and gustiness of the north-east
       trade with a clear sky in Square 40 (lat. 10°-20° N., long.
       30°-40° W.), in certain months.
   6. As to the difference between the wind and weather of Square 303
       (lat. 0°-10° S., long. 30°-40° W.),
                                               off Cape St. Eoque and its
       neighbourhood, and those of the Squares lying to the eastward
       of that point, more especially in regard of the fact that in certain
       months the wind in Square 303, during the squalls which fre
       quently occur, constantly changes between south-east and south-
        south-west in such a way that the seaman finds very great
       difficulty in working to the southward if he approaches too near
       the Brazilian coast.
  7.  As to the relation of the upper currents of the atmosphere (indi
       cated by cloud motion) to the lower winds — e.g., how the equa
       torial margin of one Trade appears to rise above the edge of the
       other Trade, how the upper clouds move from the north-east over
       the south-west monsoon on the coast of Africa, and how some
       times clouds move from the south-east, the sky looking very
       heavy towards that quarter, while the surface wind is steady from
       south-west.
   8. As to the relation between heavy dew and sea-temperature in      some

194            Report of the Meteorological Committee.             [Jan. 20,
        parts and at certain seasons,       and the connexion   between mist
        (haze) and African dust.
                                                                              "
   9. The diagrams give   a picture of   Maury's " wedge-shaped doldrums
        which   any sailor can understand, and the remarks show the
         weather experienced in them.
   In these discussions the object of the Meteorological Office has been to
determine the meteorological statistics of limited portions of the ocean in
each   separate month by means of results obtained by discussion             of
original observations extracted from the logs in the Office.
   The scope of these publications is consequently different from that of
the charts published by the Admiralty, which aim at giving a general
view of what may be expected at each season (three-monthly period) over
the Atlantic Ocean, as in the "Pilot" Charts, or the whole navigable
                                          "
globe, as in the " Wind and Current Charts.
   Of the two investigations in question Capt. Toynbee      has given popular
accounts in papers read before the United Service Institution        (in 1873)
and before the British Association (in 1875) respectively.
   The Office having thus completed the examination of the district close
to the equator in the Atlantic Ocean, about the most important and
interesting to the navigator and meteorologist of any region in the world,
has commenced the investigation of the meteorology of another great
district lying on the highroad between Europe and the Indian and
Australian seas, that of the Cape of Good Hope, which will be prose
cuted in due course, the question of the best method of dealing with
that district being under consideration.
   Another inquiry of considerable interest, of the same nature as that
noted as O. 13, is being instituted into the wind and weather of the
North Atlantic during the month of August 1873. For this the Office
has obtained the loan of 280 logs, as will be mentioned later on.
   While thus working at its own materials the Office has not been
neglectful of foreign publications of value bearing on Ocean Meteorology.
   Three of these have been specially published, in addition to the repro
duction of the Dutch Sea-Temperature Observations for the Atlantic,
which have been already mentioned.
   These three are : —

    With reference to the Recommendations contained in ihe Eeport of
the Committee of Inquiry (1866) in relation to the subject of Ocean
Meteorology      (p. 15 of their Eeport) it may be said : —

   c. As regards the method           The plan of loose cards suggested was
         of    extracting    the   tried for a certain time, but was subsequently
         observations.             given up for another (described in the Re
                                  port of the Meteorological Committee for
                                  1867, pp. 8 and 60) which experience showed
                                  to be preferable.
   t/.As regards the method           These recommendations have not been
         of   discussing    and    fully carried out; on the one hand the
        tabulating the re         work has been conducted to a much greater

                                  sults of    a more valuable character in the
                                  interests of navigation.
                                     On the other hand, with every desire to
                                  carry out the recommendations of the Re
                                  port, it   has  not   been  found  practicable to
                                  tveirjht the observations, and consequently to
                                  assign   the degree  of probable precision to the
                                 results.
   e. As regards the publi            The recommendations have been carried

        logical results.          publications    of  the  Office have  been   more
                                 methodical than those criticised in the report.
  f.  As regards the publi           The recommendations as regards com
        cation of other re        munication of hydrographical notices to the
        sults useful to navi      Admiralty have been fully carried out. The
        gation.                  report, however, did not apparently con
                                 template the publication of any data in the
                                 form of charts by the Meteorological Office ;
                                 it was, however, considered by the Meteoro
                                 logical Committee that for certain purposes,
                                 as indicated by the foregoing statement, the
                                 form of      a chart was preferable to    ordinary

196              Report  of the Meteorological   Committee   .
                                                                   [Jan. 20,
                          II. "Weatheb Telegeapht.
   The first action prior to the resumption of the issue of storm-warnings
was the inspection of the stations.
    This has been annually carried out ever since.      Much that was objec
tionable has been gradually improved, and at present 16 out of the 29
stations are provided with the Stevenson's thermometer-screen.
    Observers have been changed from time to time, so that at present
only 12 are telegraph clerks, and all are distinctly and immediately
responsible to the Office.
    The Office may fairly claim for its service a higher degree of scientific
accuracy and completeness than exists in any at present in operation in
Europe. It must always be remembered that, as a rule, telegraphic
stations    are not likely to be good stations for general climatology, the
conditions which determine the choice of locality being widely different
in the two cases. It seems therefore less incumbent on the Office to
publish means for temperature, &c. for these stations than would appear
to have been held by some authorities, to judge from the evidence on the
subject laid before the recent Science Commission.
    A difficulty in dealing with "Weather Telegraphy is to be found in the
frequency of telegraphic errors, which renders any absolute dependence
on figures received by telegraph impossible.      Some idea of the extent to
which this evil affects the scientific prosecution of weather study and
interferes with the formation of correct views of the essential facts with
the promptitude that is required for the practical application of the
 deduced results — the issue of warnings to the coasts — may be gathered
 from the fact that in the      case of one single station, Oxford, 49 errors
 were detected (on receipt of the original MS. messages) in the space of
 18 months, which were all proved to be due to inaccurate transmission,
and were     in addition to a considerable number which had been discovered
at first inspection of the telegrams (owing to the glaring discrepancy of
the reports from those of adjacent stations), and had been corrected by
repetition of the message.
    This number gives about 32 errors per annum ; so that on this hypo
thesis there would be 32 x 29 or 928 errors from British stations coming
in every year, which it is apparently        impossible  to detect by simple
 inspection of the telegrams.
    Of errors in barometrical     and thermometrical readings as received by
telegraph and suspected from their discrepancy inter se, the Office dis
 covers more than 1000 every year, frequently eliciting a correction by
 repetition of the telegram and correspondence with the observers.
    The following memorandum shows the present condition of the Weather
 Service  : —

                   by Professor Buys Ballot.     This paper tended to establish
                   the value of gradients for the purposes of weather study.
N. O.     2.   A   Paper by Capt. Toynbee on the curves of the Meteorological
                   Observations taken on board the steamers running between
                   Europe and America, showing that as on their voyages out
                   ward they meet, and on their homeward route they run with,
                   cyclonic systems of wind which are crossing the Atlantic, the
                   successionof the phenomena is much more rapid in the
                   former      in the latter case. In fact, in some of the
                            than
                   homeward runs, the barometer is found to rise when the wind
              is southerly, thus showing that the ship is outstripping the
              disturbance.
N.   O. 3. Also by Capt. Toynbee, shows by a number of instances the
              value of isobaric curves for the purposes of weather study,
                   and also draws the attention   of sailors to the fact that the

                   in which they are sailing with regard to the wind) affects
                   very materially the rate of the changes that are taking place
                   in the indications of the meteorological instruments, the
                   barometer falling less rapidly, or even rising, when they are
                   on the starboard tack (that is, with the wind on the right),
                   and the converse when they are on the port tack, in the
                   Northern Hemisphere.

                   Atlantic weather which has appeared, and     shows, inter it
                   alia, how incomplete the materials are, and must      for any      be,
                   synoptic weather-charts   extending over     wide stretch of

                   ocean. It illustrates the generation of the Atlantic winter
                   gales over the warm-water area on the prolongation of the
                   Gulf- stream, and proves that the centres of disturbances in
                   some cases move to the east or north-east, at        rate exceeding
                   30 miles an hour—  a   fact w-hich   is   confirmed     by a
                                                                        the records of
                   the self-recording observatories      in these islands, and by the
                   general results of the observations          made     over the whole of
                   Northern Europe.
     In
      order to carry out the same method of investigation over       more                   a
extensive field, the Office has undertaken the examination of the weather
of the Atlantic for the entire month of August 1873, when      very severe        a
cyclonic storm swept along the American coast and did enormous damage
in Nova Scotia. It      hoped that light will be thrown on the actual
                             is
formation of, and the subsequent modifications in, this serious storm, so
that some attempt may be made to solve the vexed problem of the precise
direction of the motion of the air in cyclones in reference to the position

of the centre of the disturbance.        The Office has appealed to the owners
of all British vessels at sea in the Atlantic during the month in question,
and has met with a very satisfactory response, having received no less
than 280 logs, a larger number than has ever before been available           for
such an inquiry.
   The charge of the issue of storm-warnings &c. has necessarily been
wholly confided by the Committee to the Director of the Office, who, in
reply to our inquiry how far the principles by which he is guided admit
of being formulated, has furnished us with the following remarks : —
   " The chief of these principles, which are only announced with
                                                                           very
great diffidence, as being liable to material modification with the growth
of experience, are as follows : —
   " I. The Law known as Buys Ballot's, which is simply a general
                                                                             ap
          plication of the Law      of   Storms announced by Eedfield and
          Beid.
             " The intelligent application of this principle to wind motion,
          even on the most extensive scale, has been the chief point in which
         modern meteorology offers a contrast to prior investigations into
         the science.
             " This law gives not only the direction of the wind, but also its
         force, which is measured with more or less accuracy by means of
         gradients.    That it is not absolutely true in all cases and condi
         tions is more than probable, although precise statements on this
         subject are not accessible as yet.
             " As regards Direction, the indraught of wind across the isobars
         in front of an advancing storm is indisputable, as is the effect of
         land in modifying the motion of the air.
             " As regards Force, it is clear that the same gradient does not ac
         company the same force      of wind from all points. A further proof
         of this statement is to be found in a fact which has been elicited
         by the investigations into the meteorology of the sea, that for the
         same force of wind the gradient is less in the 8.E. than in the
         N.E. Trade.
  "  II.   Tlie mutual Relation    of  areas  of low and of high Barometrical
         Pressure, the former being        to a great extent regulated as to
         their motion by the latter, and skirting them on their western,
         northern, and eastern side, at least ; so that when we have an area
         of high pressure situated over a portion of these islands, we can
         form a good idea of the probable direction of motion of cyclones
         in our neighbourhood — e. g., the existence of an anticyclone over
         Ireland is accompanied by the advance of cyclonic disturbances
         southwards over the Baltic or North Sea, causing northerly gales
         on the east coast of England.
             " The above principle is manifestly incomplete, inasmuch as it
         takes noaccountof the rarity of any westward motioninthecyclones.

1876.]           Report of the Meteorological       Committee.                  201
        This latter circumstance, however, appears to be a local pecu
        liarity, and it is probable that if the weather were studied over a
        wider area, as     in the synoptic charts of Capt. Hoffmeyer, or those
        projected, but not yet carried out, by the United States Signal
        Office, light would be thrown upon it. It is certain that a mo
        tion westward does sometimes occur even over these islands, as
        well     as  in lower latitudes, as,   e. g., over Turkey in Asia, from
         Bagdad to Salonika, Nov. 3-6, 1869.
             " The appearance of secondary cyclones in connexion with larger
         disturbances of the same nature is gradually attracting more and
         more attention.       These systems are imperfectly developed, inas
         much as, generally speaking, they exhibit no easterly winds of
         much force, manifesting themselves on the southern side of their
         primaries, and intensifying the violence of the westerly winds
         which blow under such circumstances.
             " It must be admitted that, not unfrequently,       the arrival of one
         of these satellite depressions, in advance of a more serious storm,
         has enabled the Office to give timely warning of the latter.
             " The comparative rarity of the easterly winds in our cyclonic
         storms is probably traceable to the constant existence of an area
         of deficient pressure near Iceland, which renders the formation of
         steep gradients for easterly winds an unusual phenomenon.
             " There appear to be   some indications of principles by which we
         can recognize whether or not a cyclonic disturbance is speedily to
         be succeeded by another.
             " If, after the centre of a depression has passed over us, the     shift
         of wind and fall of temperature causes a          great clearness of the
         air, intense radiation occurs at night, the thermometer on the
         grass falling 10° to 14° below that in the shade 4 feet above the
         ground.       Under such circumstances it has been noticed that the
         advent of a new depression is imminent. When, however, the
         series of successive depressions has ceased for a while, the wea
         ther clears much less rapidly, and radiation is not nearly so
         marked.
              " On the whole thus much may     be affirmed, that it is to the general
          conditions of atmospherical      pressure over as large an area as pos
          sible that we are to look    for an insight into the probable changes
          which     are likely to ensue. To this subject           I   shall shortly
          recur.
   " III. Temperature. — As regards the relation of this element to atmo
          spherical disturbance, there are no definite principles which can
          be said to be generally admitted as true.        This may be gathered
          from the almost total silence on this subject on the part of those
          who replied to the circular of the Leipzig Storm- Warning Com
          mittee    in 1872.

202             Report    of the Meteorological     Committee.        [Jan. 20,
            " Thus much may, however,      be said: —
            " A great contrast of temperature over a limited area, or, so to
         speak, a great thermometric gradient, being an indication of serious
         atmospherical disturbance, is a precursor or concomitant of a
         storm.     This fact   has been clearly pointed out by Dove; but
        more recent evidence on the same head is to be found in the cir
        cumstance that for five days, January 26-30, 1870, the mean of
        the temperatures at 8 a.m. at London and Valencia differed 16°,
        being 28° and 44° respectively, a heavy southerly gale blowing all
        the time over Ireland.       A more recent instance, in which a re
        markable contrast of temperature immediately preceded a very
        serious storm, was on the 13th of November, 1875, when the
        reading at Scilly was 57°, and at Wick 21°.         These figures give
       the very large difference of 36°.     The gale of Sunday, November
        14th, with its accompanying high tide, will be fresh in the me
        mory of all.
           " Another mode of utilizing temperature in the
                                                                 forecasting of
        storms is to be found in the long-established fact that an abnor
       mally high temperature, close stuffy weather, frequently precedes
        a storm.      This principle has not been reduced to numerical
       measure as yet.
  " IV.    Vapour-Tension and Rainfall.— Very much weight is attached
        by several meteorologists to the indications obtainable from these
        elements, as Mohn and Loomis consider that their disturbance
        and intensity determine the direction and velocity of motion of
        cyclones, and that even the very existence of a cyclonic disturb
        ance depends on the presence of aqueous vapour in abundance.
           " For the area of our 6torm-warning system this indication is ne
       cessarily of minor value, inasmuch as our district is so intersected
        by water that no portion of it will show such contrasts in regard
       of vapour-tension as subsist in continental stations.
  " V. Sea-Disturbance. — This is at times    a most valuable    help towards
       gaining   a knowledge      of coming storms   ; but it is very untrust
      worthy.      The sea-disturbance, being caused by the wind, is pro
      pagated    in  the direction in which that wind is blowing, not in that
       in which it is advancing. Thus a very heavy sea may roll in on
       our coasts without any gale reaching them; and conversely heavy
      gales, even westerly gales, like that of November 22, 1872, may
      come on without any premonition in the way of a ground-swell.
           " The distance to which waves may be propagated is indicated
                                                                            by
      what has already been mentioned as probable, that the ' rollers '
      of Ascension and St. Helena may be due to N.W. gales in the
      North Atlantic.
" VI. Local Signs. — These are really among the most important indica
      tions of coming change; but practically they can scarcely be

1876.]          Report   of the Meteorological    Committee.                  203
         utilized by us. They cannot be reduced to rule, and they depend
         almost entirely on personal experience.      It is impossible in a
         telegram to convey the entire line of reasoning which leads one, in
         the absence of instruments, to know that a storm is impending.
         The character, elevation, and motion of jclouds, the colour of the
         sky, the clearness or the contrary of the air, the appearance of
         the aurora, and numerous other signs are well known to every
         one who studies weather    ;and from these helps the cabinet me
         teorologist is entirely debarred.  He is like a physician dealing
         with a case by correspondence, without the chance of a personal
         interview with his patient ; for what can a resident in an inland
         town like London, on any given day, know of the look of the
        weather on the sea-coast on the same day.
  " If, in conclusion,   Iwere asked how our weather service could be
most directly improved, on the supposition that larger means were avail
able for its prosecution,    I
                           should say, —
  " A. The supply of     cheap self-recording instruments to our principal
         stations, so that the reporters should be able to furnish intelli
         gence as to the changes which have taken place immediately pre
         vious to the epoch for which the report is framed.
            " The erection at a number of well-exposed outlying stations of
         the automatic signalling-anemometers    described in the Report of
         the British Association for 1874, p. 37, in order to warn the
         nearest telegraphic stations of the fact that the wind has reached
         a given velocity, say 30 miles an hour.        Want of funds has
         hitherto prevented the carrying out of this plan.
  " B. Additional stations at well-selected points on our west coast,          as
         at Mullaghmore, on Donegal Bay, and at high levels, as at Settle,
         in Yorkshire.
            "The former especially to give more accurate indications of wind,
         which from our present stations is often necessarily incorrect,
         owing to the precipitous character of our western coasts, which
         affects the direction and force of the wind. The latter to furnish
         means for a study of the differences of atmospherical conditions in
         a vertical direction, which has yielded very valuable results when
       ever it has been prosecuted.
  " C. Additional                   This is      a most pressing   want ; it has

         "Times' having begun (Jan. 1876) to bear the expense of an
         evening message from some stations.
  " D. Improved accuracy in transmission of the reports.              This   is,
                                                                              I
         fear, hopeless!
  " E.    Extension of the area covered by our reports.   This raises the
         question of international exchanges and in this particular
                                              ;                      must

         be remembered that      stations are not of equal value, for   a   report

         from an outlying post,      as Valencia or Sumburgh   Head, is worth
         to the continental meteorologists many times more than a report
         from a continental    station is to us.
            " The extension of our system westwards, were it possible, would
         be of incalculable  value  ; but America and even Newfoundland are
         too distant for us to reason with any degree of certainty on what
         the changes taking place there may portend to us.
            "Beports from the Azores, if supported by others from Spain and
         Portugal, would be of value; but they would require confirmation.
         At least two simultaneous reports from independent stations in
         that group of islands would be required, in order to afford means
         for checking doubtful statements or errors in telegraphy.
   " P. An increase of the staff of the Office.
            " To summarize. More information from existing stations,     a large
         extension of our area of observation, and a reinforcement       of the
         staff for weather study, are the chief requirements       of our tele
         graphic system at present."
   In   the matter of the     " Becommendations     ou the subject of Weather
Telegraphy, Daily Forecasts, and Storm- Warning, and upon observations
of Weather within or affecting the British Isles," made by the Committee
of Inquiry'(1866), it may be said that the progress of this department of
meteorology since I860 has been so considerable that the importance of
several of the Becommendations has been materially modified by recent
experience. The Office has carried out the recommendations in principle
as regards the development       of the observing system, the issue of storm-
warnings,     and the discontinuance      of weather forecasts, and as to the
checking of the warnings.        It has not, however, for reasons which will
be stated   hereafter, published a series of maxims, nor has it been found
 possible, with the present staff, to analyze strictly the principles on which
 the issue of warnings, &c. has been carried out from day to day.
    The staff has been quite insufficient to cope with the serious discussion
of the weather charts which are daily accumulating.
    The Office has cooperated readily with the United States Signal Office
 in its project for synchronous observations over the whole globe.
             III.  Land Meteoboiogy. of the Beitish Islands.
    This branch of the Office has been carried out in accordance with the
plan sketched out in the letter from the President and Council of the
Boyal Society to the Board of Trade of June 15, 1865, approved by the
 Committee of Inquiry (1866), and sanctioned generally by the Treasury
in a letter to the Board of Trade, dated November 30, 1866. The num
ber of stations originally proposed was six, with possibly two additional
points of observation, situated in the south-west and in the north-west
of Ireland respectively.      The six stations specified were accepted and
have been in continual operation until now.            The Treasury did not

sanction the insertion     on the estimates of the    full sum proposed by the
Meteorological Committee for the year 1867-68 ; and accordingly the Com
mittee at first determined to defer the establishment of the station at
Aberdeen, in consideration       of the greater importance of records from
Valencia.      At  the  request    of the authorities at Aberdeen, conveyed
through the Duke of Richmond, Chancellor of that University, the Com
mittee resolved to reconsider their proposal ; and ultimately Aberdeen
was included in the list of places fitted out with self-recording instru
ments.
    The choice of these stations was guided by the fact of the existence in
each locality, except Valencia,     of some scientific body to whom the instru
ments could be entrusted.           This involved the necessity of placing the
instruments     in the best available positions on the premises of the respec
tive institutions, the funds available being totally inadequate for the
erection of special structures for the reception of the instruments or tho
maintenance of special observing establishments.           Hence have arisen the
defects in arrangements as concerns temperature in regard of elevation
above the ground at Falmouth and Aberdeen, and to a less degree at
Valencia, and as to proximity to buildings in all the observatories.          In
respect of the four other observatories, not above named, there is no
doubt the thermometrical       indications  do afford as thoroughly satisfactory
 a record   of temperature as is required — this point having been proved by
 direct experiments by Dr. Stewart for Kew, and by the Bev. Dr. Eobin-
 son for Armagh.
    Absolute uniformity in conditions of exposure is totally unattainable,
 as was fully recognized at the Vienna Meteorological Congress in 1873.
    The observatories were set in action in 1868, and with the year 1869
 the publication of the ' Quarterly Weather Eeport' was commenced. This
 was projected in order to overcome the difficulty, universally recognized,
 of the absence of uniformity in epochs of observation in the different
 countries.     A reproduction of the automatic curves was considered to be
 of paramount importance in order that the records at observatories should
 be independent of any choice of hours for observation or of any scales,
 and the value of such a reproduction         was strongly urged by the Com
 mittee of   Inquiry (1866).
    The execution of the plates was rendered possible by the invention of
 certain special instruments and processes, for which the Office is indebted
 to Mr. F. Galton and Mr. De La Hue, and which are in constant use, as
 explained in the several Annual Beports of the Office.
    The curves were at first reproduced by the lithographic process, but
 of late years that of copper-plate printing has been introduced.
    The degree of accuracy aimed at is 0*02 in. for the barometer, and
 0o,5  for the thermometer; and the plates furnish a continous record of—
                     Pressure.
                     Temperature     (Dry and Wet Bulb).

  It may be    asserted, without fear of contradiction,    that no record of a
completeness and accuracy at all approaching that attained by the plates
in questionhas yet been attempted in any other country, and that more
over the Meteorological       Office is the only^Meteorological   establishment
which itself publishes the materials for testing the accuracy of its pub
lished numerical values.
  In  the matter of accuracy many important advances have been made
since 1867, owing to the growth of experience, and the methods of treat
ment of the records have much improved.

   The text of. the ' Quarterly Weather Eeport has been a consecutive

elements, and of vapour-tension and deduced dry-air pressure, as well as
extreme readings of the barometer and dry thermometer.
   A request having been made for the publication of the actual hourly
readings of the measurements of the curves, this has been complied with.
These volumes have been issued since January 1874, and distributed to
the principal libraries at home and abroad.
  The preparation of the plates and tables above        mentioned occupies
nearly the entire time of the available staff of the Office ; so that no pre
sent prospect exists of a systematic discussion of the returns, so as to
calculate the periodical variations of the different elements. This for the
seven observatories will be a heavy task ; and it is for consideration
whether some special steps should not be taken for effecting          it,

     The Appendix last mentioned leads to an important subject calling for
 remark — the study of the climatal conditions of these islands by means
  of returns from stations auxiliary to the self-recording observatories.
     Such stations have been gradually organized ; and in January 1873 the
  Committee were able to inform the Registrar-General, in reply to an in
  quiry made by him, that if the Office were called upon to furnish mate
 rials to him for his statistical returns, it was in a position to do so.
     Of late the list of stations in connexion with the Office has received
 an important reinforcement by the conclusion of an arrangement by
 which the Meteorological Society (of London) supplies returns from some
 of its stations, in return for a small annual grant to defray the expense
 of copying.                                      #
    That Society    has recently organized   a system   of stations with much
 care, which    exhibit  a satisfactory agreement as to the character of the
 instruments and the conditions under which all the observations are taken.
    This cooperation of the Society, and of     a considerable number   of pri
 vate observers throughout      the country who have volunteered     to supply
 their schedules of observation gratis, renders it possible for the Office to
 take its part in the general international scheme of publication of returns
from eye-observations proposed by the Permanent Committee of the
 Vienna Congress, in order to facilitate climatological inquiries.
    The publication of these returns, demanded for 15 stations in the
 United Kingdom, has been commenced for England and Ireland. As for
 Scotland, it is hoped that the Scottish Meteorological Society will supply
their quota of materials for this international object.
    The Committee have felt it their duty to afford every facility to then-
Director to attend, as their representative, the meetings of the various
Meteorological Congresses which have been held of late years, and, more
over, have entertained the members of the Conference on Maritime Me
teorology, which was held at their Office in August 1874.
    The Office is therefore at present fulfilling all that is called for from
this country for international purposes, as defined by the Permanent
Committee of the Vienna Congress ; and there can be no doubt that the
information now coming in is, as regards accuracy, fully equal, if not supe
rior, to any published from a similar system of stations in any country.
    Further may be mentioned the fact of the recent publication by the
Office, at the request of the Government, of a volume entitled "Listruc-
tions in the Use of Meteorological Instruments," which has been com
piled with the assistance of several meteorologists unconnected with the
Office.
    VOL. XXIV.                                                      Q

208              Report of the Meteorological Committee.           [Jan. 20,
    The Scottish    Society have sought to obtain a grant in aid of their
general objects    from  the Parliamentary vote ; but the Committee have
 considered that, as they are only agents for directing the appUcation of
the fund at their disposal, they have no authority to make grants to be
dealt with at the discretion of other bodies, and that their action is re
stricted by the conditions that the objects to which it is directed shall be
among those for which the grant is made, and that the expenditure shall
take place in a manner that admits of their exercising a control over its
objects and results.
    Before leaving this branch of the subject, the Committee would re
mark that their operations would have been seriously crippled in the
year 1871, when the British Association withdrew its annual subsidy to
Kew Observatory, the central observatory of their     Bystem, had    not Mr.
Gassiot, one of their own body, come forward and most munificently
placed in the hands of the Boyal Society a sum of £10,000 for the en
dowment of the establishment, thereby affording ample funds for the
continuance of the observatory in full activity.
    In  conclusion the Committee would make a few general remarks on
the principles that have guided them in organizing the Meteorological
Office and controlling its operations.
    They have considered it to be their duty to give general effect to the
 recommendations of the Committee of 1866, and to establish and carry
 on for a considerable length of time, with the least possible amount of
 change, a well-arranged and uniform system of observation and of publi
 cation, being satisfied that continuity of method is one of the most essen
 tial elements of success in dealing with complicated physical phenomena.
     The Committee on their first appointment laid down with much deli
 beration the course to be pursued by the Office, and gave considerable
 attention to the removal of the numerous difficulties which necessarily
  occurred in the establishment of so much that was novel, especially in
  connexion with the self-recording instruments.
     Seeing that the Committee of 1866 had recommended a renewed in
 quiry into the proceedings of the Office after three years' trial, and feel
 ing that under any circumstances its constitution was only provisional,
 the Committee have aimed at leaving the principal officers employed in
 the duties of the department as little fettered as possible as to the pre
 cise manner in which details were conducted, looking rather to securing
  satisfactory results of the work, and to exercising that strict financial
 control over the application of the funds placed at their command which
 their duty to the Boyal Society and the Government required of them.
     They have also felt that, in the existing condition   of meteorological
 knowledge, it would have been not only presumptuous       on their part, but
 positively mischievous to have attempted to assume a     position of autho
 rity in enunciating new doctrines of their own or         in criticising the

 1876.]            Report of the Meteorological   Committee.              209
 opinions of others, and that their power of producing useful results
would have been seriously impaired if they had in any way departed
from the purely neutral attitude of accumulating a faithful record of
facts destined to furnish materials for scientific discussion.
    Although there exists a large quantity both of published and unpub
lished data in the possession of the Office, which places their staff in an
exceptional position for conducting elaborate investigations into the con
ditions of the weather, nevertheless the Committee have found it im
possible to provide for the adequate carrying on of such investigations by
means of their own staff, the time of their chief executive officers being
so much occupied by the heavy current business of the Office as to leave
them no leisure for the purpose ; nor have the Committee been able to
assign out of the funds at their disposal enough to secure additional as
sistance of a proper scientific character.      If they had diverted any of
these funds to purely scientific discussions it would have crippled other
 parte of their work, which appeared to them, under the existing condi
 tions and for the time being, to be still more important and to be, in a
measure, obligatory on them.
     It will readily be understood that the Committee holding such views
 makes no claim to having given an independent impetus to the progress
 of any special branch of meteorological science, though they feel satisfied
that their operations have in an important manner facilitated the natural
 development of accurate meteorological conceptions.           All conversant
 with the facts will agree that a very great advance has been made in
 this respect since the Committee was formed.      The Committee will not
 attempt to distinguish all the various causes that have conduced to this
 advance ; but among them are certainly to be recognized the organization
  of the system of continuously self-recording observatories and the publi
                 '
 cation in the     Quarterly Weather Beports,' with a remarkable degree of
 accuracy, of a graphical reproduction of the records thus obtained ; the
 constantly increasing attention paid by the officers of the Meteorological
 Office to the accurate and prompt preparation and distribution of the
 lithographed Daily Weather Charts, their intelligent study of the facts
 recorded under their direction, and their cordial cooperation with other
 bodies interested in similar objects, whether in this country or abroad.
 The experience gained in the preparation of the Daily Morning Weather
 Charts has enabled the Office to prepare smaller charts, which are sup
 plied for publication in several daily papers in London and the provinces.
 This indication that such information is appreciated by the public is fur
ther corroborated by the fact that similar Charts containing information
for the evening have been asked for, and are now furnished by the Office
to the ' Times.'
     The Committee being aware that the Government has entrusted to
another body the duty of inquiring how the functions they have per
formed may best be discharged in the future, thev will only permit
                                                                 Q2

their remarks to extend beyond           a review  of the past in three parti
culars.
     First. They look forward with great hope to the effect of increased
international cooperation        on a large scale, towards which important
steps have already been taken at recent Meteorological Congresses.         The
detached labours of numerous meteorological institutions will thereby be
 presented in a strictly comparable form, and may readily be combined
 in synoptic charts or in any other manner into a single whole. They
 think it is impossible to overstate the importance of measures tending to
 such a result.
     Secondly.     They consider it to  be a point of much importance that the
 meteorological     societies  and independent observers of this country should
 be more generally induced to work in unison with an Office maintained
 by grants from Parliament, so far as their several efforts are directed to
 the same field of inquiry. Administrative difficulties have hitherto pre
 vented the accomplishment of as much in this direction as could be de
 sired ; but the Committee fully recognize that it would be advisable to
 utilize more completely than has yet been done the energy of independent
 meteorological societies or individuals, and they believe that this admits
 of being effected on conditions that would be suitable and acceptable to
  them.
     Lastly. They feel it necessary to say that for the further advancement
  of Meteorology greater attention to its more strictly scientific aspect
  will in the future be essential. Merely empirical rules, however sound
  be their foundation, can never become really trustworthy guides of action
  until the principles that underlie them are established, and the circum
  stances are appreciated under which deviations from the ordinary course
  of events arise. It can hardly be disputed that in the course of the past
  nine years, since the appointment of the Committee, the general progress
  of the science of Meteorology in this country and abroad has been such
  that the application to it of exact principles seems to have become not
  only possible but requisite ; without them the full practical advantage of
  existing means of observation will not be secured, and it is only by aid
  of scientific discussion of the facts that these principles are to be ascer
  tained.
      They would suggest, as a probable mode of attaining the object they
  have in view, the application of a portion of any future grant to the pre
  paration of reports, or the carrying out of researches on special subjects
  connected with meteorological science by qualified persons to be selected
  from without and employed independently of the ordinary staff of officers
  engaged on other duties.
      The Committee       are only too well aware of the difficulties that are
  likely  to  attend  the   progress of Meteorology as an exact science ; but
  difficulties apparently as great have been overcome in other directions,
  and perseverance and time will doubtless remove those now        in question.

Philippine Islands, where he had not only made           large collection of

cient to enable him to recognize the erroneousness of many of the state
ments put forth by Prof. J. Miiller in his celebrated Memoir of 1841,
'
    Ueber den Bau des Pentacrinus Caput Medusa,' which has been the
principal authority as to the structure of the Crinoidea for all subsequent
writers of zoological text-books.            I  then placed before Dr. Semper not
only the already published First part of my Memoir, but also the materials
I    had collected for the Second ; and finding that my main conclusions
agreed completely with those at which he had arrived, he most kindly
 offered to hold back the publication of his own views until               I  should have
 given mine to the world. Having been subsequently appointed to the
 Chair of Zoology in the University of Wurzburg, Prof. Semper has of
 course taught to his students what both he and                 I regarded as the truth
 of many things erroneously viewed by J. Midler ; and another investi
 gator, M. Edmund Perrier*, having in the meantime entered the field,
 and reproduced some of Midler's errors, Prof. Semper has thought it
 right to give a wider publicity to his convictions on the subject, which
 my own protracted delay fully justified him in doing.
                                                                           " In the year
  1808," ho says,        "  I  was intending to publish a short memoir on that

 exactly the same results on European as               I  on Phdippine Comatulce.        In
  the expectation that the English investigator would soon publish his
  already prepared work on the Crinoidea,               I  deferred till now the com
  munication of the results of my examination : but since, after five years
  waiting, there is imminent risk that from my lectures the results of
  Carpenter's and my own toilsome investigations may somehow find then-

  investigations, with such dlustrations as may render my descriptions

  distant when        I may be able to present to the Royal Society the Second
  Part    of   my   Memoir,    giving with the First such a detailed account of the
   Structure and Life-history of this type as may serve as a basis for the
  description of the Pedunculate Crinoids known as living types. Of these

                             Calyx and its Contents.
     Calyx. — The shallow basin (Phil. Trans. 1866, plate xxxii. fig. 2) which
 holds the central portion of the visceral apparatus is formed not only
 by the first, second, and third Eadials, but also by the first and second
 pairs of Brachials, together with the basal segments of the pinnules
 borne by the second —these portions of the calcareous skeleton being so
connected laterally by intervening perisome as to complete the wall of
the concavity.     This concavity is lined by a smooth membrane, which
 may be conveniently and,      I think, correctly termed peritoneum, as it
 forms the immediate boundary of the perivisceral cavity or axiom. The
 calyx is shut in above by the perisome of the oral disk, which is lined by
a   continuation of the peritoneum; and this is also reflected over the
 " visceral mass" which                                         This " visceral
                         occupies the cavity thus enclosed.
mass" is a compact lenticular body, which includes the whole digestive
 and sanguigenous apparatus, with the central portion of the circulatory
and respiratory systems and the prolongation of the axial cord of the stem,
from which is given off the generative racliis that passes into each arm ;
but it does not include either what      I regard as the nervous centre or
the generative organs (testes or ovaries) — the former being contained
in the cavity of the centro-dorsal basin which underlies the calyx, while
the latter, as has long been known, are distributed through certain
pinnules of the arms.
    Oral Dish. — The membranous perisome which forms the oral disk is
continuous with that which is prolonged over the oral surface of the
arms and pinnules, and which also dips down between the basal segments
of the arms to complete the cavity of the calyx. Towards the mouth
(Phil. Trans. 1866, plate xxxii. fig. 3), which is situated in its centre,
five radial furrows converge, each of them formed by the union of two
converging brachial furrows. The distance from the mouth at which thi
union takes place is by no means constant ; and        I attach little value as
a specific character to variations    in the distribution of these furrows.
The floor of each consists of what appears to be a layer of columnar
epithelium, which    I  believe to be ciliated.     Its sides are formed by
elevated ridges of the perisome, each of which is scolloped at its edges
so as to form a row of minute valvules (the "crescentic leaves" of

214               Dr. \V. B. Carpenter on the Structure                    [Jan. 20,
Wyville Thomson), from within every one of which there rises a pair of
non-extensile tubular tentacles.    Each pair of tentacles springs from a
base  common   to it with the  leaflet ; and tins base communicates   by a
single oval orifice with the tentacular canal, which lies immediately beneath
the epithelial floor of the furrow.                                     "
                                       (This is quite distinct from the ten

tacular canal of previous authors, which lies below it and has no con
nexion whatever with the tentacles, and which              I
                                                        term the subtentacular
canal.)    The convergence of the five radial furrows towards the mouth
gives it when    viewed from above somewhat the form of a five-rayed star,
the adjacent rays being separated by rounded projecting lobes of perisome
(Plate 8. fig. 2, m, m), beneath which (as shown at a, figs. 2, 3) is situated
the true mouth surrounded by a thickened annular lip.        "Within each of
the five lobes of perisome there arise from the annular lip, by separate
bases, a series of from eight to ten thick-walled tentacles, each of which
has its own orifice of communication with the interior of the oral ring.
   The true tentacular canals are the representatives of the " radial vessels
                                                                              "
described by Prof. Wyville Thomson, in his account of the Pentacrinoid
larva, as extensions of the oral-ring canal, which, as will hereafter appear
(p. 227), is a derivative of the perivisceral cavity, marked off from it by
threads of connective tissue, as shown at rc, figs. 10, 11. In the adult
Anteilon, however, the thickened annular lip which surrounds the mouth
does not contain any distinct ring-canal, its original cavity having been
almost entirely filled up by threads and bands of connective tissue, and
by a set of caical tubuli, as to the precise relations of which     am at   I
present in doubt.       But the true tentacular canals still pass towards it,
and seem to lose themselves in what may be called its " interspace sys
tem," this being continuous with that which has come almost entirely
to occupy (as shown in fig. 3,          the portion of the perivisceral cavity
                                      1-)
that originally lay open within the intestinal coil.
   The subtentacular canals, on the other hand, radiate continuously from
the neighbourhood of the mouth to the bases of the arms, each of the
five radial trunks divaricating into two but they do not give off any
                                                 ;
branches or extensions whatever until they reach the arms, where alter
nating lateral extensions pass into the pinnules.         On approaching the
mouth, where the oral perisome becomes continuous with the lining of
the oesophagus, these canals dip downwards into the " visceral mass," as was
long since described by Heusinger*, though he did not trace their further
course in its interior.  I    shall presently show that they there all become
continuous (as at   I, fig.2)  with the single "axial canal" (jr), which passes
downwards towards the centre of the dorsal surface of the visceral mass,
and, through that canal, with the deeper or dorsal portion of the peri
visceral cavity.    And the history of the development of the subtentacular
canals (Plate 9. fig. 12, stc) plainly shows that they too are derivatives from
the upper or oral portion of the same cavity, which the progressive increase

of the visceral mass, and the formation of membranous adhesions (as at m,
fig. 12) between the apposed surfaces of its peritoneal covering and of the
peritoneal lining of the calyx, separate into an upper and a lower portion,
whose communication with each other is maintained by the axial canal.
    The oral perisome is perforated in the spaces between the radial fur
rows (especially near the angles formed by their junction in the mouth)
by numerous minute pores surrounded by ciliated epithelium, whose cilia
I   have seen in extremely active movement, apparently inwards.                  These
are the orifices of funnel-shaped canals, which first pass vertically through
the perisome, and then contract and take an oblique direction, opening
 (I believe) into a system of sinuses, which are left by the incomplete
adhesion of the peritoneum covering the upper surface of the visceral
mass to that which lines the under surface of the oral perisome.                      If
this be the case, they obviously establish a direct connexion between this
limited portion of the perivisceral cavity and the medium inhabited by
the animal     ; and the water thus introduced probably serves a respiratory
purpose *.
    Perivisceral   Cavity. — The adhesion of the under surface of the oral
perisome to the upper surface of the visceral mass is so close that they
can only be detached by tearing, after both have been hardened in spirit.
 The peritoneal covering of the lower or dorsal surface of the visceral mass,
 on the other hand, is but slightly adherent to the opposite peritoneal sur
 face lining the deeper part of the concavity of the calyx, although usually
 in close contact with it ; and thus, when the periphery of the oral disk
 has been cut through, the visceral mass adherent to its lower surface may
 be lifted entire out of the calyx, without rupture of any thing but a
 pedicle (h, figs. 2, 3) which passes up as a continuation of the original
                                                "
 Crinoidal axis, through the " rosette (Part I. § 35) formed by the meta
 morphosis of the original Basals. Hence it often happens that, through
 the tearing of their oral perisome, which is very soft in the living state,
 specimens of Antedon come up in the dredge completely eviscerated ; and
 1 have strong evidence that even this loss may be repaired (as the like
  evisceration is said to be in Holoihurida) by the production of a new
 visceral mass from the " axial prolongation."
      Although the visceral mass so nearly fills the cavity of the calyx that
  scarcely any space exists between their apposed peritoneal surfaces, yet
  the existence of a true peritoneal cavity becomes obvious at the bases of
  the arms ; for it is there prolonged, in each arm, into an extension (cc,
  fig. 7) which forms a canal that underlies the subtentacular canal (stc)
  proceeding into it from the oral disk ; and, like that canal, it not only
 passes along the whole length of each arm, but also gives off lateral exten
  sions {dd) that proceed to the extremities of the pinnules. This canal,
     * These  canals have been noticed by Grimm (Bulletins de l'Acad. Imper. de St.
  Petersb. 1872, pp. 3-8) ; but he has not been able to trace their internal connexions.
  By Perrier (loc. cit.) they are described as caeca.

         Visceral Mass. — The   " visceral mass" primarily consists of an alimen
tary canal (not distinctly differentiated into oesophagus, stomach, and
intestine), which makes about one fourth more than a single round turn
upon itself (bed, fig. 1). From the central nrouth this canal at first passes
obliquely downwards (5, figs. 2, 3), then changes its direction to the hori
zontal, and, after making somewhat more than a complete circuit, turns
upwards again (at d, fig. 1) towards the oral disk, to terminate in a vent
which projects upwards from its surface between two of the radial fur
rows, the terminal portion of the alimentary canal being separated
from the cavity of the vent by a valvular projection of its lining mem
brane.
    The membranous wall of the alimentary canal may be called its mucous
lining..   It is somewhat rugose in the first or oblique part of the canal
(6,  fig. 2); whilst in the horizontal coil it is nearly smooth on the peri
pheral   side, but deeply plicated on the central side (fig. 1), there
forming, with its epithelial (?) covering, a sort of glandular mass *, the
projection of which into the canal considerably narrows        as shown at it,
e,fig. 2. The whole smooth inner surface of the mucous lining (6, fig.                   c,    1)
is covered with   layer of yellow substance, which

               it   is    to separate  for microscopic examination, but

which, when hardened            in spirit, readily detaches itself from the sub
jacent  membrane in large flakes, which are so opaque as not to be
readily examined minutely.    The appearances presented      thin sections by
of this layer, however, dispose me to think that                it
                                                     may be regarded as
a columnar epithelium imperfectly differentiated into cells and        can      ;         it
scarcely be doubted that the portion of      forming the large gland-like
                                                      it
projection just alluded to has an hepatic function. The projecting edges
of its plicated surface are fringed with long cilia, whose function                            is
obviously to produce an indraught into the mouth, and to propel the
ingested matter along the canal.
   The exterior of the mucous wall of the alimentary canal    not in                is
immediate contact with its peritoneal covering but  continuous space
                                                            ;        a

          "
system      to be presently  noticed.
    The double wall of the alimentary canal is strengthened by the inter
position of discoidal calcareous plates ; and it is the complex plication
of the wall on the central side of the canal, and the consequent piling-up
of numerous layers of these disks, which forms the vertical columella,
erroneously likened by some writers to the sand-canal of Starfish.
Besides these disks, there are occasionally to be found minute calcareous
spines projecting from the inner surface into the cavity of the alimentary
canal, as if they were pegs whereon to hang the epithelial layer.
     The interior of this columella is traversed by a canal (</, figs. 1, 2), which
constitutes a most curious feature in the structure of the visceral mass.
When the visceral mass has been turned out of the calyx, its lower sur
face shows a minute pore nearly in its centre ; which pore, partly occupied
 (and often concealed) by the pedicle already spoken of (h, figs. 2, 3), is
the orifice of communication between the deeper portion of the perivisceral
                   "
cavity and the axial canal," which is simply a survival
                                                         "          "
                                                                      of what was
originally the part of that cavity segregated from the rest by the winding
of the horizontal extension of the alimentary canal round its stomach.
 The axial canal at first passes upwards almost along the central axis
 (figs. 2, 3) of the lenticular visceral mass ; but as soon as it meets the
 obliquely descending commencement of the alimentary canal, it too
 becomes somewhat oblique, lying in close contiguity to the exterior of
 the digestive cavity.     Before, however, it reaches the oral surface of the
 visceral mass, it subdivides irregularly into five branches, which embrace
 the oesophageal part of the alimentary canal, and there become continuous,
  as  I have already mentioned,   with the five radial canals that lie beneath the
  tentacular canals of the oral disk, one of which is seen in transverse
  section at I, fig. 1, and others at i, k.    Thus, through the subdivision of
  the five radial canals of the disk into the ten brachial canals, each of
  which gives off lateral branches that proceed to the extremities of the
  pinnules, there is a continuous canal-communication from the axial canal,
  and hence from the deeper part of the perivisceral cavity through the
  entire apparatus of arms and pinnules.          But the axial canal is also in
  relation   with the wall  of the alimentary  canal  ; for between the plications
  of the inner or central side of the latter there is a very extensive system
  of irregular passages or interspaces (I; fig. 3), which open into the axial
  canal ; and it can scarcely be doubted that these serve, like the mesenteric
  vessels of higher animals, to receive the nutritive fluid which has trans
  uded through the wall of the alimentary canal, first through the mucous
  lining into the intramural space, and thence through its peritoneal cover
  ing into the perivisceral cavity and its derivations.
       Cavity of the Centro-dorsal Basin. — In my previous Memoir             I  fully
   described the "centro-dorsal" basin-shaped plate whereon rests the
   circlet of first Kadials, whilst from its free or dorsal surface extend the

218              Dr. W. B. Carpenter             on the Structure     [Jan. 20,
clusters of prehensile cirrhi that functionally replace the Crinoidal stem,
though homologically they correspond to the nodal verticils of cirrhi borne
by the stem of Pentaerinus, which themselves take on the prehensile
function when, as not unfrequently happens, this stem breaks off just
beneath the nodal segment.   And            I
                                    further showed that in the early
Pentacrinoid stage of Antedon the centro-dorsal segment is not distin
guished from the ordinary segments of the stem, and that its enlargement
 commences with the development of the cirrhi, of which there is at first
only a single whorl, but of which two complete verticils at least are present
when the young Antedon drops off the stem. Again,              I showed that in
the early   Pentacrinoid   stage the Basals,  not  the  first radials, rest upon
the centro-dorsal segment ; and         I
                                       pointed out how, with the metamor
                                             " rosette," and the progressive
phosis of the circlet of basals into the
enlargement of the centro-dorsal plate, the first radials come to form
the central basis of the calyx, resting on the infolded Up of the centro-
dorsal.   I refer to this now, because it helps greatly in the comprehension
of the real import of the curious organ contained within the centro-dorsal
basin of the adult Antedon ; for there is no such basin in the Pedunculate
Crinoids, whose calyx rests upon the uppermost segment of the stem,
which segment, instead of being the largest, is the smallest, being the
latest formed, while the basis of the calyx is formed by the thickened
and solidified Basals.    Hence it seems clear that the extraordinary deve
lopment of the highest segment of the stem into the centro-dorsal basin,
which is characteristic of the mature Antedon, is connected with the
multiplication of the prehensile cirrhi which extend themselves from its
dorsal surface.     The number of these cirrhi, as         Iformerly showed, is
very variable ; and  I  gave reasons for the belief that there is a successional
production and exuviation of these appendages, at any rate during the
period of growth.
  When, by the action of dilute acid, the calcareous network of the
centro-dorsal plate has been dissolved, so as to give access, by dissecting
away its soft animal basis, to the contents of the cavity, we find it to be
almost    entirely occupied (as       at g, fig. 3) by a curious hollow,
                                    seen
slightly pentangular organ (figs. 4, 5), which was described by Midler as
a single-chambered heart.   Prom the angles of the lower or dorsal part
of this organ there proceed numerous slender cords              (I,
                                                            fig. 2), which
pass through    the calcareous    wall of the centro-dorsal basin into the
 cirrhi whilst from the upper part of its peripheral wall are given off
      ;
 five large radiating cords (fig. 3, m), which pass upwards and outwards
                                       1,
through the canals formed      by the inflexions of the " rosette," each then
divaricating into two branches, which enter the two adjacent orifices on
the internal face of each pair of first radials, as described in my former
Memoir. All these cords were described by Miiller as vessels          ;I   am
satisfied, however, that they are not tubular, but solid.    —  On making    a
transverse section of the hollow organ      it found to contain five chambers
                                                 is

(fig. 4), clustered like the carpels of an orange round a central axis ; and
near this axis each chamber seems to communicate on its ventral aspect
with the surrounding space (an extension of the perivisceral cavity) by
a minute orifice (d) in its wall.     Within the dorsal portion of this organ,
lying at the bottom of the centro-dorsal basin, there is a succession of
verticils of five triangular leaflets (fig. 5, a), increasing in size from
below upwards, from the extremities of some of the upper of which
leaflets issue groups of three diverging cords that proceed to the cirrhi.
I  can scarcely doubt that these verticils mark the origins of the earlier
cirrhal cords from the Crinoidal axis ; and this obviously suggests that
the five-chambered organ is itself only another and larger verticil, which
has come, by the formation of ventricular cavities in its substance (ana
logous to the lateral ventricles of the brain), to occupy the whole cavity
of the enlarged centro-dorsal basin.
    This view, which deprives the chambers of the five-chambered organ of
any special physiological significance, is confirmed by what      I have ascer
tained of the structure of the Crinoidal axis which occupies the interior of
the stem of the true Pentacrinus.          This has a central portion quite
distinct from the peripheral portion, which forms a cylindrical sheath
around it. It is from the cylindrical sheath that at every node of the
stem there pass off five cords into the whorls of cirrhi or " auxiliary side
arms   f   and at every node there is a slight dilatation of the cylinder,
which is caused, not by a thickening of the substance of the axis, but by
a separation between its central and its peripheral portions — foreshadow
ing the great ventricular dilatation just described at the summit of the
axis of Antedon.       In Pentacrinus, which has no cirrhi attached either to
the uppermost part of the stem or to the base of the calyx, there is neither
enlarged centro-dorsal cavity nor special dilatation of the Crinoidal axis.
    The divaricated cords which enter the First Radials form a sort of
 " Circle of Willis " within the system of canals completed by their lateral
 adhesion, as described in my former Memoir (§§ 34, 77) ; and from this
 circle there issue five radial cords, which speedily divaricate into ten
 brachial cords that pass continuously through the centra of the segments
 of the arms.
    This apparatus (consisting of the outer cylinder of the Crinoidal stem,
 of the five-chambered central organ formed by the dilatation of that axis
 within the centro-dorsal basin, and of the cords proceeding from it to the
 arms and cirrhi)    I  regard as the central portion of a nervous system ; and
 I  shall hereafter draw what seem to me conclusive proofs that such is
 its character, both from the distribution of branches of the brachial cords
 to the muscles of the arms, and from the effect of irritation of the central
 organ in the living animal, even after its complete evisceration, in causing
 the sudden and general contraction of those muscles (p. 226).

wards through the middle of the quinquelocular dilatation of its cortical
cylinder (as shown at g, h, fig. 3), just as in a flower the axis which
forms the style of a multilocular ovary passes upwards through the
midst of the carpels which are clustered around it. In the upward
course of this " axial prolongation," as it may be provisionally termed,
it first passes through the central aperture of the " rosette," and then
through the vertical canal which is left by the truncation of the wedge
like First .Radials, thus reaching the base of the cavity of the calyx, and

towards     the oral pole, and may be traced along its whole length (gene

subdivides into the five subtentacular canals which underlie the radial
furrows of the disk.         Here the axial cord appears to spread out into a
plexus which surrounds the mouth ; and this plexus is continued towards
the periphery of the disk underneath the radial and brachial canals, every
one of which usually has a cord running along each of its margins, con
nected by transverse branches with the cord of the opposite side. At
 or near the margin of the disk the two cords of each brachial canal seem
 to coalesce into a single one ; and this runs onwards between the subten
 tacular   and   the    coeliac   canal of   the   arm (as shown      at gr, fig. 6),
 giving off branches which pass into the sexual pinnules ; and these
 branches are continuous with the testes or ovaries which these pinnules
contain.

 a generative rachis, furnishing the germs which are to be developed into
 the proper sexual products ; and this view             I  find to be confirmed by
 minute examination of its structure.             At the point at which it dilates
 into the cavity of the ovary, it is clearly a tube containing minute cor
 puscles of about l-3000th of an inch in diameter; and from these corpuscles
 to complete ova every stage can be traced.               Following the cord back
 wards towards the plexus of the disk,           I find it still to possess the same
 tubular wall and granular contents ; in the plexus itself the cavity with
 its granular contents bears a smaller proportion to the thickness of the
 tubular wall ; but the " axial prolongation," from which               I believe this
 plexus   to  arise, often    seems    at the  period  of  generative   activity to be
 almost made up of such corpuscles.
    I confess that    I  have not yet been able to trace the absolute continuity
 of the generative plexus of the disk with the axial cord of the adult
 Antedon, the dissection of the parts around the mouth being made very
 difficult by the quantity of loose connective tissue which forms the
 annular lip.     The termination       of the axial prolongation and the origin of
 the plexus   in the    same    locality obviously point to such continuity ; but

I  shall show it to be almost unmistakably established by the history
of embryonic development, at a certain stage of which the subdivision
of the axial prolongation (ax, fig. 11) into diverging branches, of which
one passes to each ray, is very distinctly traceable.

   Each Arm is composed of a linear series of calcareous segments, con
nected with each other by muscles and elastic ligaments, in the manner
described in my former Memoir, the muscles being all flexor, whilst the
ligaments are extensor. Thus when the muscles (of which a pair inter
venes between each segment and   its proximal and distal segments, except
where two segments are connected by a syzygy) are called into contrac
tion the arm is coiled up spirally like a watch-spring, whilst when the
muscles relax     it is straightened out again by the elasticity of the ligaments.
— What    may be called the centrum of every one of the calcareous segments
is perforated by a circular foramen (a a, fig. 6) ; and the linear succession
of these foramina forms a canal, which is occupied by a cord of proto
plasmic substance (6) given off from the circlet contained within the first
radials, which circlet (as already described) is formed by the lateral
inosculation of the five radial cords      in, fig.    (I,

nervous centre.   That the cord which was supposed by Midler to                                     be   a

Paper    (§   19), on the basis of the connexion            I     had even then demonstrated
between that cord and the generative organs developed in the pinnules.

Prof. Semper independently discovered. Where, again, this vertical
partition joins the thickened layer of perisome which forms the floor
of the inter-tentacular groove, there is a small circular canal (overlooked
by   Miiller and every other anatomist), which is the real tentacular canal
                       continuity with the interior of the tentacles being
(tc, figs. 6, 8, 9), its
very distinctly visible both in transverse and in longitudinal sections.
The latter show a single oval orifice (oo, fig. 9) opening out of the
tentacular canal for each group of three tentacles.
   The perisome covering the oral surface of each arm exhibits a con
tinuation of the brachial furrow formed by the divarication of the radial
furrow of the oral disk, each side of this furrow being bounded, as in
the disk, by successive groups of tentacles, and by an elevated fold of
the perisome, scolloped at its edge so as to form a row of minute valvules,
like those of the oral disk, beyond which, when the tentacles are extended,
they project considerably, but within which they may be withdrawn, so
that the two folds may close down, the valvules meeting in a sinuous line
so as completely to cover the furrow. — The floor of the furrow is formed
by the peculiar   layer which, as already stated,     I
                                                     regard as a columnar
epithelium ; its free surface    I
                               believe to be clothed with minute cilia, the
direction of whose   movement   is from the periphery towards the centre ;
there are, however, no cilia on the tentacles.     These points, correctly
stated by   M. Edmund Perrier,       I had worked   out soon after the publica
tion of my previous Paper.
   Pinnules. — Every segment of the arms bears a pinnule ; and the pin
nules are disposed alternately along the two sides of each arm.          Their
calcareous segments are united by ligaments alone ; but each centrum (a,
figs. 8, 9) is perforated as in the arm, and contains a branch (b) of its
axial cord. On the oral face of the succession of calcareous segments
there lies an extension (cc, figs. 8, 9) of the cceliac canal of the arm ; and
immediately above this, in the barren pinnules, lies a single subtentacular
canal coming off from the lateral division of the double canal of the arm
which belongs to the side that bears the pinnule. In the thickness of the
horizontal partition between these two canals there is a passage left by a
separation of their walls, in which lies a lateral branch of the generative
rachis. The true tentacular canal (tc, figs. 8, 9) lies, as in the arms, along
the oral face of the subtentacular canal.     The first pinnules of each arm,
however,    are differentiated from the rest by the absence of tentacles, and
likewise by the greater number and closer setting of the peculiar sacculi
(ss, figs. 6, 8) contained in the perisomal folds which bound the radial
furrow.

  the subtentacular     canal, completely separating    the one from the other
  (figs.  6, 8);   and it was this correspondence       of position which first
  suggested to me the real nature of Miiller's " nerve."          On tracing the
  testis or ovary to the base of the pinnule,     I clearly made it out to have
  the same relation to the lateral branch of the generative rachis of the
  arm (h, fig. 9) as the currants forming a bunch have to the stalk that
  bears them   ; and if   I am correct in deriving the generative rachis from
  the  " axial prolongations," it may be considered originally to spring from
  the Crinoid Axis itself.
      Towards the extremities of the pinnules, especially in those that con
  tain no generative organs, the horizontal partition between the cceliac
  and subtentacular canals thins away, and at last becomes obsolete ; so that
 at the periphery     of this canal-system there seems to be as free a com
  munication   between the two sets of canals as there is between the arteries
 and veins of the higher animals through the capillary plexus.           And, for
                                  I
 reasons to be presently given, feel strongly inclined to believe that a regu
 lar circulation is carried on through them, the nutritive fluid being trans
 mitted through one set of canals from centre to periphery, then passing
 into the other, and being conveyed by it back from periphery to centre.

     Ingestion of Food. — That the food of Antedon consists, not of the large
 bodies grasped and swallowed by ordinary Starfish, but of minute and
 even microscopic organisms, and that the so-called
                                                                " tentacles " are
 entirely destitute of prehensile power, was long since affirmed by
 Dujardin on the basis of observation of the habits of the living animal
 and of microscopic examination of the matters ejected from the vent.
 These statements are entirely borne out by my own careful observation
 of the actions of the brachial and tentacular apparatus, alike in the Penta-
 crinoid and in the adult condition, and by the microscopic examination          I
 have repeatedly made of the contents of the alimentary canal.              These
 consist of minute Entomostraca, Diatoms, spores of Alga), &c., but espe
cially, in my Lamlash specimens, of Peridinium tripos (Ehr.), which was
usually very abundant in that locality.         A powerful indraught current
towards the mouth        is maintained   by the  action of the large cilia that
fringe the villous folds of the alimentary canal     ; but this does not extend
to any considerable distance ;      and it is clear that minute particles are
transmitted from the peripheral extremities of the arms and pinnules,
aloug the brachial furrows and the radial furrows of the disk, to the
neighbourhood of the mouth, where they come within the reach of the
oral indraught. This        I have repeatedly seen when 1 have had young
Pentacrinoids alive      under  the microscope ; and although       I  have been
prevented, by the peculiarity of their position, from detecting the cilia
to which the transmission is attributable,      I can scarcely doubt that they
belong to the epithelial floor of the furrows.      And when    I have   detached

small pieces of the soft parts from the arms of the living adult, have                          I
found currents to be produced in the water surrounding them, which
could only be accounted for by ciliary action.    Thus the brachial appa
ratus may be regarded, in the first place, as an extended food-trap.
   It may         be here added that my examination          of various types of existing
Pentacrini          enables me         to affirm that they are nourished in exactly the
same manner,    their brachial and digestive apparatus being constructed
upon precisely the same plan as that of Anledon, and the contents of the
alimentary canal being of the like nature.   And this renders it probable
that not only the Pentacrini of the Mesozoic period, but the entire series
of Grinoids extending through the whole range of geological time, from
the " primordial zone of Barrande to the present epoch, obtained their
                       "
food after the like fashion.

junction of the perisome of the oral disk with the wall of the alimentary
canal,     I
          have detected a series of cffical tubuli opening into the com
mencement or oesophageal portion of the alimentary canal ; these may
have a salivary function. And the peculiar gland-like character of the
plicated portion of the wall of the inner side of the horizontal coil of the
alimentary canal seems to render it probable that it performs the function
of a liver.
   Circulating and Respiratory Apparatus. — It has been shown that the
true "tentacular" canals constitute a system entirely distinct in the
adult from the general canal-system of the arms, although derived like
it,in the first instance, from the perivisceral cavity, and that there                               is
no proper oral ring which can be regarded as the centre of the radi
ating tentacular canal.    As    has also been shown that the so-called
                                              it
" tentacles " have no share whatever in the ingestion of food, the question
arises, what    their function in the economy of the animal?
                     is                                             am dis                  I
posed to think that they are homologous with the tentacular fringe
surrounding the mouth of the Holothurida, and with the " respiratory-
       "
tubes of the Asterida and Echinida, and that they constitute         special                a
respiratory apparatus, serving for the aeration of      fluid that may be      a
regarded, like the red blood of    Terebella, as not so much nutritive as
                                                   a
respiratory*. It      no objection to this view that the tentacles of

                                         it   is    more dependent than is
Echinoderms generally upon the perfect aeration of its fluid, as       soon                     it
dies in water that     not kept inis    state of tolerable purity, though

  *   It   is   stated   by   M. Edmund Perrier that distinct muscular fibres are traceable in
the walls of the tentacles        ; and these may produce    sort of vermicular contraction by

    It has further been shown that, besides the tentacular canal-system,
each arm and pinnule contains two canals, one superposed on the other,
communicating at the termination of the pinnules, and that while the
lower or cceliac canals open directly into the deeper portion of the coelom
or perivisceral cavity, the upper or subtentacular, passing inwards as the
radial canals of the oral disk, become continuous with the upper part of
the " axial canal," which opens at its lower end into the deepest part of
the coelom.     Thus a complete continuity, alike central and peripheral, is
established throughout the whole of this space ; and the central canal
also receives what may be termed the " mesenteric sinuses proceeding
                                                                   "
from the plications of the internal wall of the alimentary cavity. Thus
it  seems   probable that the products of digestion, except such as may
transude directly through the double wall of the alimentary canal into
the coelom, are collected into these mesenteric sinuses, and by them con
veyed into the axial canal, and that from this centre the nutritive fluid
is circulated throughout the double system of canals, passing from one
to the other, centrally through the axial' canal, and peripherally at the
extremities    of the pinnules.    I   have distinctly seen a movement of
granular fluid in one of the canals of the arm of a Pentacrinoid, proceed
ing from the extremity towards the centre ; and although          I  was unable
to distinguish with certainty in which of the canals it took place, my
impression is that it was the cceliac.        If  this be so, the subtentacular
 canals constitute the arterial or distributive, and the cceliac canals the
venous   or collective, system.   Now as the axial canal is bounded by a
columella    strengthened   by the piling-up of calcareous plates, its walls
can scarcely be supposed to have any contractile power ; whilst, on the
other hand, as the surface of the peritoneum lining the coelom is ciliated
in other Echinoderms, it may     be presumed to be so in Antedon : and thus
we may fairly surmise that the circulation is kept up by ciliary movement.
    If
— sea-water be admitted, as          I  believe it to be, through the ciliated
funnels of the oral perisome, into the cavity of the coelom, the circu

lating fluid will correspond in its mixed character to the chylaqueous
fluid of many aquatic Invertebrata.
    One important office of this circulation will obviously be to supply
nutritive material for the periodical development of the sexual apparatus ;
 and no arrangement could be conceived more conducive to such a pur
 pose.    For in the pinnules, whose turgidity indicates the enlargement of
 the generative racMs into testes or ovaries (as the case may be), these
 organs (as shown in figs. 8, 9) lie between the two thin-walled canals,
 so that they can readily draw nutrient fluid alike from the going and from
 the returning current. It can scarcely be doubted that the
                                                                " chylaqueous"
 fluid is aerated during its transmission through the canals of the arms and
 pinnules, particularly as the clothing of very minute cilia which       I  have
 detected on the dorsal side of the arms will serve to renew        the stratum
 of water in contact with them.
                                                                  b2

  Thus   we are also to regard  the arms and pinnules in the light of a
respiratory apparatus, an interchange of gases between the contents of
the canals and the surrounding medium being promoted by the subdi
vision of the canals and the consequent extension of their surface.
   Nervo-^nuscular Apparatus. — In the First Part of my Memoir        I   de
scribed the manner in which the contraction of the pairs of muscles
intervening between the vertical lamellae rising from the oral faces of
the successive calcareous segments of each arm coils it up into a spiral,
the uncoiling being produced, when the muscles relax, by the elasticity
of the ligaments interposed between the segments near their dorsal
 margins.    The coiling and uncoiling often take place through the whole
length of the arm, with a quickness and consentaneousness which has no
parallel in the comparatively sluggish and limited movements of other
 Echinoderms ; and while a single arm may be made to coil up by irri
tating one of its pinnules, the whole circlet of arms closes together when
 an irritation is applied to the pinnules which arch over the mouth, an
 act which affords a strong indication of the " internuncial" action of a
 definite nervous system. The anatomical considerations already specified
having led me to the conclusion that the radial cords which pass through
the calcareous segments of the arms are really nerve-trunks, and that
the five-chambered organ in the centro-dorsal basin is their centre,  I
                                                                     put
their character to the following experimental test, when visiting Oban in
the autumn of 1807 : — Having completely eviscerated a living specimen,
so that nothing was left but the calyx and arms, with the centro-dorsal
basin and its contents,   I
                          passed a needle down through the canal left at
the base of the calyx between the central faces of the first radials, so as
to irritate the quinquelocular organ beneath ; all the ten arms then sud
denly and consentaneously closed up.     On the withdrawal of the needle,
the arms gradually straightened themselves again, and again coiled up as
before when the irritation of the central organ was renewed.     I
                                                                 am at a
loss to see in what respect the evidence thus afforded that this organ is
functionally                 and that the radial cords are nerve-trunks,
               a nerve-centre,
is less cogent than that which we draw from the contraction of the limbs
of a Vertebrate animal when we irritate the segment of the spinal cord
which   gives off their nerves.  The chief difficulty in assigning to them
such a function arises from their want of the histological characters of
nerves.    The radial cords, hardened in strong spirit, may be torn into
fibrils of extreme minuteness ; but, so far as        I
                                                     have yet been able to
ascertain, these fibrils have a homogeneous protoplasmic composition.
This absence of differentiation may, as it seems to me, be related to the
fact that as the muscles are all flexors, the nerves have only one function
to perform, and that there is consequently no need of the insulation
which they require where nerve-fibres of very different functions are
bound up in the same sheath.

along the outside of the ridges that border the tentacular furrow in the
arms and pinnules, and which, by their peculiar property of attracting the
colouring-matter given off after death by other parts of the body, become
the well-known " red spots," have long been a puzzle to students of
Antedon.      I  have long been myself inclined to regard them as Sensory
organs, my surmise being founded on the fact that in the oral pinnules,
which have no tentacular apparatus, but which are much more irritable
(t. e. more susceptible of impressions which call forth contraction of the
arms) than the tentaculiferous             pinnules, these    sacculi   are crowded
together so as to form two continuous rows*.
                                    Development.
    In  the earliest stage at which        I have  been  hitherto able to study the
Pentacrinoid larva (which may          be designated as    " Allman's stage t"), the
calyx rather resembles an inverted bell than a shallow basin, its lower
part being supported by the five basals, whilst its upper is surrounded by
the five incipient first radials which alternate with them.               Alternating
in position    with   the five first radials, and at this stage resting immedi
ately upon them, are five oral plates, somewhat triangular in form,
enclosed in valvular folds of the delicate perisome which forms the
general investment of the body.              These oral valves, when inclined to
wards each other, form a sort of five-sided            pyramid, which completely
 covers in the oral disk     ;  but when opened out they surround it like the
expanded petals of a flower.            Immediately within the oral valves is a
thin elevated lip, from which spring the oral tentacles ; and the wide
 mouth, leading into a funnel-shaped oesophagus, occupies the whole of the
area surrounded by this lip. A vertical section of the calyx in this stage
 shows the gastric sac loosely suspended in the perivisceral cavity or
 ccelom  (pv, fig. 10), with the inner wall of which, however, the outer wall of
 the gastric sac is connected by scattered threads and lamellae of connective
 tissue.    And it is very distinctly seen that the circular lip is formed by
 an annular plication of the bounding membrane of the perivisceral cavity,
 a space being left between the two folds, which constitutes the original
 tentacular or ring-canal, re.           Hence this tentacular canal is clearly
 a derivative     of the ecehm, the only separation between them at this stage
 consisting    in  a circlet of threads of connective tissue, which passes be
 tween the inner and outer folds of the lip.            The increased development
 of this connective tissue subsequently constitutes a partition that cuts
 off the oral ring from the axiom, and finally breaks up the canal itself
into an irregular areolation.
    The gastric sac at this stage is elongated horizontally into a form
    * They   have been carefully studied by M. Edmund Perrier (loc. cit.), who has
 corrected (as  I  had long since privately done) the mistake into which Prof. Wyville
 Thomson fell in regarding the corpuscles they contain as calcareous, but has not
 thrown any further light on their function.

somewhat resembling that of the human stomach, having a " large end"
into which the funnel-shaped oesophagus opens obliquely, and a " small
end" with a csecal termination (an, fig. 10), which is the original intestine.
To the middle of this gastric        sac,  in sections which exhibit it in situ, the
" axial prolongation " may        be distinctly seen passing up from the base of
the calyx.       The wall of the gastric sac is everywhere thick, and is chiefly
 composed of a yellow substance which appears to consist of a layer of
columnar epithelial cells, the free surface of which layer is clothed with
 cilia.
     The further development of the alimentary canal consists, in the first
 place, in the prolongation of the intestinal extension of the gastric sac —
 this prolongation at first taking place horizontally, so that the intestine
 coils round the stomach in the space left for it by the enlargement of the
 calyx.    Later on, as the second and third radials are developed and the
 cavity   of  the calyx opens out, while the circlet of oral valves undergoes
 very little enlargement, there comes to be a space between the outside of
 that circlet and the inside of the circlet of incipient arms ; at one point
 of this space a projection of the perisome shows itself, enclosing a single
 thin oval calcareous plate ; and towards this projection the caecal termi
 nation of the elongating intestine directs itself upwards.                   At last it
 reaches the prominence of the oral disk, and oppns upon its surface,
forming the projecting vent. — The manner in which the axial canal is
formed by the gradual limitation of the space left by the coiling of the
intestine round the stomach (al, fig. 11) is shown very clearly in this
and the succeeding stages         ; and   I have  been fortunate      enough to trace
the axial prolongation (ax) upwards through              this space,  from   the base of
 the calyx to its subdivision, by the side of the oesophageal funnel, into
 five radial branches.
     The extension of the oral ring into the radial and brachial tentacular
canals having been minutely described by Prof. Wyville Thomson,                   I  need
not    go over the same ground ; but         I have now to speak of the origin of
the subtentacular and coeliac canals.
     From the time when the intestinal coil is formed, and its anal termina
 tion opens on the surface of the disk, the growth of the alimentary canal
 goes on at a greater rate than          the enlargement of the calyx ; and the
 consequence is that the marginal portion of the intestine comes into such
 close contact with the lining of the calyx, as to divide the coelom into an
 upper or oral and a lower or dorsal portion* (fig. 12); and this division
 is completed by the membranous fold, mf.                  From each portion there
 passes a sort of digitate extension into every ray, each extension having
 its own lining membrane. The communication of the lower extension,
    * This   has been distinctly recognized by Metschnikoff, who also has pointed out
 (what   had  long since occurred to myself) that the relation of the visceral and ten
 tacular apparatus to the two divisions of the perivisceral cavity remarkably corresponds
 with that which prevails in many Folyzoa.

forming the coeliac canal (cc, fig. 12) of the rays and arms, with the ven
tral division of the coelom always remains freely open; but that of the
upper or oral extension forming the subtentacular canals (stc) of the
rays and arms, with the oral division of the ceelom itself, is gradually
limited by the enlargement of the visceral mass, and by the formation of
adhesions between its upper surface and the under surface of the oral
disk; so that, as the vertical communication between the upper and
lower divisions of the ceelom becomes gradually narrowed iuto the " axial
canal," so the oral portion of the ceelom may be said to become gradually
narrowed into the subtentacular canals of the disk.
   The principal changes of note which occur in the further development
of the visceral mass consist in the progressive infolding of the wall of
the alimentary canal on the central side of the tube, so as to form the
gland-like projection into its cavity ; the development of the calcareous
disks in the inner or mucous layer of that wall, the piling-up of which in
its infolded portions constitutes the " columella ;" the separation of the
outer or peritoneal layer from the mucous, forming a space which is
crossed by multitudinous threads and lamella) of connective tissue ; the
narrowing of the spaces formed by the infolding of the walls of the ali
mentary tube into the mesenteric canals which open into the axial canal ;
and, generally, the development, in various parts, of a large quantity of
connective tissue, which traverses what would otherwise be vacuities,
and gives compactness to the whole " visceral mass."
   The mode of development of the peripheral portion of the summit of
the original Crinoidal axis into the quinquelocular organ contained within
the centro-dorsal     plate has been already noticed ; and as                      I  described in
my former Memoir the very curious manner in which its radial cords,
which at first he on the upper or ventral side of the basal plates, finally
come to lie on the lower or dorsal side of the "rosette" formed by their
metamorphosis,      I need not here repeat            the history.

 I. " On   the Variations of the Daily Mean Horizontal Force of the
       Earth's Magnetism produced by the Sun's Rotation and the
       Moon's      Synodical and Tropical Revolutions."                      By    J.   A.
       Broun,     F.R.S. Received December 15, 1875.

   The variations of daily mean horizontal              force  in the years 1844 and
 1845 showed several well-marked              oscillations,   having periods of from
 20 to 30 days, and amplitudes, in some cases, of more than one thou
 sandth of the whole magnetic force.             These oscillations were first attri
 buted to lunar action ; afterwards they were found more probably due to
 the sun's rotation on his axis.         The disappearance of these oscillations in

 the middlo of well-marked series, their different amplitudes and periods,
could not be explained except by the supposition that the solar action
was not continuous, but only by fits periodic.
    The author was induced to believe lately that these differences in the
 oscillations were due to conjoint actions of the sun and moon ; he
accordingly deduced the mean variations corresponding to three periods
 of 26, 29-5, and 27-3 days, the times of rotation of the sun derived from
 the magnetic observations, and of the moon's synodical and tropical revolu
tions respectively.     He finds that the combinations of these three series
 of variations represent with considerable accuracy all the variations of
 the daily mean horizontal force of the earth's magnetism during each
year ; so that the sun's rotation and the different positions of the moon          «
relatively to the sun- and the plane of the equator (or of the ecliptic) are
found to produce all the differences in the amplitude and time, as well as
the apparent disappearance of the oscillation.
    Cases of considerable and sudden diminution of the earth's magnetic
force which happened in the years 1844 and 1845 are next examined ;
and   it is shown that these changes occur at intervals of   2G days, or     mul
tiples of 26 days ; in one instance there are five successive recurrences at
the exact interval of 26 days.
   As this period is that of the sun's rotation relatively     to t}ie   earth, it
appears to follow that the earth has some action on the sun, or (more
probably) on some ray-like emanation from the sun, which causes these
                                                                                   *
changes in the earth's magnetism.
   It is found also that these sudden variations      occur more frequently
¦when    the moon is at a considerable distance from the equator and the
ecliptic  ; it would thus appear that our satellite has also an action on the
cause   of the great terrestrial magnetic disturbances.
II. " Results of the Monthly       Observations of Magnetic Dip, Hori
       zontal   Force, and   Declination   made at the Kew Observatory
       from April 1869 to March 1875 inclusive."               By the Kew
       Committee.       Received November 25, 1875.
   This paper, containing the result of six years' magnetic observations
at the Kew Observatory, follows as the third of a series of publications,
the first of w'hich was a communication to the Royal Society by General
Sir E. Sabine, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1863,
page 273, which consisted of a discussion of certain selected magnetic
disturbances, a general discussion of declinational changes as recorded
by the magnetographs, and a discussion of the absolute determination
of Dip and Horizontal Force at the Observatory, for the six years April
1857 to March 1863 inclusive.
   The second publication appeared in 1870 as a paper in the ' Proceed-

1876.]            Magnetic Dip     6fc. at Kew Observatory.              233
ings of the Royal Society,'      contributed  by Dr. Balfour  Stewart,    the
Superintendent     of the Observatory; it contained the results of the
monthly observations of Dip and Horizontal Force for the next series of
six years, viz. from April 1863 to May 1869.
    There is now presented a further series of six years' observations of
Dip and Horizontal Force, from April 1869 to March 1875 inclusive,
together with observations of absolute declination for the same period.
    The instruments employed in the determinations are the same as those
 described   by Sir E. Sabine in the Philosophical Transactions,        1863,
 page  296, no  change  worth   noticing having been  made in either  instru
 ments or magnets.
    As in the  case of the six years discussed by   Dr. Stewart, only those
 dips have been considered whicji have been     made with the two needles
 Nos. 1 and 2 of circle Barrow No. 33; of these the general practice has
 been to observe both needles on two successive days in the middle of the
 month, giving the mean of the four observations      as the mean    for the
 month.
    The values of the constants employed in the reduction of the observa
 tions of vibration and deflection have been redetermined, and found to
 closely correspond with those found by Mr. Welsh, which are given in
 the paper quoted above.
    Two observations of vibration and two of deflection, at two distances,
 have been made each month, the mean result being taken as the force       for
 the month.
    The Declination observations have been made in the Magnetic Obser
 vatory with the Kew 9-inch unifilar and a reversible collimator magnet
 NE, the instrument being directed after each reading to the reference-
 marks on the obelisk erected a quarter of a mile to the north of the
 Observatory as a meridian mark for the transit instrument.
    The azimuth of this mark, as viewed from the declinometer, was care
 fully determined by Mr. "Welsh in 1857, and has since been verified both
 by  Mr. Chambers and Mr. Whipple.
    After each observation of the magnet it is removed and replaced by       a
 torsion-plummet of equal weight, the position of which is observed when
 it has come to perfect rest a few hours after the observation.
    Should any torsion be found to have been introduced into the thread,
 a suitable correction is applied to the observation.
    Observations have been made at noon on two consecutive days in each
 month, the mean of which is inserted in the Table.
                                        Dip.
    In  Table L  we have a record of the observed values of dip made with
 circle 33 Barrow, each observation being the mean of two made with each
 of the two needles belonging to that circle.

   These    six years show a semiannual inequality in the dip, the mean
giving a lower reading by 0'*40 in the six months from April to September,
and a higher by 0'-40 in the other six monthis, viz. October to March,
than the average for the year.
   This amount appears to be variable, the range in the six years ending
March 1863 published by Sir E. Sabine being l'-31, in the six years
ending March 1869 discussed by Dr. Stewart but 0'"54, and in the six
years now under consideration 0r,80.

mean of the      April to September values of the dip in the              same six years

former dip the correction of — 1'*07 as the proportional part of the
secular change as determined by the whole six years' observations.

  240                   On the Thyroid Gland        of the Dog.            [Jan. 27,
     The mean annual secular change observed,            8' 5"-72 declination  dimi
 nishing, is larger than that determined by Sir E. Sabine, which was
  7' 39" ; but this is only in accordance with the opinion expressed in the
 former paper, where it is shown that the secular change is a variable one,
 and is probably now becoming progressively more rapid.
     The semiannual inequality is also largely increased, being now
 81 ''80, whereas between 1857 and 1862 it was only 58"-85 ; possibly
 part of this difference may, however, be due to the fact of the observa
 tions now under notice having only been made at isolated periods, whilst
 the latter result was obtained from the hourly readings of the magneto-
 graph recording the declination continuously.
     The observations discussed in this paper have been made and reduced
 by   Mr.  G-.  M. Whipple, B.Sc, Magnetic Assistant, and Messrs. Callum,
 Power, and Figg, observers, under his supervision.
 III. " Contributions         to the Minute Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland

        municated by Dr. Klein, F.R.S.                   Received December 9,
        1875.
                                      (Abstract.)
     The minute structure of the thyroid gland generally, and of its
 lymphatics in particular, are subjects still but imperfectly understood.
 With the view of elucidating the latter, the following research was made
 on the thyroid gland of the dog.         The research was carried out under the
 direction of Dr. Klein. On injecting the lymphatics of this organ with
 Berlin blue, by the method of puncture, they present the following
 characters    : —
     Traversing the gland, chiefly in a longitudinal direction, are large
 lymphatic vessels provided with valves.          In direct connexion with these,
 and permeating the gland in all directions, is a dense meshwork of
 lymphatic tubes and spaces.         The smaller lymphatic tubes run between
 individual gland- vesicles, the larger between groups of the- same. They
 accommodate themselves accurately to the intervals left, between the
 vesicles, and where the intervals       are larger they expand into irregularly
 shaped lymphatic spaces.          They present  no appearance of terminating in
 blind extremities as stated by some authors.           Injections with nitrate of
 silver show the lymphatic vessels, tubes, and spaces to be all lined with
a continuous      layer of endothelial plates.
    During     this  investigation it became necessary to study more care
fully the interalveolar tissues.           This led to the discovery in them
of   a tissue    which  does   not  appear to have yet been described.         This
tissue, which is designated by the author by the name of "parenchyma,"
consists of large rounded cells, each provided with an oval nucleus,
found either singly or in groups amongst the epithelial cells.                From

   1876.]          On the Anatomy      of the Alimentary Canal.               241
  appearances presented by the parenchymatous cells, the author concludes
  that they originate external to the vesicles by exerting pressure on the
 epithelial   wall of the vesicles ; they then produce a flattening and
  absorption of the same, and finally make their way through it into the
  interior of the vesicle.
     The author in conclusion points to the morphological identity existing
 between the contents of the lymphatics and those of the vesicles — the
 contents, namely, of both appear during life to be a viscid substance
 which, in sections of hardened specimens, present a like morphological
 aspect, and stain in a similar manner with reagents.          This identity, if
 proven in other respects, will go far to show that one, possibly the
 chief, function of the thyroid gland is the formation in the vesicles of a
 material which is carried by the lymphatics into the general circulation.
     This paper is accompanied by nineteen drawings illustrative of the
 lymphatics and parenchyma of the glands.
 IV. " Research      on the Minute Anatomy of the Alimentary Canal."
        By Herbert Watney, M.A., Demonstrator of Microscopical
        Anatomy at St. George's Hospital. Communicated by Dr.
        Klein, F.R.S.,     Assistant Professor in the Brown Institution.
        Received December 16, 1875.
                                   (Abstract.)
     This   research was commenced and carried on for the first fifteen
 months     under the direction of Dr. Klein ; during the last year it was
 continued independently.
     Chapter I. describes the minute anatomy of the mucous membrane of
 the small intestine and the method of fat-absorption.
    The author commences the Chapter by giving a history of the researches
of previous observers, and the methods he employed for hardening and
staining the tissue. He then gives a description of the minute struc
 ture of the mucosa.
    The following are the results obtained.
    1. The epithelium. —Lymph-corpuscles are constantly found among
the epithelial cells of the intestine.     Further it is found that the epithe
lium contains a reticulum continuous with the reticulum of the mucosa ;
this reticulum appears in horizontal sections of the epithelium as small
branched cells, which sometimes show a nucleus.             In vertical sections
the reticulum is seen as a dark line at the base of the epithelium, and
from this dark line fine processes run among the epithelial cells.           The
reticulum is stained very deeply by chloride of gold or by hematoxylin.
    In teased preparations, if the epithelial cells are isolated, shreds of the
reticulum are seen to be attached to the separate cells.
    The epithelial cells are described as being closed at their free extremi
ties.

   Groups of young cells are found. These groups (" epithelial buds ")
are due to germination.
   2. The membrana propria covering the villi is composed of large
cells. In vertical sections the cells are seen to be round or oval, and lie
close below the above-mentioned      dark line.     When the membrane is
separated   from the rest of the tissue, it is seen to be composed of these
cells arranged as an endothelium.      The membrana has holes or gaps in
it   ;        and   in teased preparations             the    superficial     capillaries     are always
attached to              it,   as the large cells         partially surround the vessels.             Villi
which are denuded of their epithelium are bordered by these large cells,
and not             by
            the dark line, as the reticulum (which forms the dark line)
breaks off with the epithelial cells.
  In oblique sections of the villi the reticulum                            is   seen   to surround    the
cells forming the membrana.
   3. The membrana of Lieberkiihn's crypts, when isolated from the
surrounding structures and viewed from above,  found to be   homo           is                  a
geneous membrane with nuclei imbedded in it. In oblique sections of the
membrane in situ      seen to be composed of cells, and the reticulum
                                 it   is                                                                 is
found to surround the cells composing it.
  4. The muscle-endings     in the mucosa. — In cross sections of the
muscle-fibres of the muscularis mucosae, reticulum   seen to surround
                                                                a                 is
the individual muscle-fibres                    ;   this reticulum    is    continuous      with that of
the mucosa.
   The author next describes the manner in which the muscle-fibres
terminate in the rabbit's colon.   The individual fibres are attached to the
large  cells forming the membrana   propria by means of the reticulum.
   This reticulum must therefore be regarded not only as         network of               a
threads,   but as forming in places membranous investments.
   5. The muscle-fibres in the villi have an adventitia formed by the
reticulum of the villus      the muscle-fibres end near the membrana, the
                                       ;   if
adventitia           may be attached to the endothelial                     cells forming the mem
brane.
         6.    The blood-vessels        are found to have an adventitia formed by the
reticulum.   In                 the veins the reticulum surrounds the endothelial cells
and even passes between them.                        In    the arteries the reticulum surrounds
the muscle-fibres  and where the latter are few and scattered, the reti
                                ;
culum forms   very definite adventitia to the vessel.
                         a
     The chyle-vessels are also found to have an adventitia formed by
         7.
the reticulum   ». e. in longitudinal sections of the vessel threads are
                          ;
seen   attaching the vessel to the reticulum.  The reticulum can be seen
to penetrate between the endothelial cells in the same manner as in the
veins.
       The tissue of the mucosa

                                                     is
a reticulum and of cells held in its meshes. The author finds that while
there     no difference, or only slight differences, between the reticulum
               is

1876.]                Anatomy     of the Alimentary Canal.                   243
of the villus and that of the lymphatic follicles, there are considerable
differences between the cells of a lymphatic follicle and those of the villi.
In the villi the cells are polygonal, with oval nuclei and faintly granular
protoplasm ; the cells are arranged as an endothelium, and can hardly be
distinguished from the endothelial cells of the membrana propria, of the
blood-vessels, and of the lymphatics.           A gradual transition is found
from the spherical lymph-corpuscles          of  the lymphatic follicles'] to the
polygonal cells (connective-tissue corpuscles) of the upper part of the
villi.
    It  is found that there are more lymph-corpuscles       in the villi of some
animals than in those of others.
    The author concludes that " the mucous membrane of the intestine is
pervaded everywhere by a reticulum, similar to and continuous with that
found in the lymphatic follicles of Peyer's patches. This reticulum is
situated among all the other elements which are contained in its meshes.
This is true of the epithelial cells, the muscle-fibres, the cells of the
parenchyma, the endothelial plates of the membrana propria, of the blood
vessels, and of the lymphatics."
     9. Fat-absorption by the reticulum — (a) by the reticulum between
 the epithelial cells. — The fat is seen to be arranged in lines between the
individual cells on viewing the epithelium from above.              The separate
 cells in teased preparations appear to contain fat ; but it is considered
 that this appearance is due to the fat-particles in the attached threads of
 reticulum.
     The paper then relates the different situations in which this reticulum
 has been seen (as in the salivary glands, rete Malpighii of the skin,
 serous membranes, epithelium of the respiratory tract, &c.), with the
 different views which various authors have held concerning it.

                                                         — During absorption fat
 is found to travel by the reticulum.
     Chapter II. gives an account of the minute anatomy of the pyloric end
 of the stomach. This chapter commences by a short history of previous
 researches, then follows a description of the minute structure.              The
 following are the results obtained : —
     1. The surface is seen to present somewhat parallel folds ; the
  stomach-tubes opening on the summits of these folds are longer than
 those which open in the depressions between the folds.
     2. The epithelium is described as being closed during inanition, but
  open at its free extremity during secretion.
     3. The germination of the epithelium is next described.             The con
  clusions arrived at are   : — that the epithelial cells divide ; that the small
  rounded cells (other than the lymph-corpuscles) are the products of their
  division ; that these small cells, increasing in size, rise up among the
  older cells, push them to one side and become short broad cells ; that the

short broad cells divide longitudinally, and form groups of two or three,
or even more cells, which the author calls " epithelial buds."
    4.  A   reticulum among the epithelial cells is described : it is found to
be very delicate, and does not extend to the surface.
    5. The membrana propria is found to be composed of large cells.
    6. The muscle-endings in the plica) villosas are similar to those in the
colon of the rabbit, already described.
    7. Perivascular spaces are found in the upper part of the plica
villossB  ;  these spaces are bordered by endothelial cells : the membrana
propria     forms  the upper wall of the space.
    8. The proper gland-tubes. — A fine reticulum is described as occur
ring among the epithelium of these glands. The nuclei are found usually
as flattened disks lying at the base of the cells.    The nuclei are, however,
during digestion occasionally found to be spherical in form.           A third
kind of nucleus was also found, which was possibly intermediate between
the two other forms.
    Chapter     III. describes the mucous membrane at the point of transition
between the stomach and intestine : after giving a short history of the
subject, it is shown that in many animals Brunner's glands are only the
continuation of the proper glands of the stomach.           Part of the proper
gland-tubes break through the muscularis mucoste, and then the glands
are situated in the mucosa and submucosa ; finally they are only found
in the submucosa.
    The mucosa at the point of transition was found to contain lymphoid
follicles in very varying amount, the mucosa being in some animals
almost free from them, and in others composed in a great measure
of lymphatic tissue. This latter condition was found to be the case in
dogs which were kept on a very reduced diet.

I. " On      Formulae   of Verification in the Partition of Numbers."
       By   J. W. L. Glaisher, M.A., F.R.S.      Received December 18,
       1875.
   In writing    down all the partitions of a number it is convenient to
have tests which will verify that none have been omitted ; and it is the
main object of this paper to give formulae which are available for this
purpose.
   At the Edinburgh Meeting of the British Association (Report 1871,
Transactions of the Sections, p. 23), Sylvester communicated the elegant
and useful test-formula
   I.                    2(1           xyz+ &c.)=0,
where    in any partition x denotes the number of l's present, y the number

of 2's, z the number of 3's, and the 2 extends to all the partitions of the
given number n ; so that 21 =N, the total number of the partitions of n.
A single formula of verification, however, is rarely sufficient to afford a
perfect test of accuracy, as the effects produced by certain omissions may
cancel one another.    In the present case, for example, as the terms are
alternately positive and negative, if the omitted partition contained one
1 and no 2 it would appear as 1 in the first term and as 1 in the second
term, and its omission would thus not be pointed out.         Having had
occasion several times to employ Sylvester's equation I., and having
found the need of some additional formula to be used in connexion with
it,
 I    was led to seek for identities which would afford similar verifica
tions.  It seemed natural first to investigate what became when all      I.
the signs were positive.

are also -worth attention.          From Jacobi's equation (' Fundamenta               Nova,'
 p. 185),
 we see that

 The sign + is to be taken if the partition contains an even number of
terms, and the sign — if the number is uneven.

 where K=the number of representations of n as the sum of an even
 number of squares, and B/ the number of representations as an uneven
 number of squares.
      In the case of n=9, of the three partitions involving only one element,
 all consist of an uneven number of terms ; of the seventeen partitions
 involving two elements, in nine the number of terms is even, and in eight
 uneven ; and of the ten partitions involving three elements, in five the
 number is even and in five uneven ; so that since 9 is an uneven square,

 even elements, but all uneven elements being admissible), and in which
 1, 3, 5 must each occur at least once; so that in the partitions all the

according as n is or is not a triangular number.  The general term on
the left-hand side is (-)"Q(1, 3, 5 . . .X»-6ma+2»»).  For n = 9, the
formula gives
                                                            2-1-1 = 0.
   There is a proposition of Euler's which follows immediately from (e),
viz. that the number of partitions of a number into the uneven elements
1, 3, 5 ... is equal to the number of partitions without repetitions into the
elements 1, 2, 3 . . ., or, in the notation already used, that P(l, 3, 5 . . .)n
=Q(1, 2, 3 . . ,}n. It is natural to suppose that this striking theorem
should admit of a simple demonstration by converting the partitions of
the one system into those of the other according to some rule, such as
in Mr. Ferrers's method of showing the identity of the numbers of parti-
tionments   into the elements 1, 2, 3 . . .m, and into parts not exceeding
m in number (Phil. Mag. 8. 4. vol. v. p. 201, 1853).        The conversion,
though not so simple as that just referred to, is nevertheless elegant and
elementary ; it in effect consists of a transformation into the binary scale.
Thus consider a partition into uneven numbers containing a. l's, /3
3's, y 5's, &c.    This is transformable at once into 1 . a+3./3+5.y
+&c.          Now express »,                    /3,   y.    . .   in the binary           scale           so that      a =2" +2°'+
&c,     /3   =    25   +   2v   +     &c.,      y     =    2°   +     2°'   +   &c., then the partition                      becomes
l(2°+&c.)+3(2*+&c.)+5(2<'+&c.) + &c., viz. becomes 20+2B'+&c.
+3.26+3.26'+&c. 5.2c+5.2<'+&c., in which no two parts are iden

tical, since a number can be expressed in only one way in the form 2™ A,
A   being uneven.
    To illustrate this take Euler's example of n=10                                                       ;   the partitions into

    To reverse the process it is only necessary to remark that every number
is either uneven, or twice an uneven number, or four times an uneven
number, or eight times an uneven number, &c., so that every sum of dif
ferent elements can be uniquely reduced to the form l+3.a+5./3+&c.
 (The practical reduction is very easy, ex. gr. 14+12+5+3+2 converts
                                          l
into7+7+3+3 + 3+3 + 5+3 + + l.) A little consideration shows that
 no two different partitions of one system can convert into the same par
 tition of the other, so that every partition of either system corresponds
 uniquely to a partition of the other ; and the numbers of partitions in the
 two systems are thus equal. Several conversions of P(l, 3, 5 . . .)n are
 given in the Phil. Mag. for April 1875 (S. 4. vol. xlix. pp. 307-311);
 but when writing that note         I
                                    failed to obtain the connexion between
 the partitions into 1, 3, 5 . . . with repetitions and the partitions into
 1, 2, 3 ... without repetitions.

development of poison-fangs.   Poisonous snakes are divided into two
groups — those which have  a shortened movable maxillary bone, which
carries the poison-fang and another tooth ; and those which have the
maxillary bone longer, immovable, and often carrying other teeth behind
 the poison-fang.
    In the former, or viperine poisonous snakes, the poison-fang is very
 long, and, when out of use, lies recumbent ; in the latter, or colubrine
'poisonous snakes, it     is,
                          from the maxillary bone being fixed, constantly
 erect (Gunther's 'Reptiles of British India,' p. 165).
    As fresh specimens are indispensable for      complete investigation of
                                                         a

                                 I   only been  able to examine one of the
 colubrine group, viz. the Indian cobra.
   Of    one may say, roughly speaking, that the poison-fangs are deve

 individually modified     so as to produce           the characteristic   canaliculated
 poison-tooth.

     But in all the viperine poisonous snakes which           I  have examined a
  strikingly different  arrangement    is displayed.   Upon   the  movable maxil
 lary bone there is room for two poison-fangs, side by side ; and in a
 macerated skull the tooth in use occupies an extreme position, sometimes
on one side, sometimes on the other.          In sections displaying all the soft
part in situ, the remaining space is generally occupied by a tooth which is
in process of becoming attached ; and, in whatever part of the area of tooth-
development the section be taken, the successional teeth are arranged in
pairs, in two parallel series. Thus there will be a right-hand series, con
sisting of the tooth in place and pf four successors, and a left-hand series,
consisting of the tooth next about to be in place and four successors.
    When    a tooth  of the right-hand series has finished its period of work
and is about to be shed, it is succeeded by a tooth of the left-hand series,
which comes up by its side, and vice versd.            A septum of connective
tissue separates the two parallel series, and is continued out into the
pouch, which conceals the poison-fangs when at rest, as a free hanging
fold : its use appears to be to keep the long axis of the tooth in the right
direction prior to its becoming firmly attached, and to prevent a right-
hand tooth from getting into the place of one of the left-hand series, and
vice versd.
    It  is obvious that this manner of succession is well adapted to avoid
loss of time in the changing of the poison-fangs, for much can be done
 towards the fixation of a new tooth before the old one is detached. That
 the succession is both rapid and regular would appear to be indicated by
 the fact that the successional tooth-sacs are very numerous (often as many
 as ten), and that they are arranged in pairs, the two being almost abso
 lutely alike in size and etage of development. Now as any given tooth
 of the one series is succeeded or preceded by its fellow in the other
 series, one might expect, if any great interval of time were to elapse, that
the one would be materially more advanced than the other.              "When such
 is not the case, one  is led to the inference that the succession is rapid and
also regular.
    In the cobra, the new tooth has to come into place and become attached
after the loss of the old one ; and this, it may be inferred, would take
much more time.        May this not be the explanation of the feat performed
                                                                                   '

 such purposes ?       A cobra disarmed would remain harmless for some
considerable period ; a rattlesnake similarly treated would be furnished
with   a new weapon very speedily.
    I have examined      specimens in spirit of a few other colubrine snakes ;
and although such examination is less satisfactory than the methods
which may be pursued with fresh specimens,           I believe it will be found to
hold good that in those snakes which have a movable maxilla carrying
but one tooth, the successional teeth are developed in two parallel series,
this being the highest specialization of the poison-apparatus.

    On the other hand, in the colubrine poisonous snakes, approximating
more nearly to the harmless snakes in having a fixed maxilla, sometimes
carrying other teeth in addition to the poison-fang, the successional
poison-fangs are developed in a single series, like any other Ophidian
teeth.
    The development of the individual tooth-germ         presents one feature of
very great    interest.    A  poison-fang tooth-germ    is first formed, like any
other, of an extinguisher-shaped enamel-organ (derived from an ingrowth
of epithelium, which winds in and out amongst the tooth-sacs) and of             a
simple conical dentine-pulp.
     As it elongates,   a groove appears on one side, which, by deepening and
by the approximation        of its lips, becomes ultimately converted into the
poison-canal.       The   enamel-organ, with its characteristic enamel -cells,
passes without break or alteration into this groove; but still lower down
is the tooth-germ, where the groove has become very deep ; instead of the
prismatic enamel-cells constituting a regular pavement epithelium, we
have a reticulum of stellate cells, just like that gelatinous stellate tissue
which forms so large a part of a mammalian enamel-organ.                That the
stellate reticulum is a non-essential structure       I  have previously shown ;
but the occurrence of such a tissue within the poison-canal, which it
wholly occupies, and in which it represents the prismatic enamel-cells
found higher up, strongly suggests the idea that it is a sort of retrograde
 metamorphosis of an active enamel-forming tissue into one which simply
 fills up a void.
     It need hardly be added that a thin layer of enamel is developed upon
 the outside of the poison-fang ; but none is formed on the interior of
 the poison-canal.
     The base of a poison-fang is fluted (this is not the case with other
 Ophidian teeth), the dentine being convoluted as it is in the base of the
 tooth of Varanus or in a labyrinthodont tooth ; and it is attached to the
 bone through the medium of an opaque, ill-defined, calcified material,
 beyond which again comes a coarse bone. The fixation of a tooth is
 effected (alike in cobra and in viperine snakes) by a sort of scaffolding
 of coarse-textured bone, which is very rapidly thrown out from the
  surface of its finer textural maxillary bone. This " bone of attachment,"
 met with, as     I  have elsewhere pointed out, in greater or less quantity
 wherever teeth are attached by ankylosis, is entirely removed with the
 fall of a tooth, and is developed afresh for its successor.

        Received January 31, 1876.
     The kinematic      principle for integrating ydx, which is used in the
instruments       well known as Morin's Dynamometer* and Sang's Plani-
meter    t,  admirable    as  it is in many respects, involves one element of
imperfection which cannot but prevent our contemplating it with full
satisfaction.      This imperfection consists in the sliding action which the
edge wheel or roller is required to take in conjunction with its rolling
action, which alone is desirable for exact communication of motion from
the disk or cone to the edge roller.
     The very ingenious, simple, and practically useful instrument well
known as Amsler's Polar Planimeter, although different in its main
features of principle and mode of action from the instruments just
referred to, ranks along with them in involving the like imperfection of
requiring to have a sidewise sliding action of its edge rolling wheel,
 besides    the desirable rolling action on the surface which imparts to it
its revolving motion — a surface which in this case is not a disk or cone,
but is the surface of the paper, or any other plane face, on which the
map or other plane diagram to be evaluated in area is drawn.
     Professor J. Clerk Maxwell, having               seen    Sang's Planimeter in the
 Great Exhibition of 1851, and having                become convinced that the com
bination of slipping and rolling was a drawback on the perfection of the
instrument, began to search for some arrangement by which the motion
 should be that of perfect rolling in every action of the instrument, cor
 responding to that of combined slipping and rolling in previous instru
ments.       He succeeded in devising a new form of planimeter or inte
 grating machine with a quite new and very beautiful principle of kine
 matic action depending on the mutual rolling of two equal spheres, each
on the other.         He described this in a paper submitted to the Royal
 Scottish Society of Arts in January 1855, which is published in vol. iv.
 of the Transactions of that Society.               In that paper he also offered a

 instrument for measurement of force.      I would suggest that the name may with advan
 tage be changed to dynamimcter.       In  respect to the mode of forming words in such
cases, reference may   be made  to Curtius's  Grammar, Dr. Smith's English edition, § 354,

suggestion, which appears to be both interesting and important, pro
posing the attainment of the desired conditions of action by the mutual
rolling of a cone and cylinder with their axes at right angles.
   The idea of using pure rolling instead of combined rolling and slipping
was communicated to me by Prof. Maxwell, when              I had the pleasure of
learning   from   himself   some  particulars  as   to the  nature  of his contri
vance. Afterwards (some time between the years 1861 and 1864), while
endeavouring to contrive means for the attainment in meteorological
observatories of certain integrations in respect to the motions of the
wind, and also in endeavouring to devise a planimeter more satisfactory
in principle than either Bang's or Amsler's planimeter (even though, on
grounds of practical simplicity and convenience, unlikely to turn out
preferable to Amsler's in ordinary cases of taking areas from maps or
other diagrams, but something that          I hoped might possibly be attain
able which, while having the merit of working by pure rolling contact,
might be simpler than the instrument of Prof. Maxwell and preferable
to it in mechanism),    I  succeeded in devising for the desired object a new
kinematic method, which        has ever since appeared to me likely sometime
to prove valuable when occasion for its employment might be found.
Now, within the last few days, this principle, on being suggested to my
brother as perhaps capable of being usefully employed towards the deve
lopment of tide-calculating       machines which he had been devising, has
been found by him to be capable of being introduced and combined in
several ways to produce important results.           On his advice, therefore,   I
now offer to the Boyal Society a brief description of the new principle
as devised by me.
   The new principle consists       primarily in the transmission of motion
from a disk or cone to a cylinder by the intervention of a loose ball,
which presses by its gravity on the disk and cylinder, or on the cone and
cylinder, as the case may be, the pressure being sufficient to give the
necessary frictional coherence at each point of rolling contact ; and the
axis of the disk or cone and that of the cylinder being both held fixed
in position by bearings in stationary framework, and the arrangement of
 these axes being such that when the disk or the cone and the cylinder
are kept steady, or, in other words, without rotation on their axes, the
ball can roll along them in contact with both, so that the point of rolling
contact between the ball and the cylinder shall traverse a straight line on
the cylindric surface parallel necessarily to the axis of the cylinder — and so
that, in the case of a disk being used, the point of rolling contact of the ball
with the disk shall traverse a straight line passing through the centre of
the disk — or that, in case of a cone being used, the line of rolling con
tact of the ball on the cone shall traverse    a straight line on the conical sur
face, directed necessarily towards the vertex of the cone. It will thus
readily be seen that, whether the cylinder and the disk or cone be at rest or
revolving on their axes, the two lines of rolling contact of the ball, one

 264                        Prof. J. Thomson on                       [Feb. 3,
on the cylindric surface and the other on the disk or cone, when both
 considered as lines traced out in space fixed relatively to the framing of
 the whole instrument, will be two parallel straight lines, and that the
 line of motion of the ball's centre will be straight and parallel to them.
For facilitating explanations, the motion of the centre of the ball along
its path parallel to the axis of the cylinder may be called the ball's longi
 tudinal motion.
    Now for the integration of ydx : the distance of the point of contact
of the ball with the disk or cone from the centre of the disk or vertex
 of the cone in the ball's longitudinal motion is to represent y, while
the angular space turned by the disk or cone from any initial position
represents x ; and then the angular space turned by the cylinder will,
when multiplied by a suitable constant numerical coefficient, express the
integral in terms of any required unit for its evaluation.
    The longitudinal motion may be imparted to the ball by having the
framing of the whole instrument so placed that the lines of longitudinal
motion of the two points of contact and of the ball's centre, which are
three straight lines mutually parallel, shall be inclined to the horizontal
sufficiently to make the ball tend decidedly to descend along the line of
its longitudinal motion, and then regulating its motion by an abutting
controller, which may have at its point of contact, where it presses on the
ball, a plane face perpendicular to the line of the ball's motion.      Other
wise the longitudinal motion may, for some cases, preferably be imparted
to the ball by having the direction of that motion horizontal, and having
two controlling flat faces acting in close contact without tightness at
opposite extremities of the ball's diameter, which at any moment is in
the line of the ball's motion or is parallel to the axis of the cylinder.
    It is worthy of notice that, in the case of the disk, ball, and cylinder
integrator, no theoretical nor important practical fault in the action of
the instrument would be involved in any deficiency of perfect exactitude
in the practical accomplishment of the desired condition that the line of
motion of the ball's point of contact with the disk should pass through
the centre of the disk.    The reason of this will be obvious enough on a
little consideration.
    The plane of the disk may suitably  be placed inclined to the horizontal
at some such angle as 45° ; and the accompanying sketch, together with
the model, which will be submitted to the Society by my brother, will
aid towards the clear understanding of the explanations which have been
given.
    My brother  has pointed out to me that an additional    operation, impor
tant for some purposes, may be effected by arranging        that the machine
shall give a continuous record of the growth of the integral by intro
ducing additional mechanisms suitable for continually describing a curve
such that for each point of it the abscissa shall represent the value of
<r,  and the ordinate   shall represent  the integral   attained   from   .r=0

 forward to that value of x.        This,  he has    pointed out, may be effected
 in practice by having     a cylinder axised on the axia of the disk, a roll of
 paper covering this cylinder's surface, and a straight bar situated parallel
 to this cylinder's axis and resting with enough of pressure on the surface
 of the primary registering      or  the  indicating   cylinder (the one, namely,

which is actuated by its contact with the ball) to make it have sufficient
frictional coherence with that surface, and by having this bar made to
carry a pencil or other tracing point which will mark the desired curve on
the secondary registering or tJie recording cylinder.        As, from the nature
of the apparatus, the axis of the disk and of the secondary registering or
the recording cylinder ought to be steeply inclined to the horizontal, and
as, therefore,   this bar, carrying the pencil, would have the line of its
length   and   of  its motion alike steeply inclined with that axis, it seems
that, to carry out this idea, it may be advisable to have a thread attached
to the bar and extending off in the line of the bar to a pulley, passing
over the pulley, and having suspended at its other end a weight which will
be just sufficient to counteract the tendency of the rod, in virtue of gravity,
to glide down along the line of its own slope, so as to leave it perfectly
free to be moved up or down by the frictional coherence between itself
and the moving surface of the indicating cylinder worked directly by the
ball.

       W. Thomson, LL/D., F.R.S. Received January 28, 1876.
   In   consequence of the recent meeting of the British Association at
Bristol,  I resumed an attempt to find an instrument which should super
sede the heavy arithmetical labour of calculating the integrals required
to analyze a function into its simple harmonic constituents according to
the method of Fourier.         During many years previously it had appeared
to me that the object ought to be accomplished by some simple mechanical
means ; but it was not until recently that         I  succeeded in devising an
instrument approaching sufficiently to simplicity to promise practically
useful results.     Having arrived at this stage,      I described my proposed
machine a few days ago to my brother Professor James Thomson, and he
described to me in return a kind of mechanical integrator which had
occurred to him many years ago, but of which he had never published any
description.     I  instantly saw that it gave me a much simpler means of
                                                    I
 attaining my special object than any thing had been able to think of
previously.     An account of his integrator is communicated to the Boyal
 Society along with the present paper.
    To calculate     f
                  J" (#)  ^{.r)c?.r, the rotating disk is to be displaced from a
 zero or initial position through       an angle equal to    yf(x)dx, while   the
 rolling globe is moved so as always to be at a distance from its zero posi
tion equal to iK-r). This being done, the cylinder obviously turns through
an angle equal to              \p(x)dx, and thus solves the problem.
                      ^ <p(.v)
    One way of giving the required motions to the rotating disk and rolling
globe is as follows : —
    On two pieces of paper draw the curves
 Attach these pieces of paper to the circumference of two circular cylin
 ders, or to different parts of the circumference of one cylinder, with the
axis of a; in each in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.
Let the two cylinders (if there are two) be geared together so as that their
circumferences shall move with equal velocities.          Attached to the frame
work let there be, close to the circumference of each cylinder, a slide or
guide-rod to guide a movable point, moved by the hand of an operator,
so as always to touch the curve on the surface of the cylinder, while the
two cylinders are moved round.
   Two operators will be requirod, as one operator could not move the
two points so as to fulfil this condition — at all events unless the motion
were very slow. One of these points, by proper mechanism, gives an

angular motion to the rotating disk equal to its own linear motion, the
other gives a linear motion equal to its own to the centre of the rolling
globe.

on this subject published in the first volume of Liouville's ' Journal des

     Every linear differential equation            of the second order may,             as    is
 known, be reduced to the form
                                      d   /l  du\                                           ,,-.

 where   P  is any given function of x.
    On account of the great importance of this equation in mathematical
physics (vibrations of a non-uniform stretched cord, of a hanging chain,
 of water in a canal of non-uniform breadth and depth, of air in a pipe of
 non-uniform sectional area, conduction of heat along a bar of non-uniform
 section or non-uniform conductivity, Laplace's differential equation of
 the tides, &c. &c.),      I have long endeavoured to obtain a means of facili
 tating its practical solution.
     Methods of calculation such            as those used by Laplace himself are
 exceedingly valuable, but are very laborious, too laborious unless a serious
 object is to be attained by calculating out results with minute accuracy.
 A ready means of obtaining approximate results which shall show the
 general character of the solutions, such as those so well worked out by
 Sturm*, has always seemed to me a desideratum. Therefore 1 have made
 many attempts       to plan a mechanical integrator which should give solu
 tions by successive approximations.              This is clearly done now, when we
 have the instrument for calculating          f $>(#)  i/*(x) dx, founded on my brother's
  disk-, globe-, and cylinder-integrator, and described in a previous                    com
 munication to the Eoyal Society ; for it is easily proved                 t that if
                                «3=j;p(c-j;«A)^J

 where «, is any function of x, to begin with, as for example «,=# ; then
 wa, ws, &c. are successive approximations               converging to that one of the
 solutions of (1) which vanishes when x=0.
                                                                          '"
    Now let my brother's integrator          be applied to find     C— f utdx, and let its
 result feed, as   it were, continuously         a second machine, which           shall find
 the integral of the product of its result into              P dx.    The second machine

                                               Use again the same process
with ua instead of uv and then  u3, and so on.
  After thus altering, as it were, wt into ita by passing it through the
machine, then w, into u3 by a second passage through the machine, and so
on, the thing will, as       it were, become refined into         a   solution which will
be more and more nearly          rigorously correct the oftener wo pass it through
the machine.     If          does not sensibly differ from u„ then each is sen
sibly a solution.
   So far   I
            had gone and was satisfied, feeling           I
                                                had done what                   I wished
to do for many years.     But then came a pleasing surprise.        Compel
agreement between the function fed into the double machine and that
given out by it. This is to be done by establishing a connexion which
shall cause the motion of the centre of the globe of the first integrator of
the double machine to be the same as that of the surface of the second
integrator's cylinder.   The motion of each will thus be necessarily a
solution of (1). Thus          I
                           was led to a conclusion which was quite unex
pected  ; and it seems to me very remarkable that the general differential
equation of the second order with variable coefficients may be rigorously,
continuously, and in a single process solved by a machine.
  Take up the whole matter ab initio : here it is.       Take two of my
brother's  disk-, globe-, and cylinder-integrators, and connect the fork
which guides the motion of the globe of each of the integrators, by                         «
proper mechanical means, with the circumference of the other inte
grator's cylinder.   Then move one integrator's disk through an angle =x,
and simultaneously move the other integrator's disk through an angle
always =j"o"P c£r, a given function of x.     The circumference of the
second integrator's cylinder and the centre of the first integrator's globe
move each of them through a space which satisfies the differential
equation (1).
  To prove this, let at any time gv g2 be the displacements of the centres
of the two globes from the axial lines of the disks ; and let dx, ~Pdx be
infinitesimal angles turned through by the two disks. The infinitesimal
motions produced in the circumferences of two cylinders will be
                                    gfa   and   gj?dx.
But the connexions pull the second and firBt globes through spaces
respectively equal to those moved through               by the circumferences     of the
first and second cylinders.  Hence
                             gjdx=dg2,    and   gJVdx=dgl     ;

  to go into details as to plans for the mechanical fulfilment of condition (7) ;
  it is enough to know that it can be fulfilled by pure mechanism working
  continuously in connexion with the rotating disks of the train of inte
  grators.
                  Addendum.           Received February 10, 1876.
     The integrator may       be applied to integrate any differential              equation of
  any order.      Let there     be i  simple integrators ; let              gv ^    be  the dis
  placements of disk, globe, and cylinder of the first, and so for the others.
  We    have
                                           dx         cfc
     Now by proper mechanism establish such relations between
                                   •ri>  9v   ri< x» 9» &c-
  that
                              fm(*v9v           *„*„... )=0,

       — 1
  (2i      relations).
      This will leave just one degree of freedom ; and thus we have 2i— 1
   simultaneous equations solved.              As one particular case of relations take
                          a,i=A,a=     . . . (i— 2 relations),.

  and
                          9-1= *v 93=k2,       &c. (t  - 2 relations)   ;
  so that
                             _dU          _dr1Ki
                                <M,9*~dxFx'             .
  Thus one relation is still available.            Let it   be
                                f(*>9v9*"-9*              *<)=0.
   Thus the machine solves the differential equation

 frame (as in my tide-predicting machine, or in Wheatstone's alphabetic
 telegraph-sending instrument).
    Then, to begin with, adjust the second globe-frames and the second
 cylinders to have their displacements equal to the initial velocity-compo
 nents and initial coordinates of     i particles free to move in one plane.
 Turn the machine, and the positions of the particles at time t are shown
 by the second cylinders of the several double integrators, supposing them
 to be free particles attracting or repelling another with forces varying
 according to any function of the distance.
    The same may clearly be done for particles moving in three dimensions
 of space, since the components of force on each may be mechanically
 constructed by aid of a cam-surface whose equation is
 and taking jj for the distance between any two particles, and
                                         '

Thus we have a complete mechanical integration of the problem of finding
the free motions of any number of mutually influencing particles, not
restricted   by any of the approximate suppositions which the analytical
treatment of the lunar and planetary theories requires.

      William Crookes, F.R.S. &c. Received January                5, 1876.
                                 (Abstract.)
   This paper contains an account of experiments on the action of radia
tion on bodies the surfaces of which have their radiating and absorbing       *
powers modified by various coatings.         The difference between a white
and a lampblacked surface in this respect was at first not very decided ;
and experiments have been instituted with the object of clearing up
some anomalies observed in the actions.        Two pith disks, one white and
the other  black, were  suspended   on  a light arm in a glass bulb by means
of a fine silk fibre ; after perfect exhaustion the white and black disks
were found to be equally repelled by heat of low intensity, such as from
the fingers, warm water, &c.     A  copper ball was then tried at gradually
increasing temperatures.     Up  to 250° C. it repelled both equally, above
that the black was more repelled than the white, and at a full red heat the
repulsion of the black disk was very energetic.        A lighted candle acts
with more energy than the red-hot copper.
   The presence of even a small quantity of aqueous vapour             in the
exhausted apparatus almost, if not quite, neutralizes the more energetic
action which luminous rays appear to exert on a blackened surface.
   After describing several different modifications and      some  new forms
of apparatus devised to facilitate experiment, the author gives a drawing
of an instrument which enables him to get quantitative measurements of
 the amount of incident light falling on it. It consists of a flat bar of
pith, half black and half white, suspended horizontally in a bulb by
 means of a long silk fibre.   A small magnet and reflecting-mirror are
fastened to the pith, and a controlling magnet is fastened outside so
 that it can slide up and down the tube, and thus increase or diminish

sensitiveness.  The whole is completely exhausted, and then enclosed in
a box lined with black velvet, with apertures for the rays of light to pass
in and out. A ray of light reflected from the mirror on to a graduated
scale, shows the movements of the pith bar.      The degrees of deflection
produced by the light  of a candle at distances from  6 feet to 35 feet are
given.

by the theoretical diminution of light with the square of the distance

278                           Mr. W. Crookes       on                 [Feb. 10,
standard candle 48 inches off was balanced by a gas-flame 113 inches off.
The lights were therefore in the proportion of 482 to 11311, or as 1 to 5£.
The gas-burner was therefore equal to 5| candles.
    By interposing screens of water or plates of alum, and so practically cut
ting off all the dark heat, the actual luminosity is measured. In addition to
this, by interposing coloured glasses or solutions, any desired colours can be
measured either against the total radiation from a candle, its luminous
rays, or any desired colour.      One coloured ray can be balanced against
another coloured ray, by having differently coloured screens on either
side.
    The variations in the luminosity of     a  " standard " candle will cease to
be of importance.       Any candle may be    taken ; and if it be placed at such
a  distance  from   the apparatus that it will give a uniform deflection, say
of 100 divisions, the standard can be reproduced at any subsequent time ;
and the burning of the candle may be tested during the photometric
experiments by taking the deflection it causes from time to time, and
altering its distance, if needed, to keep the deflection at 100 divisions.
    If  the pith bar   in this instrument    be blacked on alternate halves, an
impetus given by a ray of light always acts in the same direction of
movement.       A candle causes it to spin round very rapidly until the sus
pending fibre is twisted up, and the rotation is stopped by the accumu
lated torsion.
    By arranging the apparatus       so that the black and white surfaces are
suspended     on  a pivot instead of  by a silk fibre, the interfering action of
torsion is removed, and the instrument will rotate continuously under
the influence of radiation.      To this instrument the author has given the
name of the
                "  Badiometer," or " Light- Mill."     It consists of four arms
of very fine glass, supported in the centre by a needle-point, and having
at the extremities thin disks of pith lampblacked on one side, the black
 surfaces all facing the same way.         The needle stands in a glass cup,
and the arms and disks are delicately balanced so as to revolve with the
 slightest impetus.
    In the ' Proceedings of the Boyal Society' for 1875 (vol. xxiii. p. 373),
the author gave a brief account of some of the earlier experiments
with these instruments.        In the present paper he enters very fully into
 the various phenomena presented by them, and gives Tables showing the
number of revolutions made by the radiometer when exposed to a con
 stant source of light removed different distances from the instrument.
The law is that the rapidity of revolution is inversely as the square of
the distance between the fight and the instrument.
    "When exposed to different numbers of candles at the same distance
 off, the number of revolutions in a given time are in proportion to the
number of candles, two candles giving twice the rapidity of one candle,
 and three giving three times, &c.
    The position of the light in the horizontal      plane of the instrument is

of no consequence, provided                         the distance        is not altered       ;   thus    two
candles one foot off give the same number of revolutions per second,
whether they are side by side or opposite to each other. Prom this it
follows that            if   the radiometer         is brought into a uniformly lighted space
it will continue to revolve.                       This is proved to be the case by experi
ment.
     The   speed        with which       a sensitive radiometer            will revolve in full sun
shine is almost incredible.Nothing is apparent but an undefined nebulous
ring, which becomes  at times almost invisible.  The number of revolu
tions per second cannot be counted, but it must be several hundreds, for
one candle          will make the arms spin round forty times                        a second.

face equally, and  the movement   of the radiometer   therefore arrested       is                         if
a flask of boiling water   brought near it. The same effect

reverse way.     Thus breathing gently on the instrument will generally

fitted up and hermetically sealed in glass, and connected with an im

quartz window is cemented to the apparatus; and the movements of
the beam, when radiation falls on the pith, are observed by a reflected
ray of light on a millimetre-scale.     The apparatus was fitted up in a

ray of that    particular wave-length,              and are not evidence of separate
identities.

the different parts of the spectrum but these cannot well be given in

glass, and water screens, so as to cut off the whole of the ultra-red or
dark-heat rays.      The ray of light which was thus freed from dark heat
was allowed to fall on the pith surface of the torsion-apparatus, when it
produced a deflection of 105°.         On interposing a solution of iodine in
disulphide    of  carbon   the  deflection  fell to 2°, showing that the pre
vious action     was almost    entirely due to light.       With a candle tried
under the    same circumstances, the     light filtered from   dark heat produced
a deflection of 37°, which was reduced to 5° by interposing the opaque
 solution of iodine.
    In order to obtain comparative results among disks of pith coated
with lampblack and with other substances, a torsion-apparatus was con
structed in which two or more disks could ba exposed one after the
other to a standard light. One disk always being lampblacked pith, the
other disks could be changed so as to get comparisons of action.                If
the action of radiation from a candle on the lampblacked disk be taken
as 100, the   following   are the proportions    obtained : — ¦

   In   consequence of some experiments tried by Profs. Tait and Dewar,
and published in ' Nature,' July 15, 1875, the author fitted up a very
sensitive apparatus for the purpose of carefully examining the action of
radiation on alum, rock-salt, and glass. The source of radiation was a
candle.     Perfectly transparent     and highly polished plates of the same
size were used, and the deflection       was made evident by an index ray of
light. Taking the action on the alum at 100, that on the rock-salt in
five successive experiments was 81, 77'3, 71, 62-5, 60-4. This increasing
action on the alum was found to be caused by efflorescence, which took
place rapidly in the vacuum, and rendered the crystal partially opaque.
A fresh alum plate being taken, this and the rock-salt were coated with
lampblack and replaced in the apparatus, the black side away from the
source of radiation, so that the radiation would pass through the crystal
before reaching the lampblack.           The action of radiation was in the
proportion of blacked jilum 100 to blacked rock-salt        73.

pith  surface,  the    torsion-handle  had  to  be turned   27 revolutions and
353°, or 10073° before the beam became horizontal.              The downward
pressure  of the jfo of        grain was therefore equivalent to the force of
                               a
torsion of the glass thread when twisted through 10073°.
   The author next ascertained what was the smallest amount of weight
which the balance would indicate.        He found that 1° of torsion gave                                 a
very decided movement of the index ray of light,             torsion of 10073°    a

 only four millionths of a grain is a sufficient proof that the indications
 of this instrument, lite those of the apparatus previously described by
the author, follow rigidly the law of inverse squares. An examination
of the differences between the separate observations and the mean shows
that the author's estimate of the sensitiveness of his balance is not exces
sive, and that in practice it will safely indicate the millionth of a grain.
    One observation of the weight of sunlight is given ; it was taken on
 December 13 ; but the sun was so obscured by thin clouds and haze that
it was only equal to 10-2 candles 6 inches off. Calculating from this
datum, it is seen that the pressure of sunshine is 2*3 tons per square
mile.
    The author promises further observations with this instrument, not
only in photometry and in the repulsion caused by radiation, but in other
branches of science in which the possession of a balance of such incredible
delicacy is likely to furnish valuable results.

           DI. On   the Specific Volumes of certain similarly constituted
                                 Inorganic Chlorides.
    The results of the observations made by Pierre and Kopp upon the
boiling-points, specific gravities, and thermal expansibilities of the tri
chlorides and tribromides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony have led
Kopp to suppose that the specific volumes of phosphorus, arsenic, and
antimony, in their liquid combinations, may be identical.              The same con
clusion has been drawn with respect to tin, titanium, and silicon from
Pierre's observations upon the tetrachlorides of these elements*.
   * Ann. der Chem. u. Pharm. xcvi. p. 319. In his original paper Kopp remarks that the
specific  volume of antimony, from his observations on the chloride, SbCl3, and the bro
mide, SbBr3, is decidedly larger than that of phosphorus and arsenic.     But the larger
value is in part due to the atomic weight of antimony being taken as 129. If the more
                                                                         12

    The common value of P, As, and Sb would appear to be about 27 ; that
of Si, Ti, and Sn about 35. But on examining the details of the observa
tions, it becomes evident that this conclusion is not strictly borne out by
the results; the numbers obtained for the individual members of the
group differ in many cases considerably from the common value, the
divergences being far wider than could arise from errors of observation,
either in the determination of the physical constants or in the estimation
of the atomic weights of the constituent bodies. In fact the order of
the divergences would seem to render it probable that the specific volumes
of the several members of a family of elements increase with their atomic
weights.
                                                                   I
    In a former communication to the Royal Society have given the results
of a series of observations on the specific gravities, boiling-points, and
rate of expansion of certain liquid chlorides of phosphorus*.                  Since Eoscoe
has shown that vanadium is a member of the phosphorus group of ele
 ments, it has appeared to me that a comparison of the specific volumes
 of the analogously constituted phosphoryl and vanadyl trichlorides might
 serve to throw additional light on this question of the relation of the
 specific volumes of the members of a family of elements to their atomic
 weights.
    Methods of observation. —A detailed account of the methods of observa
 tion and of reduction and calculation employed in this series of researches
 is reserved for a subsequent communication ; but in order to render certain
 of the data given in this paper more intelligible, it may be desirable to
 state that the rates of expansion of the various liquids have been deter
 mined in thermometer-shaped                   vessels (dilatometers),       graduated and
 accurately calibrated.           The readings were made with a telescope provided
  with   a micrometer        eyepiece.       Three series of thermometers were em
 ployed, two of which were obtained from Mr. Casella, and the third from
 Dr. Geissler, of Bonn ; for a description of these instruments                    I refer to
  the paper by Prof. Biicker and myself on the " Expansion of Sea-water
 by Heat "t.
     All observations of temperature, unless otherwise stated, are converted
 into air-thermometer degrees by means of Regnault's and Becknagel's
 Tables*. In the determination of the boiling-points the bulb of the
 thermometer was placed in the vapour of the liquid.                      I mention this fact
  as serving to account for the discrepancy in the numbers given by Pierre
  and myself, Pierre's observations being made with the bulb in the liquid.
 probable number 1223 (Dexter, Kessler) be adopted, the specific volume is found to
 approximate more nearly to that of phosphorus and arsenic ; at least the variation from
 the mean value for the two last-named elements is less than the difference between the
 specific volumes of tin and titanium, which are regarded by Kopp as practically identical.

Due precaution             was taken to ensure regular ebullition and to prevent over
heating.          In    correcting the indications of the thermometer for the cooled
portion of the column,            I    have made use of a special series         of observation
to obtain the value of I              in the well-known expression

   The specific gravities of the various liquids were taken at the tempe
rature of melting ice, and are compared with water at 4°.    The weighings
were made by   the method    of vibrations, and are reduced to      vacuum.           a

This operation was repeated several times in order to remove any tri
chloride    which might possibly be present.             The boiling-point of the
chloride was, however, unaltered by this treatment ; the liquid distilled
 completely between 107° and 107°-5, the greater portion boiling at

by reducing the pentoxide by means of hydrogen gas, in a stream of dry

portion of the sample employed by him in determining the atomic weight
of vanadium, and had been prepared with great care ; it was beautifully
crystalline and of a magnificent ruby-red colour t. In order to free the
vanadyl trichloride from dissolved chlorine, it was maintained at a tem
perature near its boiling-point for a couple of hours in a current of dry
carbon dioxide.     The chloride was distilled into the flask in which its
boiling-point was to be determined.               Therm. Casella C.          The liquid

    The agreement between the results is satisfactory.               The control is
important, since it might be supposed, from Matthiessen's criticism of
Kopp's observations on the expansion of water, that the dilatometric

method      of determining      the   expansion        of liquids tends to give low
results*.
   The specific gravity of vanadyl              trichloride at 1270,19 is 1*63067;
hence its specific volume is                    = 106-54.
                                  ¦„o(|„.
   It is thus evident that the specific volumes of vanadyl and phosphoryl
trichlorides are not equal; the compound with the higher molecular
weight has the greater specific volume.
   In the communication on the chlorides of phosphorus already referred
to, it is shown that if we assume, as appears in the highest degree pro
bable, that there is a relation       between the manner in which the oxygen
atoms    in  a compound     are held in union and their specific volume, it
follows that the oxygen atom in POC1, possesses the smaller of the two
values 12-2 and 7*8 assigned by Kopp to oxygen, and accordingly that
this atom is attached to the phosphorus by only one combining unit.
   Thus
                                      CI

showing that the phosphorus atom in phosphoryl trichloride possesses
the same atomic value as in phosphorus trichloride.
   As the difference between the two values for the volume of oxygen,
viz. 12-2 — 7-8 = 4-4, is but       little   less    than that    between the specific
 volumes of YOC1, and P0C13, viz. 106-54— 101-58=4-96, it is possible
that the difference in the specific volumes of the two liquids may be due
to the different manner in which the oxygen atoms are united to the
vanadium      and phosphorus      atoms; for,        if V   be regarded    as a pentad,
VOC1, must      be written

the oxygen atom having the value                    12-2.    Assuming Kopp's       value
for CI, viz. 22*8, this would leave for            P  and  V   nearly the Bame specific
volume, viz.
                             P                            25-4

   From the uncertainty respecting the particular volume to be assigned
to the oxygen atom in vanadyl trichloride, our knowledge of the specific
volumes of VOC1, and POC1, gives us little aid towards solving the
 question whether the several members of a family of elements have
identical specific volumes.

   With   a view to obtain          further evidence,       I  have redetermined          with
special care the boiling-points, specific gravities, and rates of expansion
of the tetrachlorides of silicon, titanium, and tin.
   The atomic weights of Si and            Ti and of    P  and  V   show about the same
gradational difference      :—
                  Si                28-10           P                31-00

   And since the tetrachlorides             are free from oxygen, the uncertainty
arising from the variable specific volume of that element is eliminated.                      I
have also compared the specific volumes of the trichlorides of phosphorus,
arsenic, and antimony, making use of Kopp's determination in the case
of the last-named compound.               We thus obtain material for the discussion
of the question from analogous derivatives of two well-defined groups of
elements, viz.  : —

   The results of the determinations of the specific volumes of the tetra
chlorides of silicon, titanium, and tin, liquids of analogous constitution
and all derivatives of the tetrad group of elements, serve to establish the
conclusion, indicated by the difference in the specific volumes of phos-
phoryl and vanadyl trichlorides, that the specific volumes of the several
members of a family of elements are not identical, but that the values
increase with the increase of the atomic weight of the members.

   This compound was obtained by heating arsenic trioxide in a current
of dry chlorine.          It was distilled upwards in a current of dry carbon di
oxide for some time in order to expel the excess of chlorine.                          Care is
necessary to obtain a perfectly clear product ; the least trace of moisture
renders the liquid turbid from the formation of the insoluble oxychloride,
AsClO.         On distillation the liquid commenced to boil at 129°-23, and all
came over below 129°-33, the greater                  portion boiling at     129°- 30.    n=

                       and of Ethene Bromide and Ethene Chloriodide.
   The molecular weight of bromine                 is,   as   is   well known, nearly equal to
the arithmetic  mean of the molecular weights of chlorine and iodine                                :
hence the molecular weights of bromine and of iodinejnonocbloride     CI)                   (I
are nearly identical.  These substances closely resemble each other in
physical properties.  Both are dark-red liquids about three times heavier
 than water.               Bromine boils at about 59°-5, and solidifies at                — 24°-5   ;
 iodine monochloride melts at +24°-                 5,   and boils at 101°: the interval
 between the boiling- and melting-points                 of the two compounds   approxi
                                                                                     is
 mately equal.
   It appeared   to me of interest to determine (1)       the specific volumes
                                                                        if
 of these liquids exhibit   relation asimilar to that which    shown       theiris         by
 molecular weights, and (2)         the relation in their specific volumes
                                         if                                                      is
 preserved in analogous combinations of the two bodies.           have accord    I
 ingly determined the specific gravities, boiling-points, and rates of ex
 pansion of bromine and iodine monochloride, and of the compounds
 which these substances form by their union with ethene, CSH4. The
 observations will also serve to determine                    if    bromine and iodine      mono
 chloride preserve, when              in combination, the volumes which they possess
 in the free state.

     The rate of expansion of bromine has already been determined by
 Pierre, who has given the following expression to represent the results
 of his observations
                         * :—

     This formula gives numbers agreeing fairly well with those afforded
 by the expression deduced from my determinations, as the following
 comparison shows (the temperatures are given in degrees of the mer
 curial thermometer)      : —

     Pierre was undoubtedly one of the first to obtain bromine in a state
 approaching to purity ; but it seems probable, in spite of the care which
 was evidently taken in its preparation, that the sample employed by him
 in his determination of its rate of expansion was not perfectly free from
 water.     This is indicated by the order of the divergence between the
 results of our various observations ; and the supposition would seem to be
 confirmed by the high solidifying-point, viz. — 7C"5 to —8°, which he
 observed. Baumhauer has shown that the true freezing-point of bromine
 is at — 24°-5t.       Pierre sought to dry his bromine by digestion with
 calcium chloride.          According to Stas, calcium bromide (which, as a
 desiccating agent     is not   inferior to the chloride) is incapable of removing
 the last traces of water from bromine £.
    The specific volume of bromine, calculated from Pierre's numbers, is
                                      159-90

 The product was repeatedly distilled in order to break up the last traces
of the yellow iodine trichloride which is always formed in slight quantity
in the preparation.          The liquid ultimately boiled constantly between
99°-7 and 100°-7; n=40° f=75°.                    Corrected and reduced barometer
744-3 millims.       Corrected and reduced boiling-point 101°-3.
    In order to establish its purity the iodine monochloride was analyzed
by breaking bulbs containing weighed portions of the liquid under dilute

   Iodine monochloride, as a liquid, bears a marked resemblance to bro
mine.     Although when solidified it melts at a temperature as high as
24°-2 (according to my observations), it not unfrequently remains liquid
for many weeks after distillation, and may be cooled to below 0° without
congealing.      In a freezing-mixture of ice and salt it readily solidifies to
a dark reddish-brown         crystalline mass.         Long-continued shaking at
ordinary temperatures occasionally brings about its solidification.                   A
quantity of iodine monochloride which had been liquid                      for   months
crystallized in long prisms when subjected to the vibration of a railway-
carriage.     Mr. J. B. Hannay has already published a number of curious
observations on the solidification        of this compound *.
   The specific gravity of iodine monochloride at 17°-95 is 3-12988, com
pared with water at 4°; at 0° its specific gravity is 3-18223, compared
with water at 4°.

point, the dilatation of the liquid might be irregular, a supposition which
is not confirmed by my observations.                  He accordingly calculated two
expressions of the form
                                 *

     From 20o-09 to 100°-           16 the   expansion      may be expressed            by the
 formula

 and from 100°-16 to 132°-6 by the formula

 expression deduced from my observations, as is evident from the fol

     The specific volume of ethene dibromide, calculated from the numbers
 given by Pierre, on the assumption that the specific gravity of the liquid
  at 20°- 79, viz. 2-16292, as given by him, is compared with water at 4°
  (the temperature of comparison             is not stated, but it is probably that
  which is assumed), is 97-7.
                           IV.    Ethene   Chloriodide, C2H4IC1.
      This remarkable compound was first prepared by Maxwell Simpson.
  To obtain it, finely powdered iodine is suspended in about three times
  its weight of water, and chlorine is passed into the liquid (which should
  be kept cool and constantly agitated) until the iodine has nearly disap
  peared ; the liquid is decanted after standing, and a stream of ethene,
  washed by passing through soda solution, is led into it until both the
  liquid and the oil which gradually separates out are decolorized.                         The
  compound,     after  washing       and  drying,  is  found     to boil nearly constantly.
  When first prepared it is colourless ; but on exposure to light it gradually
  becomes red from the separation of a trace of iodine t.
      In order, if possible, to avoid the use of water in the preparation of
  this compound,      I   attempted to obtain it by the direct addition of pure

iodine monochloride      to ethene, matters     being so arranged that a large
excess   of the hydrocarbon was present during the reaction.                 The result
                                        I
was altogether different from what anticipated. When the two substances
are brought together, nearly the whole of the iodine is set free, and
Dutch liquid is formed, only a very small quantity of the chloriodide
being produced:      I  varied the conditions of the experiment in several
ways, but with invariably the same result.               I  have since found that
Geuther has made the same observation*.                 It   is remarkable that the
presence of water should so completely modify the reaction.                 It must be
remembered, however, that in an aqueous solution of iodine chloride
there is always more or less free hydrochloric acid and iodic acid, a por
tion of the iodine chloride being decomposed in accordance with the
equation
                  5IC1 +     3H„0 = 5HC1         +    HIO,      + 21,,
the extent of the decomposition being probably dependent on the ratio
of the products of decomposition to the compound still undecomposed.
This supposition is rendered probable by the observations of Hannay,
that, on filtering the solution from the iodine, a further precipitation
gradually occurs ; and that on mixing an aqueous solution of iodine
chloride with carbon bisulphide, which dissolves the iodine as it separates
out, the whole of the compound is gradually decomposed, nothing but
iodic and hydrochloric acids being left in the water.
    Dr. Maxwell Simpson kindly sent me a sample of ethene chloriodide
prepared by the process above described, with the direction that in order
 to render it quite pure it was merely necessary to wash it with dilute
 potash and dry it.        After being dried over phosphorus pentoxide it
 boiled almost completely between 139°-1 and 140°-1. Barometer 759-3
 millims. ; n=50°, <' = 110°; corrected and reduced boiling-point 140°-1.
    Two observations of specific gravity gave, (1) 2-13363 at 15°-28 and
 (2) 2-13329 at 15°-43, compared with water at 4°. Reduced to 0°, the
 specific gravity becomes (1) 2-16440 and (2) 2-16437.                 Mean 2-16439,

 The number obtained for iodine monochloride differs considerably from
 the volume calculated by means of Kopp's values (CI = 22-8, 1=37-5),
 viz. 60-3. The specific volume of bromine (Bra) is also less than Kopp's
 number, 55-6.       The value assigned to chlorine is unquestionably far
 more accurate than that given to iodine, since the value of the latter
 element was calculated from only two or three compounds, whereas the
 former value was deduced from a comparatively large number of
 chlorinated    products.    That the value for iodine needs revision      seems to

be confirmed     by Billet's observations of the specific gravities of liquid
iodine   at various  temperatures.       His results are * : —

If   these numbers        be plotted   down    and the curve        prolonged to the
boiling-point of iodine, we find that the specific gravity of iodine at this
temperature is 3-780 ; hence the specific volume of iodine (I)

   If  now this value      be added   to that of chlorine, as given by Kopp, we
get a result identical with the      observed    volume of iodine monochloride —
                                 33-5 + 22-8    = 56-3.
   If we    subtract the specific volumes of C2 H4, as calculated by the aid
 of Kopp's values (C=ll, H=5-5, C2H4=44), from the specific volumes
 of ethene bromide and ethene chloriodide, we obtain numbers which are
 nearly equal to the specific volumes of bromine and iodine chloride re
 spectively  : —
                                97-30   _ 44  = 53-30.
                               101-27   - 44 = 57-27.
 This correspondence between the two          sets    of values seems to  warrant the
 conclusion that bromine and iodine chloride possess the same volume                 in
 a compound which they have when in the free state.
    In  order to ascertain how far this conclusion is general,            I purpose to
 determine the specific volumes         of such    of  the C, H10 hydrocarbons as     I
 can. obtain in quantity and of sufficient purity, and also of the specific
 volumes of their combinations with bromine.                 Buff has already made
 observations    upon amylene ; but a recently published investigation by
 Havitzky has rendered it probable that the preparation employed by Buff
 was a mixture of isopropylethene and trimethylethene t.

   Since bromine and iodine chloride appear to have the same volume in
union with ethene that they have when uncombined, it is not unreason
able to suppose that the same may be true of ethene itself, viz. that at
its boiling-point it would possess the same volume which                        it has in the
bromide and chloriodide at their respective boiling-points.                         On this   as

        By Alfred Tribe, Lecturer on Chemistry in Dulwich Col
        lege.  Communicated by J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., Fullerian
        Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution.    Received
        January  13, 1876.
  In July   1800 Nicholson and Carlisle first effected the decomposition
of water by the pile of Volta ; and they were not a little surprised when
the constituent gases of the water appeared separately at some con
siderable distance from each other*, but they offered no opinion as to
the cause of so singular a phenomenon.   A little later Cruickshank also
decomposed water by the pile, and, for the first time, many metallic
salts   t.    He also, like Nicholson and Carlisle, was much struck by the
appearance of the compounds round poles separated some distance, and
attempted to explain the phenomenon by supposing that the principle of
galvanism could exist in an oxygenated and deoxygenated condition —
that in entering water at the negative end, it combined with oxygen,
liberating hydrogen, and that on arriving at the positive end the oxygen
either escaped or combined with the wiret.
   This hypothesis, which involves the idea of an imponderable capable
of combining with ponderables, underwent various modifications by
Fourcroy and Vauquelin and Thenard, and by Dr. Bostock and others.
   But the next step of importance to the theory of electrolysis was the
idea of the passage into or through the liquid of one or both constituents
of the electrolyte, which was first roughly foreshadowed by an anonymous
correspondent of Nicholson's Journal (vol. iv. p. 472), and which was
                                                             "
thus more explicitly expressed in 1807 by Sir H. Davy : — The oxygen
of a portion of water is attracted by the positive surface at the same
time that the other constituent part, the hydrogen, is repelled by    and               it,
the opposite process takes place at the negative surface       and in the       ;

middle or neutral      point of the circuit, whether there         be a series of  de
compositions     and recompositions, or whether the particles from the
extreme points only are active, there must be a new combination of the
repelled matter." (Phil. Trans. 1807, p. 30.)
    The next enrichment of the subject was by Grotthus *, who contended
that since in the elementary combinations of the pile of Volta, as in a
magnet, there is polarity, it would establish a like condition in the
elements of water.
    Faraday, accepting the notion of polarity, added the necessary corol
lary, the idea of the revolution of the molecules of the electrolyte t, which,
as far as   I am aware, is the last important contribution to the theory of
the subject.
    If  the condition   of an electrolyte just prior to, and in the act of, de
composition be     in accordance with the views of Grotthus and Faraday,
as enunciated, an electrolyte may, it appears to me, be regarded as a
dielectric whose molecules are possessed of the power of mutually ex
changing their constituents during discharge.               This view, jointly with
 some supposed points of resemblance between magnetic and electrolytic
substances to which it is unnecessary here to refer, led me to undertake
the experiments detailed in this communication.
    Experiment    I. — A   piece  of thin copper wire about an inch long was
suspended lengthwise, by a piece of cotton, between the copper electrodes
(distant about 4 inches) of a Grove's battery +, and immersed in a 5-per
cent, solution of potassium chloride.              Gas was at once given off from
the end of the wire facing the positive pole, and after the lapse of
a few minutes the end facing the negative battery-pole was found
corroded.
    Experiment II. — Four small upright wooden posts 1 inch high were
 fixed perpendicularly and 1 inch apart in a wooden stand 5 inches long.
 Slits were made in the tops of these posts, and in them were inserted
 strips of thin sheet silver.
    The whole arrangement, as in the figure, was then placed in a glass
 vessel containing a 5-per cent, solution of copper sulphate mixed with a
 little potassium chloride, the silver strips being arranged lengthwise in a

straight line between the copper electrodes. On making contact, silver
chloride (resulting from the action of the potassium chloride upon the
silver sulphate produced) immediately formed upon those ends of the
strips facing the negative pole, and marked B in the figure above, and
descended in clouds in a beautiful manner, being apparently attracted,
after the lapse of a minute or two, towards the battery-poles. In a few
minutes the condition of the other ends of the strips was examined, and
on each there was copper distinctly visible.
  The preceding experiments demonstrate that an insulated conductor
may, by immersion in any part of an electrolyzing fluid, become endowed
with the power of doing work exactly similar in kind to that done by the
two battery-electrodes ; may, because, as will be subsequently shown, the
working power of the insulated conductor is dependent more or less
upon its length, position in the fluid, and conductivity,      as well as
chemical activity.
  It is well known that the poles or electrodes of a battery are each
charged with electricity opposite in kind, but possessed of similar pro
perties to the electricity of friction, though generally much less intense.
This being so, were an insulated conductor placed lengthwise, so as to
ensure the maximum effect, between the electrodes of a battery, the
whole being immersed in air,         it is certain that, were our instruments
sufficiently delicate to detect      it,         the positive electrode
                                           the end facing
would be found charged with negative electricity, whilst the other end,
facing the negative electrode, would be found charged with positive
electricity. That       is,
                     the conductor would become endowed with the
power of doing work similar in kind to the two battery-electrodes, just
as has been shown to obtain with an insulated conductor placed between
the battery-electrodes        immersed     in   a    solution of copper sulphate and
potassium chloride.
   Now     appears to me that the two actions just mentioned are parallel
          it
phenomena and  ;      the polarization of the insulated conductor immersed
                       if
in air be ascribable to induction, the polarization (for such its properties
show     to be) of the conductor immersed in an electrolyzing fluid may
         it
also be attributed to the same cause.
   Similar phenomena to the former receive       ready explanation by
                                                             a
means of Faraday's theory of the polarization of contiguous particles,
a similar hypothesis applied to air and other dielectrics as was thirty-
two years previously applied by Grotthus to what we now term electro
lytes.
   The difference between the two phenomena lies in the fact that       high    a
electric tension   necessary
                   is         to effect the  depolarization of the particles
of air    by
          discharge, which, of course,          is
                                          unaccompanied by decomposition                ;
whereas only      very low electric tension
                   a                             required to effect the de
                                                        is
polarizationof an electrolyte, which, on the contrary,              is   always accom
panied by decomposition.

battery for two hours, metallic copper was distinctly visible on the ends
of each of the strips of silver facing the positive pole. The copper on
the strips in this and in another precisely similar experiment was deter
mined by the cyanide of potassium and ammonia process, after removing
it by digestion with dilute hydrochloric acid containing      little nitric.         a

 which, graphically   represented, give curves as in this diagram.
    These quantitative experiments also accord with the view of Grotthus.
    Nos. 3 and 4 would show that the whole of the molecules of the elec
trolyte were equipolarized, which follows from the fact that in any given
section of the liquid there must have been the same number of polarized
particles as in that in immediate contact with the electrodes ; whereas
in Experiments V. and VI. it would appear that the number of polarized
particles increases as the section is removed from the electrodes, and the
intensity of the action in any definite space is accordingly diminished.
Grotthus's view, however, as it appears to me, does not account for the
difference of polarization of the molecules in the vicinity of the two
electrodes, as exhibited    in Experiments V. and VI.
   The principal source of error in the foregoing experiments is the
difficulty of placing the strips in a straight line and perfectly parallel in
direction ; for if not parallel to the line joining the electrodes, the

    The positive battery-electrode is supposed to be at the top and the
negative at the bottom of the columns respectively.
    A glance at these numbers well shows the influence of direction, and
at the same time reveals the fact that a suspended rigid conductor, sur
rounded by an electrolyzing fluid, may transmit the electric power as
though it were transparent to its influence.
    The effect of varying the length of the conductor is illustrated by
Experiment VII., that of conductivity by Experiment VIII., and that of
chemical activity by Experiment IX.

   In   the language of Grotthus's hypothesis, the foregoing experiments'
may be explained      thus : — The greater amount of copper found on the
longer silver strip in Experiment VII. may be accounted for (1) by its
being subjected to the influence of a greater number of polarized mole
cules, (2) by its tendency to electric equilibration being less, and (3) by the
smaller number of molecules between its ends and the battery-electrodes
inducing a more rapid discharge.
   The absence of copper on the glass, the presence of a little on the
carbon, and more on the platinum in Experiment VIII. is explained by
the difference in the capability of these bodies to be polarized en masse.
   The results of Experiment IX. are due in great part to the specific
affinities of the metals for the chlorine of the potassium chloride ; in
great part, because the different metals are polarized en masse with more
or less facility, and the result is affected accordingly ; but were the con
ductivity of the metals equal, we might expect the rapidity of the dis
charge to be proportional to the specific affinities.
    It now appeared desirable to obtain some experimental knowledge of
the general direction of the lines of the discharge between electrodes of
small dimensions.
   For this purpose 198 silver strips were placed in         as many posts fixed
into  a wooden stand.      The arrangement of these, as well as the position
in which the electrodes   were placed, is shown in the accompanying diagram.
Connexion was made with the battery for an hour, after which the copper
sulphate was removed from the trough, and each strip examined. Those
on which copper was visible, as well as its position on the strip, are
thus marked in the figure, (— >— ; t signifies the merest trace, and ?
doubtful.

electrical condition, illustrates in a striking manner the electrical condi
tion of the molecules in the vicinity of the poles. It is also evident that

way that the magnetic influence does in the magnetic field.

    In  an extension      of these experiments, employing smaller electrodes
and a trough of much greater dimensions, measures of the amount of
action in different parts of a liquid undergoing electrolysis would be
 found, and these would doubtless be                in accordance with what might be
reckoned a     priori from the known laws of electrical action, and would in
another way exhibit the equipotential                  curves which         Prof. Adams      has
worked out in his Bakerian Lecture.                  I hope to do this       so soon as time
 and opportunity permit.
    The work recorded above is in no way inconsistent with those current
 views which are usually expressed in the language of Ohm's laws ; but
while those views deal rather with results, the views propounded above
refer to the physical processes involved, and appear to unite the different
 kinds of electricity more closely together.
    I  have much pleasure in expressing my indebtedness to Professor
 Gladstone for the use of the chemical laboratory of the Eoyal Institution,
 where the experimental work of this paper was done. My thanks are
also due to Mr. E. J. Legg for his excellent assistance.

I. " On    determining the Depth of the Sea without the use of the
       Sounding-line, and on an Attraction-meter." By C. William
       Siemens,    D.C.L., F.R.S., M.I.C.E.              Received     January 20,
       1876.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The author starts with the proposition that the total gravitation of the
earth, as measured on its normal surface, is composed of the separate
attractions of all its parts, and that the attractive influence of each equal
volume varies directly as its density and inversely as the square of its dis
tance from the point of measurement.
    The density of sea-water being about 1-026, and that of the solid con
stituents composing the crust of the earth about 2-763 (this being the
mean density of mountain-limestone,         granite, basalt, slate, and sandstone),
it follows that an intervening depth of sea-water must exercise a sensible
influence upon total gravitation if measured on the surface of the sea.
    The amount of this influence is proved mathematically in considering,
in the first place, the attractive value of any thin slice of substance in a
plane perpendicular to the earth's radius, supposing the earth to be a
perfect sphere, unaffected by centrifugal force, and of uniform density.
    The attraction of each such slice is shown to be represented by the
expression
                              ddAl = 2-irdh sin ada,
in which h represents the vertical distance to the slice from the point of
attraction, and A, the total attraction of the slice.
    In integrating this expression between the limits h and 0 and a and 0,
this gives
 in which, for small values of   h, the factor              may be neglected, when
                                                  <y//^-
 the formula assumes the form
 in which Al represents the total attraction down to the depth           h.
    If A  represents the total attraction of the earth, the following propor
tion obtains,
                                    A,_27tA
                                     A      |Rrr'
 or
                                      7, = §R.
    It follows that if sea-water was without weight, the total attraction
 of the earth, as measured upon the sea-surface, would diminish in the pro
 portion of the depth to |R; but taking the weight of sea-water into

 account, gravity would be found to diminish upon the sea-level in the
 proportion of the depth to     f|f B, or as E nearly.
    The proportion would be strictly correct if the interior of the earth was
 of the same density as surface-rock ; but the coefficient here arrived at
 has to be diminished in the proportion of the density of surface-rock to
 the mean density of the earth, or in the proportion of about           -~  ;  the
 author considers   it safer, however, not to rely entirely upon these    mathe
 matical deductions in constructing his working scale, which he prefers to
base upon comparison       with the sounding-line.
   The author next describes a first attempt made by himself in 1859 to
construct an instrument to indicate upon a scale such slight variations in
total gravitation as would result from the ordinary variations of depth
below a vessel, and the difficulties he then encountered.      These difficulties
he has since succeeded in overcoming in adopting an instrument of another
construction,   which he proceeds to describe in detail, reference being had
to the accompanying drawings.
   This instrument, which he proposes to call     a Bathometer,  consists essen
tially of a vertical   column of mercury contained in a steel tube having
cup-like  extensions at both extremities, so as to increase the terminal
area of the mercury.       The lower cup is closed by means of a corrugated
diaphragm    of  thin steel  plate, and the weight of the column of mercury
is balanced in the centre of the diaphragm by the elastic force derived
from two carefully tempered spiral steel springs of the same length as
the column of mercury.
   One of the peculiarities     of this mechanical arrangement is that it is
parathermal, the diminishing elastic force of the springs with rise of tem
perature being compensated by a similar decrease of potential of the mer
cury column, which decrease depends upon the proportions given to the
areas of the steel tube and its cup-like extensions.
   The instrument is suspended a short distance above its centre of gravity
in a universal joint, in order to cause it to retain its vertical position,
notwithstanding the motion of the vessel ; and vertical oscillations of the
mercury are almost entirely prevented by a local contraction of the mer
cury column to a very small orifice.       The reading of the instrument is
effected by means of electrical contact, which is established between the
end of a micrometer-screw and the centre of the elastic diaphragm.            The
pitch of the screw and the divisions upon the rim are so proportioned that
each division represents the diminution of gravity due to one fathom of
depth.
   Variations in atmospheric pressure have no effect upon the reading of
this instrument ; but a correction has to be made for variations of atmo
spheric density as affecting the relative weight of the mercury column,
which correction might be avoided, however, in excluding the atmosphere
from both the upper and the lower surface of the mercury, and connecting

the extremities of the column.       The only necessary correction is that for
latitude, which it is asserted in the paper must be less variable on the sea
than on land, owing to the absence of masses elevated above the surface,
and owing to the comparative greater distance of the irregular solid con
stituents of the earth and the very uniform density of sea-water.
    The paper contains tables of the result of actual observations of the
instrument in twice crossing the Atlantic on board the steamship ' Fara
day,' while she was engaged upon laying submarine cables. The readings
of the instrument were checked by actual soundings taken by means of
Sir William Thomson's steel-wire sounding-apparatus ; and the compa
rable results agree in all cases as closely as could have been expected,
considering that the sounding-line gives the depth immediately below the
vessel, whereas the bathometer gives the mean depth taken over a certain
area, depending for extent upon the depth itself ; it is also shown that
upon an even slope the two instruments may be expected to agree in their
indications.
    It is thought that the bathometer may render useful service to the
mariner in warning him of changes of depth long before reaching dan
gerous ground.      An example is recorded where the position of the end of
a submarine cable in deep water was found simply from a knowledge of
the depth in which the end had been lost ; and it is shown how the posi
tion of   a vessel, when no astronomical observations can be taken, may be
ascertained by the aid of a bathometer, provided the contour-lines of equal
depths of oceanic basins were accurately laid down.
    The instrument    is applicable also for measuring elevations above sea-
level  ; and it is shown that for height the total attraction of the earth
varies in the ratio of
                                      h : 5R,
and that therefore approximately the fathom-readings at sea may be taken
for yard-readings in measuring height ; but that in this last application
allowance    will have to be made, in addition to corrections for latitude, for
the local attraction of the elevated land itself, varying with its breadth,
and rendering the indications of the instrument for height less reliable
than for depth of sea.
   Addendum. — On an Attraction-meter.                 Received February 23,
                                       1876.
    At   the reading    of  the  foregoing    paper, the author exhibited an
instrument for measuring        horizontal    attractions, which, at the same
 time, illustrates the action of the bathometer.           This instrument con
sists of a horizontal tube of wrought iron 400 millims. long, termi
nating at each end in a horizontal transverse tube of cast iron of 60
millims. diameter and 300 millims. long. The first-named horizontal
tube is partially closed at its ends, and communicates with the transverse

  320                  On determining the Depth    of the Sea.       [Feb. 24,
  ubes below their horizontal mid section.       The transverse tubes commu
  nicate also by means of a horizontal glass tube of 2 millims. diameter at
  a superior level to the former.
       The whole apparatus being mounted upon three set screws is filled to
  the level of the half -diameter of the transverse tubes with mercury, which
  mercury fills also the whole of the longitudinal connecting-tube ; the upper
  halves of the cast-iron transverse tubes and the glass connecting-tube are
  filled with alcohol tinted with cochineal, comprising, however, a small
  bubble of air, which can be made to occupy a central position in the glass
  tube by raising or lowering the set screws.
      If a weighty object is approached to either extremity of the connecting-
 tube an attractive influence will be exercised upon the mercury, tending
  to a rise of level in the reservoir near at hand, at the expense of the more
 distant reservoir ; and this disturbance of level between the two reservoirs
  must exercise a corresponding effect upon the index of air in the hori
 zontal glass tube, moving it away from the source of attraction.          The
 amount of this movement must be proportionate to the attractive force
 thus exercised, and is considerable, because the transverse cross section of
 each reservoir-tube is 60 x 300 = 18,000 square millims., whereas the sec
 tion of the glass tube is only about 3 millims.     ; the motion produced by
 the effect of gravity is thus increased 3000-fold, and could easily be in
 creased, say 30,000-fold, by simply increasing the horizontal area of the
 transverse or reservoir-tubes.      Variations of temperature have no effect
 upon this instrument, because the liquids contained on either side of the
 index of air are precisely the same in amount ; and the total expansion of
 the liquids is compensated for by an open stand-tube rising up from the
centre of the connecting-tube, through which the apparatus can be easily
filled.     By means of this instrument the effect of 1 cwt. approached to
 one end or the other of the mercury connecting-tube causes a sensible mo
tion of the air-index.
      It is suggested that an instrument of this description may be employed
usefully for measuring and recording the attractive influences of the sun
and moon which give rise to the tides.           The instrument, which is of
simple construction and not liable to derangement from any cause, would
have to be placed upon a solid foundation with its connecting-tube point
ing east and west, records being taken either by noting the position of
the index upon the graduated scale below, or by means of a self-recording
arrangement through photography.
     This mode of multiplying the effect produced by gravitation is shown
as applicable also to the bathometer ; and the author showed one of these
instruments      fitted with a spiral glass tube laid horizontally upon the
upper surface of the bathometer upon a regularly divided scale, which
horizontal tube is connected at one end with the uppermost chamber of
the bathometer above       the mercury, while the other end remains open to
the atmosphere.        The  space above the mercury in the upper chamber is

   filled by preference with oil, which terminates in the horizontal spiral
   glass tube at a point which will vary with the total attractive influence
   of the earth, and thus furnish a means of reading the instrument. The
  electric contact arrangement described in the paper is thus rendered un
  necessary, and the reading of the instrument much simplified.

          different Depths in the Ocean."                By J. Rymer Jones, of
          the Imperial Government Telegraphs, Japan.                  Communicated
          hy Prof.     Rymer    Jones, F.R.S. Received January 1, 1876.
       The object of these instruments is to register on board ship : —
              1st. The direction of currents which flow at different depths in
         the ocean.
              2ndly. The velocity of those currents.
              3rdly. The temperature of the sea at all points between the sur
         face and bottom, without requiring the instruments to be hauled up
         in order to register the results.
       The advantages of such results, if capable of being obtained, must
  appear self-evident ; and the following description will,         I hope, prove the
 practicability of those methods which           I  propose to adopt in order to
 arrive at the above desiderata.
      All  three instruments     are based  on electrical principles.
      Diag. 1. fig. 1 represents       a full-sized section     of the    instrument
 employed for making serial observations of the direction of currents
 flowing at different depths in the sea ; and in the lower part of the same
 figure is shown        the method for taking the temperatures at the same
 points     ;  but as the description of this instrument will form a separate
 paragraph,       I shall dismiss  it for the present with the remark that the
 same leading-wires       are used in connexion with both instruments.
      In  considering the best method for registering the direction of deep-
sea currents, two things seem absolutely necessary : — 1st, some point
capable of taking up a fixed direction and uninfluenced by the currents ;
and 2ndly, a movable point taking up the direction of, and regulated by,
the current whose direction is required.             With these data it appeared
sufficiently easy to arrive at the direction of the currents, by measuring
the angle between the fixed point and the movable point, which varies
with the direction of the current.            It is clear that    the only available
fixed point is that afforded by the unerring magnet, while the employ
ment of a sufficiently large vane will cause the instrument to take up a
position in the direction of the current, the rest being only matter of
detail, which       I now  proceed to discuss.

 thick sheet-copper (A B C D) is strengthened by stays (t i i) calculated to
 stand the great deep-sea pressures ; and the air-chamber between the
 inside and outside casing renders the whole instrument buoyant, and is
 intended to take off all the strain from the line when being hauled up.

 dotted line    Bb Dd, showing the ebonite disk, gimbals, card, and magnet

 the periphery of the disk (««) are sixteen pieces of brass, insulated from
  one another by the ebonite, but placed in such close proximity to each
  other that the fibrous end of the platinum wire (pp) must always be in
  contact with the under surface of one of them.            Sixteen insulated wires
  enter the top of the instrument in the form of a cable, which divides into
  two parts (h h), eight wires on either side.
      These are conducted through two holes (h', h') in the ebonite disk (e e) to
  the lower part of the instrument, where they pass through a second hole
  in the centre of the concave bottom of the compass-chamber e" e", which
  renders the compartment e'eee" watertight, and to the underside of
  which the thermometer to be afterwards described is attached.                   The
  ends of the wires are finally connected to the sixteen terminals on the
  back of the thermometer.        Before, however, passing through the holes
  (h\ h') short leading-wires are soldered to each and connected to the upper
  surfaces of the sixteen brass contacts on the ebonite disk (« e).             These
  contacts pass through the disk and project a little beyond its lower sur
  face, where they are grooved as in fig. 1, oo, in order to prevent the end
   of the platinum wire pp, which is so adjusted as to pass immediately
  under the centre of the groove, from trespassing beyond the line of con
   tacts, through any unsteadiness of the instrument.           These brass contacts
   are amalgamated on the under surface to render the contact more
   decided ; and the top of the platinum wire pp must be so fine and
   flexible as to reduce the friction to a minimum, while at the same time it
   ensures perfect contact.     A   stuffing-box,   »' s, with hemp and wax pre-

vents the leakage of sea-water through the hole by which the wires enter
the top of the instrument ; and the compartment e C « is filled with
melted paraffin wax, which consolidates and effectually insulates the wires
and contacts from one another, should any moisture find its way in.
    The registering-instrument (diag. 2. fig. 3) is exceedingly simple and
greatly resembles the dial-plate of Breguet's         electro-magnetic     dial
instrument.
    Around the circumference of this dial-plate are sixteen brass contacts,
passing through an ebonite disk ; and to the under surface of each contact
is soldered one of the sixteen wires which form the core of the cable,
whose other ends are soldered to the upper surfaces of the contacts on
the disk (« «), as before mentioned.
    Concentric with these metallic contacts are two circles, one on either
side. In the outer circle are the rhumbs and semi-rhumbs of the wind,
and in the inner circle are the degrees (Celsius) corresponding to those
marked in the diagram of the thermometer, this dial-plate being capable
of registering the results of both instruments.
    I J is a metallic lever capable of being moved round the dial by an
ebonite handle N, and the axis x of this lever is in connexion, through
the galvanometer g' g, with one pole of the battery C, the other pole Z
 being put to earth, E'.
    In the centre of each brass contact is an indentation for dropping the
lever into ; and when not in use the handle can be turned back on to itself,
 by means of a hinge (n n) in the centre, and thus break the circuit.
    The different parts of the instrument having now been explained,          I
 shall proceed to describe the manner in which it is intended to take an
 observation.
    After attaching weights sufficiently     heavy to carry the instrument
 steadily down in an upright position to the detaching-instrument        (diag.
 1. fig. 3), paying out is commenced;       and under the influence of the
 vane E, the instrument takes up a position in the direction       of the cur
 rent, varying in direction as the currents vary.    Whenever    it is desired
 to take a reading, the lowering is stopped, and the instrument in mid
 ocean will be pointing in the direction of the current, while the magnet
 (mm) is pointing steadily to the north.
    Tn order to understand the arrangement of the sixteen leading wires,
 let us suppose the instrument to be influenced by a current from the
 north ; the direction then of the vane and magnet will coincide (diag. 2.
 fig. 1), and the platinum contact pp (diag. 1. fig. 1), attached to the cop
 per wire w w, and which is always at right angles to the magnet m m,
 will be rubbing against the under surface of the contact pointing due
 west    (W.).   If, then, one of the sixteen wires in connexion with the
 upper    surface   of this contact be soldered to the under surface of the
 contact on the registering dial-plate marked N (diag. II. fig. 3), when
 lever 11 is moved slowly over this contact, on the upper surface of the

1876.]             Currents and Temperature in the Ocean.                   327
dial-plate,   a  current will circulate from the battery C, through galva
nometer    <f g' (the needle of which
                                       is deflected), axis of lever x, lever 1 1,
contact N, leading-wire to the contact against the underside of which
the platinum wire is pressing, and through it and the pivots of the
gimbals to earth E', and back to the battery-pole Z, which must also be
put to earth. It is clear that by calling this contact of the dial-plate
north, and soldering the other fifteen wires in order to the under sur
faces of the remaining contacts (as in diag. 2. fig. 3), with their other
ends attached to the corresponding contacts around the periphery of the
ebonite disk (e e) in the instrument below, in order to find the direction
of any other current than a northerly one, the handle has only to be
 moved round the dial until the galvanometer-needle is seen to deflect ;
and when this is the case, the lever will be pressing against the contact
 whose letter represents the direction of the current which was required
 to be found. This reading having been duly registered, the instrument
 is lowered some 100 fathoms or more ; and after waiting for a few
 minutes for the instrument to settle down in the direction of the cur
 rent, the handle of the dial-plate is again turned round on board, in
 either direction, over the contacts until the galvanometer-needle again
 deflects, showing that an electric current passes ; and after registering
 the direction of this current also, the instrument may be lowered to
 greater depths, and readings taken at any points between the surface and
 the bottom of the sea.       On reaching the bottom the weights detach
 themselves by means of the apparatus (diag. 1. fig. 3) invented by Mr.
 Edward Hill, and the instrument (whose weight has been previously ad
 justed to enable it to float, when there is no sinker attached, and remain
 in an upright position) offers little weight or strain to the cable when
  being hauled up.      The detaching-apparatus made use of is one designed
  by Mr. Edward Hill expressly for detaching weights ; and after many
  trials this method has been found to be exceedingly sure and trust
  worthy. So long as the sinker is in mid ocean, the ring r' r' remains
  tightly hooked on to the apparatus (fig. 3) ; but directly the sinker rests
  on the bottom and the strain is taken off, the ring r' r falls, and the
  form of the apparatus effectually prevents the ring r r' from rehooking
  the sinker when the instrument is raised ; instead of which it slides up
  the curved surface (cf. fig.) and becomes completely detached.         The de
  taching-apparatus is left at the bottom, after each series of observations,
  with the sinker ; but as this can be made exceedingly cheaply, the loss is
  very trivial.
      The cable containing the core of sixteen insulated wires must be
  strengthened by strands of steel wire ; and it would be well to make the
  cable with a larger section at the top, and to taper gradually towards the
  end attached to the instrument below.
      The strands of steel wire are intended to be finally attached to the
   rings in the eye-bolts uu, and thus take all the strain off the wires
   forming the core.

 internal adjustments have been looked to. The instrument must be
 made smaller should experience prove the present size too bulky ; it will,
 however,   be necessary to have a sufficiently long compass-needle to
 enable it to overcome the resistance due to the friction of the end of the

           is   a
plan, the section representing the part xyz, and being made through
the centre of the wheel, as shown by the dotted line.
   One half only of this wheel (x iv z) is exposed to the free action of the
water at once (cf. fig. 2). The wheel revolves on its axis (W W), which
is carefully pivoted on jewels in the small brass cups, cc, fixed on the
centres of the disks (d d, B D).
   The upper end of this axis carries a soft armature (a a), which rotates
 with the wheel immediately under the poles of a large horseshoe magnet
(m m).   Around the poles of the magnet are two bobbins of insulated
wire {b b), wound in opposite directions, and in connexion with them are
the two leading- wires, one of which is put to earth, and the other passes
up the core of the cable to the registering-instrument on board.       Be
tween the poles of the magnet and the armature (a a) is a disk of ebonite
or boxwood or other non-conductor (B D), strengthened round the edge
by a rim of brass, and sufficiently thick to prevent its warping, which is
intended to render the compartme .t (B C D) water-tight and protect the
magnet and coils.
  The reason for not employing a sheet of copper or other metal is to
avoid the magnetism of rotation discovered by Arago, or the reaction of
currents  induced in the copper plate by the armature revolving, as ex
plained by  Faraday ; this reaction, though probably small and insignificant,
is better eliminated, as the tendency is to improve the motion of the
armature.    The wooden disk (d' d') keeps the magnet firmly in its right
place, and a stuffing-box        prevents sea-water from entering the com

When it is required to make an observation, a sinker is put on to the
detaching-apparatus, and the instrument lowered to the required depth,
where it remains steadily in a perpendicular position in the direction of
the current, and the wheel commences to rotate, more quickly or slowly
according to the velocity of the current influencing            it,

   Instead of only two poles, as in the diagram, four poles may be used,
the principle being the same as adopted by Sir Charles Wheatstone in
his extremely beautiful ABC instrument, in order to get rid of the hob
bling motion peculiar to other magneto-electric       machines.     By this
arrangement the stronger current induced in the coils as the       armature
passes off one pole, compensates for the weaker induced current which
circulates through the coils when the armature approaches the other
pole, and thus makes the reverse currents much more regular.          The
coils must be wound so that the currents circulate in the same direction.
If  this method    adopted there will be four reverse currents for every
                       is
revolution of the armature instead of two, as before mentioned, and the
number indicated on the counter            will have to   be divided   by two.

we obtain by differentiation with respect to each of the n+r variables
n + r equations, together with the original equation n+r+1 equations,
from which, eliminating the r+1 constants, we have a system of n non
linear partial differential equations.
   Conversely, given a system of n non-linear partial differential equations
with n+r independent variables, if there exists an equation

  Starting with such a system of partial differential equations, it is in
the present paper proposed to determine the conditions which must be
satisfied in order that the system may admit of a complete primitive, and
also to examine what kind of solution, if any, exists when the conditions
above referred to are not satisfied.
  The late Professor Boole has given an elegant method of treating a
system of linear partial differential equations of the first order ; but am                              I
not aware that any one has considered the case of a non-linear system.
  Let us begin with the case in which the dependent variable z is not
explicitly involved in the proposed system, which can therefore be pre
sented in the form

   I   have divided my subject into three parts, namely, I. The Structure,
II.   The Innervation, 111. The Development of the Organ of Corti, con
cluding with a few remarks on its function, the mode of preparation
employed, and the nature of the animals examined.
              Part  I. — The Structure of the Ohgas of Corti.
   This apparatus, the essential portion of the cochlea, is situated partly
on the lower lip of the limbus, or terminal portion of the bony lamina
spiralis, and partly on the membrana basilaris ; on either side it is
bounded by epithelial cells, being itself developed from epithelium, as will
be shown hereafter.
    It  consists of the following parts  : —
                        (1) The rods or fibres of Corti.
                        (2) The ciliated or hair-cells.
                        (3) Certain nuclear cells.
                        (4) The supporting cells.
                        (5) The membrana reticularis.
                        (6) The membrana tectoria.
    (1) The Rods of Corti are arranged in two rows, an inner and an outer,
with their upper extremities in close contact, but separated by a consi
derable interval below ; so that the two rows, sloping towards each other,
form the roof of a triangular tunnel.
    The rods stand almost in the centre of the organ, the foot of the inner
rod standing on the lower lip of the limbus, and that of the outer on the
membrana basilaris.        On either side of the rods are situated the various
cells ; above and closely adherent to them is the membrana reticularis,
and above this again lies the thick membrana tectoria.
    The form of the rods is similar to that of a long bone, consisting of a
cylindrical shaft with two enlarged extremities.         The lower of these is
conical in both the outer and inner rods, but their upper extremities or
heads differ considerably in form.       The head of the inner rod is somewhat
cuboid in form, compressed laterally ; and at its upper part it iB prolonged
into a long slender process, which overlaps and covers the head of the
 outer rod, this process being a direct prolongation of the upper surface.
 The outer surface of this rod-head presents a concavity for articulation

 with the outer rod    ; and below the concavity is a little tubercle, from which
 point   the head  tapers off to the shaft.     The inner surface is continuous
 with the shaft below, and forms a distinct angle with the upper surface.
 The sides are marked by a raised curved ridge.
     The head of the outer rod is more rounded, and fits into the concavity
 of the inner-rod head already mentioned.          From its upper part also pro
 ceeds outwards a process which is more slender than that of the inner-
 rod head, and passes further outwards.
                                                    I
     The length of these rods is graduated (as pointed out in my former
 paper), and ranges from yj^; inch (or -17 millim.)at the apex of the spiral
 to       (or -05 millim.) at its base, where the two rods are of equal length ;
 but proceeding upwards the outer increase in length much more rapidly
 than the inner, so that at the apex the former are twice the length of the
 latter.
     The number of the rods in each row is not the same, there being three
 of the inner for every two of the outer. According to a careful calcula
 tion of mine, there are about 5250 inner and 3500 outer rods in each
 human cochlea.      In    substance they resemble delicate hyaline cartilage,
 show a tendency to split into fibres, and contain no nuclei.
     (2) The Hair-cells are very delicate, columnar in form, with large round
 nuclei and nucleoli    ; the rest of their contents is finely granular.      Their
 summit is flat, and from     it project a row of four bristles or cilia ; the rows
 of bristles run in the direction of the spiral.
     There are four rows of these hair-cells, one situated internal to the rods,
 and the other three to their outer side.
     The lower ends of the outer hair-cells are evenly rounded off, and both
in man and in the monkey this end is enlarged, giving the cell a flask-
shape ; the lower end of the inner hair-cells tapers off, and the whole cell
is somewhat larger than the outer ones.          The summits of all these cells
are attached to the membrana reticularis, and their bristles project through
the circular meshes of that membrane.
    (3) The Nuclear Cells, which include those of Claudius, Deiters, and
the granular layer of Waldeyer, besides some others scattered about.
    These cells have very distinct nuclei with small nucleoli, and are sur
rounded by some protoplasm, but have no cell-wall ; they are all connected
with nerve-filaments.
    These are found: — 1st, on the lower lip of the sulcus internal to the
rods, in a mass of three irregular layers (this group has been termed
the granular layer by Waldeyer). 2ndly, below the level of the outer hair-
cells, and corresponding to them, are found three or four rows of these
nuclear cells, which usually go by the name of the cells of Deiters.          3rdly,
there is one of these cells found in each lower angle of the triangular
tunnel formed by the sloping rods.         Lastly, there are one or two scattered
about, which will be considered with the nerves.
    (4) TheSupportiny Cells of Uensen form the outer boundary of the organ ;
                                                                  2d    2

348                          Dr. U. Pritchard on the                     [Mar.   2,
they consist of several oval or columnar cells, which gradually merge into
the epithelial cells ; they form, in fact, the link between the hair-cells and
the epithelium.
   One or two similar cells, but with ill-defined outlines, are found forming
the inner boundary of the organ ; these       I
                                          would term the inner support
ing  cells.
   (5) The Membrana Reticularis is one of the most peculiar structures in
the cochlea, and has never been satisfactorily described.   It consists of a
fibrous network which covers the hair-cells and rods, and is firmly attached
to them.    On either side it grows finer and finer, until lost among the
epithelial cells.   The reticulate form of this membrane is only seen when
viewed from     above ; to the inner side of the rods there is only one row
of regular circular meshes, through which the bristles of the inner hair-
cells project.    Over the rods and their processes the membrane passes in
the form of long meshes, and in the region of the outer hair-cells it pre
sents a very peculiar aspect.      Here there are two forms of meshes —the
one elongated, called a phalanx, the other circular, called an annulus, so
arranged that each phalanx is surrounded by four annuli.          Through the
annuli project the bristles of the outer hair-cells.
   Connected with this reticulate membrane, and, in my opinion, belonging
to it, are found three rows of fibrous cords, situated on the outer side of
each row of outer hair-cells.     These cords, or trabeculaa, pass downwards
to the membrana basilaris, to which      they are loosely attached by an en
larged extremity.       The trabecule have been described by other authors as
belonging to the hair-cells   and Waldeyer figures them, together with the
                              ;
hair-cells and cells of Deiters, as forming so many twin cells. My obser
vations totally discountenance    these views, as in the upper part of the
cochlea these three structures are seen to be quite separate, and again in
the human foetus the two cells are very far apart.

ception existed even down to the last few years as to the form and struc
ture of this membrane.   It was regarded as an elastic membrane of equal
thickness   stretched  straight across from the upper lip of the sulcus
internus to the corresponding projection of the ligamentum spirale nor     ;
has   ityet been properly described.      quite agree with later writers in

portion of  a  layer which lines the whole ductus cochleae, and which          I
have traced right round.
   The thickened portion forming the membrana tectoria commences at
the attachment of the membrane of Eeissner to the limbus, and passes
over the teeth of the limbus as    layer of equal thickness
                                      a                       then passing

dually tapers off to the thin general layer, which, as already stated, lines
the rest of the ductus cochleae.

       The bristles of the hair-cells penetrate into this membrane, which itself
   is analogous to the otolith mass of the vestibule.
       The organ of Corti is not found at the two extremities of the lamina
   spiralis.
      The whole organ increases regularly in breadth from base to apex of
   the spiral, measuring in the cat ^J-^ inch near the base, and y^ inch near
   the apex.
      The height, taken at the rod-heads, varies very little ; but in the region
   of the outer hair-cells it again regularly increases from base to apex.
      The component parts are further separated from each other on pro
  ceeding up the spiral.       The rods, as already stated, increase in length,
  the heads widen, and the processes elongate.           The hair-cells increase in
  height    and   breadth, and, lastly, the cilia or bristles themselves regularly
  elongate from base to apex of the cochlea.
      In man and monkeys (but, curiously enough, in no other animals) a
  further change takes place ; the number of the outer hair-cells increases
  from three to four, and at the apex to five rows.
     These observations of mine are original, except as regards the increase in
  the organ as a whole.
               Part  II. — The  Innervation of the Obgan of Cobti.
     The cochlear nerve in the substance of the modiolus, in passing upwards,
 gives off branches at right angles, which traverse a spiral ganglionic mass,
 the ganglion spirale, and then enter the lamina spiralis.            This ganglion
 is situated in the lamina at the base, and gradually becoming more central
 in position, is found entirely in the modiolus at the apex ; its cells are
 bipolar fusiform, averaging l Joa of an inch in man and most mammals, but
 are much larger in the porpoise, averaging -g^ inch. The nerve-fibres run
 in bundles, which form a plexus, to the end of the lower lip of the limbus,
 where they perforate its upper surface, and, losing their dark borders,
 reach the organ of Corti.           The filaments are now divided into two
 groups   —   an inner, passing to the parts internal to the rods, and an outer,
 passing     to the opposite side of those bodies. The inner principally enter
and appear to terminate in the adjacent mass of nuclear cells (the granular
layer of Waldeyer) ; one large filament, passing through one of the nuclear
cells, goes to the inner hair-cell and enters its lower extremity.             The
outer group may be divided into three sets,          which   all pass  between  the
rods and traverse the triangular tunnel.          The upper filament passes along
the roof of the tunnel, and on reaching the other side of the outer rod
traverses a nuclear cell, and then passes on to the first of the outer hair-
cells.     The middle filament traverses the centre of the tunnel and enters
the same nuclear cell, besides sending a branch downwards to another of
the nuclear cells.        The third or lower filament runs along the floor of the
tunnel, being connected with the two nuclear cells in the lower angles of

it;   on the outer side of the rods this filament enters the nuclear cell,
which has received the descending branch from the middle filament ; and
this cell, again, is connected with the first cell of Deiters by another filament.
Filaments in the form of festoons connect the hair-cells with each other,
and analogous nervous connexions are found between the cells of Deiters.
Besides these     I have found numerous     detached filaments, so arranged as
to give the appearance of a plexus throughout the outer part of the organ.
     This arrangement of the outer group of nerve-filaments has not been
demonstrated      before  ;  up to the   present time      it is only the middle
 filament that has been described.
           Part  III. — The   Development     of the Organ of Cokti.
     The organ of Corti is developed from certain of the epithelial cells lining
 the ductus coehlese, which at first consist of a single layer of cuboid cells ;
 later on, those cells which line the floor and sides of the canal elongate
 into the columnar form, while those lining the inner part of the floor
 become longer still, and their nuclei multiply two, three, and fourfold.
 On the outer side of these are five cells, from which the chief part of the
 organ is developed ; these     I term the five primary cells.
     The limbus is next developed and the sulcus formed, the latter being
 completely filled up by the tall columnar cells with proliferated nuclei ;
 these, however, dwindle down again as age advances.
     The contents of the first or innermost        of the five primary cells are
 divided into two transversely, the upper division forming the inner hair-
 cell, the lower a nuclear cell.     The same change takes place in the third,
 fourth, and fifth primary cells, their upper division forming the outer hair-
 cells, and the lower the cells of Deiters.        The rods are developed from
 the second primary cell, which does not divide transversely, but widens at
 its base so as to form a triangular cell, the inner and outer sides of which
 thicken and form the rudimentary inner and outer rods.            As this widen
 ing increases, the protoplasm disappears from the centre, forming the tri
 angular tunnel, and the nucleus divides into two, one for each of the lower
 angles of the tunnel. The rods enlarge at their upper and lower extremi
 ties, but do not attain their perfect form until after birth ; at this period
 the angle of the inner-rod head has not been developed, besides which the
 shafts are much thicker and more clumsy in form than in adult life.
     The membrana reticularis is developed from the free border of the five
 primary cells and a few of the other adjacent tall ones, but the exact
 manner in which the reticulation is formed has not been made out.
     The trabecule are, like the rods, developed from the side of primary
 cells ; and although only three (on the outer side of the rods) persist in
 adult life, yet at birth numerous fine trabecular are found to the inner side
 of the rods.
     I regard  the membrana tectoria as a secretion from part of the general
  epithelial layer ; it first appears as a thick but even layer, and as age ad

 1876.]                     Organ of Corti in Mammals.                        351
varices  that portion which covers the organ increases considerably in thick
 ness.
   From the foregoing observations it will     be seen that the rods, membrana
reticularis,   and trabecule are developed from the walls of the original
epithelial   cells,  whereas the hair- and various other cells are formed from
their contents ; and, lastly, that the membrana tectoria is a secretion from
the same original epithelium.
                         The Function of  the Organ of Corti.
   It is  generally assumed that this part of the labyrinth is concerned in
appreciating the pitch and quality of sounds ; and there are two prevalent
theories to account for the manner in which this is accomplished.            The
first, Helmholtz's, assumes that each of the rods of Corti, which are not of
                                                         I
uniform dimensions but graduated in length, as clearly demonstrated
in 1871, vibrates in unison with a certain note, when produced in the
outer wall, and in vibrating affects certain nerve-filaments, which carry off
 the impression to the brain.
    The second theory regards these rods as mere supports, and assumes the
 hair-cells to be the only essential structures.
    The only objection of importance to Helmholtz's theory is the fact that
 there are no rods in the cochlea of birds.
    As regards the second theory it is very incomplete, as it does not by
itself explain the appreciation of the variations in pitch and quality.        To
 make up for this deficiency, however, some further mechanical theories
 have been suggested.
    Hensen was of opinion that the membrana basilaris, whose breadth is
also graduated, acts as the mechanical appreciator, whereas Hasse believed
that office to   be performed by the membrana tectoria.       Both of these ideas
are not only very unsatisfactory but obviously fallacious, when the posi
tion and structure of these membranes are considered.
    For my own part        I  prefer adhering to Helmholtz's view, with the
modification that the rods are concerned only indirectly, and that their
vibrations affect the hair-cells connected with them, so as to cause an im
pression to be transmitted through the nerve-filament to the brain.             I
consider it highly probable that the graduation in the length of the bristles
alone may account for the appreciation of the variations to a considerable
extent ; but     I  cannot believe for one instant that the rods and rest of the
organ are so beautifully graduated for no special purpose.
    The membrana tectoria is undoubtedly analogous to the otolith           mass
of the vestibule ; and     I agree  with "Waldeyer in regarding it  as a damper
to the vibrations.
    The method of preparation usually employed was as follows : —
   The cochlea were always quite fresh.
   They were hardened in a -J-per-cent. solution of chromic acid in ordi
nary methylated spirit      ; ten days required.

 found a striking similarity in the organ of Corti of all these animals.
     Unfortunately all my efforts to procure the cochlea of a monotreme
have      as yet proved    unsuccessful, a circumstance much to be regretted,
 as    I  fully anticipate that it presents some appearances which link the
 very dissimilar cochleae of mammals and birds.
 II.     "Preliminary Note on the Compound                 Nature of the Line-
          Spectra Of Elementary Bodies."            By  J.  N. Lockyer, F.R.S.
          Received January 20, 1876.
      In  a former communication     to the Royal Society (Proc. vol. xxii. p. 380,
  1874)     I  referred briefly  to the possibility that the well-known line-
  spectra of the elementary bodies might not result from the vibration of
  similar molecules ; and     I  was led to make the remark in consequence of
 the differences in the spectra of certain elements as observed in the spec
  trum of the sun and in those obtained with the ordinary instrumental
  appliances.
      I  have now clear evidence that the molecular grouping of calcium which,
  with a small induction-coil and small jar, gives a spectrum with its chief
  line in the blue, is nearly broken up in the sun, and quite broken up in
  the discharge from a large coil and jar, into another or others with lines
  in the violet.
      I say " another " or " others,"      because  I have not yet been able to
  determine whether       the last-named lines proceed from the same or dif
  ferent molecules ; and     it is possible we may have to wait for photographs
  of the spectrum of the brighter stars before this point can be determined.
       This result enables us to fix with very considerable accuracy the electric
  dissociating conditions which are equivalent to that degree of dissociation
  at present at work in the sun.
       I beg  permission to append the following Letter from Prof. Stokes and
  my reply      : —

         When        a solid body such as a platinum      wire, traversed   by a voltaic cur
    rent, is heated to incandescence, we know that as the temperature increases,
    not only does the radiation of each particular refrangibility absolutely
    increase, but the proportion of the radiations of the different refrangibili-
    ties is changed, the proportion of the higher to the lower increasing with
    the temperature.    It would be in accordance with analogy to suppose
    that       rule the same would take place in an incandescent surface,
             as a
    though in this case the spectrum would be discontinuous instead of con
    tinuous.   Thus if A, B, C, D, E denote conspicuous bright lines, of in
    creasing refrangibility, in the spectrum of the vapour, it might very well
'   be that at a comparatively low temperature A should be the brightest and
    the most persistent ; at a higher temperature, while all were brighter than
    before, the relative brightness might be changed, and C might be the
    brightest and the most persistent, and at a still higher temperature E.
    If, now, the quantity of persistence were in each case reduced till all lines
    but one disappeared, the outstanding line might be A at the lowest tem
    perature, C at the higher, E at the highest.    If so, in case the vapour
     showed its presence by absorption but not emission, it follows, from the
    correspondence between absorption and emission, that at one temperature
    the dark line which would be the most sensitive indication of the presence
    of the substance would be A, at another C, at a third E.                 Hence, while      I
    regard the facts you mention as evidence of the high temperature of the
    sun,     I
           do not regard them as conclusive evidence of the dissociation of the
    molecule of calcium.

         Dear Professor Stokes, — I was not prepared for your suggestion,                   as
    it was the abnormal and not the normal behaviour of Ca which led me
    to investigate it.

    at the Ca level is red, while in the coronal atmosphere it is green ; ». «.

           By W. Galloway. Communicated by Professor Frankland,

                                                              considerably                 is
higher than the mean annual temperature at the surface, there      usually                       is
a layer of rubbish on the floor of the roadways and air-ways, which con
sists, in some places, almost entirely of dry coal-dust, and in others of
coal-dust mixed with small pieces of coal and stone.
    If could be shown, therefore, that mixture of air and coal-dust
          it                                                    a                                      is
inflammable at ordinary pressure and temperature, there would be no
difficulty in accounting for the extent and violence of many explosions
which have occurred in mines in which no large accumulations of fire
damp were known to exist       for     ;  only necessary to suppose that
                                                     it   is                                           a
sudden gust of wind (originated, for example, by the explosion of     small                       a
accumulation of firedamp) had swept through the adjoining galleries,
raising    cloud of dust into the air, and then all the other phenomena
             a
would follow in regular order.     The flame of the originally inflammable
mixture would pass directly into the newly formed one, expanding its
volume; the disturbance would be propagated over an ever -widening
area, until that area might possibly become coextensive with the work
ings themselves and the consequences would be the same as
                             ;                                    the whole                 if
space had been filled with an inflammable mixture before the disturbance
began.
  The accounts of colliery explosions published in this country hardly
ever allude to the existence of coal-dust and when they do so, in one or
                                                                ;

notes referring to           it,
                         together with     paper by M. Vital, Ingenieur des

produced       an explosion in the Campagnac colliery on the 2nd of No
               by
vember, 1874.      A shot, which blew out the tamping, was fired in one of
the working-places, in       seam of bituminous coal, and was accompanied
                                   a
by an explosion which burnt three men so seriously that they died within
a week.     No firedamp had been detected in this place at any time but                           ;
as the floor was covered with very fine, dry coal-dust, and as the shot was
fired at the bottom of the face, and would consequently raise        cloud of               a
dust,     was concluded that nothing but the instantaneous combustion of
         it
coal-dust, under the influence of the shot, could account for the accident.
    The writer then describes the nature of the coal-dust, both in regard
to the size of the particles and their chemical composition   and afterwards  ;
he gives an account of some experiments conducted           him in the Eodez
                                                                         by

may of itself alone give rise to disasters;     in workings in. which firedamp
exists   it   increases the chances of explosion and when, an accident of this

                        it
I    had carefully thought over this subject for considerable time before

I had seen M. Vital's paper, and had come to       conclusion somewhat
                                                                  a
different from his.    It was this that air mixed with certain propor
                                        :
tions of firedamp and dry coal-dust would be explosive at ordinary pres
sure and temperature, although the presence of the same proportion of
one of the combustible ingredients, or the other, alone, might be insuffi
cient to confer         this property on the mixture.          I       derived this opinion
increasing gradually to certain distance as we neared the place of ignition.
                             a                                                  This
deposit was, in some parts, half an inch, and in others almost an inch thick;    ad               it
hered together in a friable coked state ;when eiamined with the glass  presented the   it
fused round form of burnt coal-dust, and when examined chemically, and compared
with the coal itself reduced to powder, was found deprived of the greater portion of
the   bitumen, and in some cases entirely destitute of it.             There      is   every reason    to
believe that much coal-gas was made from this dust       in   the very    air itself of         the mine
by the flame  of the firedamp, which raised and swept       along it          ;   and much of the
carbon of this dust remained unburnt only for want of air."

 356                 Mr. W. Galloway      on the Influence               [Mar. 2,
  mmediately from the consideration        that, without doubt, combustible
  gases can supplant each other in certain equivalent proportions           in mix
 tures which will just ignite at given temperatures,     and   that  finely divided
 combustible solids have probably the same property to some extent.
     Accordingly, when an opportunity occurred on the 3rd of July last,           I
 made experiments to test the correctness of these views.           An apparatus
 for testing safety-lamps in an explosive current had been erected for my
 use at Llwynypia Colliery, in the Ehondda valley, through the kindness
 of Mr. A. Hood, the Managing Director, and Mr. W. G. McMurtrie, the
 Manager of the Glamorgan Coal Company's Collieries ; and by having it
 altered slightly, I was able to employ it also in making experiments with
 coal-dust.    This apparatus, of .which fig.  1 is a vertical   section, consists
                   ^¦¦¦—

of   a horizontal  wooden box or pipe, 18 ft. 9 in. long, by 12 in. deep, by
 6 in. wide inside; it was connected with the covered top of the upcast
shaft by means of a vertical box of the same dimensions as itself in cross
 section, and 4 feet long.   A and F are sliding valves for regulating _ or
shutting off the air-current; B is   a glass  window, and b a small door on
the top of the box; D a wooden pipe 4 in. square inside, by 2 ft. long;
C a hopper for letting the coal-dust into the apparatus, and c an iron
pipe 2 inches in diameter, closed at the top by a wooden plug which
projected above the top of the hopper; lastly, E is a malleable iron pipe,
which conducted firedamp from a closed space underground, in which
there is a strong blower.
    The valve at F having been closed, and that at     A  opened somewhat, a
current of air passed up through D into the apparatus, and, flowing past
B, escaped into the upcast, which is connected with an exhausting-fan.
A naked light was then placed inside the apparatus at B, opposite the
window ; the hopper was filled with coal-dust and the plug withdrawn
to a short distance above the top of c, and moved about gently.                The
coal-dust falling through c into the upper end of D was winnowed by the
air-current; the larger particles fell down through D on to the ground
below, and the fine dust, with which the whole air-current was charged,

passed over the naked flame at B, and thence into the upcast.            The
flame of the naked light seemed to lengthen somewhat under these cir
cumstances ; but on no occasion did the mixture take fire, or show any
symptoms which led me to suppose it might possibly do so.          I repeated
this experiment many times, both with steam-coal dust and with the
finest and driest dust of the No. 3 Bhondda seam, which is an excellent
coking coal, and invariably obtained the same result. The air was charged
at different   times with every proportion of dust, from a thin, scarcely
visible cloud to one which extinguished the flame of the lamp.
    The following analyses of the two kinds of coal-dust employed in these
experiments have been kindly made by Dr. Frankland : —

    In some of the experiments with coal-dust and air alone, the dust of
 the bituminous coal was carefully dried and sifted through muslin before
 being used.
    The results of these experiments, and of others which       I have   made
 since, seem to indicate very conclusively that a mixture of   air and coal-
 dust is not inflammable at ordinary pressure and temperature.
    When, however, a small quantity of firedamp was allowed to pass into
 the apparatus at E, the valve F being partly opened to determine an air-
 current from E towards B, the mixture of air, firedamp, and coal-dust
 was found to be somewhat explosive.
    This experiment was conducted in the following way : — A safety-lamp
 was placed in the apparatus at B, and the quantity of firedamp was regu
 lated until the flame of the safety-lamp showed no indication of its pre
 sence.   The safety-lamp was then removed and replaced by a naked
 light, and coal-dust was admitted at C. The effect was instantaneous;
 for, as soon as the cloud of coal-dust touched the flame, an explosion took
 place, and the box was filled with a red flame, which continued to burn
 until the supply of coal-dust was cut off or the air-valves closed. The
 naked light inside the apparatus was raised up to the top by means of a
 wire, just before the coal-dust was admitted, in order to ascertain that
 there was not an explosive mixture of gas and air at that point.
    I have extracted the following analysis of the firedamp employed in
 this and all the experiments that follow from a paper by Mr. J. W.

    Although I   was satisfied after this with the correctness of my hypo
thesis in regard to mixtures of air, firedamp, and coal-dust,       I could not
consider this form of the experiment to be quite satisfactory ; for it was
always possible that the coal-dust, in falling through the branch D, might
diminish the quantity of air sufficiently to enable it to form an explosive
mixture with the constant quantity of gas entering the apparatus.
    On the 4th of December last a serious explosion occurred in New Tre
degar Colliery, and on the 6th two others followed, in Swaithe and Llan
Collieries.  I  made an official investigation into the circumstances attend
ing the explosion in the last-mentioned colliery, and was fortunate enough
to be able to visit the workings within two and a half hours after its
occurrence, when the ventilation was only partially restored.           At that
time the air in all the unventilated parts of the workings near the level
in which the explosion had taken place (as far as they could be explored
with safety) was so charged with coal-smoke, soot, and other products of
the imperfect combustion of coal, that it was difficult to distinguish
objects two or three feet distant.
                                                                I
    During this and subsequent visits to these workings, ascertained that
the floor of the level already referred to was covered with a layer
of dry coal-dust, mixed with small pieces of coal and stone, throughout
its entire length (130 yards); that for about 50 yards next its inner end
the ventilation of the level itself, and of the working-places branching
 from it,  depended almost,  if  not altogether, on convection-current and
                                                    a
diffusion; and that firedamp was given off occasionally    bythe coal and strata
at the face of the level, and in two other places 50 or 60 yards further
 out, in sufficient quantity to form small explosive accumulations.             It
was asserted, moreover, that no accumulation of explosive gas was known
to'exist anywhere in, or near, this part of the workings an hour before the
accident; and as there were naked lights in each of the working-places,
an explosive accumulation which might be formed in one of them could
not find its way into any of the others without passing one of these
lights and being ignited by it. It was impossible, therefore, that    large
                                                                          a
accumulation of gas could have been formed within the hour which pre
ceded the explosion.
   On the other hand, there were traces of coked coal-dust on the timbers,

extending over a distance of 322 yards of the workings, pointing to the
presence of a large body of inflammable matter ; and yet the amount of
damage done was insignificant.         The traces on the props undoubtedly
indicated the  direction   in which   the  air was travelling when the coked
coal-dust   was deposited; and       I  could not satisfactorily reconcile the
various directions   indicated in  this  way, except on the supposition that
the inner end of the level (0, fig. 2) had been the origin of the explosion;
that in the level itself and in the two places (O1, O") branching from it to
the dip (the only branches in which the traces were distinct), the coke
was deposited during the retrograde movement of the air ; and that in the
places leading from the outer end of the level (O'") it was deposited
during its outward movement.
    If we supposed, for example, that all the coke had been deposited while
the air was moving away from the origin of explosion, it would be neces
sary to assume three distinct origins, one in each of the dip places at
points where no gas could possibly accumulate (0', 0"), and one at the
outer end of the level (0'"), where there was no cavity in the roof, and
where the whole of the ventilation was passing.
    Every circumstance tended to show that some explosive gas had accu
mulated at the inner end of the level, where there was no ventilating cur
rent; that this gas had ignited at one of the naked lights, raising a cloud
of dust along the level by its explosion, and that there had been sufficient
firedamp in the air occupying the level to form a weak explosive mixture
when the coal-dust was added.
   There could be no doubt whatever          that the whole of the air in the
level contained   some  firedamp,   so that  it became a matter of importance
to ascertain the smallest quantity required to make air explosive when
coal-dust is added ; and with this object in view        I made further experi
ments on the 13th of December.
    The apparatus at Llwynypia       Colliery   w'as altered somewhat.   Fig. 3

 360                Mr. W. Galloway       on the Influence            [Mar. 2,
represents the new arrangement.        The same wooden box was employed ;
 but instead of connecting  it to the top of the upcast, a small blowing-
 fan (A) driven by a steam-turbine was joined to it at one end, and the
 other end was left open. B and D are windows ; C the hopper for coal-
 dust; and E one of two sluice-valves, which can be pushed into the box
 from each side until they meet in the middle, when they stop the air-
 current coming from the fan.
    The fan draws the air into two chambers, one above and the other
 below the blades ; from these chambers the air passes into the fan itself,
downwards and upwards through central openings, and is expelled into
the apparatus through a tangential pipe.
    The firedamp-pipe passes through one of the air-holes into the lower
chamber, and, being turned up at the end, terminates close to the blades.
    The whole of the firedamp coming from the blower is allowed to pass
 into the fan; and as there is always an inward draught through the
air-inlets, the whole of it passes into the apparatus thoroughly mixed
 with air.
    The qualitative experiment with this apparatus is made in the follow
ing way: — The fan having been set in motion, a current of air and fire
damp traverses the apparatus in the direction of the arrow.          A safety-
lamp is then placed in the box opposite       the  window (B), and the velo
city of the current is increased by opening the valves at E until the
 flame of the lamp gives no indication of the presence of the firedamp.
After this the safety-lamp is removed and two naked lights substituted,
one opposite each window; and coal-dust is supplied through the hopper.
As soon as the cloud of coal-dust reaches the flame at D, it takes fire,
and either explodes backwards against the current, or fills the box with
a red flame from D to the end, according to the amount of firedamp in
the mixture.      Meanwhile the lamp at B continues to burn exactly as
before, showing no indication of the presence of the firedamp.             This
experiment is quite conclusive.
    The quantitative experiment is slightly different.       A safety-lamp is
placed at B, and the valves at E are closed very gradually until the cur
rent becomes explosive ; the velocity is then measured at D by means of
a small    anemometer, observed through the window.             After this the
valves are opened   to any  desired   extent;  the  velocity of  the current is
again measured; the anemometer is removed, and a naked light sub
stituted for it at D, and coal-dust is admitted at C.
    On the 16th of December    I found that the current of air and firedamp
alone was just explosive   when   its velocity was 155 feet per minute; and
two other observations, made during the intervals between the experi
ments with coal-dust, gave respectively 156 and 153 feet. Again, on the
5th of January it became explosive at 150 feet per minute.              On the
former occasion the velocity was increased to 296, 331, 337, 440, 523,
and 543 feet per minute, and on the latter to 714, 808, 900, and 1060.

At the whole of these velocities the mixture became instantly inflam
mable when coal-dust was added to                it,
                                     and filled the apparatus from                         B

 Making   use of these  data, then,  to calculate  the  composition of the mix
 ture passing through the apparatus during the last of the second series
 of experiments, we find that the relative volumes of gas and air were
 9-375 and 140*625 at a velocity of 150 feet per minute; whereas they
 were 9-375 and 1050-625 at 1060 feet per minute, or                 firedamp to
                                                                             1

    In order to obtain reliable results from these experiments,          was ne  it
 cessary to have some means of ascertaining that the whole of the fire
 damp entered the apparatus at the low velocities, and that the fan exerted
no exhausting force on the gas-pipe in the opposite cases. For this
 purpose the 2-in. gas-pipe was terminated at distance of 16 inches from
                                                               a
 the fan, and the gas was conducted from this point to the centre of the
fan-chamber, through          -inch pipe fitted loosely into the former to a
                                a   If
 distance of about    foot;
                          a    very delicate means of observing the state of
                                    a
 the pressure in the gas-pipe was also provided by having a small hole
punched in      at
                it   distance of 15 feet from the fan, and keeping
                          a                                                jet of     a
gas continually burning at that point.
    When the velocity of the current was low, gas escaped through the
space between the two pipes, and discovered its presence when                light    a
was applied to it. It was then necessary to close some of the air-inlets
to the fan, either partially or wholly, until       flame held at the junction
                                                           a
of the gas-pipes was drawn inwards; at the same time the flame of
the jet 15 feet off had to be carefully observed, so that the closing of the
inlets might not be carried too far.     When the velocity was greatest, on
the other hand, all the air-inlets were opened           and although air was
                                                                   ;
drawn through the junction of the gas-pipes, the height of the flame of
the jet already referred to did not diminish to an appreciable extent.
    Having ascertained in the manner just described that when air con
tains only     very small quantity of firedamp (0-892 per cent, of its
               is a
volume)   it  capable of forming an inflammable mixture with coal-dust,

to say, until it has little or no yellow colour remaining), and observe
whether it has a
                    " cap " above it or not. The cap is a spindle-shaped or
conical blue flame, more transparent than, and appearing to rest upon,
the oil-flame; it seems to be due to the combustion of that part of the
mixture of firedamp and air which becomes heated to the temperature at
which its active constituents can combine.         It is known that when the
cap is large, there is much firedamp in the air; when it is small that
there is little ; and when there is no cap, it is almost, if not quite univer
sally assumed that there is no firedamp present.
   There is not, however, so far as     I know, any published information of
a definite  kind concerning the appearances presented by the cap in mix
tures of firedamp and air in different proportions ;          I have therefore
made   a few  experiments     in order to obtain   these data for the purposes
of this paper. The experiments were made on the 17th of January, in
the cabin near the bottom of the No. 3 Pit, Llwynypia Colliery. The
firedamp employed was from the same source as that with which the
coal-dust experiments were made, and was obtained from a pipe close to
the door of the cabin.      The apparatus consisted of a measuring-cylinder,
a mixing-cylinder, a lamp, a bucket for holding water, and some india-
rubber tubes.       The measuring-cylinder     (fig. 4) is 10 inches long by
2 inches   in diameter   ; it has a cock (a and b) in the middle at each end,
and a branch cock from each of these (c and d) ; it has also a water-
gauge a, opposite which there are marks and figures on the cylinder
showing the parts into which its volume can be divided.            The mixing

 cylinder (fig. 5) is 2 feet long by  8 inches in diameter ; it has a cock (e and /)
 at each end, a water-gauge         at the side, and a scale, each division of
 which represents one volume of the measuring-cylinder.             In the interior
 it is divided into three compartments by two diaphragms (g and A) ; these
 compartments communicate with each other through ten ^-inch holes
 (o o) in each diaphragm, ranged in a circle whose centre is the axis of
 the cylinder.    Fig. 6 represents the essential parts of the lamp appa
 ratus in section.     It consists of a wick-holder and an oil vessel, above
 which there is a chamber b, with a branch pipe (a) on one side and a
 circular opening (o o) on the top. This is surmounted by a glass chimney
 (d) covered on the top with a piece of tin-plate (c), in which there is a
 |-inch round hole (<f). The water-bucket is of the same capacity as the
 mixing-cylinder, and has a cock on one side at the bottom.             The india-
 rubber tubes are used for the purpose of connecting the cylinders with
 each other, with the water-bucket, &c.         Each cylinder can be filled with
 water or emptied, as may be required, by connecting the cock at its lower
end with the one in the water-bucket, and placing it below or above the
level of the water in that vessel after the cocks have been opened.
    Both cylinders are filled with water in the first place : the water in
the larger one is then allowed to flow out, the cock at its upper end
being open to the atmosphere, until it contains any desired number of
volumes of air, each volume equal to the capacity of the smaller cylinder.
    The cock at the top of the smaller cylinder is connected with the gas-
pipe   ; the branch cock   e  is opened, and firedamp allowed to pass through
it so as to expel the air from the india-rubbes tube ; the jet of gas is
ignited and kept burning, while the water is permitted to flow out at
b until the required volume of gas is obtained : all the cocks are then
closed.
    The two cylinders are now connected together at both top and bottom,
care being taken that the upper connecting-tube is filled with firedamp
and the lower one with water when the connexion is made ; the four
cocks are opened, and the small cylinder is so placed that its top is just
below the level of the water in the other.        The gas is thus quickly trans

the cylinders disconnected.
    With this apparatus the volumes of gas and air can be measured with
considerable accuracy and rapidity.
    The quantity of water remaining in the mixing-cylinder varied in the
differeut experiments from 60 to 300 cubic inches.         Accordingly, when
this cylinder was inverted, the water ran down through the holes in the
diaphragms into the lowest compartment, and a corresponding volume of
the gases was forced to take the opposite course ; aud I found that by
inverting it forty times in succession and pausing each time until the
sound of the running water had ceased, a comparatively perfect mixture
of the gases was obtained for each experiment.           The homogeneity of
the different    parts of these mixtures was attested by the fact that,
whereas the whole of the one composed of 1 volume of firedamp and 15
volumes of air was inflammable, none of the mixture of 1 firedamp to 16
air was so.
    The wick of the lamp (fig. 6) having been carefully trimmed, was
drawn down uutil the flame presented the appearance of a small blue
hemisphere, about £ inch high by     j inch diameter at the base, and having
a conical speck of yellow in the middle near the top ; the tube a was
then connected with the top of the mixiug-eylinder, and the mixture was
forced into the chamber    1 at the rate of about 2^ cubic inches per second.
All   other lights were removed from the cabin during this part of the
experiment, and the various phenomena were observed in what would
have been total darkness but for the feeble light of the lamp itself.
   The different mixtures employed consisted of      1 volume of firedamp to
14, 15, 16, 18, 20. 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 volumes of air.       The experi

   1 to 15 — inflammable : the flame of the mixture would not pass down
through the hole in the tin-plate cover of the chimney ; but when the
small flame, employed to ignite it, was put through the hole to a depth of
^ inch
        or so below the tin-plate cover, the mixture ignited, and a hori
zontal, waving sheet of blue flame, occupying the whole sectional area of
the chimney, passed down through it in about two or three seconds, and
was extinguished on reaching the bottom.

      1 to 60 — it was hardly possible to distinguish        any thing above the
 small oil-flame.       If there was any cap (which the manager of^the pit
 and two of the firemen who were present considered excessively doubt
 ful), it was represented by the frustum of a cone, of which the sides
 only were visible, little more than          inch high.
      The firemen, whose principal occupation is to examine the workings
  daily for any symptoms of firedamp, both asserted positively that they
  would consider an atmosphere in which the small oil-flame burned as            it
-did in this mixture to be perfectly free from gas.
      When the height of the oil-flame was increased to ^ inch it became
  luminous, and then the cap was invisible in all the mixtures consisting of
  1 volume of gas to 25 volumes and upwards of air.           Similarly, the cap is
  invisible in all mixtures down to the explosive one with higher oil-flames.
       On comparing these results graphically (fig. 7), the divisions of the
  base line, measured from left to right, representing the number of volumes
  of air to one of firedamp, and the length of the ordinates giving the
  heights of the corresponding caps, measured from the top of the oil-
   flame, it is seen that the curve drawn through the extremities of the
  ordinates is roughly approximate to the form of a rectangular hyperbola.
  I    have therefore drawn that curve for comparison through the top of
   the ordinate which corresponds to 20 volumes of air.
       It is evident that the heights of these caps are in some degree propor
   tional to the quantity of firedamp consumed above the oil-flame per unit
   of time ; and, although the methods by which they were obtained are far
   from perfect, the results seem to point to the existence of a simple rela
   tionship between the initial temperature, the heat of combustion, and the
   specific heat of the various gases contained in the mixtures.
       To recapitulate in a summary manner what has been already said in
   the preceding pages of this paper, we have now two principal facts before
   us, which are these :—
        1. A mixture of firedamp and air, in the proportion of 1 volume of the
   former to 60, or more, volumes of the latter, gives no reliable indication
   of the presence of the inflammable gas, when tested in the manner usually,
   if not always, adopted in mines.
        2. A mixture of firedamp and air, in the proportion of 1 volume of
   the former to 112 of the latter, becomes inflammable at ordinary pressure

   1876.]             of Coal-dust in Colliery Explosions.                367
   and temperature, when charged with fine dry coal-dust, such as that which
  is to be found on the roadways in dry coal-mines.
      It seems, therefore, only reasonable to conclude that an explosion,
   originated in any way whatever, in a mine of this class, may extend itself
  to remote parts of the workings where the presence of firedamp was quite
   unsuspected.
      It is by no means so uncommon as might be imagined to find the air
  at the face of the workings and in the return air-courses of what are
  considered to be well-ventilated mines showing a cap at least ^ inch high
  on the small oil-flame.   I refer to my own observations in mines abound
  ing in dry coal-dust, and reported to be free from gas, because no inflam
  mable accumulation was known to exist in them at the time.         In these
  cases the firedamp appears to be given off quietly at a uniform rate along
  the face of the coal, but nowhere in such quantity as to render the atmo
  sphere locally inflammable.     To give some notion of the volume of gas
  given off in this way,  I need only mention that, in one instance,  I found
  an air-current, whose volume amounted to 34,000 cubic feet per minute,
  showing a cap \ inch high.       Taking this case as an example, we may
  suppose    the amount  of  air to  be doubled, so that where a cap \ inch
  high was to be found formerly there is now no trace of gas.        Then we
  know that, so long as the coal-dust remains undisturbed, naked lights
  might be used with perfect safety ; but let it once be raised and ignited
  by a small local explosion of firedamp, or by a shot such as that which
  caused the explosion in the Campagnac Colliery, and the final results may
  be  of the most serious description.    In this way some of the great ex
  plosions which have occurred in mines supposed to be almost, if not
  quite, free from explosive gas may perhaps be accounted for.
     The explosion in the Campagnac Colliery might possibly have been
 partly due to the presence of a small proportion of firedamp in the atmo
 sphere of the working-place in which it occurred.      That place had been
 driven in coal to a distance of 25 metres beyond the ventilating-current
 of the district, and was ventilated only by an eddy which passed inwards
 along the floor and returned along the roof ; and, although no firedamp
 had been found in it, the workmen were provided with a safety-lamp
 with which they were expected to make a careful examination before
 igniting a shot. This precaution was considered necessary, since slight
 explosions had taken place in other parts of the same mine.      Lastly, the
 working-place was quite level, so that it offered no opportunity for an
 accumulation of explosive gas to be formed in it.
     The most striking circumstance, however, connected with this explo
 sion is that, although it raised a dense cloud of coal-dust along the gal
lery which formed the prolongation of the place in which it occurred, to
a distance of from 130 to 150 metres, the flames do not appear to
 have extended more than 7 metres beyond the point at which they first
 encountered the ventilating-current.

   Similarly, in the case of the Llan explosion, I found that, at a distance
of 15 yards or so beyond the point where the principal air-current was
met (it, fig. 2), the traces of coked coal-dust on the timber began to grow
fainter ; and although they could be found here and there to a distance
of 70 yards further towards e, they were indistinct for the last 40 yards,
and resembled sparsedly scattered grains of gunpowder.               Let the plane

  Before leaving this part of the subject   may not be out of place to
                                                                it

          a
explosions in mines.     have already had the honour of submitting a
                                      I
paper on the same subject to this Society, published in No. 164 of
the Proceedings for 1874. In that paper experiments were described
     '                       '
which showed that an intense sound-wave, such as that originated by                             a
blown-out shot, was able to pass the flame through the wire-gauze of a
safetv-lamp burning in an explosive mixture.      The two hypotheses ad
vanced in the reports of the Inspectors of Mines to account for the simul-
taneousness of explosions of firedamp with the firing of shots were also
mentioned (p. 443)    and  purpose again to refer to one of these, namely,
                                  ;       I
that which supposes the firedamp to be ignited directly       the flame of         by
the shot.
     There can          be no doubt       that the   gases which issue from a shot-hole have
a sufficiently high temperature to ignite an explosive mixture of firedamp
and air      they pass into
              if             immediately. it   exploded such   Imixture of          a

experiments              at the Meteorological         Office in the beginning of the year
1873.         It   seems exceedingly doubtful,             however, whether the gases even
from     heavily-charged shot which blows out the tamping will retain a
          a
sufficiently high temperature to ignite    mixture of this kind at a distance

that   if  the same shot were fired in Various mixtures of firedamp and air
its flame would be prolonged more and more as these mixtures drew
nearer to the explosive point, somewhat in the same measure as the cap
on the flame of a lamp enlarges under the same circumstances.              This pro
longed      flame might even partake of the nature of a local explosion of
firedamp, especially if augmented by the presence of a small quantity of
coal-dust, although those who fired the shot had not been able to discover
the existence of any explosive gas beforehand.           I undertook to investigate
the nature of mixtures of gas and air which are not explosive at ordinary
pressure and temperature, when          I applied to the Government-Grant Com
mittee for assistance in 1872       ; but I regret to have to say that, from various
causes,    I have not     yet been able to carry out the necessary experiments.
    M. Vital      has given experimental     results which tend to show that the
flame of a shot is prolonged in a mixture of coal-dust and air.               I  have
repeated       his  experiments   with  gunpowder,     but without   much    success,
having only once succeeded in getting the flame to appear at the end of
the apparatus (fig. 3), when the shot was fired from a pistol in the posi
tion p ; and as the mixture of coal-dust and air was travelling in the
same direction at the rate of about 500 feet per minute, some deduction
must be made on that account.             The charge consisted of V36b gramme
of gunpowder well rammed.             I also placed  a shield at 0, and fired many
shots through a hole in the centre into the current charged with coal-dust ;
the amount of gunpowder varied from 2| grammes downwards, but on
no occasion did the mixture seem to ignite.
    It is always possible, however, that if coal-dust could be made fine
enough, and were thoroughly mixed with dry air in the proportion of
about 1 pound to 160 cubic feet of air, the mixture might be inflammable
at ordinary temperature, or, if not, it might at least be so nearly inflam
mable that an explosion begun in it in a confined space might be propa
gated through it. Without some further proofs, therefore, it would be
 premature        to draw any positive inference from my experiments with
gunpowder-shots, as they are by no means so satisfactory as            I could wish ;
and    I  am glad to be able to state that Professor Marreco, of Newcastle-on-
Tyne, intends to investigate this question with more substantial apparatus.
    The occurrence of three great explosions within as many days in the
beginning of December last, seemed to indicate the influence of some
external agency tending to produce the same result in each individual
 case.     The barometer was high and the temperature at the surface ex
ceptionally low at the time ; and it is well known that these atmospheric
 conditions are not favourable to the occurrence of explosions in which
 firedamp alone is concerned.           It had been often observed before that
 disastrous explosions happen most frequently during the winter months,
 and in some instances during very cold weather.             Mr. Scott has recently
 informed me that he pointed out the latter circumstance in the year 1867
 in an official letter to the Home Office ; and in preparing the diagrams

 370                  Mr. W. Galloway         on the Influence                [Mar. 2,
 for our papers on the Connexion between Colliery Explosions and Weather,
 it was remarked by both Mr. Scott and myself that several great explo
 sions had occurred in the years with which we had to deal (1868 to 1872
 inclusive) during weather very similar to that which prevailed in the
 beginning of December last.         This phenomenon was more marked, how
 ever, on the last occasion than at any time during my own experience; and
         I
 while was investigating the causes of the Llan explosion the following
 explanation presented itself to me, which        I   have now the honour of sub
 mitting   to  the  consideration   of   the  Fellows     of this Society, with the
 remark that this part of the subject        will   be more minutely      investigated
 by Mr. Scott and myself.
     If we assume that the magnitude        of some colliery explosions has been
 determined by     the  presence   of  coal-dust   in the workings, and that the
 hygrometric state of coal-dust changes with the humidity of the air with
 which it is in contact, then it is an obvious conclusion that explosions of
 this kind will be most likely to occur when the air in            the mines  is driest ;
 for at such times not only will the coal-dust be most easily raised into
 the air by the local explosion (which we may always suppose to happen
 at any rate), but it will also be burned more easily than when it con
tains a larger proportion of moisture.
    As an example we may take the case of a dry mine, in which the tem
 perature of the workings is 70° Fahr.            During warm weather the air
 which descends the shaft has a temperature of, say, 60° when it enters the
intake air-course ; at this stage it is also saturated with vapour, for there
is usually a little water trickling down the sides of a mine-shaft.                 The
temperature rises gradually as the current draws nearer to the faces, and
at length attains its maximum when the newly exposed face of the coal
has been passed. During this process the humidity has also been increas
ing to some extent, always remaining below complete saturation, however,
in a mine of this kind.
    In very cold weather, on the other hand, the same current may some
times have a temperature of 32°, or less, when it reaches the bottom of
the shaft   ; and since   it  passes through the same workings, its tempera
ture rises to 70° as before.      It is plain, therefore, that, in the latter case,
the ventilating-current      must  either obtain an additional supply of mois
ture from the workings (about | pound for every 1000 cubic feet of air),
or it must be drier than in the former case at every point of its course.
   PrimA facie, then, this process of reasoning leads            us to the conclusion
that explosions whose magnitude is due to            the  influence   of coal-dust will
happen most frequently during cold weather            ;  and, conversely, we might
expect to find that the magnitude of those explosions which occur during
cold weather is traceable, in some measure, to the influence of coal-dust.

           heat somewhat the air which enters it when its normal temperature is at or
           below the freezing-point    This is necessary in order to prevent the formation
           of large masses of ice on the walls, which would be the result if the numerous
           springs which percolate the brickwork were permitted to freeze for a consider
           able time.  In this way the apparent irregularity of the temperature observed
           in the cabin of thiB mine at the beginning of December may be partly or wholly
           accounted for.

       Ferndale and Llwynypia shafts are 286 and 380 yards deep respectively.
    The cabins, in which the observations of temperature are made daily, are
    small chambers 8 to 9 feet square by 7 to 8 feet high, formed in the coal
    on one side of a roadway.   Each cabin is separated from the roadway by
    a brick wall with a door in    whichit, usually kept shut.

  doors, in a passage which eounects an intake with a return air-way. The
  side of the cabin on which the thermometer hangs is separated from the
  intake air-way by a thickness of 6 yards of coal ; this point of the air
  way is 130 yards from the bottom of the downcast shaft, and the cur
  rent of air passing it amounts to 21,600 cubic feet per minute.           The
  cabin in the Llwynypia mine is only 16 yards from the bottom of the
  shaft, and is situated at the side of one of the principal levels, where the
 quantity of air passing the door is about 30,000 cubic feet per minute.
     The temperatures recorded in these two positions vary very little from
 day to day     ; and although they do not represent the actual variations
 taking place in the temperature of the ventilating-currents, they may
 be accepted, in a general way, as indices to the march of temperature in
 the intake air-courses.      Regarding them only in this capacity, then, it
 is interesting to observe that, in each case, the temperature had reached
 a minimum about the end of the first week in December.
     The great explosions which furnish the data for figure 10 are those by
 which nineteen, or more, men were killed ; twenty was originally the lowest
 figure, but afterwards four others were included, by each of which nine
 teen men were killed.      In consequence of this restriction the Llan explo
 sion (17) is excluded, as well as many others of equal importance.
     Arranging the months according to the number of explosions which
 took place in each, we have : —
        December    . . 10       October  ....   4       June             3

    The six months ending with March have produced thirty-two of these
explosions, and the other six months only seventeen.         January is excep
tionally low among the winter months, a circumstance which may per
haps have some connexion with the general cessation of work for several
days at the end of the year ; and July is high among the summer months,
indicating the effect of a high temperature at the surface in retarding the
ventilation.      The three explosions in May happened within the same fort
night in 1852 (May       6, 10, and 20) ; and September    is particularly ex
empt, having only one.
    It   may be said in conclusion that the dangers arising from the presence
of dry coal-dust in mines may be greatly diminished by having the coal-
dust itself removed as far as possible, and extending the system of water

mines will require to be largely augmented before we can reasonably ex
pect to enjoy comparative immunity from the recurrence of explosions.

  I. "  On the Diurnal Variations of the Disturbances of the
       Magnetic Declination at Lisbon."           By J. Capello, Director
       of the Lisbon Observatory.            Communicated by Balfour
       Stewaet, F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philosophy, Owens
       College, Manchester.       Received February 12, 1876.
    The Observatory of Infante D. Luiz has possessed since 1863 a set of
 magnetographs giving continuous records similar to those at Kew.           In
 1870 the results of the declination magnetograph, from the year 1864 to
 1867, were published ; and in 1874 the results for the same period of
 the bifilar and balance magnetographs (results embracing the horizontal
 force, vertical force, total force, and inclination) were published.       At
 present the results of the declination for 1868 to 1871 are in course of
 publication.
    The subject of this short paper is the diurnal variations of the disturb
 ances  of the declination.     The method which has been adopted for
 reducing the disturbances is that of Sir Edward Sabine.       I  have taken
  + 2 millimetres, or 2'-26, as the limits, beyond which limits all readings
 are regarded as disturbed.
    In  separating for each hour the disturbances (that is to say, the
excesses and the deficiencies of individual observations over the monthly
 means for each hour), and then taking for each year on one side all the
excesses   and on the other side all the deficiencies, we shall have a series
of numbers in millimetres which represent the law of the frequency of
these disturbances.
    In comparing the curves which graphically represent the law of the
frequency of the disturbances ( + West) and ( — East) for the 8 years
(1864 to 1871), it is at once noticed that all the phases appear later (as
regards the hour of the day) for the latter years.       In the easterly dis
turbances this tendency is manifested whether we make the comparison
between the curves of 1864 and 1871 (fig. 1) or compare the curves for
every 2 years (fig. 2), or finally the curves of the two periods of 4 years
(fig. 3).   In the westerly disturbances similar results are found, but
they are less marked    ; the movement appears to be slower     ; and it is in

these disturbances more difficult to prove it on account of the close double
maximums which show variations from one year to another*.
    However, it is easy to see, in either of the figs. 4, 5, or 6, that the
dotted curves are generally displaced to the right of the plain.                  This
difference     in behaviour between the easterly and westerly disturbances
still tends to support the supposition of their different sources. It is
very probable that these movements are periodical.
    The staff at the Observatory who can be engaged in measuring the
 photographic curves of the magnetograph, and making the calculations
 upon the monthly tables, is at present engaged with the curves of the
 bifilar and balance magnetographs for the years 1868 to 1871.
    It would be very interesting to know if similar displacements in the
 disturbance-curves at the stations in Asia and America have been ob
 served, and in what direction.

     Thus near 1870, or a little after, there is a maximum period of
 disturbances,      and from 1866 to 1867 there is a minimum period of
 disturbances, agreeing with the observed periods for the maximum and
 minimum of sun-spots.

     The author states that, although the general forms of several genera
 of Podophthalmous Crustacea are known, yet the details of their struc

 that, during the hours 20 a.m. to 3 p.m., there is another force in action independent
 of the two principal forces.

  and appreciated.
      Through Dr. Carpenter he received from Mr. Power an offer of a con
  siderable number of larvae of exotic species, together with the parents
 from which they had been obtained ; in relation to which Mr. Power
 wrote    : —
      " Deae Sib, — I have to thank you for your kindness in
                                                                       answering my
  letter to Dr. Carpenter, and for the memoirs.
      " My collection of Crustacea and the microscope-slides of the larva?
 are at present, and have been, packed up in Fort Louis.                  Now     I  am
 again    on  detachment   ; and  if left here in peace for a few months,       I  shall
 arrange my specimens and finish up the microscopic drawings.

                                                  (the only kind of aquaria my
 nomad life allows me to use), so each crab or prawn &c. whose larva                  I
 possess is identified with its young ; and this reminds me that on reading
 Fritz Miiller's paper in the ' Annals ' (1864, vol. xiv. p. 104),              I   was
 much astonished, as none of the prawns or prawn-allies whose young                   I
 have hatched show any such Nauplvu* form as shown in figures 1 & 3,
 &c. ; but all   I have observed as yet are born like fig. 8, or near it.
     "  1 have been   quite unable to rear any crab-larvae beyond a day or
 two after birth ; whether they require moving water or not                 I  do not
 know ; but certainly, though        I have kept the parents alive for several
 weeks in basins (the water changed once or twice in 24 hours) of salt
 water, the same      method     would    not succeed with the larvae.         I  then
tried small aquaria, and signally failed again.
        I
     " have not been in the neighbourhood of fresh water as yet, so have
had no opportunities of observing the freshwater Crustacea, though
there are a good many crab and shrimp forms.                    I   have found two
kinds of that curious parasitic crustacean which adheres like a little poly
pus, a mere bag with a peduncle, but containing hundreds of young
Crustacea whose genus        I do not know, as

     " In Fritz Miiller's paper before referred to, I fancy that he has not
hatched the different larvae mentioned.             After reading the paper very
carefully,    I could not help fancying that the various stages of develop
ment were not hatched through, but specimens were captured at different
times, and perhaps larvse of totally different species have been given as stages
of the same animal.       I  say this with great doubt ; but reading the paper
        I
will; think, bring every one to the same conclusion.             Thus he says, ' the

    " To tow a net in these tropical seas and to examine all the micro

    "  I  have not yet hatched the land Hermit-crabs, though               I  suppose
 they   are much    as the  ordinary  sea specimens,    and   they certainly spend
 their larval life in the sea.

    Some time afterwards the author received the promised collection, to
gether with Mr. Power's drawings and notes.              These have enabled him
to identify the parent forms of some known larvse, and also to deter
mine those of several unknown genera.
    It  has also led him to the conviction    of a unity of character through
out the various forms        and changes of Crustacea; that variety in form
is never inconsistent with homological truth ; that parts suppressed or
rendered abortive for want of use are never absolutely lost, and may be
reproduced under conditions that may require them.
    The eyes of those Crustacea, such as Alplums, that inhabit dark places
are reduced in power according to the condition of their habitat. But these
organs are, in their larval state, as well developed, if not more so, as
any of those whoso life is passed in the bright sunshine of the surface of
the ocean.
   The blind Didamia brought from the depth of four miles below the surface
of the Atlantic by the dredges of the 'Challenger' differs in no respect
from Polycheles, taken by Heller in the comparatively shallow Adriatic sea.
In the blind prawn from the Mammoth Cave of America, and the sight
less Nephropt of Formosa, the organs of vision are reduced to the smallest
condition     consistent   with their retention ; and in the Cirripedes the
eyes are represented by      their nervous apparatus only.
    The several forms of larva have not, in the prawn-allies, shown any
approach to the JSrauplius state, as mentioned by Fritz Miiller, so that
the author believes that it must be confined to the genus Penceus alone
among the Podophthalmia.          Nor should it be forgotten that the Nauplius
form has only been observed as a free-swimming animal.
   The author has taken this opportunity of making a close examination

into the earlier stages in the development of the embryo, and comparing
the progress within the ovum of some of the larvse that arrive at or near
maturity before being hatched, with those of the larval forms that are
hatched in a more immature condition ; and he states that, as soon as
the protoplasm assumes any thing like a definite plan, distinct lobes, cor-
respondingin position with those of the several appendagesin the Naupliu*,
together with an embryonic or ocular spot, are present ; that in the Naujilins
forms they exist as deciduous appendages only, and are soon cast aside
and replaced by others more adapted to the wants of the adult exist
 ence.
    In the embryos of other Crustacea the anterior pair of lobes enlarge in
 size with little alteration of form, while the posterior two pairs are de
veloped into appendages that have but a deciduous value, since they never
fulfil the office of permanent organs, and are generally cast off with an
early moult.
    This is observable within the ovum in Palcemon, Craixyon, &c., and also
in the marsupial embryo of Mysis after it has quitted the ovum.
    The relation of these parts to the permanent organs the author has
 closely traced, and believes that he has demonstrated that the three pairs
 of mobile appendages in the cirripedal or Nauplius form of larva homolo-
 gize with the eyes and two pairs of antennas, and not with the antenna?
 and mandibles, as stated by Fritz Miiller, Anton Dohrn, and others.
    The author, moreover, contends that the small pair of filamentary
 appendages seen on each side of the ocular spot, existing in the Nauplii
 of Cirripedes, homologize with the peduncular appendage existing in the
larva of Caliyus, the arm-like appendages in the pupa-stage of Cirripedes,
 the peduncle of the stalked Cirripedes, and probably also with the long
 multiarticulate,    antenna-like    organs belonging to the fossil Pten/yotus.
    He also demonstrates the origin of the nerves in            a mass  of cellular
 material   that reaches from one extremity of the embryo to the other.
 This divides into parts corresponding to the various somites into which
 the animal divides.       These masses gradually separate from each other
 as the animal increases in size, and concentrate into the several ganglia
 that form the great nervous chain.
    The author also shows the origin of the permanent organs of vision,
 and the manner in which the number of lenses increases with the growth
 of the animal, and traces the origin of several of the internal viscera
 and their mode of growth.
     He also figures, in minute detail, the larvaa of the following genera
 (those in italics are from British specimens, while all the others are
 from the collection sent to him by Mr. Power) : —

      In  this paper the author sums up the principal             results obtained by his
  investigations as follows :—
      (1.) Taking for the individual years of maximum and minimum sun-
  spot those given in par. 4 *, it is found that the rainfall in the maxima
  exceeds the rainfall in the minima years in each country or district, and
  therefore in all taken collectively, the mean annual excess for Great
  Britain being 1-94, for the continent of Europe 3-64, for America 5*17,
  for India 8-98, and for Australia 6-23 inches, which gives a mean
  excess of 5-19 inches.            In Great Britain the rainfall in seven of the
  nine years of maximum sun-spot exceeds the rainfall in the corresponding
  seven out of nine years of minimum                 sun-spot; on the continent of
  Europe     six   out   of   seven maxima years are similarly favourable;                in
  America five out of six are favourable, in India four out of six, and in
  Australia two out of three.
      A comparison of the mean rainfall of all the stations taken collectively
  gives an average annual excess of 7'01 inches in favour of the years of
  maximum sun-spot, and seven of the nine maxima years are favourable.
      (2.) It is thus seen that the excess is not owing to abnormal and
  casual heavy falls in one or two years of maximum sun-spot, but that it

is evidently the result of law ; for the years of most sun-spots are the
rainiest years generally in every part of the world the rainfall of which
has been obtained for a sufficient number of years.
   (3.) By taking three-year maxima and minima periods, and comparing
their rainfall, it is found that an increase of rain from the minimum
to the next maximum period, and from the maximum to the next mini
mum period, is the general rule, with a few local exceptions, almost all
of which disappear when means of all the observations are taken.          Thus
we find that 95-7 per   cent, of the three-year maxima and minima periods
are favourable in Great Britain, 75-0 on the continent of Europe, 88-8 in
America, 88-2 in India, and 87"5 in Australia, &c, giving a favourable
mean percentage of 87*0.
   (4.) Taking the annual     mean rainfall of the five districts collectively,
the percentage of favourable maxima and minima periods is 91*3, show
ing that there is scarcely any exception to the law of increase of
rain in the years of maximum, and decrease of rain in the years of
minimum    sun-spot.    This fluctuation is well seen in the Tables contain
ing the annual mean rainfall of the globe (that is, of all the stations),
the rainfall of each of the triennial periods being given separately.
Of the nine wettest and the nine driest years 77'8 per cent, are within
two years of the epochs of maximum and minimum sun-spot.
   (5.) A large majority of the entire sun-spot periods are also favourable.
This is shown by taking the annual rainfall at the same stations for each
period, placing the rainfall in the years of minimum sun-spot at the
beginning and end, and the rainfall in the years of maximum sun-spot
in the middle of the period, and observing whether the rainfall first in
creases and then decreases.     Of the number of entire sun-spot periods,
78'6 per cent, are completely favourable, and some others partially
favourable, making the favourable percentage still greater.
   (6.) When the years of greatest and least rainfall occur within two
years of the years of most and least sun-spot respectively, they are con
sidered favourable, and unfavourable when they fall beyond these limits.
Prom this point of view, we have for Great Britain 72-2 per cent, of the
wettest and driest years favourable, for the continent of Europe 57-l,
for America 66-7, for India 83-3, and for Australia also 83-3, giving a
mean percentage of 72-5. The mean rainfall of all the stations (globe)
gives a favourable percentage of 77-8.
   (7.) With respect to the rivers, the results, as might be expected, are
similar.   The depths in the maxima exceed the depths in the minima
sun-spot years by an annual average of 16-2 inches (Austrian); and of
thirteen maxima years, compared with thirteen minima years, there are
only three in which the excess is not in favour of the former.              As
to the maxima and minima triennial periods 79-4 per cent, of them
arc favourable, the rivers, as a rule, rising and falling with the
amount of sun-spot.       Of the thirteen entire sun-spot periods 77 per

1876.]                  Rainfall in   connexion   with Sun-spots.                381
cent, are favourable.    Of the fifteen years in which the depths were
greatest 60 per   cent, were within two years of maxima sun-spot years,
and   6 To per  cent, of  the years in which the depths were least were
within two years of minima sun-spot years. The latter percentages,
although favourable,         are less so than those for the rainfall, owing       to
obvious causes.
      (8.)   All   the above results have been obtained by strictly adhering to
the adopted years of maximum and minimum               sun-spot, and by taking
the absolutely wettest         and driest years, however little the rainfall      in
them might differ from that of other wet and dry years in their neigh
bourhood.    It is clear that this was subjecting the hypothesis to a severe
test ; for there is some doubt as to the positions of the years of maxi
mum and minimum sun-spot, especially in the earlier periods of observa
tion ; and, assuming a connexion between rainfall and sun-spots, it might
well happen that the absolutely wettest and driest years would not
always, or even often, fall within two years of the epochs of maximum
and minimum sun-spot.       The results, therefore, may be considered
highly favourable ; but they become still more so if , in a few cases, the
epochs of maxima and minima be altered to the extent of one year, and
if, for the absolutely wettest and driest years, almost equally wet and
dry years be occasionally substituted.      A slight alteration of this kind
would, for instance, raise the percentage of favourable maxima and
minima periods on the continent of Europe from 75 to 100, and make
all the wettest and driest years favourable.       Similar results would be
obtained for the other districts of observation.
   (9.) The ratios of the maximum and minimum rainfall to the mean
rainfall (especially the latter ratio) are nearly the same for each part of
the globe and this points to the sun as the main ageut in producing
              ;
rainfall variation. The ratios of the maximum and minimum river-deptbs
to the mean depth are almost the same as those for the rainfall.
   (10.) The years of maximum and minimum sun-spot are characterized
by great rainfall and river oscillations, circumstance which also points
                                                  a
to the sun as the disturbing cause         *.
   (11.) As the mean duration of the sun-spot period              years,

and from the maximum to the minimum           about 7-4 years, the durations
of the rainfall and river cycles, and the intervals between their epochs of
minima and maxima and maxima and minima, should approach those for
the sun-spot cycle, supposing that the three cycles are connected by              a
common cause.      Now this     found to be generally the case. The
                                      is
intervals between the consecutive wettest and between the consecutive
driest years for Great Britain are 11-3 and 10-8 years respectively,
while the interval from the driest to the wettest years 3-9, and from
                                                                    is
the wettest to the driest years 6-8 years.        For the continent of Europe
             * The greatest river-fluctuations occur in minima years.

382                            Mr. C. Meldrum        on                 [Mar. 9,
the mean duration of the period is 11 years ; but the intervals are less
favourable, being 5-3 years from the driest to the wettest, and 5-2 from
the wettest to the driest.        The results for America are nearly the same.
In India the mean duration of the period is 10*8 years, the mean interval
from the driest to the wettest years 4*5, and from the wettest to the driest
5-8 years. For Australia we get a mean period of 107 years, with an
interval of 4*7 from the driest to the wettest years, and of 5-5 from the
wettest to the driest years.           The means of the five results are as
follows   : —  Duration   of period  =  ] 1 years ; interval from driest to wet
 test years ¦= 4-8 years ; interval from wettest to driest years = 5-8
years.
    The mean rainfall of the globe (all the stations) gives the following
 results : —Mean duration of period = 106 years ; mean interval from
 driest to wettest years = 4-9 years ; mean interval from wettest to
 driest years = 6 years.
    For the river-depths the mean duration of the period is 11 years ; the
 mean interval from minimum to maximum 3'8, and from maximum to
 minimum 6*8 years.
    (12.) The results just given are of course only approximations.          They
 were, however, considered so favourable as to encourage a closer
 examination ; so that whenever        I   procured a portion (at least) of the
 Kew values of the sun-spot area, and of Wolfs relative numbers,           I com
 pared the former with the rainfall from 1832 to 1867, and the latter
 with the rainfall and river-depths for the longest possible periods, and
 on the whole obtained very favourable results.
    (13.) Supposing (as Mr. J. Allan Broun does) that any connexion
 that may subsist between sun-spots and rainfall may be approximately
represented by the equation A B =
 for Great     Britain,  the continent   of
                                           /A  A, it is found that the values of
                                             Europe, America, India, and Aus
                                                                                 f
 tralia from 1832 to 1867 are all favourable, except for America, where
it is slightly unfavourable.
    (14.) There are, apparently, some discrepancies between the Kew
 values and those of "Wolf for the period 1832-67. For when, in place
 of A A (difference of sun-spot area from the mean) we take A r (difference
 of Wolf's relative numbers from the mean), we obtain favourable values
 of /  for all the five districts.
    (15.) A comparison of Wolf's relative numbers with the rainfall of
 each country for the longest possible periods also gives very favourable
 results.     The agreement of A B and S with A r, in regard to the signs
 (+)   and  (
              — ), is remarkable,
                                   especially for the period 1842 to 1872, during
 which the rainfall of a portion of the southern hemisphere is represented.
 The values of       /                             /
                       in the equation A E = A r are favourable for each
 country, and (taking all the stations) they are also favourable for each
 of the seven sub-periods, except the one 1832-41.              The whole period
 of 77 years gives for the rainfall of the globe A B s= + '05745 A r ; and

   1876.]               Rainfall in connexion with Sun-spots.                 383
   from this equation we obtain a mean annual difference of 5*03 inches in
  favour of the years of maximum sun-spot.
      (10.) A similar comparison of         ir  with AD (differences of river-
   depths   from   the  mean) also gives favourable results.    The 116 years of
  river-depths (1756 to 1871) compared with the relative numbers of sun-
   spots for the same years give the equations AD = + 0*17322 Ar and
-  A D = + 0-12266 Ar. According to these equations the depth in the
   years of most sun-spot should exceed the depth in the years of least sun-
   spot by an annual average of 12-69 inches.        For all, except three, of the
   11 sub-periods into which the 116 years are divided the values of
   favourable, and they would no doubt be found favourable as far back as
                                                                            /  are
   the observations of river-depths extend (1728), if we had the sun-spot
  numbers for those years.
      (17.) Sun-spot, rainfall, and river curves laid down from the Tables
  have, notwithstanding some exceptions, a general resemblance, which
  cannot,     I  think,  be ascribed  to chance.    The resemblance, aB might
   be expected, is greatest   in the case of the rainfall curve for the globe.
  Here, with the exception of two or three years in the period 1765 to
   1776, for which there are only three stations, and of three years in the
  period 1832 to 1841, the resemblance is very strong.
      (18.) Of the seven entire sun-spot periods of rainfall for the globe,
  the mean values of six can be compared with the mean values of Wolf's
  relative numbers by placing the maxima years near the middle and the
  minima years at the beginning and end of each period, so as to have
  nearly    all the maxima years in one horizontal line, and the minima
  years    in   other horizontal lines.    This is done in one of the Tables.
  The river-depths for the same six periods are similarly arranged in
  another Table.        Then, applying Bessel's formula, we get three equa
  tions, the second terms of which enable us to lay down three curves
  showing the general progression of sun-spot, rainfall, and river-depths.
  The modification of these curves by the third terms of the equations is
  shown by dotted curves.         In a similar way we obtain three other equa
  tions and curves for five sun-spot periods, in which the minima years of
  sun-spot are placed near the middle and the maxima years at the com
  mencement and end.         The resemblance of the curves to one another is
  very striking.
      (19.) According to the terms containing 6 and 2 0 in the first three
  equations the three cycles have nearly the same lengths.           The rainfall
  maximum occurs 4-8 months after the sun-spot maximum, and the river
  maximum 9-6 months after the rainfall maximum.               According to the
  second three equations the rainfall minimum occurs 10-8 months after
  the sun-spot minimum, and the river minimum 3-6 months after the
  rainfall minimum.        The mean range of rainfall variation is C-19 inches,
  and of river-depth variation 16-73 inches.           The intervals from the
  minima to the maxima epochs are in every case less than those from

38   i                         Mr. C. Meldrum       on                      [Mar. 9,
the maxima to the minima         epochs, and the ratios of the former to the
latter intervals are nearly the same for all the three cycles.
    (20.) These results will be somewhat modified by the fourth and fifth
terms of the equations and by additional observations ; but at present
they may be considered fair approximations.                 The mean excess of
rainfall (6-19 inches) is almost the mean of the 5-19 and 7*20 inches
previously obtained, and the 16-73 inches of river-fluctuation are nearly
the same as the 16-20 inches found by taking the means of the depths in
the adopted maxima and minima years.            The durations of the periods,
and the intervals from minimum to maximum and from maximum to
minimum, given by the equations are also not very different from those
given directly by the observations.
    (21.) Although the mean depths of the rivers have apparently been
decreasing, yet the range of variation has altered little. It would thus
appear that there is some general cause which operates irrespectively of
 local causes, and that its effects usually override all other effects. This
is shown by the differences between the greatest and least depths for
 consecutive periods of ten to thirteen years.
     The more numerous the observations the more evident does a con
 nexion between sun-spots and rainfall become.               At first (1872) the
rainfall at only three stations (Mauritius, Adelaide, and Brisbane) was
 examined.     To these Mr. J. Norman Lockyer, in a paper " On the
                                 "
 Meteorology of the Future         (' Nature,' vol. vii. p. 142), added the rain
 falls of the Cape and of Madras, strongly expressing in favour of the
 hypothesis (even at that early stage) an opinion which, though not then
 accepted by some meteorologists, all subsequent investigations, including
 those of Mr. Blanford, Prof. Broklesby, Mr. Dawson, Mr. Ellery, Dr.
 Jelinek, Mr. B>. H. Scott, and Mr. Symons, have amply justified *. The
 number of stations has, in short, gradually risen from three to 144, and
 the results of each successive investigation     have been an improvement on
 their predecessors.
    Not only has the number of stations been increased ; the periods
 of observation have been greatly extended. At first we had only ten to
forty-five years' observations, comprising at the utmost one to four sun-
 spot periods.     We have now rainfall observations for seven and river-
 observations for thirteen sun-spot periods ; and the fact that the law-
holds good with the earlier as well as with the later observations is signi
ficant.   The variations in the level of the Elbe, from 1728 to 1777,
 followed the sun-spot variations as regularly as those of the rainfall and
 rivers have done in later times.
    The amount of rainfall variation is greatest within the tropics, and
 seems to decrease as the latitude increases.             This is a point, how
ever, which requires further examination by considering the observations
          * I have not seen Prof. Tyndall and Mr. Hennessy's contributions.

1876.]              Rainfall in connexion with Sun-spots.                     385
belonging to different zones.       The positions of the belts of calms and
variables may be found to have a secular variation.
   It is to be borne in mind that the average excess of rainfall in the
maxima years (6*19 inches) is obtained by taking all the observations
of whatever      description.   Most of the observations are favourable, but
others are unfavourable.       If the  former alone had been taken, the excess
would    be much larger.      Now the rainfall at many of the stations seems
to be permanently favourable, while at several others it seems to be per
manently unfavourable*; that is, there are many stations at which the
rainfall is invariably, or at least generally, greater in the maxima than
in the minima years, while at some others the reverse takes place. As
a rule, it would appear that the stations near the sea and fully exposed
to winds sweeping over a considerable expanse of water are favourable,
while the unfavourable ones are those exposed to winds passing over
land and liable to be deflected by mountains and valleys.                Bombay,
Madras, Mauritius, Cape of Good Hope, Brisbane, Melbourne, Plymouth,
and Charleston (U.S.) are among the favourable stations, and Calcutta,
Milan, and Trieste amongst the unfavourable.            At Bombay (exposed to
the S. "W. monsoon) there has been only one exception to the general
law since 1817, and at the Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, &c, as far as
observation extends, there has been no exception at all.            On the other
hand, Milan furnishes an opposite example. What we have to do, then,
is to separate the favourable from the unfavourable stations, and to study
the rainfall of each class by itself.            The total rainfall of the globe
generally is about 6 inches greater in the maxima than in the minima
sun-spot years; but there are local exceptions, and it is important to
know their laws.
    As the rainfall at a majority of stations fluctuates with the sun-
spots, and as the amount of fluctuation for these stations is considerably
greater than 6 inches, it would probably be of advantage to be able to
predict the epochs of maximum and minimum sun-spots.                  Dr. De La
Eue and Prof. Balfour Stewart have shown that the sun-spots are, to
 some extent, connected with the relative positions of the planets and
 sun.    If, then, it were proved that the sun-spot period depends upon
 the configuration of the planets, and the rainfall period on sun-spots, it
 would be easy to predict the general character of the seasons for large
portions of the globe. Even without this it is possible, as recently
pointed out by Mr. Ellery, in his Annual Address to the Eoyal Society
of Victoria, that there is so much interdependence in the rainfalls
of different countries, that, with our present knowledge and with the
aid of the telegraph, we may shortly be in a position to foretell whether
a coming season is likely to be a wet or a dry one. The results of the
   * These are  few in number.  Observations for long periods show that the law of
fluctuation holds good at a great majority of statious.

  386               On Rainfall in   connexion   with Sun-spots.       [Mar. 9,
  present investigation warrant the inference that, generally, the rainfall
  of the next two or three years will be below the average rainfall of the
  years 1870-3, and that, though some places may suffer from floods, more
  will suffer from drought. Prom all the information I have been enabled
  to collect, it is not improbable that the rainfall of this year (1875), re
  markable though it is for destructive floods in various parts of the world,
  will  be less than the average.      Floods are, apparently, characteristic of
  the setting in of the minimum period of sun-spots, especially on the
  continent of Europe.       But these floods are local, and the large vintage
  in Central Europe is an indication that, generally, the rainfall there for
  at least several months of the year has not been excessive.
     A completely satisfactory proof of a connexion between sun-spots
  and rainfall requires that the variation in the rainfall must necessarily
 follow from the variation in the sun-spot area. We may show that the
 two periods, as far as observation extends, are equal, that the intervals
  between their maxima and minima epochs are equal, and that the times
 of the epochs themselves are exactly what might be expected. It might
 also be argued that periodic constitutional changes in the sun, as in
 dicated by the solar spots, must         produce  atmospheric changes. But
 granting all that, it may    be said that so long as there is a bare possibility
 of explaining the phenomena otherwise, the evidence is incomplete.
 There may be two independent causes at work, one producing a sun-spot
 and the other a rainfall cycle, and the two causes and effects may have
 run nearly parallel to each other for many years ; but it does not follow
 that they will always do so.
    Such a possibility may exist, but it seems to be a rather remote
 one   ; and in order, if possible, to make it still more remote, it may be
 desirable to compare the amount of sun-spots and rainfall for each day
and month.
    But supposing it were fully established that the rainfall and sun-
spot variations are produced by one and the same cause, it may be asked
whether the corresponding eleven-year period of magnetic variation, dis
covered by Sir Edward Sabine, has also the same cause; and if so, by
what process are such apparently dissimilar effects as rainfall and mag
netic variations produced by a common agent?               I would hazard the
opinion that the proximate cause of the sun-spot, magnetic, and rainfall
cycles is a secular variation in the intensity of solar heat, the solar spots
or cyclones      being, like terrestrial cyclones, most frequent when the
temperature is greatest, that the sun radiating more heat in some years
than in others evaporation and rainfall are greater in the former than in
the latter,    and that the changes in solar radiation affect the earth's
magnetism.        This opinion seems to receive some support from the cir
cumstance that, according to some remarks recently made by Sir Greorge
Airy at    a meeting of the  Institution of Civil Engineers, and to researches

by  Mr. Blanford ('Nature,' vol. xii. p. 188), solar radiation   is greater
in the rainiest years, that is, in the years of most sun-spot.    That the

   This paper contains an account of an experimental investigation under
taken with a view to support, by absolute measurements, the theoretical
arguments by which the author endeavoured to prove the existence of
reactionary forces or " heat-reactions

                                                whenever heat is communicated
from a surface to a gas, and vice versd, and the connexion between these
forces and the motion caused by heat and light falling on bodies in
vacuo.
   Since the publication      of the author's paper on this subject in the
'               '
  Proceedings     for  April  1874,   the correctness of his conclusions with
regard to the existence of these heat-reactions has not been controverted
or even questioned ; while Professors Tait and Dewar, after an elaborate
investigation, entirely confirm the author, not only in these conclusions,
but also in his view as regards the explanation of Mr. Crookes's experi
ments.     Mr. Crookes, however, appears entirely to repudiate this ex
planation, arguing, —
    1. That he obtains his best results in vacua so perfect that there is no
air either to receive the heat or react on the surface.
   2.   That the force is radiant in character.
    3.  That light, as well as heat, produces the motion, which consequently
 cannot be due to the heating of the surface.

by Dr. Geissler, of Bonn, the author was in a position to make quantita
tive measurements of the effects produced               and of the force producing
them.
     Inthe first place, with regard to the sufficiency of the residual air to
cause the motion.    It was found that this air                   is,
                                                       with the exception of
the friction of the pivot, which    found to be so small as to be inappre
                                          is
ciable, the sole cause of the resistance which the mill experiences, of
the limit which    imposed on its speed for each intensity of light, and of
                  is
the rapidity with which   comes to rest when the light
                              it                          removed.     The  is
law of resistance, as determined by careful measurements,              found to    is
agree perfectly   with the resistance which highly rarefied     air would  offer
to its motion and this law
              ;                    distinctly special in its character, being
                                     is
proportional to the velocity at low speeds, and gradually tending towards
the square of the velocity as the speed increases.
   Having established the fact that there       sufficient air in the mill (and
                                                   is
Mr. Crookes's behaves in the same manner as this mill) to balance, by its
resistance, the force which moves the mill,            argued that all question
                                                        it   is
as to the sufficiency of the air to cause the forces      removed.is What the
air can prevent   it can cause.
   As regards the possibility of the motion being in any way the direct
result of radiation.    This supposition the author had previously shown
to be directly contradicted by the fundamental law of motion that action
and reaction are equal.   A cold body runs away from hot body, while,   a
if free to move, the hot body will run after the cold body, showing that
the force does not act from body to body, but that each body propels
itself through  the surrounding medium in       direction opposite to its
                                                        a
hottest side, the effect of one body on the other being due solely to the
disturbance which      it    in the equilibrium of temperature.
                            causes
   The truth of this view was entirely confirmed by an experiment made
by Dr. Schuster, to be communicated to the Eoyal Society. Dr. Schuster,
by suspending the entire mill, was able to see whether the force which
causes the vanes of the mill to revolve caused any twisting force on the
envelope  ;   and he found that such twisting force, so far as      existed,        it
was exactly what must result from         force arising entirely within the
                                               a
mill, t. e. between the vanes and the medium immediately surrounding
them.   "While the vanes were acquiring momentum           reaction was ex
                                                                        a
perienced by the envelope but when the vanes had acquired full speed,
                                ;
the envelope was subjected to no force whatever          when, however, the
                                                                    ;
light was turned off, the vanes, by virtue of the friction they experienced,
tended to drag the envelope with them.
   Besides proving that the force acts between the vanes of the mill and
the medium immediately surrounding them, Dr. Schuster's experiments
furnish quantitative measure of the actual force. Taking the manner of
          a
suspension and the weight of the mill into consideration,                        the effect pro

390        On Force caused between      a Surface and a Gas.        [Mar. 23,
duced showed that, when making 240 revolutions per minute, the torsional
force on the vanes does not exceed one forty millionth part of a pound
acting on a lever a foot long ; that the pressure of the gas on the vanes
to produce this was not more than one two million five hundred thousandth
part of a pound on the square inch, or one thousandth part of the pres
sure in a Torricellian vacuum, thus placing the extreme minuteness of
the forces in a clear light, a light from which the extreme delicacy of
Mr. Crookes's instrument had altogether withdrawn them.
    It is then shown on theoretical grounds that the difference of tempe
rature on the two sides of the vanes necessary to cause heat-reactions of
this magnitude could not be less than l°-7 F., while the probability is
that it is considerably more.
    In order to apply this test and see how far the actual difference of
temperature in Dr. Schuster's experiments corresponded with that deduced
from the theory, a new photometer was devised by the author with an
immediate view of measuring the difference of temperature caused by
light on    a black and a white surface.
    Of two thin glass globes, 2| inches in diameter, connected by             a
siphon-tube g inch internal diameter, one was blackened with lamp
black on the inside over one hemisphere and the other was whitened
with chalk in a similar manner, the two clean faces of the globes being
turned in the     same direction.   Oil was put in the tube and the globes
were otherwise sealed up.         Any light which enters through the clean
                                                '
faces is received on the black and white          surfaces, and the air in the
globes expands      in accordance with the difference of temperature which
they attain, moving the oil in the tube. A motion of | an inch on the part
of the oil shows a difference of 20-2 in the temperature of the air within
 the globes.
    The instrument so constructed is exceedingly delicate, and will show
a difference in the intensity of light sufficient to make one revolution
 per minute difference in the speed of the mill.          As a photometer it is
 much more convenient than the mill, and its construction presents much
 less difficulty.    By making the lower portion of the siphon-tube hori
 zontal, and using glass indices after the manner of Eutherford's thermo
 meter, the instrument might be made to record maxima and minima
 intensities of light, as well as be more delicate in other respects.
     Measured with this instrument, the light necessary to give the mill
 240 revolutions per minute does not exceed 24°, and is probably less
 than this, which shows that the theoretical difference of heat necessary
 to cause the heat-reactions is well within the difference as actually
 measured, leaving an ample margin for error in the methods of approxi
 mation used in the calculation.
     In concluding the paper the author claims to have set at rest the only
 point respecting the explanation of the motion caused by heat which
 remained doubtful after he had discovered that, according to the kinetic

1876.]      Motion of a Body exposed to Heat and Light.                        391
theory, the communication         of heat to   a gas must cause a force reactionary
on the surface, viz. whether this reaction was adequate in amount to
cause the results seen to take place.
   He adds a suggestion as to a new form of light-mill to have vanes
inclined like the sails of a windmill, and not having one side white and
the other black, like  the light-mills at present constructed, arguing
that the forces act perpendicularly to the surface, and in a direction in
dependent of that from which the light comes ; so that such a mill would
turn like a windmill with the full and not merely the differential effect
of the light. Such a mill, he concludes, would furnish another test as to
whether or not the force is directly referable to radiation.

  Mr. Crookes has lately drawn attention to the mechanical action of a
source of light on delicately suspended bodies in vacuo ;        I
                                                          have made a few
experiments which will,      I
                             think, throw some light on the cause of the
phenomenon, and assist us in the explanation of the manifold and striking
experiments made by Mr. Crookes.
  Whenever we observe                          to drive a body in a certain
                                 a force tending
direction, we are sure to find a force equal in amount acting in the opposite
direction on the body from which the force emanates. It was with the
view of finding the seat of this reaction that          I
                                                    have made a few experi
ments.
  If the  force is directly due to radiation the reaction will be on the
radiating body;  if,on the other hand,      due to any interior action, such
                                                is
                                               it
as the one suggested    byProf. Reynolds, the reaction will be on the en
closure of the moving bodies.     have been able to test this by experiment,
                                   I
and
  I    have found that the action and reaction    entirely between the light
                                                       is

 was concentrated on the light-mill, which then revolved about 200 times
 a minute.
   The light was cut off at the beginning of the experiment by means of
a screen,  and the position of rest of the glass vessel was read off by means
of the dot of light on the scale. The screen was then suddenly removed,
and in every case a large deflection of the glass vessel was observed. The
vessel was deflected in the opposite direction to that in which the mill
turned.    When the velocity of the mill had become constant, the vessel
returned to its original position.    On suddenly cutting off the light the
vessel was again deflected, but in the opposite direction to that on starting
the experiment.     The vessel therefore now turned in the same direction
in which the mill turned.
   These experiments are easily explained on the assumption that the force
acting on the vessel enclosing the light-mill is exactly equal and opposite
to that acting on the mill itself.   While the velocity of the mill in one
direction is increasing, a force acts in the opposite direction on the vessel.
When the velocity has become constant, the force which tends to drive
the mill round is exactly counterbalanced by the resistance which opposes
the motion of the mill.     The two forces acting on the vessel will there
fore counterbalance, and the vessel will return to its original position of
rest.   When the light is cut off, the resistance will stop the motion of
the mill.   The reaction of the resistance will act on the enclosure, and
the enclosure will turn in the same direction as the mill.                     »
   By means of the reaction on the enclosure    I have been able to calculate
the strength of the force; and   I have found that the pressure on a surface
on which light of equal intensity to that used in my experiments falls,
is equal to that produced by the weight of a film of water on a hori
zontal surface equal in thickness to the length of a wave of violet light.

    The instrument depends upon two principles : —
         I. The distance through which an image is displaced by refraction
                  through a plate.
          II.   The exquisite sensitiveness of contact-films forming the various
                  orders of Newton's rings and the central black spot.
   I. It is well known that when the index of refraction is 1-500 or ,         f
an image is formed by a plate having parallel sides at a distance
nearer to the eye of the observer equal to two thirds of the thickness of
the plate.   Indeed if t be the thickness and fi the refractive index, the
displacement is generally
                                             t

    If,
      therefore, an instrument could be devised which would with great
accuracy measure the thickness of the refracting plate, and also at the
same time the distance by which the image of points on its surface was
displaced inwards        by refraction,   data could be obtained for determining
the value of fi.
    The instrument has assumed its present form after many construc
tions and reconstructions.      was led to consider this method of finding
                                I
 the refraction of glass by frequent accidents happening while using the
fiftieth-of-an-inch objective with the microscope, which by pressure
destroyed or cracked the thin glass covers generally applied to protect
the objects or " slides."  Now, so to speak, the observer always in such
a  case really examines the elevated image of the object, raised about
two thirds of the thickness of this cover. By knowing, therefore, the
refraction of the glass cover and its thickness, such accidents, so irre
parable in many valuable objects, might be avoided.     Means were sought
to determine the index of refraction of such covers, frequently varying
from the hundredth to the thousandth of an inch thick, nn extra thick
ness sometimes being destructive to the most valuable objective.
   Hitherto the method of finding the refractive index has been by the use
of prisms made of the material in question, and employed in the form of
aspectroscope.

half an inch thick, marked B, gave on three trials

    Upon constructing an instrument roughly the index was readily found
 to two places of decimals in covering-glass, viz. fi = 1'55.
    The contrivance of an instrument to read to the 100,000th of an inch
 now seemed desirable.       It was necessary not only to measure thickness,
 but the elevation of the image within the substance of the plate.
    The well-known delicacy of evanishment of a point under a good
 microscope seemed to afford an exquisite test of distance.
    At first the point of an advancing screw was made to touch the
 " plate," the screw moving in the axis of the microscope. The point
 was brought into focus, or rather its image.            The refracting plate wras
 now removed, the microscope remaining undisturbed.                The screw was
 then advanced until its point again came into focus ; the point now
 occupied the precise position just before occupied by its image.             This
 distance was then read off and the thickness of the plate read by
 observing successively the distances traversed by the screw between the
 point of first contact and its rising to the very same position of a
 particle already observed on the upper surface.
    II.  At this point of  the research it occurred to the writer to substitute a
 minute plano-convex      lens, fixed to the end of the screw, and endeavour
 to produce contact-films,      especially the black central     spot of Jsewton's
rings.
    In  order to render     the colours of these rings gorgeous by reflected
light, a thin piece of plate glass was fixed at an angle of 45° behind the
 observing objective, and a hole perforated in the tube or
                                                                       " body " to
admit light from a lamp       ; the object-glass then condensed a strong light
upon the film-forming surfaces, and the black central spot came out
beautifully black and distinctly defined in the field of the microscope.
This occurred whether air or other fluid intervened between the lens and
the surface.     After fixing several different lenses,       I found a radius of
curvature of about one quarter of an inch the most convenient for deve
loping the rings suitably for the microscopic field of view.
    For being apprised of the near approach of contact, still greater con

venience was accorded by using a minute film of paraffin-oil, formed by
repeatedly wiping the surface of the screw-lens.    Contact was then
heralded   instantly between the two surfaces by a brilliant flash of
colours.   One thing appeared certain, the various colours could be pro
duced in perpetually expanding and vanishing rings, always starting
from the centre.    I  counted no less than thirty-two changes of colour
in the central part, reckoning from the black spot of perfect contact
(within the half-millionth of an inch) and the final evanescence of the
last colour by slight movements of the screw.
   For the purpose of illuminating the point of contact of the " screw-
     "
lens with the plate under examination,        I
                                             inserted a minute right-angled
prism behind the lens.        This giving totally reflected light, provided
nothing   adhered   to  the reflecting surface of the prism, afforded the
means of making observations by ordinary daylight, and observing the
rings of Newton, though very pale, by transmitted light.
   Another great advantage of the prism-lens attached to the end of the
steel measuring-screw, is the bright illumination of the contact surfaces,
the contact of an opaque extremity of the screw being with difficulty
ascertained.
   The whole method of finding the refractive index of a thin plate of a
given refractive material resolved itself, then, into the best instrumental
means for advancing a fiducial visible and illuminated point truly and
steadily through measurable intervals, and observing with a good micro
scope the precise position of evanishment in and out of focus, and deter
mining the focal points under correct collimations.
  After many trials the following form was adopted : —
  A steel cylinder very accurately turned between dead centres            (»'.   e.   the
centres being fixed and the object revolving between them), about                       5

                                    ;
101*3 per inch) were very patiently formed. The front part of the cylinder
passes smoothly (at first air-tight like piston) through
                                          a               collar of brass,

a   screw as described, with   a   very exact apparatus lent to the writer by
a  celebrated optician.
   It was found that in so delicate an operation as dealing with coloured
films, touching any part of the instrument caused them to flash       new  a
colour.    Itwas necessary to obviate, then, all varying mechanical strain.

                                                                             so that on
precisely the same number of threads in every measurement,
the average the same number of threads probably represented nearly the
same distance.         In  the case where a spring is more and more compressed
and the number of threads embraced by the nut is constantly increasing
                                                                                       are
(although some compensating action may arise), the screw and parts
certainly submitted to very varying and uncertain conditions.                   Another
source of error arose, — shake of rotation.              Having abandoned the usual
 form of micrometer construction (a revolving nut with a constant
                                                          —
 change in the number of threads embraced a plan, one would think,
 fatal to all delicate accuracy), the next difficulty was to insure to the
 steel screw absolute advance and retreat without rotatory shake or
 motion.       For this purpose slides were also abandoned.            This action, the
  most important part of the instrument, should now be described.
     A lever is affixed to the cylinder of steel and bent at right angles ; it
  carries an adjustable weight.          This weight slides upon a flat edge formed
  parallel to the     axis  of the  steel  screw by a most careful process, tested
  by a carefully prepared spirit-level for parallelism.
      On lifting the weight slightly, the lever rotates the screw through a
  small angle ; and this lever forms a constant test of the efficiency of the
  screw action of the greatest sensitiveness.
      A  further action put into motion by a fine screw gives to the advance
  of the film-forming surface, or prism-lens, a movement of the millionth
  of an inch.
      Supposing that tho recording-wheels have advanced several turns, the
  weight and lever also advance on the smooth edge already said to be
  formed parallel with the axis of the screw.
      The constancy of the weight preserves the screw in one normal fidu
   cial position, as regards its liability to rotate on its axis. An error of
   one hundredth of an inch in the sliding edge would produce an error
   of the reading of less amount than the hundred-thousandth                         of an
  inch *. But the lever advances             so  very slowly,  as the wheels   rotate   the
  nut upon the screw, that this error appears to be almost destroyed.
      An arrow-head shows upon the face of the differential wheels the
   number of turns taken by the nut.                The instrument is self-recording,
   and reads to four places of decimals, from the hundredth of an inch to
   the hundred-thousandth.            Two wheels, divided into 98 and 100 teeth
   respectively, run in gear at will with a long pinion of ten leaves,
   carrying a wheel showing the hundred-thousandths                of an inch.
       The prism end of the screw passes through the ground socket ; and this
    socket carries a small stage accurately turned and ground, furnished with
    stops and a spring to confine the small plate of glass, if necessary, in one

 carefully adjusted in one line, so as to have a common collimation.
    In very thin glass an objective of 5-inch focal length has been found
 sufficient. For thick glass, nearly half an inch thick, Mr. Wray, of High-
 gate, made a beautiful half-inch with three lenses cemented together with
 balsam, so as to give the greatest possible penetration.    The body of the
 microscope is about 6 inches long.
    The whole instrument is placed at an angle of about forty degrees.
 Its accuracy depends on the weight of the toothed wheels always bearing
 with an equal pressure, without springs, on the back poppet of the
 jeweller's lathe employed to carry and work the apparatus.
    It remains to say a few words on the method of using the instrument.
   1.   By transmitted Light. —The instrument is placed near           a   window in
 daylight, and the small condenser is then used to throw a light upon the
 minute prism, which is then reflected up the microscope.       A minute
 drop of kerosine is placed on the prism-lens at the end of the micrometer-
 screw, and then wiped off. The lens is then withdrawn a little below
 the stage, and the plate of glass to be measured is placed upon it.   The
microscope is armed with a quarter-inch, a half inch, or inch objective,
according to the thickness of the plate to be examined.
   The microscope is then focused upon the under surface of the plate.
The micrometer- wheels are set in motion.   Tho prism-lens gradually
rises into view.   The instant of contact is observed by a sudden
spreading out of the remains of the oil-drop. It may require several
cleansiugs or wipings of the lens before the oil is sufficiently removed.
The film expands and contracts with the slightest movement ; with a
little practice the eye detects the position of initial contact.
   The instrument is then read.
   Example. — Initial reading for

which acts as its own condenser.           The most beautiful colours are deve
loped on contact, either with a film of air or kerosine.
    The central spot of final contact is of a grey-black, surrounded with
its well-known succession of Newtonian rings of great beauty and per
fection, flashing through numerous changes of colour for each thickness
of film varied by the micrometer-screw.
    The instant of the formation of the black spot film (thickness 0-000005
inch) determines the place of contact, i. e. the fiducial point of zero,
with a precision scarcely equalled by any other known method of linear
measurement by optical means.             It can be readily obtained with great
accuracy.      This important point (the zero) of the observations depends
not upon a thin spider line or engraved line, but upon the formation of
a bold black circular spot whose diameter is variable and dependent upon
the curvature of the lens employed.           "Where great endurance is desired,
 a small plano-convex         sapphire lens can be cemented to the prism at
little expense.
     The behaviour of minute microscopic kerosine oil-drops persistently
 adhering to the surface of the lens, in spite of repeated wipings, is
worthy of notice. -
    On the near approach of the lens to the under surface of the glass
under notice, the scattered drops suddenly coalesce, shooting out into a
film of varying colour.
    On one occasion a small oil-drop, one hundredth of an inch in
diameter, appeared as a black annulus enclosing a bright thin ring of
 light, which enlarged on being touched by the prism-lens by the advance
 of the screw.       It   spontaneously then spread out and rapidly exhibited

    It is not absolutely necessary that a plate of glass with precisely
parallel sides be used. A wedge can be manipulated if a particular spot
be chosen and the wedge be most carefully adjusted to the same position
by means of the stop and ledge on the stage. Less difficult, however,
is glass formed into a plano-convex lens of long focus, the plane side
being placed downwards, and the same point, the summit if possible, being
always selected for observation : better still if a slice be cut off so as to
present a secure fixing of the lens in the same position.
    A variety of substances formed into plates, wedges, or lenses, with
little convexity, may thus be examined, as also fluids enclosed between
parallel plates.

    The opportunities which present themselves for the acquisition of
the ova of Mammalia during the early stages of development, and
especially ova of the period during which the formation of the blasto
 dermic layers is proceeding, are so rare that, although the subject has
been under special investigation by more than one observer, all the
 stages of the process of formation have by no means as yet been
described   ; and much remains    to  be  discovered   in connexion with this
phase of development alone.         It  seems    on this  account desirable to
publish observations bearing       upon this question, although they are
limited to two or three or even to a single ovum, since it is by collecting
and comparing the results which have been arrived at by different ob
servers that there   will be the best chance   of coming to a definite conclu
 sion upon a   subject which involves the knowledge of every progressive
 stage.
    I  have been induced by these considerations to furnish a short de
scription of an early developing ovum (of the cat) which came into my
hands now fully two years ago, but which        I had continually deferred the
account of in the hope of obtaining specimens a little more in advance
with which to compare that which          I  already had.     This expectation
 having,   however, hitherto  been  disappointed,   I think  it better to com
 municate the description without further delay, as it may at least serve
 for comparison with the statements of other observers.

corresponding number of corpora lutea upon the. ovaries, judged that
each swelling must contain an ovum.      Removing the uterus and placing

the above-mentioned dilatations was reached, a minute, beautifully clear,
vesicular body floated out into the surrounding liquid ; there was no sign
of any adhesion to the uterine wall.

be made out in the fresh condition, and the little vesicles (at least two of
them, for the others were of less value for the purpose of sections, owing
to the blastoderm having shrunk away at various places from the zona,
and presenting    crumpled distorted aspect) were accordingly hardened
                       a

with carmine respectively, imbedded              by

pellucida, or primitive chorion, two distinct layers, the section of each
forming complete circle, the whole structure, therefore, included by the
            a

of an intermediate layer of cells or mesoblast.   The epiblasfc closely lines
the zona throughout ; but the hypoblastic vesicle is considerably smaller,
so that except at one part, where it comes into closer proximity than else
where with the epiblast, it is separated from the latter by a considerable
interval, filled in the fresh condition by a clear fluid. This fluid would
seem to be of a different nature from that which occupied the cavity of
the hypoblastic vesicle, for the coagulum produced in it by the action of
the hardening liquid has a much more granular appearance in the sections.
Both epiblast and hypoblast throughout almost the whole extent are
composed of a simple layer of flattened cells joined edge to edge.     Those
of the former are represented in fig. 2, as seen flat in a separated portion,
those of the latter in fig. 3. Most of the epiblastic cells exhibit in a
high degree a condition of the nucleus which is frequently met with in
epithelial cells elsewhere — a tendency, namely, to become separated into a
clear colourless part, and a highly refracting and usually somewhat irre
gular body, which readily becomes stained by the usual colouring reagents.
This change is no doubt a post mortem effect, probably produced by the
action of the reagents employed.   The hypoblastic cells do not for the
most part present this appearance; their nucleus remains large, round,
and clear ; and the cell-substance does not become stained as much as that
of the epiblastic cells.
   It was mentioned above that the epiblastic and hypoblastic vesicles
come into closer proximity at one part of the circumference than
elsewhere   ; even here, however, they do not come into actual contact.
At this  place they are no longer formed, as elsewhere, of a single layer
of cells, but their component elements, besides being rounder in shape
and smaller, are two or three deep, although not arranged in as many
definite strata.   Both layers are in consequence somewhat thickened
just here, the thickening (which is most marked in the epiblastic vesicle)
extending over an area of about -g^- inch in diameter ; not sharply defined,
however, but gradually shading off into the thin part.    Both epiblast and
hypoblast are, it may be repeated, perfectly well defined and distinct from
one another here as elsewhere ; and there are no cells to be seen which do
not clearly belong to one or the other.      Moreover they are not only
separated by a small but obvious amount of the granular material (coagu
lated fluid) previously mentioned, but there is in addition an exquisitely
fine pellicle, which in the sections appears as a mere line passing over
and forming a definite boundary to the upper (outer) surface of the
hypoblast at the thickened area.     This membranous pellicle, for which    I
would venture to propose the name of membrana limitans hypoblastica,        is,
as made out   in teased preparations, perfectly homogeneous, and continues
so throughout its extent. It becomes stained slightly by carmine, but
apparently not at all by logwood, and    is  probably to be looked upon as
a cuticular formation produced      bythe hypoblastic cells.  Whether the
delicate pellicle may extend around the whole hypoblast in the natural

            am unable to say ; in the sections, at any rate, it appears to
terminate towards the periphery of the thickened area, and to have become
curled somewhat away from the hypoblast.
   I    am not aware that a similar structure                has yet been noticed in the
early blastoderm of any animal ;                but its importance in this case in bounding
the hypoblast is evident.   Indeed, if it should be found that the mem
brane in question is of general occurrence in the mammalian germ, and
that the first appearance of the mesoblastic cells occurs external to it,
as from its proximity to the hypoblast there is little reason to doubt, the
fact of the existence of such a film between the commencing mesoblast
and hypoblast is strongly in favour of the view which derives the former
from cells of the epiblast            as against that which would assign to        it   a   hypo-
blastic origin.

the Royal Society Library, to see a recent number of the new 1 Zeit-

by Hensen on the early stages of development of the rabbit's ovum.        In
sections of one blastoderm, of which he gives figures, there is a delicate
line at the anterior part of the germinal area lying midway between the
epiblast and hypoblast and marked m.pr.       This is referred to in the

text of the paper is incomplete (the completion is promised in the next
Number) ; and the full description of this blastoderm and the account of
the so-called
              " membrana prima " are for the present altogether wanting.

   But from Honsen's figure have very little doubt that his " membrana

ovum as       " membrana limitans hypoblastica," although the position and
relations of the membrane, especially with regard to the hypoblast, appear
somewhat differently in our respective drawings.          think the namoI
" membrana prima "              is,

     The phenomena of the rotation of movable conductors, carrying' cur
 rents, about lines of magnetic force are well known.               One form of ex
 periment, commonly called the rotating spark, presents, beside the actual
 rotation, some peculiar features which do not appear to have been noticed
 in detail. The instrumental arrangements consist of a partially exhausted
 chamber with a platinum point for one terminal, a ring for the other, and
 the intervening air or other gas for the movable conductor.                        The
 chamber is made in the form of a double cylinder, so that a magnet in
 serted through the ring may reach nearly to the point. The discharge
 then passes between the point and the ring, and revolves about the
 magnet according to Ampere's law.
     But beside the rotation, and even when, through weakening of the
 magnet, rotation does not actually take place, the spark, when carefully
 observed, is seen to assume a spiral form ; and the spiral is right-handed
  or left-handed according to both the direction of the current and the mag

  404                        Mr. W. Spottiswoode        oh               [Mar. 30,
  netic polarity. This effect is particularly noticeable if the magnetic pole
   be inserted only a short distance beyond the ring.        The discharge is then
   seen to spread itself out sheetwise on the ring       in the direction in which
  rotation would take place.        The  edge   of the sheet is in the form of a
   helix.
      The object of the following observations is to bring out the character
  of this phenomenon by making it a principal instead of a secondary
  feature of the experiment.
      The arrangement here described consisted in using the poles of an
  electromagnet as the terminals of a discharge from an induction-coil, and
  in observing the effect on the form of the discharge caused by exciting
  the electromagnet.       For this purpose the movable poles were insulated
  from the main body of the magnet by interposing a sheet of ebonite thick
  enough to prevent the passage of the discharge, but not thicker, in order
 as   little as possible to diminish   the strength of the magnetic poles. The
 discharge was then effected either in the open air or in a closed chamber.
 The latter was constructed of a short cylinder of glass, say 3 inches
 in length and     2 in diameter, having conical ends pointed inwards, so as
 to receive the poles of the magnet.         The chamber was also furnished with
 a pipe and stopcock for the purposes of exhaustion.
     The discharge from an induction-coil taken in air or other gas at
 atmospheric pressure consists, as is well known, primarily of the spark
 proper or bright line, irregular in form and instantaneous in duration.
 But beside this, when the primary wire is thick and the battery-current
 strong, the spark is enveloped in a bright cloud, or rather flame, which is
 capable of being thrown on one side, although not entirely detached from
 the spark, by a current of air.          This, when examined in a revolving
 mirror, is found to     be subsequent    in time to the spark proper, and may
 bo considered to be due      to  the gas in the neighbourhood       of the spark
 becoming sufficiently heated to conduct part of the discharge, and to the
 consequent combustion of any extraneous matter floating in the medium.
 Such a view is supported by the fact that the colour of this flame depends
partly upon the nature of the gas in which the discharge takes place, and
partly upon that of any volatilizable matter which may         be introduced near
the poles.                                    ,
     The exciting of the magnet produces upon the spark proper no appre
ciable effect ; but as soon as the flame is submitted to its action it is
spread out into a sheet, which arranges itself in a helicoid right-handed
or left-handed according to the direction of the current and of the mag
netic polarity in obedience to Ampere's law.
     Effects substantially the same are produced whether the discharge be
taken in gas at atmospheric or at a less pressure.            But in the former
case the helix has a lower,      in the latter a steeper gradient ; that is to say,
in the former      case  it presents  a greater, in the latter a less number of
turns for a given interval between the poles.

    But for producing the best effects, both of the rotating spark and also
 of the spirals, there is  a  limit beyond which the exhaustion should not be
 carried.   At a pressure   low enough to produce stratification, or even short
of it, the whole     chamber is filled with the discharge, and all traces of
rotation and of     spirals are obliterated.     The stage best suited to the
purpose is that    in which the discharge has thickened in diameter, and
where the spark    proper has been replaced by a suffused light of the thick
ness, say, of a quill.   If  the negative terminal be a surface (say the naked
surface of the soft iron pole of the electromagnet) instead of a point,
the sheet does not become        contracted at the negative end, but remains
spread out and cuts the iron pole in a line radiating from the point.
    Various gases were tried —atmospheric air, carbonic acid, ether, chlo
roform, coal-gas, hydrogen. Of these the first two succeeded best. With
air the illumination of the flame-sheet was rather greater ; but with car
bonic acid greater steadiness of position was obtained.        With both ether
and chloroform occasional flashes, brilliantly illuminated, were seen ; but
some chemical action appeared to take place militating against the steady
 development of the flame-sheet. With coal-gas there was an inconvenient
 deposit of carbon upon the sides of the chamber.           With hydrogen the
 cloud was not sufficiently developed.
    The success which attended the experiment with air may possibly be
 partly due, as suggested above, to the combustion of the extraneous
 matter floating therein ; and in fact the brilliancy and extent of the sheet
 may be increased by attaching a piece of metallic sodium to the negative
 terminal, or by causing a stream of any of the chlorides in powder, e. g. of
 strontium, lithium, &c, to flow across the field of action.
    When a piece of sodium (or better still of soda) is attached to one of
 the terminals, two effects may be noticed. When that terminal is negative
 the whole of the flame is bright yellow, showing that the sodium is not
 only detached but even carried across the field and deposited on the
 positive terminal.     When, however, the terminal to which the sodium is
 attached is positive, it is found that the flame, when observed through a
 red glass, appears yellow to a certain distance from that terminal, but red
 beyond, and also that the pitch of the helix is less near the positive than
 near the negative terminal.        These effects may be attributed to the pre
 sence of metallic vapour evolved by the heat at the positive terminal, but
 not carried across the field as when the terminal in question is negative.
    The following explanation of the phenomenon is due to Prof. Stokes,
 from whose correspondence it is substantially taken. The mathematical
 solution, although only roughly approximate, is perhaps still quite suffi
 cient to give the general character of the experimental results.
     The magnetic field will be supposed uniform, and the lines of force
 parallel straight lines from pole to pole. The path of the current when
 undisturbed   is also a straight Une from pole to pole. In such a condition
  of things, every thing being symmetrical, no rotation would take place.

But if through any local circumstance,              as  in the experiment          in air, or
through heating of the chamber as in the exhausted tube, or otherwise,
the path of the current be distorted and displaced, then each element will
be subject to the action        of two forces.         To estimate these, let        ds be an
element of the path, with rectangular components dx, dy, dz, C the
strengtli of the current, and R the magnetic force with components X,T, Z,
which in the first instance will be treated generally.                    Then one force
will  be that tending      to impel the current           in the direction of the axes
respectively, and may be expressed by
         C{Ydz

Besides   this, there will      be the    tendency of the current to follow the
shortest path so as to diminish          the resistance.            Representing this as a
tension r, the components at one end of ds will be

                   bo assumed that            a
element of volume of its substance in an electropolar state, and also that
dielectrics        have      a  property analogous to coercive force in magnetism
whereby time            is   requisite for the development or decay of this electro-
polar state, an              explanation of the residual charge of the Leyden jar

 408           On the Residual Charge      of the Leyden Jar.          [Mar. 30,
 easily follows.     Adding the hypothesis, which at first sight appears most
 probable to connect the induction and polarization with the time by two
 differential equations, it follows that the potential E of a Leyden jar
 when insulated      may be expressed in the form E=(A + Be— '''je-
 where X and fi are constants for the material, aud A and B depeud on
the previous states of the dielectric.
    2. Observations made with the quadrant electrometer, the condenser
being a Florence flask containing sulphuric acid, show that E cannot be
so expressed.        Glass is a mixture of different silicates, and it may be
supposed     that  each  substance is capable of independently being electro-
polar ; there will thus be E and more than one polarity to be connected
with the time by more than two differential equations.           Making a simi
lar obvious hypothesis regarding these relations, E must be expressed
in the form 2 Are—             If this be so, it would probablv    be possible to
                 o
charge a Leyden jar in such a way that the sign of the return charge
after discharge and insulation should change once or more.
   3. This anticipation was verified by charging the flask alternately posi
tively and negatively for successively decreasing periods. The author
learned after making this verification that Sir "William Thomson had tried
similar experiments before, but had never formally published them.
   4. The analogy between coercive force in magnetism and the electro-
coercive force suggested that,        as mechanical   agitation  shakes  out the
magnetism from a magnet, so it might shake down the electropolar state
of a dielectric and unmask residual charge more rapidly than is the case
in quiescence. This was found to be the case ; a residual charge manifests
itself in the flask more rapidly when the flask is tapped than when it is
quiet.    It was also found that that portion of the return charge which
comes out last is more accelerated by vibration         than that which comes
out first, and that, after tapping, the flask was less susceptible to the
effect of tapping than it was before it was touched.
   5.  Experiment shows that, after      a return charge   has  attained a maxi
mum and is decreasing by conduction through the glass, the loss per
cent, per unit of time does not continuously increase from zero at the
point of maximum potential but may presently decrease.
   6. Sir William Thomson explained specific inductive capacity by sup
posing every part of the dielectric to be electropolar under induction ;
by introducing time into that explanation, it is made to cover both specific
inductive     capacity and that on which residual charge depends as re
spectively rapid and slow cases of similar phenomena.

   In the Introduction to this Memoir a description was given of the
observations made by M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards on the gravid uteri
of several genera of Lemurs. The author then proceeded to describe the
gravid uteri of six Lemurs which he had received from Dr. Andrew
Davidson, of Antananarivo, Madagascar, viz. Propithecus diadema, Lemur
rufipes, and Tndrit brevieaudatm.       He then summarized the conclusions he
had arrived at in the course of his         dissections,   and showed that the
placenta in these animals was diffused and presumably therefore non-
deciduate.     The paper concluded with a discussion of the bearing of
these observations on the classification of the Lemurs, and on the theory
propounded by Haeckel of the descent of the deciduate mammals from
a primaeval root-form of Prosimia?.
IV. " On     the Movement of the Glass Case of           a  Radiometer." By
     William Crookes, F.R.S.            &c.   Received March 30, 1876.
   During the discussion which followed the reading of Prof. Reynolds's
and Dr. Schuster's papers at the last meeting of the Royal Society       I men
tioned an experiment bearing on the observations of Dr. Schuster.        I have
since tried this in a modified form ; and as the results are very decided and
appear calculated to throw light on many disputed points in the theory of
these obscure actions,   I venture to bring a description of the experiment,
and to show    the  apparatus at work, before the Society.
   I made use    of a radiometer described in a paper communicated to the
Society in January last.       I  quote the description from paragraph 184.
" A large radiometer in a 4-inch bulb was made with ten arms, eight of
them being of brass and the other two being a long watch-spring magnet.
The disks were of pith, blackened on one side. The power of the earth
on the magnet is too great to allow the arms to be set in rotation unless
a candle is brought    near  ;   but once started   it will continue to revolve
with the light some distance off."
   This radiometer was floated in a vessel of water ; and four candles
were placed round it so as to set the arms in rotation. A mark was
put on the glass envelope so as to enable a slight movement of rotation
to be seen.     The envelope turned very slowly a few degrees in one
direction, then stopped and turned a few degrees the opposite way ;
finally it took up a uniform but excessively slow movement in the direc
tion of the arms, but so slow that more than an hour would be occupied
in one revolution.

410                                   Presents.                            [Mar. 2,
    A powerful      magnet was now brought near the moving arms.               They
immediately stopped,      and   at the same  time the   glass envelope  commenced
to revolve in the opposite direction to that in which the arms had been
revolving.      The movement kept up as long as the candles were burning,
and the speed was one revolution in two minutes.
    The magnet was removed, the arms obeyed the force of radiation from
the candles and revolved rapidly, whilst the glass envelope quickly came
to rest and then rotated very slowly the same way as the arms went.
     The candles were blown out ; and as soon as the whole instrument had
come to rest a bar-magnet          was moved alternately from one side to the
 other of the radiometer, so as to cause the vanes to rotate as if they had
been under the influence of a candle.            The glass envelope moved with
 some    rapidity (about one revolution in three minutes) in the direction
 the arms were moving.         On reversing the direction of movement of the
arms the glass envelope changed direction also.
     These experiments show that the internal friction, either of the steel
 point on the glass socket, of the vanes against the residual air, or of both
 these causes combined, is considerable.        Moving the vanes round by the
 exterior magnet carries the whole envelope round in opposition to the
 friction of the water against the glass.
     As there is much discussion at present respecting the cause of these
 movements, and as some misunderstanding               seems to prevail as to my
 own views on the theory of the repulsion resulting from radiation,           I wish
 to take this opportunity of removing the impression that           I  hold opinions
 which are in antagonism to some strongly urged explanations of thes3
 actions.     I have on five or six occasions specially stated that   I wish to keep
  free from theories.      During my four years' work on this subject         I have
  accumulated a     large fund of experimental observations, and these often
  enable me to see difficulties      which could not be expected to occur to an
  investigator who has had but a limited experience ^ith the working of
  one or two instruments.

                 I. Its  external Form and Method         of Growth.
    The peculiar twisted appearance of the human umbilical cord has re
ceived much      attention from anatomists, and has been the subject of
much ingenious speculation.        According to Velpeau ('Embryologie') the
torsion begins as early as the seventh or eighth week, whilst Burdach
has not observed it earlier than the tenth.                 I  have repeatedly seen
foetuses, apparently of the twelfth and thirteenth week, in which no
appearance of twisting was observable in the cord, though one of the
 most perfectly twisted cords in my possession belongs to a fcotus of
 certainly not more than thirteen weeks' development.
     Velpeau attributes the twisting simply to the rotation of the foetus.
 Schroeder Van der     Kolk supposes that the blood flowing in the arteries
 exerts a backstroke influence on the pelvis of the swimming foetus, thus
 determining its revolution in one direction or the other, as the arteries
 are to be found to the right or left of the vein.           In order to dismiss this
 view we have only to recollect that the umbilicus could not in any way
 become a fixed axis, and that the mechanical arrangement of the heart,
 in the non-separation of its streams, would yield but a very weak im
 pulse until very late in pregnancy.        The revolution of the foetus is not
 known to occur, though its occurrence is probable. Such revolution
  occurs in the spawn of the frog as early as the first segmentation of the
 black sphere ; but then it is evidently the result of the necessity there is
 for an equal exposure of all parts of the embryo to the action of light
  and heat, just as the germinal spot is always uppermost in the bird's egg.
  No such necessity exists in the persistently included mammalian ovum,
  and the revolution of the foetus cannot be accepted. If it did occur it is
  highly improbable that the revolutions could number only from four to
  eighteen, these being the ranges       I have noticed in a large number of
  fully  developed  cords.   Another    objection to Schroeder's hypothesis is
  that, as a matter of fact, the arteries leave the omphalic ring nearly
  always    below the vein    and   symmetrically arranged in relation to it.
  Their passage to one or other side of it is seldom apparent till the ex
  ternal dermal ring has been reached.        Also    I  have seen the first revolu
  tion of the arteries    pass from right to left, after which they suddenly
  bent on themselves     and  passed up the cord in an irregularly straight
  course, whilst the vein maintained the normal spiral.               Further,  I have
  seen the arteries reverse their course about the middle         of the cord, though
  the vein maintained the uniform spiral.
      Sir James Simpson (' Edinburgh Medical Journal,'            July  1859) was of
                          * See Proceedings, vol. xxiii. p. 498.

  418                          Mr. Lawsou Tait       on the
  opinion that at the time of the commencement of the torsion the right
  iliac artery appears more like the continuance of the aorta than the left,
  the latter appearing more like a branch, the right having, therefore, a
  stronger blood-stream than the left ; it would thus influence the foetus.
  This supposition is ingenious ; but           I cannot find any fact which will
  support    it. I  have    examined     several  foetuses from the ninth to the
  sixteenth week without being able to discover any difference in the right
  and left iliac arteries.     Such difference, if it exist, should continue during
  the growth of the cord; and        I have entirely failed to find any evidence of
  it in any of the large number of foetuses          I  have examined.      Moreover,
  it seems greatly contradicted by the fact established by Hecker, that the
  twist is once to the left for 3-5 times to the right. Further, are we to
  suppose that in the cases of well-matured children in whose cords there
  are no twists, or only very slight ones, the embryo has continued perfectly
  still in the cavity of the amnion ?
      Neugebauer    (' Morphologie der menschlichen          Nabelschnur,'    Breslau,
  1858) explains the rotation by the pressure of the blood-stream on the
  walls of the vessels.         The umbilical vein, he states, has a greater area
  than the two arteries         together,   and is more distended,       the pressure
  diminishing its growth in length, whilst that of the arteries is unin-
  terfered with, and the natural arrangement must be spiral. "Whatever
  be the explanation,    it  is a fact which    my injections and dissections have
  established beyond dispute,       that  the arteries have a greater length than
  the vein in very many cases, but it is not true in all.
      In some cords the vein is longer than the arteries,        for it remains spiral
. whilst they go almost straight.        In  others the vein continues persistently
  and regularly a definite spiral direction, whilst both arteries course over
  it first in one direction and then excentrically in another, sometimes even
  turning back over their first course and presenting a varicose appearance
  on the cord, to return again to their normal direction.                 Neugebauer
  states what is in strict accordance with my own experience, that irregular
  twistings are very common on the arteries but very rare on the vein.               I
  have never seen one on the vein.
      Neugebauer further believes that the reason the majority of cords are
  twisted from right to left lies exclusively in a dissimilarity in the size of
  the arteries,   lie has found (in agreement with Simpson) that the right
  artery is larger than the left.         Occasionally, he states, the left is the
  larger of the two, and then the twist is reversed.
      Hyrtl (' Lehrbuch der Anatomie des Menschen ') states that the left
  artery is usually the larger of the two.          I  do not see, in the writings of
  either of these two authorities,      any details of the method of examination
  of their specimens.
      My own method         has   been   to remove the whole        thickness  of the
  abdominal wall from the base of the bladder up to and including the
  omphalic ring, along with a piece of cord.            This I place in my freezing

                          Anatomy     of the Umbilical Cord.                    419
machine, and cut from         it a number    of consecutive sections, examining at
intervals, by careful measurements, the two arteries.               I have seen no
reason to agree with the conclusions of Simpson and Neugebauer.                Even
if their position were established it could only refer to the contracted
condition of the vessels after death, and this would afford no accurate
clue to their relative sizes during life.          But even if it did it would not
explain,   as  I  shall  try to  show,   the spiral growth of the cord.
     In the investigation of this subject my first endeavour was to ascertain
 which of the three tubes in the cord had the greatest influence in main
 taining the spiral, either before the cord was separated from its con
nexions or after.        If, while the cord was still attached to both mother
 and child,   I passed a needle       through    the cord close to the child, so as
 to isolate the vein, and then compressed it against the needle, found      I
 that the spiral was completely maintained.             On the contrary, if  I com
 pressed the arteries and cord together towards the placenta, the cord
 emptied and became flaccid, losing its spiral appearance.             This was the
 case very markedly in the instance of a cord which is the most perfectly
 spiral in my possession.          On distention by injection it showed a com
 plete helix in the remarkably short distance of an inch and an eighth
 with a perfect lumen through the helix of three sixteenths in diameter.
 In this cord the arteries coiled together within the helix of the vein. In
 no cord which      I  have injected, and in which the twist was evident at all,
 has it not been as evident that the vein was the main factor in the twist.
 I   have established this by distending, in a well-twisted cord, the three
 vessels alternately with water.           Distention of the vein induces the com
 plete spiral of the cord.         Distention of one artery has little or no effect,
 and distention of both arteries in no case equalled the results obtained
 by distending the vein.          I have injected both arteries with some slightly
 resisting   material,    as stiff size, and after it has set  I have distended the
 vein with plaster of Paris, and in every case it has become evident that
 the chief spirality lies in the vein.         Injection of an artery with plaster
  of Paris and allowing the whole cord to dry seldom produces a well-
  marked spiral in any part of the cord, and never throughout its whole
  length.    A similar proceeding with the vein will produce a perfect spiral
  throughout the whole length of any cord which has the twist running
  through it.
      Neugebauer also found that blowing up the vein produced more marked
  twisting of the cord than blowing up the arteries.            In one of my speci
  mens injection with plaster has done so over a length of three feet, and
  the dried arteries are seen coiling round it; yet distention of these
  arteries by water did not produce any spiral at all.             In any regularly
  spiral  cord  the   arteries   will  always be    found on injection to be within
  the helix, a point which is very suggestive that the vein is the chief
   factor in the production of the twist. In such cords as those in which
   the whole development and the spiral are evidently deficient (and this

  420                           Mr. Lawson Tait      on the
  has no relation      whatever to the development of the child), the arteries
  are to be      seen  on   the outside of the imperfect helix, and this greater
  length has to be accommodated by twistings and reversions.                But even
  in such a cord sections are       to be  seen where the spiral becomes complete,
  and then the arteries take their normal place within the helix.
      Injection of one or both arteries by plaster, with subsequent drying,
  does not produce a spiral even in cases where the cord has shown a
  very marked spiral when the vein has been previously distended with
 water.
      When the spiral is faintly marked but the cord long, and the arteries
 not very much, if at all, longer than the vein, the spiral will be found
 always at the end near the fetus.            Thus in one specimen, which is very
 tvpical of this class, there are three well-marked helices occupying the
  six inches of the cord at the foetal end.            One artery was successfully
 injected, and it is seen to occupy an almost straight course in the middle
 of    the helices, the uninjected artery accompanying it closely, whilst
 further on they are both seen to follow, with only one reversion or
 doubling, the almost straight course of the vein.
     This last fact makes it very evident that the growth of the spiral is
 directed by some mechanism at the foetal end of the cord, and not by any
 hypothetical revolutions of the foetus.
     From the appearances of some cords it would also seem as if the spiral
 growth of the cord became interrupted for a short time, or even reversed,
 and then that it resumed its original direction.
     In the first and fourth volumes of the ' Encyclopaedia of Anatomy '
 some interesting quotations           are given by Vrolik and Mr.         J.  Hart.
 Vrolik gives      some   cases where    the vessels ran from the foetus to the
 placenta separately, and not twisted in a cord.              He also mentions that
 extreme shortness of the cord is generally accompanied by ectopia of the
 abdominal viscera, indicating an arrest of development at an early period
of embryogenesis.          Eudolphi states that the umbilical vein is persistentlv
 double in the Quadrumana of the new world ; but                I cannot anywhere
find a statement as to whether, in such a case, the cord is twisted
or not.
    I   think we may conclude from some of these facts that both the
growth of the cord and its spiral direction are due to some mechanism at
the omphalic ring, and that probably that mechanism is in a most im
mediate relation to the umbilical vein.
    Further,    I think   it certain that the greater part of the spiral, and the
closest coils of the spiral, are formed during the later months, or even
weeks, of gestation.          Thus in cords which are deficient in the spiral it is
always most marked near the foetus ; and in one which               I  have already
alluded to as the most perfectly spiral cord         I have seen, the helices were
complete      in  an  inch   and an  eighth  near the  child, whilst they graduallv
opened out towards the placenta, so that the last was nearly three inches

in length.          This could not   be the case   if
                                                the twisting were due to the
rotation     of the       during early embryonic life, as then we should
                        foetus
expect that the spiral would be uniformly spread over the cord,          indeed,    if,
it would not be most marked near the placenta. Neugebauer says that
the spirals have    uniform length, with the exception of those close to
                        a
the placenta, which are almost invariably longer.

the cord.

of the pelvis, might compress the cord to an unsafe extent. This com

   John Goodsir has shown how thoroughly the spiral runs through all

growth, and how perfectly   it is seen in joints. It is the universal direc
tion of growth in plants and shells, and may yet be shown to exist in
structures where little suspected.      If we accept the doctrine of con
tinuous descent, we can be at no loss to account for the presence of a
spiral in the umbilical cord, the most lowly organized structure in the
human economy.       If we do not accept that doctrine as more than an
hypothesis, the spiral growth of the cord may yet be advanced as an
argument in favour of its establishment.  To this end its history must
be carefully    worked   out, and to this               I hope,   to   be able to make a con
tribution in another note.
   Virchow is the only author whom                  I
                                        have found to state that capillaries
pass from the structures of the child into the substance of the cord ; but
there can be no doubt that he is correct.
  I  injected a large and fully developed still-born child with a strong
solution of Berlin blue in size, under the pressure of 350 millims. of
mercury.       Every organ was completely injected and the liver had given
way.
   At the foetal attachment of the cord, and running upwards from the
line of demarcation, was an arrangement of small capillaries.      These
were visible all round the attachment of the cord, but at some parts were
not more than               in length, while elsewhere they were 8 or 10
                  a millimetre
millims.  They did not seem to form loops, but to run straight out from
the dermal ring along the cord and immediately under its surface.
   There were five points at which the exaggeration in length was very
marked, three of these corresponding to the region of the vein, and one
to each of the arteries (Plate 11. fig. 2).
   It will be seen from this that the nutrition and growth of the cord,
supposing them to be in part due to this arrangement of blood-vessels,
must be unequal     — that   that one side will grow somewhat more than
                                   is,
that opposite. This, of course,     certain to result in

                                                                           a       ;
principle of unequal nutrition hope to be able to demonstrate in further

                                         II.   Its Covering.
  The naked-eye appearance of the covering of the umbilical cord needs
no minute description here. Like all other serous surfaces,     smooth           it   is
and glistening, and     continuous with the epithelium of the amniotic
                         it   is
surface    of the placenta     ;  very sharp line of demarcation exists
                                     but       a
between the epithelial surface of the cord and that of the skin covering
the omphalic canal.
   This line, however,   only isnaked-eye appearance

epithelial     surfaces, nor do      I think    that there is much difference in their
function.
     The epithelial covering of the cord is said to be derived from the
amnion ; but this is a loose method of description which has yet to be
substantiated.
      In all the microscopic examinations from which descriptions are taken
in this paper, the sections have been made by my freezing section cutter,
from fresh tissue unless otherwise stated ; and they have been submitted
to various staining-processes by the action of litmus, hematoxylin, red
cabbage, &c., as described in Humphrey and Turner's 'Journal of Anatomy
and Physiology,' May 1875.              The lenses used have been a half-inch and
a quarter-inch objectives of Natchet, with the corresponding eyepieces
 1, 2, and 3, and an immersion sixteenth of Hartnack.
    • To obtain
                  pieces of the epithelial surface of the fresh cord of any size
 and of sufficient thinness to see the surface transparently was a matter
 of considerable difficulty.          I  first of all tried freezing the fresh cord
 while pressed flat against a piece of glass, tearing off the glass and then
 cutting off the flattened surface. To the fact that the glass removed
 with it a great part of the epithelium            I  owe a most important though
 accidental observation.        I   further found that first smearing the glass
 with glycerine prevented the cord becoming intimately attached to it ; and
 by carefully washing off the glycerine by distilled water               I obtained a
 perfect epithelial     surface free    from   disturbance.    This I  examined  after
 being treated in various ways.             Soaking the section in an ammoniated
 solution of litmus or hematoxylin and reducing the colour by washing it
 in a '004 per cent, solution of nitric acid,             I found that the epithelial
 layer    was  single  and  composed       of irregularly polygonal cells, regularly
 nucleated.       These cells were bedded in a fibrillar matrix, very thin, and
 in    which  no  special structure could be discovered, and which is certainly
 only a slightly condensed arrangement of the canalicular system on which
 the cells lie.     Virchow has described the subepithelial tissue as a " some
 what denser dermoid layer ;
                                     "
                                         but  I  have failed to see any such analogy.
 The fusiform nuclei of the canalicular tissue are to be seen (Plate 11.
  fig. 6) immediately under the single layer of epithelium, lying in the direc
 tion of the long axis of the cord. These epithelial cells differ from similar
  cells on the foetal surface of the placenta and amnion only in being some
  what less regular in size and arrangement ; and, indeed, in these points
  they differ to a considerable extent on various parts of the cord itself, for
  they are slightly larger and more regular near the foetus than near the
  placenta.      That there is only a single layer of cells is a point on which
  I   am satisfied ; for  I have stained the whole layer removed on the glass,
  as   I described above, and     I  have never been able to focus one cell above
  another.
       further, in a microscopic section of a fresh cord stained with hema
  toxylin the epithelial covering may be seen to be turned over. The

124                          Mr. Lawson Tait        on the
nuclei are stained; and when they are brought into focus under a quarter
objective, it requires only about the thirtieth part of a revolution of a
fine screw adjustment to bring the subjacent fusiform nuclei into clear
definition, that screw having 56 threads to the inch.                The thickness of
the layer is therefore certainly not more than                 of an inch.
    For the silver treatment     I have employed      a solution    of lactate of silver
with the addition of some free lactic acid, and           I  have found the results
more definite than those given by the employment of a solution of the
nitrate.    The method is advised by Serge Alferow, of Charkow.                     This
treatment displays an irregularity of size and arrangement of the cells
such as   I  do not see in those of any other epithelial surface, and which
I  think must be due to the singleness of the layer. It is not due to my
method of treatment, for         I have seen it in small pieces which            I  have
snipped    off  by scissors, without  freezing    on  glass.    The   intercellular sub
stance takes on the characteristic brown colour (Plate 1 1 . fig. 3), and be
tween certain cells slight ganglioniform enlargements of this colour are to
be seen in great numbers — the stomata spuria of Klein.                I am in as great
doubt as that author whether these dark spots have any thing to do with
the subjacent canal-system.        They may have ; but         I  have seen nothing as
yet which convinces me that they are other than mere extensions of the
peculiar intercellular substance which first takes up the argentic stain.
That this stain is more than a mere filling up by the darkened solution
of intercellular gutters must be the conviction of any one who works to
any large extent with silver fluids ; for in other tissues it may be seen
to affect nuclei with avidity, as notably, in my own experience, it does in
the placenta and in the ovary.             Certain groups of cells in epithelial
surfaces are seen to take up this       colour   without apparent meaning ; but
this is much less frequent in the cord than in the amnion, &<;.
    The groups of small darkly coloured cells or nuclei which are now
admitted to mark the stomata of serous membranes are numerous on
the cord ; but     I am bound to state that my experience of them had to be
extended to other membranes before           I  could admit for them the inter
pretation which they had in the opinion of others, and notably of Koster.
They are unquestionably the orifices of the vast system of canals which
forms the basis of the cord and upon which it solely depends for its
nutrition. Hound their orifices, or within their entrance (I have not yet
decided which), are to be seen these small darkly shaded cells.                 I  doubt
if they are endothelia.       I believe  that  rather   they   are  young epithelia in
growth ; that, in fact, these stomata are the points of growth and ex
tension    of the epithelial layer of the cord, and that the groups of
darkly coloured cells of larger size to which          I  have already referred are
the same in further progress.          It certainly is the fact that round the
stomata the uncoloured cells are often of much smaller size than they are
at a little distance away.           At a few points         I   have been fortunate
enough    to   see these stomata   leading   directly  into   a  canal, into which the

staining-fluid       seemed   to have permeated,            and   therefore   rendered   it
distinct.
  But the absolute proof is to           be    found in     a   few preparations   where
the epithelium has been partly removed by the accident    have already    I
described.                           I
             Thus at one spot saw the edge of the coloured epithelium
curled up, displaying the naked (Plate 11. fig. 3) canals where it had
been removed     ;                     could be seen leading directly into
                     and there the stomal      a
the canals where the epithelium was still in situ. The canals will be seen
branched in all directions, with large central spaces.   At one point at
least   Icertainly saw such an enlargement correspond exactly with a
true stoma ; and though much remains to be done in this direction, it
seems to me more than likely that each of these lacunar enlargements
may be at any or at some time the site of a stoma.
   The number of stomata on the surface of the cord is certainly very
much less than the number of lacunar enlargements in the subjacent
canals.   But it does not seem probable that the sites of the stomata
are constant.    They seem rather to be in process of change, formed by
loss of epithelium and closed by its regeneration.    This is not much
more than speculation ; but it would explain some curious facts hitherto
not explicable.
  I  have already mentioned that there seems to be some difference in
the details of the arrangement of the epithelium at the foetal end of
the cord from that at the placental end. Perhaps these differences are
accidentalto the one cord examined for this purpose ; but even there
they are marked enough to be mentioned.      The cells are smaller and
more irregularly jointed, and more especially they seem elongated in
the direction of the long axis of the cord.  They are not so well marked
nor so  numerous,  and the darkened groups  of small cells are not much
seen.  The whole structure gives the impression as if it was older than
that nearer the foetus. Thus in the canals and in the stomata are to be
seen regular rows of minute refracting globules, visible only under very
high powers, the nature of which          I
                                   have been unable to make out as they
are seen only after deep silver staining.

                                                                      '
   Since the publication of Wharton's ' Adenographia    (London, 1656),
the name of "Wharton's jelly" has been retained for the proper substance
of the cord.
   Although the substance is in no sense gelatinous, the name is convenient
from its traditions, and it is likely to be retained.   The jelly-like appear
ance is due simply to a preponderance          of fluid contained in alveoli.
Virchow dismisses the chemical character of this fluid by saying that it
contains mucin.    So far as     I
                                 have gone, however, it contains much more
definite compounds, and seems closely to resemble the liquor amnii,                      if,
indeed,    be not that fluid itself.

  420                        Mr. Lawson Tait       on the
  tigntion than   I  have yet been able to give to it.     Virchow regards this
  tissue as ranking with embryonic subcutaneous tissue and the vitreous
  humour.     I am not yet in a position to give an opinion on this relation
  ship, though   I  think it possible.
     This alveolated tissue is divided, throughout the whole length of the
 cord, into three columns, one of which surrounds each blood-vessel. The
 divisions between these three columns are not visible to the naked eye,
 but they become very perceptible when the tissue is injected in the
 manner to be immediately described.           When the nozzle of the injecting-
 apparatus   is inserted  into the   tissue of one column, the fluid will be found
 to travel along that district only, unless such pressure is used as produces
 rupture of the limitation of the column.         The injection will be found to
 surround the blood-vessel of its district with great uniformity (as shown
 in Plate 11. fig. 4), but the injection will never be found to encroach upon
the walls of the vessel. The limitation can scarcely be said to be mem
branous ; for if the adjacent tissue of two columns be injected, the line
of demarcation where they touch cannot be made out.                   It seems to
depend upon the absence of communication between the canals of the
two columns.        This is a most interesting fact bearing on the nutrition
of the blood-vessels.
     Virchow describes the proper substance of the cord as consisting of
"reticulated tissue, the meshes of which contain mucin and a few
roundish cells, whilst its trabecular are composed of a striated fibrous
substance in which lie stellate corpuscles.        "When a good preparation has
been obtained by treatment with acetic acid, a symmetrical network of
cells is brought to view, which splits up the mass into regular divisions."
    Kijlliker considers the substance to be "immature connective tissue
with stellate anastomosing cells." "Weisemann thinks " it corresponds to
the skin and subcutaneous tissue in arrest of development."                 But it
Beems to me, however probable their explanations of the biological
relations of the tissue may be, that their descriptions of its anatomy
are only partially accurate and far from being complete.            The facts are
that the striated fibrous tissue is composed of the collapsed walk of
numerous canals of which alone the proper tissue of the cord is made
up. "When only partially emptied some of them appear like stellate
cells, and therefore they give the deceptive appearance of there being a
matrix in which Virchow's " connective-tissue corpuscles" are imbedded.
In the lacunar spaces of the system oval nuclei are imbedded in the
walls of the canals.       In  a large number of observations       I  have never
seen these nuclei alter their shape and position.
    Before detailing the results of my observations on these canals, it will
prove more satisfactory if     I  describe my methods of preparing the speci
mens observed.                     I                I
                      First of all may say that have in no instance drawn
a conclusion from observations made on a cord otherwise than perfectly
fresh, unless it is distinctly stated to the contrary.        I  have found the

                     Anatomy of the Umbilical Cord.                          427
examination   and treatment of tissue which      has been subjected   to hard
ening reagents so unsatisfactorythat     I
                                        have quite discarded it.
  All  my sections are made by the freezing process (described in Hum
phrey and Turner's Journal for May 1875), so that sections of the
perfectly fresh cord of about        of an inch in thickness have been
examined.    These have been subjected to various treatments — as simple
clearing by glycerine, destruction by acetic acid, staining by silver lactate,
and by my various indifferent staining-fluids, hematoxylin, litmus, cab
bage, &c. (also described in Humphrey and Turner's Journal).
  My injecting-apparatus    is so arranged that it acts automatically when
set at work. The tissue injected and the whole apparatus is surrounded
by a current of warm water, the temperature of which is registered.
The injecting force is supplied by compressed air admitted directly to
the surface of the injecting-fluid, and the pressure is registered by a
manometer.     The nozzles used vary in diameter from 1 to 4 millims.
The fluid used is a ten-per-cent. mixture of Seitels's Berlin blue sus
pended in firm size.   This does not stain the tissue because it is not in
solution, yet its granules are too small to be seen by any power of lens
in my possession. That it is not in solution is certain from the fact
that it is completely removed from the fluid by adding some albumen
and boiling.   Similar but not so satisfactory results may be obtained by
Davies's granular carmine ; but here the granules are too large to enter
the canals, save under such pressure as produces frequent extravasation.
   One disadvantage of the Berlin blue is that it contains a little free
acid, and must do so to remain visible.    After a short time this acid
destroys the colouring of the stained nuclei ; so that, save in an almost
perfectly fresh specimen, it is impossible to demonstrate the relations of
the nuclei to the canals when distended by the injection.
   The method of injection of these canals is apparently very rough.         It
consists simply in inserting a small nozzle superficially into the substance
of the cord over and parallel with the course of a vessel, tying it in, and
injecting under a low pressure of 50 or 60 millims. of mercury.
   Schweiger-Seidel   made the very obvious objection to this (Beckling-
hausen's) method that any appearances presented by it would be simply
those of extravasation.   Such was my own belief when       Ifirst tried it on
the cord ; but very short experience showed me that the result was a
regular and uniform injection of a system of canals, and that extravasa
tion was very rare and always limited to the immediate neighbourhood
of the wound in the cord. With the whole apparatus at a temperature
of 47° and a pressure of 60 millims.,        I
                                           have injected a column of the
cord for a distance of 9 inches in about half an hour.         The injection
travels rather more rapidly in the direction from the child to the placenta
than jn the opposite direction.
  I  have repeatedly seen minct« streams of the blue injecting fluid
flowing from the surface of the cord into the water surrounding evon   it,
                                                                2i2

428                           Mr. Lawson Tait        on the
at as low a pressure as 55 millims., with a nozzle only 1 millim. in dia
meter ; yet at a pressure of 350 millims.           I  have not produced a rent in
the surface of the cord, though         I have produced numerous extravasations
into the alveoli and into the neighbouring columns.                       The appearances
when these canals are distended are well shown in several of the draw
ings, but especially in Plate 11. figs. 5, 6, and Plate 12. fig. 14, in the
first of which they are       seen to   run up close to the muscular coat of the
artery.    Transverse and longitudinal sections of the same piece of the
cord show that they are stellate in every plane, and that they intercom
municate in every direction; but their processes are slightly longer in
the long axis of the cord than in any other.              This, however, is not con
stantly evident.
   Recklinghausen        regards these canals as wall-less spaces between the
anastomosing       cells,  simple interspaces in the connective-tissue                  basis
substance (" Ausgrabungen in der Bindegewebs-Grundsubstanz ") ; but
that this is not so my own observations, substantiating those of Koster,                    I
think completely established.           It is best proved by preparations of the
termination of the injected district, where the blue colour may be seen
running into the processes of the so-called stellate "connective-tissue
corpuscles," contrasting with the complete occupation by the colour of
every thing but the alveoli*. It is in these alveoli exclusively that                 I have
found the round migratory cells.
   Henle thinks that the anastomosing cells may be the foundation plan
for blood-vessels (" Gefassanlage "), such as are seen in the umbilical cords

of all mammals but man. So far, however, as have yet seen the vessels
which extend over the mammalian cord are chiefly on its surface, as I
have already mentioned they are to a limited extent at the foetal inser
tion of the human cord ; but this point is one for further research.
It is scarcely possible, however, to regard a system of canals which
constitutes the whole tissu-e of the cord as a representative of blood-vessels,
otherwise    it must somewhere        be seen as an almost erectile tissue.
   Pohmann       has asserted that he has injected a complete system of lym
phatic   vessels   in the cord by quicksilver; and though Virchow thinks
that his material has permeated the alveoli, and Hyrtl that his lymphatics
are mere chasms in the tissue,            I  think it possible that he really has
injected these canals, but that from his inability to make sections which
would retain the quicksilver in the tissue, he has not demonstrated the
facts of his system.         This difficulty is obviated by the use of size and
Berlin blue.
    Staining with silver lactate (1 in 800, with slight excess of lactic acid)
leaves the canals as clear white spaces (Plate 11. fig. 3), but gives a decided
brown edge to them, which shows that they are walled.                        Their general
appearance after this treatment closely corresponds to that seen after

their injection minus the extreme distention.        I  have never seen any
appearance of endothelia in these canals ; but there is a very constant
relation of nuclei to their walls in the lacunar spaces.        These nuclei,
when examined by a power of 200 diameters, seem to be fusiform (Plate 11 .
fig. 8) ; but when examined by a sixteenth immersion-lens, they are found
to be of a regular oval shape, and to have a nucleolus which is very small
in proportion to the mass of protoplasm (Plate 11. fig. 7). They are not
always solitary, and occasionally one large nucleus may be seen asso
ciated with a number of smaller structures which seem identical.        These
nuclei are readily shown by acetic acid ; but by such treatment their re
lations to the lacunae are destroyed. They readily take up the colouring-

matter of an indifferent solution of haematoxylin ; but have not yet been
able to colour them with litmus.      These nuclei are constant.
   In the alveoli, which lie between the anastomosing branches and also
between the lacuna of the canals, are sometimes found numbers of round
cells.   They do not readily take up haematoxylin, at least       I have not
often been enabled to find them by means of that stain, but they readilv
absorb the litmus colour.      "When examined by a quarter they appear
like round free nuclei ; but if examined very carefully, or with a sixteeuth,
they are seen to have a thin layer of uncoloured protoplasm round them.
Tbey are in fact cells (or nuclei) in which the nucleus (or nucleolus) is
disproportionately   large for its envelope : they are not constant.       In
some cords, especially when removed from large children, they are found
very   scantily ; whilst in the cord of a small eight months' child
                   I
(Plate 12. fig. 9) found them to be extremely abundant. They are also,
as in this instance, found far more numerous in some parts of the cord
than in others, and in one district of the cord than in another.     They are
most abundant close to the umbilicus, and in the districts in which the
capillaries are seen.    They are certainly free in the alveoli ; for  I have
seen them wandering and exhibiting amoeboid movements on the warm
stage,  after having taken up the litmus colour.      I  have never seen the
lacunar nuclei exhibit any movements, nor have       I ever seen any appear
ance as if they multiplied by division.      These round cells may not be
confined to the alveoli, however, as they seem     scattered over the tissue
in the uninjected cord. In the injected cord       I  have seen them in the
alveoli only.    In sections taken near the umbilicus they are seen to be
most numerous in the vicinity of a small capillary which ran up the
cord certainly to as far as half an inch from the ring. Here they are
also seen to be of larger size than elsewhere (Plate 12. fig. 11), and to ap
pear close to the mass of blood-corpuscles which, as a clot, occlude this
capillary.    My inference is that they originate in this neighbourhood
(to be afterwards more carefully described) and migrate throughout the
cord.    They do not ever appear as if they multiplied by division.       The
walls of this small vessel had no muscular fibre, but seemed to be formed
merely by a condensation of the canalicular tissue.

430                          Mr. Lawson Tait         on the
  Koster regards these two forms of cells'as the              same, and
                                                              differing only
in position.    But he has evidently neither applied high powers no.-
delicate stains to them, so as to discover the presence of a nucleolus in
one and its absence in the other.   The different actions on them of litmus
and hematoxylin seem very decisive as to their being different structures,
and probably having different functions.      They are also quite different
in size and  appearance.
   Koster states that he has seen the nuclei of the lacunae send tins shoots
into the branching canals. This is only an optical delusion, which is
dispelled by the use of the high power immersion-lens.
    I   conclude,   therefore,  that the proper tissue of the cord is entirely
canalicular.        How   the canals are formed, and what relation their nuclei
have to their growth and nutrition, has yet to be determined.      is, of      It
course, more than probable that the explanation of the growth of the
stellate corpuscles advanced by Virchow, Aeby, and Eberth is applicable
to the lacunar canals ; that         is,
                               that they are the result of cell modifica
tion, the body of the corpuscle expanding into      membrane for the
                                                                  a
formation of the lacuna and its processes, whilst the nucleus remains
for nutritive reproduction. This, however,    am not yet prepared to

   Koster speaks of having seen " in silver-stained sections irregular or
interrupted lines showing through the white canals, which remind us of

   It    is then      easy to discriminate between the canalicular and
                       quite
muscular           but in the unprepared, or in the stained section, it is
              tissue    ;
impossible to decide where exactly the muscular fibre begins, especially
if the blood-vessel bas been distended, for then the layers of canalicular
tissue immediately outside the blood-vessel are stretched so as to be
parallel                to the general course of the muscular fibres. It
             in direction
will    be seen, therefore, that the whole column of the cord constitutes the
external coat of the blood-vessel, and also the substitute for the vasa
vasomm which are seen in other arteries.
   I  have already described an arrangement of blood-vessels at the root
of the cord when speaking of its method of growth, but something more
must here be said on this point. When the nozzle of the syringe is tied
into the still attached cord an inch or two from the foetal insertion, with
the stream towards the foetus, the injection is made to travel with some
difficulty, and it is always found to terminate in a sort of cone outside
the blood-vessel, the apex of which is just within the dermal ring (Plate 12.
fig. 13).   At this point it seems impossible to get the injection to travel
round the blood-vessel as it does elsewhere in the cord — that           have    is,
                                                                                 I

  When the extreme apex of the cone obtained by injecting the substance
of the cord near the ring      examined
                                    is                 by

that the injected canals (Plate 12. fig. 14) run up to and border immediately
upon the nucleated fibrous and muscular tissue which constitutes the
omphalic ring.     I        have failed to inject any capillaries    from the tissue in
this way.
  It    clear, then, that there must be some special arrangement for the
        is
nutritive supply of the substance of the cord, as    does not obtain any
                                                                it

nutrition of the cord, could hardly be considered as sufficient to do the
whole work.
   When the capillary plexus running from the dermal ring (already
described) has been successfully injected,        have found that
                                                        I               peculiar

vascular arrangement       also displayed in the centre of the cord, lying in
                               is
the firm nucleated tissue which forms the omphalic ring, and to which                   is
due unquestionably not only the process of growth of the cord, but also
in great measure its nutrition and the processes of closure of the vessels
of the ring, and the removal of the stump by inflammatory ulceration.
   The basis of this arrangement           peculiar sacculated sinus,
                                              is   a                       mere   a
excavation in the fibrous tissue, as      haveI  been quite  unable  to demon
strate any definite wall for it. It seems to have         spiral arrangement

432                           Mr. Lawson Tait       on the
could.     It extends from the omphalic ring at least 12 millims. up into
the true substance of the cord, giving off at short intervals thick trunks
which rapidly break up into capillaries.            Nowhere in this peculiar vas
cular arrangement of the cord, either central or superficial, have              I seen
the capillaries turn up in loops as if to go back.            They open, as    I   have
seen in innumerable instances, directly into the canalicular system              ;  and
it is possible to inject a large extent of           all these districts of the sub
stance of the cord by placing a nozzle in the vein and first injecting the
foetus.     After that has been accomplished, the capillaries, and finally the
canalicular tissue of the cord, can be seen filling.           In one section (Plate
 13. fig. 15) the capillaries were seen opening into a limited district of the
canalicular tissue, which evidently was somewhere near the apex of its
cone.
    The injected tissue was in immediate relation to the walls of an
artery and of a vein.         I  believe that under favourable circumstances          I
may yet      succeed    in this   way in injecting the whole substance of the
cord.
     The point of origin of this sinus       I have as yet failed to work out ; but
 I  conclude it comes from the intereosto-lumbar arteries, as the injection
 of the cord does not appear until the skin of the abdomen is perfectly
 blue.
     The superficial layer of capillaries may also be seen entering the cana
 licular tissue of the cord. They lie immediately under the surface of
 the cord.
     It is quite evident that the analogy between this capillary supply for
 the cord and the Havorsian system of canals in bone is complete.                   The
 Haversian     canals    admit   red  corpuscles,  but   the  stellate lacunaa   admit
 only liquor sanguinis.         So it is with this nutrient arrangement of the
 cord ;   and  not   only  is  the   function of the stellate canals of the cord
 identical with that of the lacunae and canaliculi of bone, but their
 anatomy is the same minus the deposit of the salts of lime which occupy
 the alveoli.    In   the cord the place of the salts of lime is occupied            by
                                                            "
 water containing      some organic compounds.                 . •
     In one cord     I  found    a capillary   extending nearly an inch from the
 omphalic structures, and which,           when its surrounding and concentric
 layers of nucleated canals were stained with hsematoxylin, very closely
 resembled an Haversian system (Plate 13. fig. 16).              This is probably the
 continuation of the central sinus, as it does not appear to have a definite
 wall, and it lay about the middle of the section.
     As yet   I  have not been able to demonstrate this vascular mechanism
 in any but perfectly fresh and mature children, because the friction to
 be overcome in order to make the injection pass round the front walls of
 the abdomen is so great that it requires a greater pressure than the
 liver will stand iu immature children, which generally have been dead
  eorue time before they are injected.

    In all
         previous descriptions it seems to have been taken for granted
that the umbilical vein and arteries are identical with blood-vessels else
where ; but        I
               have already pointed out some important differences, and
I have now to describe some                 others.
   When the arteries and vein of a cord which has been removed from
a mature      and living child are examined, the arteries are found con
tracted to a very small size, and the vein is also found to be much con
tracted.     The introduction of a tapering probe into the canal of an
artery or of a vein shows that it can be readily dilated ; and the forcible
distention of the whole tube with water may be made to enlarge the
diameter of the tube as much as four or five times.              In the vein the
possible   distention  is even  greater ; but in  both there  is a limit to   and         it,
the walls are so strong that they resist         pressure of 800 millims.
                                                              a               The
distention    isquite equable,   and never  presents any   sacculations.
   The proper tissue of the vessel          made up of the ordinary fusiform
                                                     is
fibre-cells with their characteristic rod-shaped oval nuclei, the external
coat being, as    I have already shown, the canalicular tissue of the district
proper    to each  blood-vessel.    To the arteries there      certainly no inner
                                                                              is
or endothelial coat, though when the vessel          contracted, the inner fibres
                                                                   is
being pressed into folds by the contractions of the outer layers, their
nuclei present at the apex of the fold very deceptive appearance (Plate 14.
                                                     a
fig. 25).    Staining with silver or haematoxylin, however, gives the most
decided indications of the absence of endothelium in the arteries, but in
the vein     it   is   probably present.
   When      section

living child, in which one artery has been distended and the other left
untouched,        it   will                       produces an arrangement
                              be seen that the contraction
of folds somewhat resembling what takes place in the closure of the
oesophagus.    The inner layers contract; but the outer layers seem to
contract still more, so that the internal fibres become bent on themselves
and form rugose prominences, which almost meet in the middle of the
lumen of the tube (Plate 13. fig. 20)   In the vein the muscular wall                            is
much thinner, and this folding of the inner walls   not seen.            is
  This does not take place in any other artery which      have examined        I
for the purpose        ;   at least,   if
                                        it   does so     it   becomes   undone' after death; but
I did not find           it   in the carotid of        a    guineapig    divided   and examined
immediately after death.
    This extraordinary             power of contraction of the umbilical artery           is    due
to three conditions — the exceptional thickness of the muscular layer, the
absence  of any restraint by   firm external or any internal coat, and
                                            a                                                    a
peculiar arrangement of the external bundles of muscular fibres.
   In the distended artery, examined after the addition of acetic acid, or
after treatment            by
                    hematoxylin or silver lactate, the rod-shaped nuclei
are seen     to lie all in parallel             directions,       which are concentric with the

434,                          Mr. Lawson Tait on        the
lumen of the tube.          In  the contracted artery it is different.   The fibres
are seen distinctly to be arranged in bundles, and these bundles have
different directions.        Some are seen to be cut across, whilst others can
be traced      passing downwards through the section and ending on the
lower surface. When a very thin section is made, stained, dried on the
 slide, and mounted in balsam or dammar, here and there two layers of
 bundles are seen, one immediately above the other, crossing one another
like the limbs of St. Andrew's cross. Again, two sets of bundles may
 seem to be arranged like the webs on the shaft of a feather ; longitudinal
 sections show this still better.           Prolonged exposure to the action of
 acetic acid shows, in a longitudinal section of an artery, that the muscu
lar fibres are arranged in bundles, the directions of which occupy a
 double spiral (Plate 13. fig. 17), somewhat like that carefully described by
 Dr. Bell Pettigrew as being the arrangement of the fibres of the heart.
 Silver-staining also demonstrates this.           I  have made a diagram of this
 arrangement (Plate 13. fig. 18), and it may be fairly well illustrated by the
 way in which a ball of twine is cast on the spindle.           If the hole through
 which the spindle has been passed be supposed to represent the lumen of
 the artery, a distention of that aperture would, if the string were elastic
 as the   fusiform fibres are, drag the string into       a uniform direction con
 centric with the hole.        There can be no doubt that such an arrangement,
 especially   in  the external bundles, where it seems to be most marked,
 would    be of great mechanical advantage        in the closure of the vessels.
     One makroscopic fact is certainly in support of this view, which is
 that the length of an artery in the umbilical cord is very perceptibly
 diminished after its distention.
    It  remains    a very interesting      point to consider whether this spiral
arrangement will not be           found to exist in other arteries as well as in
those of the umbilical cord.            Dr. Beale figures it   as occurring    in the
longitudinal fibres of the aorta of the horse.
    In support of my statement that there is no endothelium                   in the
arteries of the cord      I  may detail the following observations.
    In   the case of the vein silver-staining reveals no diSerence            in the
arrangement of the inner surface before and after distention with air,
and the appearances are very much the same as is seen in the endothe
lium of other vessels.         But in the arteries, if the inner surface   be  silver-
stained before distention,         the brown lines will be found to include       long
fusiform     spaces very different from those seen enclosing endothelium
elsewhere (Plate 14. fig. 25) ; and if the same artery be distended with air
and then stained, the fine brown lines will be found to be replaced by
thick and much       less regular    brown interspaces (Plate 14. fig. 26). There,
it appears to     me, the    fusiform cells are elongated to their utmost and
somewhat separated; and the appearance.? are inconsistent with my
experience of vessels elsewhere lined with endothelium, and they are
quite consistent with the appearances noted after the treatment of trans

                         Anatomy      of the Umbilical Cord.                            435
verse sections of the umbilical arteries, distended and undistended, with
vegetable-colour stains.
    I  have already stated that        I   have failed to find any trace of nerve-
fibres in any part of the cord.               By what mechanism, then, can this
process of contraction be set going ? It seems to me that the answer is
readily found in three facts.             First, there is no endothelium in the
umbilical arteries, and the muscular fibres are therefore directly in con
tact with the blood which flows          in them, that blood being venous           as long
as the placental       circulation   continues *.      Second, it has now been well
established, by Dr. Bichard Norris and others, that contractility exists
in muscle itself, and that nerve-influence is only its regulator, its exciter,
 or even its controller.        Muscles depend most for their contractility on
the contact of arterial blood.         Thirdly, in the infant this happens to the
muscular fibre of the umbilical arteries with the first few respirations.
The blood in them up till that time has been venous, and suddenly
becoming arterial, it throws them into violent contraction.                   By the ces
sation of the supply of arterial blood they may again dilate; for Simpson,
in his collected memoirs (posthumous edition, vol. i. p. 228),                says,
                                                                                     " It is
generally acknowledged by physiologists, as the result of various observa
tions, that immediately after the child is born the umbilical vessels cease
to pulsate and carry blood if the pulmonary respiration becomes active,
 and  if the pulmonary respiration is by any cause interrupted or arrested
before the cord is divided, the circulation through the umbilical vessels
again becomes more or less active.               Hence various practitioners have
gone so far as to aver that it is unnecessary, as a general rule, to place
a ligature upon the foetal extremity of the cut umbilical cord if the cord
be not cut    till the child has cried loudly."
    This  I  have repeatedly verified by experiment.                By refraining from
dividing the cord for a few minutes after the child is born, some very
interesting observations can be made.             If   the child do not cry at once,
and the placenta        be left in situ, the arteries of the cord may be felt to
pulsate strongly.       If the child cries freely, they at once cease to beat and
contract to firm threads, being felt through the flabby cord almost like
cartilage.    Should the child's respiration cease for a few moments they
again relax and pulsate, and contract once more when the child cries.
When the possibility of the circulation through the cord is arrested by
the application of a ligature its stump soon ceases to give any indication
of pulsation, because only arterial blood can then pass into it. The con
traction and subsequent obliteration of the hypogastric arteries take place
   * The arterialization of  the blood  in  the capillaries, especially of the central veins
of the cord, may also have much to do in exciting the contraction of the arterial coats.
It may also be from this central sinus that this peculiar form of haemorrhage occurs,
which is sometimes seen after the separation of the stump.
   This hemorrhage is passive but arterial, and is seldom controlled by any ordinary
hemostatic agency.     The abseneo of muscular walls froin this sinus seems to explain
some of the facts of this hemorrhage.

436                             Mr. Lawson Tait        on the
in exactly similar ways         ; indeed my observations were first made in these
arteries    and were    subsequently      extended to the cord.
    The permanent closure of these vessels and of the stump of the cord
is accomplished partially by clot, but chiefly by the aid of the round
wandering cells previously described.               They also play a very important
part    in  what   is  an    extremely    common     cause of premature death and
expulsion of the foetus.           My conclusions are based upon the examination
of the omphalic         structures     of several children who have died within
thirty-six hours after birth, but chiefly on two           cases of omphalic    throm
bosis.
     It seems   that immediately         the arteries of the cord have contracted
and the inner layers have been pressed into the folds already described
(Plate 13. fig. 20), the remaining interval is filled with blood which
coagulates.      In the stump of a cord which had belonged to a child
which     lived only      a   few hours,    I  found the tissue of all the vessels
permeated with the large round nucleated cells, and a few had even
 entered the mass of blood-corpuscles.             "Where the clot was not present
 these cells seemed to become adherent by a granular blastema to the
 inner surface of the wall, and to tend to arrange themselves in processes
 on the apices of the folds (Plate 14. fig. 22).             It is doubtless through
 the agency of these cells mainly that the vessels are closed.             I have seen
 complete closure without any trace of a clot ; and in such a case these
 cells alone must effect the process.           In a case where the child had lived
 about two days, and the cord was partly desiccated, the internal layer of
 muscular fibres of the arteries had in great part disappeared, leaving
 lacunar spaces, which were occupied by the large cells, and a complete
 layer of them existed between the muscular coat and the clot.
     This was more and more evident           as the sections neared the child.    The
 appearances     of  this   retrograde change (Plate 14. fig. 23) at some parts of
 this cord were so curious as to become almost suggestive that the mus
 cular fibre and the nucleated canalicular tissue are developed from the
 same cells, that they are a mere modification            of the  same  tissue.   Some
 of the cells mentioned           as lying in the retrograde lacuna) of the inner
 layer of the muscular fibres of the artery possessed the same peculiar
  small nucleolus as is seen in the nuclei of the canals.              These cells are
  also seen apparently passing through amongst               the outer   layers of the
 arterial coat.
     In   a case where a dead          child was expelled at the eighth month,
 clots were found to occupy the arteries from the base of the bladder
  to within a short distance of the cord ; and in this cord (Plate 12. fig. 9)
 the round cells were abundant throughout the cord, and were especially
 numerons in the meshes of the muscular tissues of the arteries.                Round
  the clot was a complete ring of these cells, apparently intimately asso
  ciated with it  ;  and a few of the cells could even be seen isolated among
  the blood-corpuscles, though this appearance may be due merely to their

dislodgement during the process of preparation                    of the section (Plate 12.
fig. 11).
   Further  proofs that these wandering cells are very efficient in the
various processes of the cord and an indication of the source of their
origin are obtained by the examination of the cords in cases of extra
uterine gestation.     I
                      have operated in two such cases, removing chil
dren which were quite fresh, one having been dead probably from six to
ten days, and the other about three months.   In both cases the cords
were unaltered, save that in the second it seemed to be somewhat
shrivelled.   In    the first case          it was full and plump; but the vessels
were uncontracted   and unclosed, and there were no indications of any
wandering  cells anywhere, though the canalicular nuclei were easily dis
played.   The appearances in the second were somewhat similar, with the
addition that the canalicular tissue was contracted, just as it becomes
when the cord is examined after maceration    in some hardening fluid.
The canalicular nuclei were not easily shown, and appeared only here
and there.
   In such displacement the child seems to die of asphyxia, from the
closure of some part of the canals of the mechanism by which the
blood is oxygenated, and which               will probably       be   found to occur in the
placenta.  The foetal circulation ceasing, we have an arrest of the pro
duction of the wandering cells by the omphalic capillaries ; and conse
quently they are absent from the tissue of the cord, and there is no
attempt to close the vessels.
   The fact that thrombosis of the arteries occurs at least eight times
more frequently than thrombosis of the vein*, and that the clots are
always adherent to the walls of the arteries and more firmly than to the
walls of the vein, seems also to point to this conclusion.
                   V. Its Relations         to the Foetus   and Placenta.
   The relations of the cord to the foetus and placenta are very interest
ing.    The foetal attachment of the cord has already been described at
some length when speaking of the vascular supply to the canalicular
tissue.   In the omphalic ring nothing of the cord is found but the mus
cular substance of the three vessels which pass inwards, the arteries
towards the pelvis, and the vein on its passage to the liver.
   The canalicular tissue ends in three of the cone-like processes already
described, and into which the capillaries open, either from the superficial
layer or from the central sinus, or from both.
   The limitation of the canalicular tissue of the cord at its placental
attachment is quite as abrupt.
   When the nozzle of the syringe is inserted into one of the columns of
the cord a short distance from the placenta and directed towards                       it,   a
ligature being placed tightly round the cord and nozzle to prevent regur-

                                           Kinderkrankheiten,'    1873.

438                        Mr. Lawson Tait        on the
gitation, it will  be  found impossible to force the fluid into the substance
of the placenta.      It is limited by a membrane, derived from the inner
layer  of the chorion,   into which the arteries pass to be included between
two layers of it, and from between which two layers the veins emerge.
Tliis membrane is very tough ; and if extreme pressure be used the fluid
will be found to pass under the ligature and down the column which is
being injected, or by rupture into one of the other columns, but never,
according to my experiments, can it be made to pass through that mem
brane.    There is absolutely no connexion, therefore, between the nutri
tive system of the cord and that of the placenta.
    The amnion is loosely attached over the placenta by some cellular
tissue, which Arthur Farre describes as the tunica media.                 But the
amnion becomes adherent to the cord a few lines on the foetal side of the
basis membrane of the placenta.
    The relations of this attachment have yet to be made out.
                                VI.   Its Nutrition.
    From what    I have already said it will be apparent that       I  regard the
chief factor in the nutrition of the cord to be the capillary arrangements
at its foota! insertion, at which point the cord grows and obtains its
 spiral form, and from which also it derives its supply of wandering cells.
 From the facts observed in cases of extra-uterine gestation, however, it
 has seemed to me to be likely that the stomata on the epithelial surface
 of the cord also play an important part in its nutrition. The liquor
amnii contains casein, creatin, lactic acid, grape-sugar, and some saline
 matter, all of which are very suggestive that the fluid is used for the
 purposes of nutrition, and perhaps for that of the cord.               In recent
 cases of extra-uterine foetation, before the liquor amnii becomes absorbed,
 the cord remains fresh and plump.         After the liquor amnii has become
 absorbed it becomes shrivelled, but still retains its structural character
 minus the wandering cells.        It may be, therefore, that the canalicular
 nuclei may be able to keep the cord in repair, as it were, by the matters
 absorbed from the liquor amnii, until that fluid disappears, very much as
 ivy continues to live after its connexion with the root      has   been   severed.
 Indeed the resemblance between the umbilical          cord and vegetable tissue
 is a very close one, as   I  have previously indicated, and as   I may in future
  communications be able to make still more clear.
                   Appendix.- — Received        June  14, 1875.
    Since the preceding note was written,          I have been able completely
 to verify Virchow's depiction of the arrangement of capillaries on the
 surface of the cord, in continuity with those of the dermal ring.
    The existence of this arrangement, however, must         be exceptional,   and

                          Anatomy     of the Umbilical Cord.                  439
 is probably only an early stage of the more perfect            plan  already de
 scribed, for  I  have only found it in this one case.
    The foetus in which the observation was made was a large one, but
 not fully developed, having probably not reached within six weeks of
 maturity. The injection was very successful, and was made under a pres
 sure of only 100 millims., and the plexus of vessels was seen to extend
 about 5 millims. over the venous surface of the cord (Plate 13. fig. 21,6).
 But on examining the vessels with a power of thirty diameters, it is readily
 seen that these capillaries did not return in loops, but seemed to be lost
in the substance of the cord — contrasting in this relation very markedly
with the capillaries of the dermal ring, from a large trunk of which
they arose.      These latter are arranged in loops for the return of the
circulation, as is the case with capillaries almost everywhere else ; but
those in the cord have an arrangement more like that of the branches
of a tree. Further, it is noticeable that the capillaries spreading over
 the surface of the cord may be seen to arise by the aggregation of
smaller roots, just as       I  have pointed out to be the case in the forma
tion of the central sinus of the cord (Plate 13. fig. 21, a).
    None of the canalicular tissue of the cord could be seen to have been
injected from these capillaries; but the pressure used was too low to
 accomplish that, as the injection had to be made for another purpose.
    The umbilical cord in this case had been cut off about 60 millims.
 from the dermal ring, and the injection as usual was made from the
vein.
    On making a section of the cord immediately below the ligature which
retained the injecting nozzle, a small spot of injection was seen in the
 substance of the cord lying close outside the wall of the vein.         This was
found to be    the   central   sinus of the cord ; and  on being carefully traced
towards the foetus, it was found to curve spirally close alongside the vein
and to enter and pass through the omphalic canal in the midst of the
three vessels.
    Throughout its course, examination          by a power of thirty diameters
showed that     it gave    off branches which rapidly broke up and were lost
in the tissue of the cord.
    Finally, it was found to arise from several small branches, four of which
 at least are preserved and are represented in the drawing (Plate 13. fig. 19).
 They arose from the lower intercostal arteries, and gathering together on
 the lower surface of the omphalic vein, combined in the omphalic canal
to form the sinus.
    From this case     it is evident that this sinus at least occasionally passes
 very  far  into   the   cord, as the point where it was discovered was at
 least 45 millims. from the dermal ring.
    (I think it is possible that the radicles of this sinus may be what
Kolliker described      as the nerve-twigs   derived from the hepatic plexus.)

        Museum.       Received February 28, 1876.
                                    (Abstract.)
     The method adopted for estimating the mutual friction of water and
air. consisted in connecting a glass tube of 8 ccntims. in length and 0-72
 internal diameter with the pipes which supply Vienna with water at a
 pressure of four atmospheres.        Arrangements for securing a vertical
 position for the tube ensure a perfectly continuous jet, devoid of any
 broken surface ; and a glass tube surrounding this jet, with its axis coin
 ciding with that of the jet, acts as an aspirator into and along which air is
 drawn through a lateral feeding-tube.      The amount of this indrawn air
 corresponding to the fall of a given amount of water was determined by
 observing the rate at which a film of soap was borne along the feeding-
 tube ; and the velocity of the water causing the indraught was calculated
 from the diameter of the water column and the quantity of water dis
 charged along it in a given time ; but after having once determined
 the form of the slightly conical water column, the amount of water dis
  charged was the only datum required for the calculation.
     The influence of a greater or less section of the air feeding-tube on
  the volume of the aspirated air was carefully determined, while also the
 absence of any appreciable retardation         due to the soap film was
  established.
     Neglecting the slightly conical character of the surface of the water
  column, and assuming (as the result of experiments in which the motion
  of a smoke cloud was observed) that the movement of the air was
  throughout in lines parallel to the axis of the tube along which it flowed,
  and showing that the pressure does not vary along the length of the tube,
  the author proceeds to discuss the     hydrodynamic equations expressing
  the conditions of the problem (the motion of the air being uniform and
  independent of time), and represents the volume of air A passing through
  the tube  in a second as : —

radius of the jet in turns of the micrometer-screw (6-8 turns of which
correspond to 1 centim.), B. being the radius of the aspirating tube.
    The results obtained by observation accorded well with those given by
this equation, so long as the value of E did not exceed the limit within
which the suppositions regarding the motion of the air hold good.
     The question was considered whether the results might not be brought
into even closer accord with theory by the assumption that a slipping
action takes place between the air and the water-jet on the one hand, and
between the air and the tube on the other, instead of the assumption pre
viously made that the air adhered alike to the water and to the tube in its
passage. The result of the calculation, however, led to no nearer ap
proximation ; and, finally, experiments with other materials for the tube
and other gases          (namely, coal-gas and carbonic anhydride)            were    made,
without resulting in any marked difference from the results obtained with
air and glass.
II. " An       Inquiry into the Cause of the slow Pulse in Jaundice."
         By J. Wickham         Legg,M.D., Demonstrator of Morbid Anatomy
         in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Communicated by J. Burdon
          Sandekson, M.D., Professor of Physiology in University Col
         lege, London.         Received February 24th, 1876.
     It   has  long been known to physicians that the pulse of patients
 jaundiced and free from fever is often slow.                 But    I am not acquainted
 with any definite investigation into this subject until about thirteen years
 ago, when Eohrig published his researches upon the influence of the bile
 upon the heart*.          He Mas the first to find out that the bile-acids, not the
  pigments nor the cholestearin, had the power to render the pulse slow.
 He formed the opinion that this slow pulse was caused by a paralysis of
 the cardiac ganglia, because the pulse became slow after the injection of
 the bile-acids into the jugular vein, even when the vagi had been cut,
 and because the heart of the frog, cut out and plunged into a solution of
 bile-acids, beat a less number of times than when cut out and immersed
in serum.
     The following year Traube published an altogether different explana-
tiont. It is well known that the bile-acids have the power of dissolving

  the blood-corpuscles.         If these bile-acids, therefore, be injected into the
  jugular    rein,   they destroy or injure the red corpuscles with -which they
 meet, and the blood containing dissolved red corpuscles and bile-acids is
 quickly brought to the left side of the heart and thence into the coronary
 arteries. This blood is unfit for the exchange of oxygen with the
 muscular substance of the heart, as the red blood-corpuscles are so
 much injured ; and it is to the consequent change in the muscular
 ¦walls of the heart that Traube apparently              attributes the slow pulse of
jaundice.
     About the same time Johannes Banke, in the course of his researches
into the phenomena of tetanus, arrived at the conclusion that the bile-
acids have a paralyzing action upon the striped muscular tissue, and that
it is solely by the action of these acids upon the muscular fibres of the
heart that the slow pulse is caused*. He agrees with Traube in opposi
tion to Eohrig and Landoist.
     I have repeated most of the experiments of those who have gone before
me ; but those only will be detailed which seem to throw a new light upon
the matter in hand.
     The bile-acids employed in these researches were prepared from ox
 gall by a slight modification of the process recommended by KiihneJ.
I   have to thank my friend Dr. Shuter, of Caius College, Cambridge,
 Assistant Demonstrator of Physiology in St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
 for his kindness in preparing for my use some of the bile-acids used in
 these experiments.         In nearly all instances the bile-acids were dissolved
 in distilled water, 10 per cent, in strength.             I  should mention that the
 acids were not separated from their combination with soda.
     My first experiments were directed altogether to the heart of the frog,
 which lends itself readily to researches of this kind, as it can be separated
from its attachments, and its contractions kept up by being fed with
 serum by means of an artificial circulation.                             I

 decide if the slow pulse be due to an excitement of the ends of the vagus
in the heart.

lowing observations were taken : —

     Four other like experiments with the like results were made : in one
of them the bile-acids were added to the serum first, and the atropine
added afterwards ; but the same results were attained.                      The slowness
of the pulse arose         as before, and was unchanged            by the addition of the
atropine.       If    it be true, then,     that atropine     paralyzes the ends of the
vagus in the heart, it would appear that the slow pulse is not due to any
 excitement of the ends of these nerves in the heart.                  The great height of
the curves just before the heart ceased to beat does not favour, either, the
belief that the slow pulse is due to a weakening of the muscular walls.

     In order to test the foregoing experiments, made further experiments
 upon the irritability of the vagus in poisoning by the bile-acids.
     The heart and vagus of a frog laid bare.                   Heart beating 12 in 15'.
 The right vagus then irritated by induced electricity: the "heart stood still
 in diastole. Three or four drops of the pharmaceutical solution of
atropine now let fall upon the heart.                Five minutes after the beats were
 7  in  15*. The right vagus was then again irritated by induced electricitv,
with no change in the heart. After ten minutes, four drops of a 10-per
cent, solution of bile-acids were let fall upon the heart and neighbour
hood.        Thereupon, for nearly a minute, the heart-beats rose to 10 in 15",

   1876.]              Cause   of the slow Pulse in Jaundice.                 445
  but directly after fell to 6 in 15'. Five minutes after, the beats being
  still 6 in 15", the right vagus was again irritated, but no change followed.
  Three minutes after the beats were 5 in 15". Experiment was then,
  broken off.
     Two other like experiments were made and with like results.             They
  would seem to show that the bile-acids do not restore to the vagus the
  inhibitory power destroyed by the atropine.
     If, then, the slowness of the pulse be not due to the influence of the
  vagus on the heart, there remain two other factors in the movements of
 the heart to be considered      — the ganglia and the muscular walls. Look
 ing at the muscular walls as the cause of the slow pulse, it became of
 great importance to examine with care the experiments of Traube and
 Johannes Eanke, as to the action of the bile-acids upon striped muscular
 tissue.     Traube    himself   has   made no     immediate  observations   upon
 muscle.      He believes that the heart muscle is the organ affected, solely
 apparently because the low blood pressure and slow pulse so quickly dis
 appear.      I can confirm nearly all Traube's statements of fact by observa
 tions of my own.         Only the ecchymoses in the conjunctiva of the side
 used for injection have       I failed to see. The inspiratory spasm on the
 injection of the bile-acids into the carotid is extremely well marked, and
 persists after the removal of the cerebral hemispheres.          But it is hard
                                                        "                "
 to agree with his explanation of facts, and his muscular-motor            theory
 remains at present a pure hypothesis.
     In   repeating Eanke's experiments       I followed his method of injecting
 10 cubic centimetres of a 1-per-cent. solution of bile-acids in saline solu
 tion into the aorta of frogs.        I noticed all the phenomena which he has
 described — the irregular contractions of the muscles of the limbs as the
injection passed into them, their rigidity and hardness immediately after
the     injection, and the absence of contraction on the application of
electricity to the sciatic nerves. Eanke seems to think these appearances
are best explained by supposing that the bile-acids have a specific in
fluence upon muscular tissue.            Knowing, however, the power which
the    bile-acids  possess of  coagulating albumen (a 1-per-cent. solution will
coagulate white of egg), it seems to me that the appearances seen would
be very fully explained by the chemical action of the bile-acids upon the
albuminous substances of the muscle ; and a chemical action Eanke him
self admits.       I was thus led to make a series of experiments in which
the bile-acids should not be immediately brought into contact with the
muscles, but should act by means of the natural process of absorption.
The bile-acid solution was injected into the lymphatic sac or under the
skin of frogs.        The amount given varied from -05 to -3 grin. Twelve
experiments were made, and in nearly all no change in the curve traced
by the myograph could be detected after the injection of the bile-acids,
the observations lasting up to the time that the muscles responded to ¦
any amount of electricity that        I was able to bring to bear upon them.

446                       Dr.  J.  Wickham Legg on the                        [Apr.   6,
   The method used was as follows : the sciatic nerve was prepared,
carefully avoiding all injury of blood-vessels ; the tendon of the gastro
cnemius was attached to a string, and separated from the heel. The frog
was then put into a moist chamber, and the string attached to the tendo
Achillis fastened to a telegraph lever writing on a revolving cylinder.
The sciatic nerve was then irritated by means of electricity from a Du-
Bois-Eeymond's coil ; it was applied not oftener than once every 60",
and only of such amount as to cause the muscle to contract.
    I here extract from my experiment-book a few experiments detailed at
length.
    Jan. 22. — Excellent normal curves obtained. *1 grm. of bile-acids
injected under skin of back : no change in the curves, save that they
grow smaller in height from 15m to 60m after the injection.
    Feb. 2. — -3 grm. of bile-acids injected into the lymph-sac of frog             : no
change from normal curves from 16m to 92m after the injection.
    In    three of these experiments changes in the natural curve were
noticed after the injection of the bile-acids.            The same appearance was
seen    in all three, namely, that the muscle was         a long time    in recovering
itself.     The down stroke of the muscle curve took some space before it
reached the abscissa. In two of these cases, however, the muscle curves
taken before the injection of the bile-acids showed the same appearance.
After the injection the prolongation of the curve became somewhat more
marked, varied by returns to almost normal markings.                    It is thus im
possible     to attribute any weight    to  these variations.     The  amount    of bile-
acid given in these two cases was -2 and -3 grm. respectively.                   In the
third case in which this lengthening of the curve was noticed no mark
ings were taken before the injection, so that from this case it is again
impossible to draw any inference.             The amount of bile-acid given was
•3  grm.
    If,  then,   the bile-acids have no physiological           action upon striped
muscular tissue, have they yet any chemical influence upon the ventricle
alone ?       I thought, therefore, of making some experiments upon the
action of the bile-acids on the ventricle when separated from the rest of
the heart.       It is commonly said that the ventricle of the frog's heart
continues to beat for some time after it be severed from the auricles.
I  found, however, that the time was not long enough, nor the beating
of the ventricle constant enough, to enable me to judge of the difference
in time taken to bring the ventricle to a standstill if immersed in serum,
or in serum containing 1 per cent, of bile-acids.                I therefore fell back
upon a method lately employed by Luciani*.                 It consists in introducing
into the ventricle of the frog's heart a tube divided vertically by a
septum, and tying the ventricle on to the cannula below the auricles.
The heart is supplied by serum through the double cannula, and each

pulsation is recorded by        a manometer*.     I  made five of these experi
ments, but could detect no change in the alternate standstill and tetanus,
described by Luciani, after the introduction of bile-acids in 1 per cent,
into the serum, nor after the removal of the bile-acid serum and the
feeding of the heart with pure serum.         Both before and after the use of
the bile-acids the contractions of the ventricle were the same.            It would
seem, therefore, that the bile-acids have no influence, either chemical or
physiological, upon the ventricle of the frog's heart separated from the
auricles.
   If,  then, the bile-acids have no influence upon the ends of the vagus in
the heart, nor upon the muscular tissue, there remains, in the present
state of knowledge, only one other cause of the heart's movement which
may beget a slow pulse, viz. the ganglia of the heart.            Arguing, there
fore, per viam exclusionis, the same conclusion is reached as that of
Eohrig, viz. that it is the action of the bile-acids upon the ganglia of the
heart which causes the slow pulse in jaundice.           The same conclusion is
come to, but upon altogether different grounds ; for it must be acknow
ledged that the grounds upon which Eohrig formed his opinion seem, in
the present state of physiology, to be insufficient.
   I  have also made some experiments upon the influence which the bile-
acids have upon the rate of pulsation of the lymphatic hearts of frogs.
The rate does not seem to be in any way influenced by the bile-acids.
The heart only begins to beat more slowly where general death is setting
in from the action of the poison. The blood-heart, on the contrary, begins
to feel the influence of the poison within a few minutes of its injection,
and the pulsations may sink from 13 to 3 in 15' in seven minutes after the
injection of 1 cubic centimetre of the bile-acid solution under the skin.
   I have made six observations upon the lymph-hearts, of which               I add
the details of one.

      'Challenger'       Expedition. Communicated by Prof. Wyyille
      Thomson, F.R.S., Director of the Civilian Scientific Staff.
      Received March 6, 1876.
                                      (Abstract.)
   In  a paper    treating mainly of the structure of Heliopora cctrulea,
communicated to the Boyal Society in the autumn of 1875, some account
was given of results arrived at from the examination of two species of
Millepora obtained at Bermuda and at Zamboangan, Philippines ; and
in that paper a summary of the literature concerning the tabulate corals
generally was given.        The present paper, to be considered to a certain
extent   a continuation     of the last, gives an account of the structure of
a species of Millepora obtained at Tahiti, Society Islands.       The author
 commences by expressing his obligations to his colleague Mr. J. Murray,
who obtained living specimens of the Millepora and handed them over
to him with the zooids in the expanded condition for examination, and
who further, having devoted some time to the study of the coral, gave
him valuable information with regard to several points in its structure.

1876.]                Str ucture of a Species of Millepora.                        449
     No Millepora appears to have been hitherto known to occur at Tahiti.
The name of the species of the one the structure of which is described
in the paper was not ascertained.                   It resembles M. tuberculoid, as
described by Milne-Edwards *, in outward form, but differs from it in
having the calicles of two kinds disposed on the surface of the corallum
in regular separate systems, in this respect resembling more closely
M. plicata, M. foliata, and M. Ehrenbergii as described by the same
author.
     The coral was examined in the fresh condition,               and also preserved
in alcohol, chromic acid, and glycerine, and treated with osmic acid.
Hardened specimens were decalcified and examined by means of sections.
The corallum is a spongy mass composed of more or less contorted
trabecular of calcareous matter, which is disposed in a series of thin
layers following the contours of the surface, and representing successive
additions by growth.            Within these layers ramify a series of canals
 which give off branches and subbranches, the whole ramifications being
 intimately connected with one another, and with the calicular cavities, by
 a network of smaller channels.             The main canals are sometimes large
 enough to be easily seen by the naked eye, and run for as great a
 distance on the surface of the corallum as 1| inch.                   This system of
 branching canals is held to be characteristic of the coralla formed by the
 hydroid genus Millepora, distinguishing it from all other coralla. The
 calicles are of two kinds, small and large.                 They are disposed on the
 surface    of  the corallum    in  irregularly circular systems. A large calicle
 occupies the centre of each system, and is surrounded by a ring of
  smaller calicles, usually from five to eight in number.               In histological
 structure, as also in chemical composition t, the coralla of the genus
 Millepora seem to show no marked differences from Anthozoan coralla.
     The zooids are of two kinds.          The one, short and stout, occupies the
 larger central calicles of the systems, has from four to six short knobbed
 tentacles, and is provided with a mouth and certain gastric cells, closely
 resembling those figured by Allman as occurring in Oemmaria implexa +.
 The other kind occupies the smaller calicles, is longer and more slender
 than the mouthed zooid, has from five to twenty tentacles, and no trace
 of a mouth.       The usual number of tentacles in the mouthless zooid is
 about twelve to fifteen.         The tentacles are larger than in the mouthed
  zooid, and disposed at irregular intervals along the body.                They show
  the transverse striation,      or apparent septa, so characteristic of the tenta
  cles  of hydroids.     They have spheroidal            heads composed of masses of
 thread-cells.
      The zooids of both kinds are provided with well-marked longitudinal

 muscular    fibres, which are disposed in bundles, and are attached infe-
 riorly to the vessels of the hydrophyton which join the somatic cavity at
 the base of the zooids.           Circular muscular fibres are possibly also
  present.    As  in  Heliopora, only a thin layer at the surface of the coral is
  living.
      The soft parts of the hydrophyton      consist of a network of canals and
  vessels  occupying the corresponding canals in the coralluin. The canals
  are composed of an ectoderm and endoderm.              The ectoderm rests on a
 thin layer of membrane.         It is mainly composed of fusiform fine granu
 lar cells with an oval nucleus, but is much modified in certain regions.
 In the upper part of the living layer its cells are abundantly converted
 into the parent cells of thread-cells, and on the actual surface into a
 layer of prismatic cells showing at the very surface hexagonal outlines.
 This layer is believed to be continuous over the whole outer surface of
 the coral.     It is continued down into the calicular cavities, and in the
 contracted    condition   almost closes their orifices.  The endoderm consists
 of two elements    —  yellow pigmented cells closely similar to those of other
 hydroids, and small transparent highly refracting globules.           The pig
 mented cells are abundant in the somatic cavities of the zooids, and in
 the canals and vessels of the hydrophyton.          They impart a bright yellow
 colour to the tips of the tubercles of the living coral.      The canal-system
 of the hydrophyton anastomoses most freely with the somatic cavities
of the zooids, and establishes a free communication between them. Two
kinds of thread-cells are present. The one is of the peculiar form occur
ring only in Hydrozoa, viz. that which has in the expanded condition a
short, wide, bladder-like structure at the base of the thread next the cell,
which bladder is armed with three spines set in one whorl. In Mille
pora the spines are unusually long and set at right angles to the thread.
This kind of thread-cell alone occurs in the tentacles; it occurs also
more sparingly in the hydrophyton.
     The other kind of thread-cell is larger and ovoidal in form, closely
resembling that figured by Allnian as occurring in Gemmaria implea-a.
These thread-cells     are confined to the hydrophyton.       They form densely
set zones around the bases of the zooids.
     The other species of Millepora examined appear to agree in all essen
tial particulars with that occurring at Tahiti. They have mouthed and
mouthless zooids, but these are not arranged in regular systems.           They
have the same two kinds of thread-cells, with a similar distribution.
The Tahitian Millepora, like the others examined, is infested by a para
sitic fungus, which exists in the soft superficial tissues, as well as in the
substance of the corallum, and has a decided green tint.

        1876.
    Since my communication of the above-cited Paper to the Boyal Society
on the 16th December, 1875, two important contributions to the Anatomy
of Antedon have appeared — one by Dr. Ludwig, chiefly based on his
study of Antedon Eschrichtii (" Zur Anatomie der Crinoiden," Zeitschrift
f iir Wissenschaf tliche Zoologie, Bd. xxvi. 1876, p. 361, continued in Nach-
richten von der Konigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften und der G. A.

Greef, of Marburg (Sitzungsberichte der Gesellschaft zur Beforderung
der gesammten Naturwissenschaften               zu Marburg, January 1876), both
of which seem to have been prompted by the appearance of Professor
Semper's short paper on the subject.              These able observers fully concur
with me, as to all essential particulars, in the account            I have given of the
triple canal-system of the arms, which M. Edmund Perrier not only
could not himself find, but ventured to predict that no one else would
find ; in fact, Professor GreeFs figure of a transverse section of an arm
might have been copied from one of the drawings                 I   have had by me for
more than ten years, save for one slight additional feature. The German
investigators also accept the correctness of the statements made by me
in my First Memoir, that the " nerve of Midler is really the genital

though neither is disposed to believe with me that this
nerve.      The character of a nerve, on the other hand, is assigned by
Ludwig to a fibrillar band lying beneath the epithelial floor of the ventral
furrow of the arms ; which band had been independently noticed by my
son, Mr. P. H. Carpenter t (who is at present working in the laboratory
of Professor Semper at "Wiirzburg), in two of Professor Semper's Philip
pine species, Actinometra armata and A. nigra, as also in Antedon
Eschrichtii, in which it had been previously discovered by Ludwig.                   It is
not nearly so distinct, however, in A. rosaceus ; but its existence in that
 species was also independently recognized by Professor Huxley, who,
 like Ludwig, was led by his general view of the homologies of the
 Crinoids to regard it as a nerve.          My son regards both the ventral band

arms of Actinometra armata and       A. nigra —two pairs of branches running
on each side towards       the dorsal surface, and two towards     the ventral,
where he has distinctly traced their ramifications as far as the leaflets
bounding the ventral furrow.        Prof. Greet , on the other hand, describes
the whole epithelial floor of the ventral furrow as a nerve, on the ground
that its histological     character resembles that    of the nerves of   other
Echinoderms.
    Having recently had an opportunity of examining at "Wuraburg the
very thin sections prepared by my son,       I can say with certainty that the
fibrillar band is quite distinct from the layer of columnar epithelium which
it underlies ; but it appeared to me to send off very minute fibrils that
pass up between the cells of which that layer is composed.
    To myself it appears by no means improbable, looking alike to its
position and to its histological characters, that this band is a nerve ; but
having regard to its immediate proximity to the sensory (ventral) surface,
and to its separation from the muscles by the interposition of the triple
canal-system,     I  cannot but think it more likely that it is functionally
related rather to the former than to the latter      — in other words, that it
is an afferent rather than a motor nerve.
    As it seemed to me that important evidence might be obtained on this
                                                        I
point from experiments made on the living animal, took the opportunity
afforded by my recent visit to the Zoological Station at Naples to insti
tute such experiments; the results of which       I am desirous of appending
to my Paper, as they seem to me to place the doctrine advocated in it
 beyond reasonable doubt.
    Every one who has had the opportunity of observing the habits of the
living Antedon well knows the peculiarly rhythmical and symmetrical
swimming action which it executes when it spontaneously leaves or is
detached from the anchorage afforded by the grasp of its dorsal cirrhi.
Each of its five rays divaricates into two arms, which may be characterized
 (like the two legs proceeding from the human trunk) as the right and the
 left respectively ; and the act of swimming consists in the alternate
 consentaneous advancement of the Jive right and then of the Jive hfl
 arms, each of which is bent forwards in a curve which resembles that of
 the swan's neck in its graceful arch, and is then straightened backwards.
 The perfect similarity of the movements of all the five arms that work
 together, involving the conjoint contraction of several hundred pairs of
 muscles, seems to me to point almost certainly to coordination through a
 nervous centre ; and it will be seen that experiment has fully confirmed
 that conclusion.
     It will  be recollected that the centre   of what  I regard as the motor
 nervous    system is the quinquelocular      organ  contained  in the eentro-
 dorsal basin, which Miiller (who did        not recognize its cavitary sub
 division)   characterized  as a heart.   Midler's view of its nature is still

upheld by Greef (loc. ext.), who says that it gives off vessels to the cirrhi,
and regards what      I
                      have described as a circular commissure (analogous
to the " circle of Willis ") as a closed blood-vascular system in connexion
with this, although he admits that the axial cords of the arms, which
are derived from this ring, are solid.  The careful and repeated investi
gations  Ihave made on this point, however, have fully satisfied me that
my previous statement was correct.     There is no passage whatever out of
the chambers into the axial cords either of the cirrhi or the rays ; and in
the pedunculate Crinoids, as in the early Pentacrinoid stage of Antedon,
there is no ventricular        dilatation, the solid -radial cords directly      arising
from the axis.
     Experiment 1. —Taking up a large and vigorous specimen of Antedon,
I    turned the entire visceral mass out of the calyx, leaving behind                 it,
therefore, as the centrum of the animal, only the calcareous segments of
the calyx with their muscles and ligaments, the centro-dorsal basin with
its cirrhi, and the five-chambered organ contained in the cavity of that
basin. On replacing the animal in the water,      executed the
                                                         it                 xisual stvim-
ming movement as perfectly as the entire animal had previously              done.
   Experiment      2—
                    I     removed fromsecond specimen, which
                                               a                took out I
of the water in the act of swimming, the entire centro-dorsal basin, with
its contents and appendages, leaving every other part as    was. On re
                                                                    it
placing the animal in the water, all the arms were rigidly straightened out,
apparently    by
               the action of the elastic ligaments, which the muscles were
powerless to antagonize.
   This second experiment, then, not only confirmed my previous belief
that the source of the perfect coordination of the swimming movements
lies in  aNervous centre, but seemed to establish beyond doubt that the
quinquelocular organ     the instrument of that coordination — the centre
                          is
of   Nervous system, whose peripheral portion consists of the axial cords
     a
of the rays, arms, and pinnules. On the other hand, the first experiment,
taken in connexion with the second, clearly shows that nothing contained
in the Visceral mass   essential to the perfect coordination of the swim
                          is
ming movements.     And since      clearly in the oral ring that we should
                                     it   is
expect to find the centre of any nervous system lying immediately be
neath the tentacular furrow,     seems to me fair to conclude that the
                                     it
supposed "nerve" of Ludwig,               if   a   nerve at all,   has no    immediate
relation to those movements.
   Experiment 3. — divided, in another lively specimen of Antedon, the
                    I
soft parts of one of the arms down to the calcareous segment, thereby
cutting through the "nerve" of Ludwig.     This ought, on his supposition,
to paralyze the arm so treated, or at any rate to destroy the consen-
taneousness between its movements and those of the other arms.         But
on replacing the specimen in water, all the arms worked as usual, without
the slightest disturbance of regularity.

    Experiment 4. — then endeavoured to make a corresponding section
 of my nerve, the " axial cord," by cutting from the dorsal side of the
arm, with the blade of a very thin knife, sufficiently deep between the
 segments to divide that cord without injuring the
                                                                " nerve " of Ludwig.
Having been repeatedly baffled in this endeavour, however, by the throw-
ing-off of the half-divided arm,         I  had. recourse to another method, the
application    of nitric  acid.    Carefully   drying with a bit of blotting-paper
the part to be thus burned away, so as to prevent the spreading of the
acid,   I  applied it with a finely pointed camel-hair pencil, until              I  had
reason to feel sure that it must have reached the axial canal.                   On re
placing    the  animal   in  the  water,  that  arm    remained  rigidly  stretched  otti,
while all the other arms worked as usual.
    Now if these experiments, taken in connexion with the one described
in my Paper, which        I  have again repeated with the same result, are not
admitted as valid evidence that the quinquelocular organ with its radia
ting cords constitute a Nervous system,               I am at a loss to understand
what is the superior probative        force  of   the  evidence  which is universally
held to justify the assignment of such functions to the Brain, Spinal
Cord, and the white solid cords proceeding from these centres in a
Vertebrate animal.        And    I  should feel it necessary to enter a strong
protest against the refusal of a similar character to what            I hold to be the
Nervous system of the Crinoida (if based on no other objection than
that its position does not correspond with that of the accredited Nervous
system of other Echinodermata), were it not that an investigation which
I   commenced seven years ago into the structure of the Ophiurida
showed that they will probably afford the means of bridging over this
 difficulty ; for the calcareous segments of their arms, instead of being
perforated by a central canal, have a deep notch on their ventral margin,
 which is sometimes almost completed into a canal ; so that there is
 here an easy passage on the one hand towards the ventral nerve-cord of
the    Asteroida,   on the      other  towards      the   central nerve-cord     of the
 Crinoida.      Further, it is to be borne in mind that in the early stage of
 the development of the Pentacrinoid larva of Antedon, as described in
 the First Part of my Memoir (Phil. Trans. 1855), the " axial cords
                                                                                    " lie
 on the ventral surface of the Eadials and Brachials, which are then mere
 flat plates ; by an endogenous thickening of the calcareous network of
 those plates, the axial cords come to lie in furrows channelled out in their
 ventral surfaces ; while by a further endogenous growth of that network
 these ventral furrows are completed into canals; and it is by a still
 further endogenous thickening that these canals finally come to occupy
 the centre of each Badial and Brachial calcareous segment.
                           I                         I
     At the same time would repeat that see no reason for refusing to
 believe that the subepithelial band of Ludwig is a sensory nerve, the
 functions of the single trunk of the Asteroida being here divided between

an ordinary spinal nerve is divided in the head between the 5th and
7th pairs. And it seems not unlikely that while the "axial cords"
(motor nerves) of the arms are derived from the peripheral part of the
Crinoidal axis, the " ventral bands

                                          (sensory nerves) are derived from
the central part of that axis, which has been shown to be continued, as
the " axial prolongation," to the oral ring.

    After referring to certain modifications in his former method of work
ing at high pressures, the author describes some preliminary experiments
which were undertaken to determine the change of capacity in the capil
lary bore of the glass tubes under the pressures employed. From these
experiments it appears that, on raising the pressure from 5 to 110 atmo
 spheres, the capacity was increased for each atmosphere by only
 O0000036, and that this change of capacity was chiefly due to com
 pression of the internal walls of the glass tube. Another set of experi
 ments was made to ascertain whether air or carbonic-acid gas is absorbed
 at high pressures to any appreciable extent by mercury. Por the method
 of operating and other details reference must be made to the original
 memoir; but the general result is that no absorption whatever takes
 place, even at pressures of 50 or 100 atmospheres.          The pressures are
 given according   to  the indications   of  the  air-manometer  in the absence
 of sufficient data (which the author hopes will         be soon supplied) for
 reducing them to true pressures.      In the mean time it is probable, from
 the experiments of Cailletet, that the indications of the air-manometer
 are almost exact at 200 atmospheres, and        for lower pressures do not in
 any case deviate more than        from the true amount.
    In a note which was published last year in the ' Proceedings ' of the
 Society (No. 163), it was stated that the coefficient of expansion (a) for
 heat under constant pressure changes in value both with the pressure and

It will be observed that the value of a. increases with the pressure until
a very   high pressure is attained, when it changes its direction and

the high pressure having passed from the gaseous state proper to the in

     As the general result of this investigation, it follows that in the ordi
nary gaseous state the law of Gay-Lussac does not hold good, either in
the case of a. or of «', and that the dilatation by heat of a body in the ordi
nary gaseous state, whether measured by its expansion under constant pres
sure or by the increase of elastic force under constant volume, is not a simple
function of the initial volume or initial elastic force, but a complex function
changing with the temperature.
   In the second part of the paper the general properties of the ordinary
gaseous state are considered.    As the basis of this inquiry, the following
Table of the compressibility of carbonic acid at 60-5, 64°, and 100° is
given, in which e is the ratio of the observed volume of the carbonic acid
at the pressure p and temperature t' to its volume under one atmosphere

   If we put p=fp, and calculate the values of p for each of the above
experiments, it will be found that these values diminish regularly as the
pressure increases at each temperature, with the exception of the last
observation at 04°, where Ihe value of p is greater than at the preceding
observation.   This change of direction in the value of p is explained by
the circumstance already mentioned, that the carbonic acid at the higher
pressure has been reduced to the liquid volume (although no liquefaction
has taken place) in passing through the conditions of matter intermediate
between the gaseous and liquid states.
   The relations between the volumetric curves in the ordinary gaseous
state for different temperatures are determined
                                                by means of what the
author calls the homologues or homologous points of those curves — that                      is,

                                                                                      '
                                                                                        in
equation      (A)     are the volumes     of the  gas on different isothermals.
    It follows from        these results that, iu the case of a body in the ordinary
gaseous state, if the relations of pressure and volume are known at any
one temperature, the corresponding relations at any other temperature
can be calculated from the observation of a single homologue at the second
temperature.           Thus the whole relations of volume and pressure will be
known from a set of primary observations at a fixed temperature and
the determination of one homologue for each of the other temperatures.
   The general form of the primary curve itself, or curve exhibiting the
relations of pressure and volume at a given temperature, is next investi
gated ; and the author finds, as the result of all his experiments under
very varied conditions of temperature and pressure, that the value of
e (1— p) is constant for the same temperature.                  Hence we have for the
third equation of the ordinary gaseous state
                         v(l-pv)   =  c                                              (C)
   From this last equation the relations of homologous points, as defined
by equations (A) and (B), may be deduced.
   The author concludes with some general observations on the action of
the internal attractive forces in the ordinary gaseous state, and also on
the resistance to diminution of volume which, under certain conditions,
modifies largely the effects both of external pressure and of internal
attraction.

                       To Captain Evans, C.B.,  F.R.S.
    Snt, — I  have the honour to report that we left Honolulu ou the 11th
 of August, and on the 12th we sounded in 2050 fathoms, aucl took a
 series of temperature observations between the islands of Oahu and
 Hawaii.     At night a crimson reflection was visible in the position of
 the top of Mauna Loa ; but as we understood that the side crater of
 Kilauea only was in eruption, we supposed that that was some great
 conflagration of forest on the flank of the mountain.    All the following
 day we steamed against a head wind along the rugged and picturesque
 coast of Hawaii —headlands of lava and volcanic ash separated by deep
 wooded ravines or " gulches," with a rapid hill-stream running in the
 bottom of each.      The top of Mauna Loa was covered with clouds
 during  the  day ; but at night a splendid crimson glare hung over the
 mountain, and lit up the clouds to a wide radius, and it became evident
 that we were fortunate enough to see one of the rare eruptions of the
 summit crater.    Early on Saturday we cast anchor in Hilo Bay ; and a
party of us made arrangements to start as early as possible for the
volcano of ;Kilauea thirty miles distant, intending, if the eruption of the
summit crater continued and if we found it practicable, to push on to
the top of the mountain.      We left Hilo in the afternoon, taking mag
netic and photographic instruments with us, and rode all night through
the forest and over the lava-flows, reaching the rest-house at the side of
the crater of Kilauea early in the morning.       During the early part of
the night the light from the summit crater was very brilliant, but it be
gan to pale soon after midnight ; and when we arrived at Kilauea we
found that the column of smoke at the top of the mountain had almost
entirely disappeared, and that the eruption was virtually over. This
was no great disappointment to us ; for we had learned that the ascent of
the upper peak could not be undertaken with reasonable safety without
much greater preparation in the way of provisions aud warm clothing
than we had had time to make, and we should have been obliged to give
up the idea in any case.       In the afternoon we went down into the

464        Prof. Wyville Thomson on some of the Results of
crater and walked for about three miles over the nearly level lava of the
eruption of 1868 ; we then clambered up to the ridge overlooking the
two liquid lava-lakes, which have remained nearly in the same condition
since 1868.     We were greatly struck with the fluidity of the melted
lava, which washed about in the basins with very much the appearance
and sound of water.      The night was perfectly still ; and it had a most
singular effect to see the two glowing lakes tossing like the sea in a
storm, and a red surf dashing against the encircling rocks and springing
forty or fifty feet into the air in wreaths of fiery spray. Lieutenant
Bromley and      I recrossed the lava-bed after nightfall, and our guide
missed the ordinary path.       In several places on either side of us the
surface of the lava was glowing of a dull red, and we could see through
the cracks the crust red-hot a couple of inches under our feet, and the
liquid lava flowing beneath at the depth of about half a yard.
   Observations were made by Lieutenant Bromley in the crater and on
its rim with the " Fox dip-circle for inclination and intensity, and with
                         "
the prismatic compass for declination.     Several excellent photographs of
the crater were taken during the day. We returned to the ship on the
evening of the 16th, and on the 19th we left Hilo and proceeded under
sail for Tahiti, 2270 miles distant.
   In the section between Hawaii and Tahiti, running almost directly
southwards, we established 18 observing-stations at average intervals of
160 miles.    At each of these stations the depth was taken, the bottom
temperature was observed with two thermometers, a fair sample of the
bottom was obtained, a specimen of the bottom-water was brought up
for examination, serial temperature observations were made to a depth
of 1500 fathoms, and at eight stations the trawl or dredge was sent
down six times successfully, and twice unsuccessfully.        Except at one
station close to Tahiti, where the depth was 1525 fathoms, the depth
ranged throughout the section from 2000 to 3000 fathoms, with a mean
of about 2600 fathoms, and the nature of the bottom was very uniform.
Except in the neighbourhood of the groups of volcanic islands, where it
was found to be largely composed of volcanic debris and shore mud, it
consisted mainly of red clay, in many of the soundings containing a large
admixture of the decaying shells of Foraminifera, and in almost all in
cluding a large proportion of manganese peroxide in the form of con
cretions, from the size of a nut to that of an Orbulina, and passing into
fine, almost microscopic granules visible under a low power in every
sample of sounding.     In two patches the siliceous skeletons of Badio-
larians were so abundant as almost to entitle the deposit to the name of
" Badiolarian ooze ;" and a patch between these, nearly halfway between
Hawaii and Tahiti, in its abundance of surface Foraminifera approached a
true " Globigerina-ooze."     The larger samples of bottom brought up in
the dredge or trawl had, of course, the same general character as the
                           "
contents of the " Bailie     sounding-tubes ; but in these large manganese

                       the Cruise     of H.M.S.         Challenger.'                 4G5
 concretions,     up to the size of an orange, or even larger, were col
 lected in quantity, the greater part of the red clay being usually washed
out.
    The surface-temperature naturally rose in passing southwards from
 Hawaii towards the equator, and again sank from the equatorial belt
 towards Tahiti.        The isothermobaths*            between 14° C. and 24° C.
 gathered together and approached much nearer to the surface in the
region of the trade-winds, owing no doubt to the rapid removal of
 the hot surface-water by evaporation and the driving action of the wind.
Thus the isothermobathic line of 14° C, which is at a depth of 200
fathoms a little to the north of Tahiti, is at a depth of 100 fathoms on
the line.     In the Atlantic all the isothermobaths seem to participate in
the rise in the region of the trade-winds : it is not so in the Pacific ;
the lines below 14° C. uniformly sink, forming a depression which
extends from lat. 10° N. to lat. 10° S. ; thus the isothermobath of 5° C,
which may be taken as a type of these deeper lines, is found in
lat. 10° N. at a depth of 450 fathoms, and in lat. 10° S. at the same
temperature within the limits of error of observation, while in lat.
2° 34' N. it is found at 625 fathoms.              The point where the isothermo
baths gather together most markedly and approach nearest to the sur
face is a little to the north of the northern border of the equatorial
counter current.        This fall of temperature is so decided as to indicate
 some special areas of cold water j and it may possibly be to some extent
due to the pressing up of deeper and therefore colder layers of the colder
trade-current      against the hot stream.       In the equatorial region between
lat. 10° N. and 10° 8. there is a belt of water about 80 fathoms in
thickness at a temperature generally over 25° C. ; and the whole of
this water,     with the exception of the narrow band of the counter
current,    is running to the westward at the rate of from 40 to 70 miles
a day.
    The bottom fauna over the whole of the manganese area is very meagre,
both as to number of species and number of individuals.                 It can scarcely
be said, however, that its scope and extent were fairly tested ; for the
presence of manganese nodules is almost fatal to the working of the
trawl, which either becomes imbedded and impacted among them, pro
 ducing a destructive strain on the line, or has the bottom torn out of the
bag on the way up.          Still in every haul in which the trawl was recovered

 through places of equal temperature on the surface of the earth, have found it con
venient, in considering these questions of ocean temperature, to use the terms Imthermo-
bath and Ieobaihythcrm ; the former to indicate a line drawn through points of equal
temperature in a vertical section, and the latter a line drawn through points of equal
depth at which a given temperature occurs.        Isothermobaths are shown in a scheme
of a vertical section, such as Plate 10. Isobathvthcrms are of course projected on the
surface of the globe.

    "We took advantage      of   a week's stay at      Tahiti to sound out the slope
 of this coral reef, and to determine the bathymetrical distribution of the
 species of reef-building corals.        This investigation, which is not yet fully
 worked out, will form the subject of a separate report.
    "We left the harbour of Papeete on the 3rd of October, and proceeded
 southwards, expecting to pick up the westerly winds about lat. 40° S.
 We sighted the island of Tubuai on the 7th ; and as we fell in with s
 succession of southerly instead of easterly winds, we were able to cut
 off a corner, and we reached the parallel of 40° in long. 132° 5S' W.
 Prom that point we ran along a little to the south of the parallel of 40°,
 encountering no regular westerly winds, but rather heavy weather from
 the south and north and calms, as far as long. 84° 39' W., when we
 altered our course for the island of Juan Fernandez, steaming most of
 the time against foul winds from the north and north-east.               "We reached

   Juan Fernandez on the evening of the 13th, and remained there two
  days observing and photographing the scenery, and making such col
  lections of animals and plants as it was possible to make in so short a
  time.    "We weighed anchor on the evening of the 15th, and stood
 towards Valparaiso, where we arrived early on the 19th.
     The section from Papeete to Valparaiso (Plate 17) is         about 5000
 miles   in length, and is naturally divided into two parts — the run south
 wards to the parallel of 40° S., and the course along that parallel towards
 Valparaiso. In the entire section we established 20 stations bearing
 numbers from 279 to 298.       At each of these the ordinary bathymetrical
 and temperature observations were taken successfully ; and the trawl or
 dredge was lowered on thirteen occasions, twelve times successfully     ;  on
 one occasion the trawl-line carried away.
     Setting aside Station 279 in 680 fathoms close to Tahiti, the mean
 depth throughout the section was 2139 fathoms, considerably less than
that of the meridional section from Honolulu to Tahiti, and very much
less than that of the section      in the North Pacific between Japan and
 San Francisco.     The nature of the bottom is very much the same as in
 the meridional section, red clay imbedding nodules and lumps of various
 sizes of manganese peroxide, and passing in the shallower soundings into
 more or less pure Olobigerinar-ooze ; and, as in the section between Hawaii
 and Tahiti, the fauna is generally meagre.      The trawling between Juan
 Fernandez and Valparaiso (Station 298) was particularly interesting ;
animal     forms were much more abundant        than they usually are in the
Pacific ; and the general character of the assemblage resembled in a re
 markable degree that of the fauna of the Southern Sea in the neighbour
hood of the Crozets and Kerguelen, many of the species, including some
singular Urchins of the family Ananchytidoe, being identical. The bottom
at this station was a bluish mud, the surface layer containing little or no
carbonate of lime, and, curiously enough, a deeper layer, with a con
siderable proportion of Olobigerina-eheNs.       There was no considerable
quantity of manganese in the sounding.        Notwithstanding the consider
able depth of 2225 fathoms, the conditions in this locality seem much
more favourable to animal life than even the manganese area ; and       I  am
inclined to think that we had struck upon one of the highways by which
migration takes place to the northward from the Southern Sea.            The
following Table (p. 468) gives the proportion in which the principal animal
groups are represented in the trawlings in this section.
     From Tahiti to Station 288, in lat. 40° S., the upper temperatures
fell regularly and steadily ; but the isothermobaths below 80° C. showed
rather a tendency to sink, indicating a somewhat thicker layer of water
at a temperature above 3° C. towards the southward.         The cause of this
apparent anomaly will be discussed hereafter.         From Station 289 the
isothermobaths run on to Valparaiso with scarcely an oscillation of any
importance (Plate 18).

     Although there are certain points which have yet to be worked out in
 detail, the general distribution of temperature in the Pacific seems
 sufficiently simple.     In the first place, the whole mass of water consists
 of two well-marked divisions — an upper layer of no great depth, in which
 there is rapid cooling from the surface downwards, and considerable
 variation in temperature in different localities ; and a mass of water of
 incomparably greater amount, which extends to the bottom, and which
 may be said to have nearly the same temperature throughout.              These
 two divisions shade into one another; but the isothermobath of 5°C. may
 be taken as     indicating generally the limit between them ; below this line
 the isotheimobaths       are still affected by surface thermal conditions, but
 comparatively slightly. Above the line of 5° C. the course of the isother-
 mobaths is to all appearance entirely regulated by causes affecting the
  surface-temperature — that is to say, directly or indirectly, by surface cur
 rents produced by permanent, periodic, or variable winds. The equatorial
 current occupies the region of the trade-winds, approximately from
 lat. 20° N. to 20° 8., and there is a strong but narrow counter current,
 entirely comparable with the counter current in the Atlantic between
  the parallels of 5° and 8° N. The water of the equatorial current has

no free egress to the westward, being intercepted by the peninsula of
Malacca and the islands of the Malay archipelago ; but neither is it
completely arrested, as the equatorial current is in the Atlantic by the
unbroken coast of America    consequently a return current, less perma
                                    ;
nent and less defined than the return current in the Atlantic, finds its
way to the north-eastward along the coast of Japan.    The course of the
Japan current is much the same as that  of the  Gulf-stream, and is due,
as in the Atlantic return current, to the high initial velocity of the inter
cepted water ; its influence on the temperature of the ocean            is,
                                                                    however,
much sooner reduced and obliterated.
  The hot water of the Pacific equatorial         current instead of being
gathered together and focused by the form of the land-barrier, as             it   is
in that of the Atlantic, spreads out in the Middle and "West Pacific in            a
vast sheet of abnormally warm water, extending to           depth of nearly
                                                               a
100 fathoms   ; thus the isobathytherm     of 25°  C. at 80  fathoms passes
near Hawaii and Tahiti, and near the parallel of 20° N. on sections
between the Admiralty Islands and Japan.         The lower isotherm obaths
of the upper layer are     little nearer the surface in lat. 40° N. than in
                           a
lat. 40° S. and this
          ;             Ibelieve to be due to the banking of the Antarctic
indraught against the Arctic land-barrier, and to be the only case in
which the position of the lines of equal temperature in the upper layer
is not absolutely dependent upon the wind.
   The temperature of the underlying cold water        derived from another
                                                         is
source, and its distribution      governed by other laws.
                                    is                       Throughout the
Pacific the isothermobath of 5° C. maintains on the whole          very even
                                                                        a
course, oscillating between the 400- and 500-fathom lines.  These oscil
lations depend upon causes acting on the surface, for the line rises and
falls in harmony with the higher isothermobaths.      The line of 5° C.
deviates sensibly on two occasions from its comparatively straight course.
In the equatorial region    sinks to

next three degrees of temperature are lost with increasing slowness in
the next 700 fathoms, the line of 2° C. making  very even course at

fractionis  lost between 1100 fathoms and the bottom.     The depth of the
Pacific increases slowly from the south to the north, the mean difference
between the depth of the South Pacific and that of the North being
perhaps as much as 1000 fathoms (see Plate 19, and the results of the
soundings of the Tuscarora         Notwithstanding this increase in depth,

a result can only be arrived at by a careful combination         and comparison
of many      observations,  taking  into  full consideration   the errors of the
thermometers arising from all sources. There is a like very sb;ght de
crease   in the bottom-temperatures from east to west.
    I  think we can scarcely doubt, looking at such a diagram as Plate 19,
that, like the similar mass of cold bottom-water in the Atlantic, the bottom-
water of the Pacific is an extremely slow indraught from the Southern
Sea.     That it is moving, and moving from a cold source, is evident from
the fact that it is much colder than the mean winter temperature of the
area which it occupies, and colder than the mean temperature of the
crust of the earth ; that it is moving in one mass from the southward is
shown by the uniformity of its conditions, by the gradual rise of the
bottom-temperatures to the northward, by the fact that there is no
adequate northern source of such a body of water (Behring's Strait being
only 40 fathoms deep, and a considerable part of that area being occupied
by a warm current from the Pacific into the Arctic Sea), and by our
knowlege from observations that one or two trifling currents from the
Sea of Okotsk and the Behring Sea, which are readily detected and
localized, and are quite independent of the main mass of cold water, re
present the only Arctic influx.          During its progress northwards the
upper portion of the mass becomes slightly raised in temperature by
mixture with, and possibly by slow conduction from, the upper layers
which are affected by solar heat.        At the end of the Gulf (that is to say
in the extreme north, furthest from the cold source) the temperature is,
as   I  have already pointed out, influenced to the very bottom ; and the
isothermobaths between 8° and 5° C. are obviously raised and pressed
together, probably by the accumulation of the cold water against the
land.     The colder bottom-water to the westward might be expected, from
the lower initial velocity of the Antarctic water causing it to drag against
the west coast.
    I am   every day more fully satisfied that this influx of cold water
into the Pacific     and Atlantic oceans from the southward is to be re
ferred to the simplest and most obvious of all causes, the excess of
evaporation over precipitation in the northern portion of the land hemi
sphere, and the excess of precipitation         over evaporation in the middle
and southern part of the water hemisphere.
    After what    I have   already said  I need  scarcely add that  I have never
seen,    whether   in the Atlantic, the Southern Sea, or the Pacific, the
slightest ground for supposing that such a thing exists as a general ver
tical circulation of the water of the ocean depending upon differences of
specific gravity.

                       Preface to Preliminary       Reports.
    The Preliminary Reports have been prepared at the request of Professor
Wyville Thomson.           They have been compiled during the past three weeks
from notes      taken  daily during the past three years.   In only a few cases
has    it been    possible to refer to the objects remarked upon, they having
been sent home for greater safety, or packed away beyond reach.              When
specimens taken early in the cruise can be placed side by side and com
pared with the more recent revelations of the trawl, dredge, or sounding-
tube, many of the statements herein made may require to be modified.
    Reports on three years' work, prepared under the disadvantages above
mentioned, must necessarily be very incomplete ; and indulgence may
 be asked till the final Report can be issued.
    To all my coadjutors, naval and civilian,        I am indebted for much
assistance, especially to Mr. Wild for his drawings, to Mr. Buchanan for
 much information concerning the chemical constituents of the bottoms,
 and to Professor Thomson for assistance and advice, not only in pre
 paring these Reports, but also while carrying on the investigations of
 which they are intended to give some account.

       9th December, 1875.
 1.   Preliminary Report on Specimens of the Sea-bottoms obtained in the
                                                              '
        Soundings, Dredgings, and Trawlings of H.M.S. Challenger,' in the
        years 1873-75, between England and Valparaiso.
     Method of Work. —During the first six months of the expedition the
 sounding-apparatus in use on board was provided with a very narrow
 cylinder, which brought up only a very small quantity of the bottom.
     In July     1873 Capt. Nares had a much larger cylinder fitted to the
 instrument,      one with a 2-inch bore ; and later on he caused the weights
 to be so arranged with respect to the cylinder that the latter projected
 some 18 inches beneath the former.
     This arrangement, the cylinder of which is always provided with the
 common butterfly-valve,        usually gives us a very large quantity of the

472            Mr.     J.   Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined
bottom in each sounding.    Sometimes the tube has been forced fully
18 inches into the bottom, and has brought up frequently as much as a
quart of the ooze, mud, or clay. When the tube arrives on board the
contents are carefully removed, and the colour, extent, and arrangement
of the section* is noted.  A portion is washed several times in distilled
water and dried, a portion is submitted to a rough analysis,                         and the
remainder, if any, is preserved in spirit.
   The analysis consists in determining so far as possible : —
   1. The kinds of organisms present, and their relative abundance,
whether carbonate of lime or siliceous, and whether alive or dead.
   2. The kind and quantity of amorphous and mineral matter, and its
ratio to the remains of the above organisms.
   This is accomplished by decanting the finer from the coarser particles,
and examining each with the microscope.       "When carbonate of lime is
present this is removed by weak acid, and the specimen is again examined.
When manganese is present in great quantity this is removed by strong
hydrochloric acid, and again an examination is made. Very frequently
portions of the upper layers are placed in colouring solutions (as carmine,
magenta, &c.), for the purpose of rendering more distinct any organized
material, should any be present.
  When the dredge or trawl brings up mud, a considerable quantity is
preserved for future work, and what remains is carefully sifted.    The
sittings are examined and preserved.
   Lately it has been the custom to send down tow-nets loosely attached
to the trawl or dredge and at the weights in front of the trawl. These
often bring up specimens of the bottom when the trawl fails to do so.
As these nets do not probably sink deep into the ooze, they give us a
surer idea of the nature of the surface-layers than previously obtained by
the trawl alone.
List of     the Soundings and Dredgings, with an abstract             of     nature of
                                                                           the               the
              bottom   in   each case where a sample has been        procured.
  Explanatory Note. — The following remarks under each sounding or
dredging have been abstracted from notes made daily during the cruise.
In making the abstract the object in view has been to indicate so far as
possible the relative abundance in each sample of—
                Remains of carbonate-of-lime organisms ;
               Remains of siliceous organisms ;
                Mineral particles, as quartz and mica ;
                  Glauconite,     pumice, manganese, &c.         ;   and
                  Amorphous clayey and calcareous matter.
  It hasbeen thought that, however incomplete, such an abstract will in
the mean time be useful to naturalists and geologists. It will give some
  * e. the vertical section, which
      «'.                             is   always greater   the further the      tube has   been
forced into the oore or clay.

idea of the nature and distribution of the deposits which are taking
place in the oceans and seas we have visited.         It will also furnish some
data and serve as the basis for speculations on the mode of origin of —
      The deep-sea clays ;
      The formation of the manganese nodules ;
      The presence of the remains of surface animals (consisting of siliceous
          and carbonate-of-lime      organisms) in some deposits, and their
          absence in others, &c.
    By pelagic Foraminifera are meant species of Globigerina, Orbulina,
Pulvinulina, and of one or two other genera which are still undescribed,
but which have been found abundantly in the surface-waters of the
Pacific and South Atlantic oceans.
    When the final Report is prepared, the genera or species of the
 organisms whose remains occur in each sample will be given.             So also
 for the mineral particles, and the ratio of these to each other and to the
 amorphous, clayey, and calcareous matter will be more accurately stated.
 At the present moment such an undertaking is in no way possible.
 Those things which are most abundant in the sample are generally
 mentioned first.

       ganese particles.
    Several manganese nodules came up in the trawl ; these were more
angular than usual and appear to have been formed on hardened portions
of the bottom ; some had a cherty-like nucleus with concentric coloured
layers as in agate.         There were some hardened pieces of bottom also in
the trawl, some with just a slight coating of manganese, others perforated
in various directions by worm-tracks.
 Sounding      280.     25th August, 1875.        2900 fathoms.         Lat. 12° 42' N.,

        remains of Eadiolaria, Diatoms, and Challengeria ; a few manganese
       grains.
    The dredge brought          up much mud.        In the washings were several
 pieces of pumice about the size        of peas.    One   manganese nodule the size
 of a marble;        three or four largo Pulvinulinas.          Over a third of the
 bottom made up of siliceous remains.
 Sounding      287. 26th August, 1875. 2750 fathoms.                    Lat. 11° 11' N.,
        long. 152° 2' W.        A Eadiolarian ooze of a brown colour contain
        ing : — Immense numbers of Eadiolarians, Diatoms, and some Chal-
        Icnr/eria remains ; some amorphous clayey matter ; a few small
        white and some red-coloured         mineral    particles   ;  a few manganese
        particles.
    There were        some   yellow-coloured     spots in the bottom, but it was

 510           Mr.    J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined
 mostly of a brown colour.       It was more compact than yesterday's and
 contained more Eadiolarians and fewer pieces of the delicate large cylin
 drical Diatom (see notes on Diatoms, p. 533).
 Sounding 288. 28th August, 1875. 2700 fathoms.                Lat. 9° 28' N.,     .
       long. 150° 49' W. A small quantity came up, which indicated a
       Eadiolarian ooze of a yellow colour containing : — Great numbers of
       Eadiolarian and remains of other siliceous organisms ; a few
       rounded, olive-coloured,    and some small white mineral       particles  ;
       some manganese grains.
    Thecolourof this sounding was thesameas thelower layerof ourdeepest
 sounding, 4475 fathoms, and as the yellow patches in the last sounding.
 Sounding    289.     30th August, 1875. 2900 fathoms.         Lat. 7° 35' N.,
       long. 149° 49' E. A Eadiolarian ooze of a brown colour, with a
       thin upper layer of a pale straw-colour, containing : — Immense
       numbers     of Eadiolarians, Diatom,     Challengeria, and remains of
      other   siliceous organisms   ; a few   small white and yellow mineral
      particles   ; some  amorphous clayey matter    ; a good many manganese
      grains.
   There appeared to be a thin surface-layer of a yellow colour.         It  dif
fered from the mass of the bottom beneath only in the relatively less
abundance of manganese grains.
Sounding 290.        2nd September, 1875.      2550 fathoms.    Lat. 5° 54'  N.,
      long. 147° 2'     W.  A Eadiolarian    ooze,  upper layer yellow, lower
      layer brown-coloured,      containing : — Immense numbers of Eadio
      larian, Diatom, and Challenyeria remains ; a few pelagic Forami-
      nifera and their broken parts (Pulvinulinas, Orbulinas, Globigerinas)
      and some Coccoliths     ; some   amorphous clayey matter.
   The Foraminifera appeared to         be confined to the top layer chiefly.
There were fewer manganese grains in this sounding than in the last,
and in this sounding they were more abundant in the lower than upper
layer.
Sounding 291.        4th September, 1875.     2925 fathoms.    Lat. 2° 34' N.,
      long. 149° 9' W.      A Globiijerina-ooze, upper layers brown, lower
      layers cream-white colour, containing : — Very many pelagic Fora
      minifera and their broken-down      parts, and Coccoliths ; many Eadic-
      laria ; remains of other siliceous organisms ; a good deal of amor
      phous calcareous and some clayey matter ; very few mineral particles
      of any kind other than manganese grains.
   The carbonate-of-lime organisms were most abundant in the lower
layers.    The upper brown layer had carbonate-of-lime and siliceous
organisms in nearly equal proportions, and this layer had more clayey
matter and manganese grains than the one underneath.
Sounding     292.     0th September, 1875. 2425 fathoms.        Lat. 0° 33' S.,
      long. 151° 34'     W. A white Globiyerina-oozG containing : — Great

     numbers of pelagic Foraminifora,        their broken-down parts, and
     Coccoliths ; a good many Eadiolarians and some broken Diatoms ;
     some amorphous calcareous but very little clayey matter.
   Few, if any, mineral particles other than manganese grains, of which
there were a few.     A good deal of the bottom came up in the tow-net
attached to the trawl. In the washings there was one piece of puinico
about the size of a hen's egg.
Sounding    293.   8th September, 1875.       2G00  fathoms.   Lat. 3° 48' S.,
     long.  152° 56'  W. A Kacliolarian      ooze  of brown colour contain
     ing : — Immense numbers of Eadiolaria, Diatoms, and Clutllenr/eria ;
     a few broken pieces of large pelagic Foraminifera, and one or two
     perfect specimens ; a little amorphous clayey matter.
   Few, if any, mineral particles other than the manganese particles,
which were abundant.       One of these last (about the size of a pea), which
I broke, appeared to be formed on a nucleus of pumice.
   In the trawl were several manganese nodules ; one, the size of a hen's
egg, appeared to be formed on a nucleus of ordinary pumice.           Also one
areolar piece of pumice (or lava) of a green colour like that from the
Sandwich Islands. Several yellow and red cherty-like pieces of mineral.
Sounding    294.   9th September, 1875. 2350 fathoms.           Lat. 5° 0' S.,
     long. 152° 26' W. A Eadiolarian ooze of a chocolate-colour con
     taining : — Great numbers of Eadiolaria and the broken eruviro of
     these and other siliceous organisms ; a few pelagic Foraminifera
     and their broken      parts ; a few Coccoliths  ; a few red and yellow
     mineral particles  ;  manganese grains in great abundance.
Sounding 295.      11th September, 1875.       2750 fathoms.    Lat.  7° 25' S.,
     long. 1523 15' "W.      A Eadiolarian ooze of a chocolate-colour con
     taining  : — Great   numbers    of Eadiolaria and the exuviaj of other
     siliceous organisms ; many pieces of black manganese, some pieces
     of red and yellow minerals, these latter being perfect crystals, and
     some pieces of pumicestones ; some amorphous clayey matter ; a
     few broken pieces of pelagic Foraminifera.
   The trawl brought up fully a peck of manganese nodules and some
mud.     Amongst the nodules were some with a nucleus of pumice, of
sharks' teeth, and of the ear-bones of cetaceans ; some of the sharks' teeth
had a very light coating of manganese.
Sounding 290.      14th September, 1875. 2010 fathoms.         Lat. 11° 11' S.,
     long. 1 50° 30' W. A dark chocolate clay containing chiefly : — Small
     yellow crystals and rounded particles of a red mineral about the size
     of a pea ; very many manganese particles and grains ; a few pieces
      of Eadiolarian tests ; a few small sharks' teeth ; amorphous clayey
     matter.

512             Mr.   J.  Murray    on Oceanic Deposits examined
       long. 149° 30' W.        In  the top of the tube a Qlohigerina-ocaxt       of a
       light brown colour       containing:  —  Very   many   pelagic  Foraminifera
       and Coccoliths     ; amorphous clayey matter and many small yellow
       crystals and particles of the peroxide of manganese.            In the lower
                                                                —
       part of the tube a dark chocolate clay containing : Very many small
       yellow crystals ; pieces of a red and yellow mineral and pumice
       particles ; many small sharks' teeth ; amorphous clayey matter, and
       great numbers of manganese particles and grains.
   The transitions from the dark chocolate clay at the bottom to the light
brown Glotrir/erina-ooze on the top was very gradual, the lighter colour
and the carbonate of lime increasing pari passu. The yellow crystals and
manganese particles were most abundant in the lower portions of the
tube. Eadiolaria and other siliceous remains were almost wanting in
this bottom.
    The trawl brought up about half a ton of manganese nodules, some
 small pieces of pumice, several sharks' teeth, one of which was 3 inches
 across the base.        Some of these were deeply and others only slightly
 coated with manganese.
 Sounding 298.         17th September, 1875. 2325 fathoms.            Lat. 15° 7' S.,
        long. 149° 41' W. This bottom nearly the same as described for
        yesterday.     It had, however, more mineral particles and fewer of
         the small yellow crystals in all its parts ; also few manganese par
        ticles.
 Sounding 299.         18th September, 1875.       1525 fathoms.      Lat. 17° 13' S.,
         long. 149° 33'    W.    A grey mud containing : — Amorphous clayey
         matter   ; many fine and coarse mineral particles of a white, red, and
         yellow colour ; many pelagic Foraminifera        ; Coccoliths and Bhabdo-
         liths ; one or two portions of Eadiolaria.
                              Off Tahiti,  Society  Islands.
  Sounding      300.    20th October, 1875.       420, 590, G20, and G80 fathoms.
          In each case a grey or blue mud containing : — Very many particles
          of volcanic sand and amorphous matter ; debris of coral ; pelagic and
          other Foraminifera   ; larval Gasteropods and Lamellibranchs      ; Echini-
          spines &c. In the two deeper ones there was a red surface-layer.
     J ust outside the reefs at Tahiti there was a coral-mud containing a few
  mineral particles ; inside the reefs there was a soft blue mud.
                                  Tahiti to Valparaiso.
  Sounding 301.        4th October, 1875.     1940 fathoms.    Lat. 18° 40' S., long.
          149° 52'   W.     A   grey Globigerina-ooze containing : — Very many
          pelagic Foraminifera ; Coccoliths and Ehabdoliths ; some amorphous
          clayey and calcareous matter ; some manganese grains ; a good many
          rather coarse mineral particles of a brown and black colour ; a good

                           on board    H.M.S. 'Challenger.'                     513
       many internal and external casts of the Foraminifera in a red sub
       stance, as on 15th August, 1874.
   Two or three hardened pieces of the bottom, coated with manganese,
were in the trawl.
Sounding 302.           6th October,     1875.     2385 fathoms.   Lat. 22° 21' S.,
       long. 150° 17' "W.        No bottom    came up  in the sounding-tube.     The
       trawl brought up         some   dark chocolate clay and many manganese
       nodules and sharks' teeth.          Washing away the amorphous matter
       from some of the bottom there remained a large amount of sediment,
       consisting almost entirely of small rounded red mineral particles.
       Many of these had the form of both Foraminifera and Badiolaria ;
       and it seemed as if some substance had been deposited in and on
       these organisms. There were also many manganese particles ; one or
       two pelagic Foraminifera.
   In the washing of the mud in the trawl were great numbers of sharks'
teeth, the largest being 4 inches across the base. One piece of manganese
concretion measured 18 x 12x2 inches, and had a mass of soft red or
yellow clay in the centre. There were two or three pieces of pumice.
Sounding 303.        7th October, 1875. 2450 fathoms. Lat. 23° 35' 8., long.
       150° 3' "W.      A dark brown clay, same as described yesterday, con
       taining  : — Amorphous clayey matter ; rounded yellow minerals, many
      Badiolarian-shaped       ; pieces of pumice and other minerals   ; very many
      manganese particles        ; a few Badiolaria.
Sounding 304.           9th October,     1875.     2075 fathoms.    Lat. 26° 9' S.,
      long. 145° 17' "W.        In the upper part of the tube a Globigerina-oom
       of a light  brown     colour  containing : — Very many pelagic and other
      Foraminifera ; Coccoliths, Bhabdoliths, and Echini-spines ; small
      yellow crystals and pieces of a red and yellow cherty-like mineral ;
       some amorphous clayey matter.             In the lower part of the tube a
      dark chocolate clay containing : — Much amorphous clayey matter ;
      very many yellow crystals and pellets of peroxide of manganese ; a
      few broken pelagic Foraminifera.
   The transition from the one to the other deposit was quite gradual.
 This sounding was very like that on 16th September last.
   Bemains of Badiolaria and other siliceous organisms appeared to                be
 entirely wanting in this sounding.
 Sounding 305.        11th October, 1875.         1985 fathoms.   Lat. 28° 22' S.,
       long. 141° 22' "W". A Globigerina-oow of light yellow colour con
       taining : — Great numbers of pelagic Foraminifera ; Coccoliths and
       Bhabdoliths    ;   liWum'-spines ; a good many Badiolarian remains ;
       amorphous clayey matter and manganese grains ; a few pieces of
       vesicular lava, of a green colour, like that at the Hawaiian Islands.
 Sounding 300.        14th October, 1875.         2375 fathoms.   Lat.   32° 36' S.,
                                                                   2r2

 514           Mr. J. Murray       on Oceanic Deposits examined
       long. 137° 43' "W.     A dark chocolate clay containing : — Amorphous
       clayey matter ; many small yellow crystals and pumice ; pieces of
       red cherty-like mineral ; many manganese grains and pellets ; a few
       remains of pelagic Foraminifera.
    The trawl brought up        some    mud and over a bushel of manganese
 nodules and some pieces of pumice.         Amongst the nodules were : — Many
 sharks' teeth, some deeply imbedded in manganese ; eight tympanic
 bones of Cetaceans, some deeply imbedded       in manganese. Some nodules
 had a nucleus of bone, some of pumice, some a cherty-like mineral with
 agate bands.
 Sounding     307.   16th October, 1875. 2335 fathoms.            Lat. 33° 29' S-,
       long. 133° 22' W. In upper part of tube, 2 inches, a dark choco
       late clay containing : — Much amorphous clayey matter ; many small
       yellow crystals, pieces of a cherty-like mineral, and many manganese
       grains and pellets ; a few remains of pelagic Foraminifera. In lower
       part of the tube, 5 inches, a light brown clay containing, besides the
       things in the upper layer : — Many more pelagic Foraminifera, and
       immense numbers of Coccoliths.
    The lighter colour of the lower layers appeared to      be due to the greater
abundance of carbonate-of-lime        organisms, and consequently       less abun
 dance of manganese particles.
    This arrangement of the contents of the sounding-tubs           is the reverse
 of that on the 9th inst.
    The trawl brought up over a bushel of nodules       &c,   as  : —
       Over 100 sharks' teeth,                     \-
       About 30 tympanic bones of Cetaceans, j All these had a more or
       Portions of other bones,                     >    less coating of per-
       One granitic pebble,                        \     oxide of manganese.
       Grey  concretions   of the  bottom.         /
Also    some   nodides   with no apparent     nucleus, and some with a hard
cherty yellow    mineral  in the centre.
Sounding     308.    19th October, 1875.      2400 fathoms.      Lat. 36° 33' S.,
      long. 132° 55' W. A dark chocolate clay containing : — Amorphous
      clayey matter ; many manganese grains ; small yellow crystals,
      rounded    pellets of a red-brown mineral;      a few pieces       of pelagic
      Foraminifera.
   The remains of the Foraminifera appeared to        be confined to the upper
layer.
Sounding     309.    21st October, 1875. 2600 fathoms.            Lat. 40° 8' S.,
      long. 132° 56' W. A chocolate clay containing : — Amorphous clayey-
                          '

 Sounding 310.        23rd   October, 1875.     2550 fathoms.    Lat. 39° 47' S.,
       long. 131° 20' "W.      Two small pieces of manganese and three small
       pieces of a cherty-like mineral in the tube ; a trace of brown mud on
       the outside of the tube indicating a bottom like the last.
     In the trawl were many rounded manganese nodules to which some
 traces of mud adhered. The nodules had nuclei of sharks' teeth, tym
 panic bones of cetacea, agate-like minerals, pieces of bones ; and in all cases
these were deeply imbedded in manganese, in some cases a coating of
over an inch in concentric layers. It is curious and significant that not
much (other than a trace) clay came up in the sounding-tube, the bag of the
trawl, or in the tow-nets attached to the trawl and weight. All this
indicates that the manganese was in great abundance at this spot.
Sounding      311.    25th October, 1875.      2300 fathoms.    Lat. 39°  16' S.,
       long. 124° 7' W.      A streak of black manganese on the outside of
       the  tube, as if it had  been rubbed against a nodule. A small portion
       of mud adhered to the water-bottle, which indicated a dark chocolate
       clay containing : — Amorphous clayey matter ; much manganese ;
       piece of a red mineral ; a few remains of pelagic Foraminifera and
       some Coccoliths.
 Sounding 312.       27th October, 1875.       2250 fathoms.    Lat. 39° 13' S.,
       long. 118° 49' W. On the outside of the tube a streak of manga
       nese, as if it had struck a nodule.        Inside the tube a little light
                                  —
       brown clay containing : Amorphous clayey matter ; many particles
       of a black manganese and of a red mineral ; a good many pelagic
       Foraminifera and Coccoliths.
     The trawl brought up one small manganese nodule. The frame of the
  trawl had many streaks of manganese.
  Sounding    313.   29th October, 1875.       1600 fathoms.    Lat. 38° 44' 8.,
       long. 112° 34'   W.    A  Globigerina-ooze containing :— Great numbers
       of   pelagic and a    few other Foraminifera; many Coccoliths and
       Ehabdoliths ; many manganese grains and one or two particles of a
       red mineral.
     There was very little amorphous matter in this sounding        ; the brown
  colour is due to the presence of the manganese grains.
  Sounding    314.   1st November,     1875.    2025 fathoms.    Lat,  39° 4' S.,
       long. 105° 5'   W.    A  Globigerina-ooze of a red colour containing : —
       Very many pelagic     Foraminifera    and others ; Coccoliths and Ehab
       doliths and Cy-pridina-y&hes ; some amorphous clayey matter;
       many manganese particles,       and some particles   of red, yellow, and
       black minerals.
     The lower layers were of a darker colour than the upper ones, and

516            Mr.  J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined
contained less carbonate of lime.       About a dozen manganese nodules and
two shark's teeth came up in the trawl. Two nodules had a nucleus of
obsidian (?), outside this several agate-like bands, and then many layers
of the peroxide of manganese. Two other nodules, from the structure
and presence of lime, appeared to be formed on a nucleus of bone.           One
of the shark's teeth was deeply imbedded, the other was not.
Sounding     315.    3rd November, 1875.      2270 fathoms.    Lat. 39° 22' S.,
      long. 98° 46' W.      A dark chocolate clay containing : — Much amor
      phous clayey matter ; many manganese particles, small yellow crys
      tals, red, white, and black mineral particles (quartz and particles of
      volcanic   sand ?). In the upper layers there were a good many
      remains of pelagic Foraminifera and a few Coccoliths, but these
      were almost wanting in the deeper layers.
Sounding     316.    5th November, 1875.       1500 fathoms.    Lat. 38° 7' 8.,
      long. 94° 4' W. A small quantity of bottom came           up which indi
      cated a Globirjerina-ooze of a brown colour containing           : — Many
      pelagic Foraminifera, Cypridina-yalves,      and 2?c7tint-spines   ; many
      manganese particles, and a good many rather coarse sandy particles
       of a green colour (serpentine ?) ; a few Eadiolaria.
   Most of the finer portions of the bottom appeared to have been washed
out of the tube on the way up.
   The tow-nets at the trawl contained many particles of a green mineral
and one pebble of the same nature (serpentine ?), with a coating of man
 ganese.
Sounding      317.   9th November, 1875.       1825 fathoms.    Lat. 38°   6' S.,
       long. 88° 2'  W.    A  Glohigerina-ooze of a brown colour containing :
       — Many pelagic Foraminifera, Coccoliths, and Ehabdoliths ; a good
       many manganese particles and pieces of a red and yellow mineral ;
       one Eadiolarian noticed ; some amorphous clayey matter.
   In   the lower end of the tube the bottom was of a much darker colour,
and contained fewer Foraminifera and more manganese and amorphous
matter.
   In the trawl there was some mud, all of a brown colour, same as in the
upper part of the sounding-tube.          In the sifting were many pellets of
manganese and pieces of a flinty-like mineral.
Sounding 318.       11th November, 1875.       1775 fathoms.   Lat. 37° 29' S.,
       long. 83° 7' W. A Globigerina-oow of a brown colour. No bottom
       came up   in the tube.
   I  here copy in extenso from my Journal notes so far as they relate to
the bottom in the trawl : —
    " The trawl came up in the afternoon fouled, but in it were three or
four quarts of manganese nodules varying from the size of a hen's egg to
 that of a pea.
    " The weights
                    (300 fathoms from the trawl) were all scored and marked

                          on board     H.M.S. 'Challenger.'                         517
with streaks of black,     as   if   they had been dragged over lumps of manga
nese.
   " The tow-net just behind these weights had in it
                                                     very many Olobigerince,
Pulvinuliiice, and one or two Orbulinas (all dead), a good many manganese
pellets and a very little mud.
   " This net would seem to have caught the particles knocked up by the
weights in front. One of the tow-nets at the trawl was full to the brim
of a yellow or, rather, light-brown-coloured mud, in which were many
manganese nodules.      Being so full of mud, not much of the finer portions
of the bottom could have been washed away ; hence this tow-net of mud
gives us information from which some idea may be formed of the ratio
which the manganese nodules bear to the ooze.          In a peck of the mud
there was a little over a quart of manganese nodules.      The nodules were
all nearly round.    Some of the smaller ones were composed of the black
manganese    to the centre, while some had just a small yellow spot in the
centre.    Some of the larger ones had a yellow or dark green nucleus of
about half an inch in diameter, which was surrounded by concentric layers
of peroxide of manganese of half an inch in thickness.         The yellow or
green nucleus was soft, and could be cut with the knife like new cheese.
Tinder the microscope it presented a mottled appearance, with yellow and
light- and dark-green spaces, many of these being partially surrounded
with agate bands.
   " Foraminif era could also be seen imbedded in the mass ; but all the car
bonate of lime had been removed, strong nitric acid having no effect on
any part of this nucleus.    Birds'-feet-like extensions of the black manga
nese ramified into the yellow nucleus ; and it seemed as if the manganese
was extending into the nucleus as well as being deposited in concentric
layers around   it,as in those instances where pumice forms the nucleus of
a  nodule.   There were lumps of the bottom in the tow-net which seemed
to show the beginning of this process of nodule-formation.      These lumps,
which were of    a redder colour than the rest of the bottom, seemed to be
cemented by  a red substance (?).
  " Examined    aportion of the bottom in the same way as usual with the
soundings.   It contained — many GHobigerinas, Pulvinulinas (the pyra
                                :
midal variety), and   a   few Orbulinas one or two Uvigerinas, and some Bilo-
                                             ;
culinas and others    ;   two arenaceous forms of Foraminifera, the tests com
posed of particles of manganese and red mineral  a   many Coccoliths and
                                                            ;
Bhabdoliths ;  only two portions of siliceous spines and three Eadiolaria
were observed.
    " Bemoving the manganese from the washing there remained — A good   :
many mineral particles (these were almost all of      dark lead-colour and
                                                            a
very areolar structure,  reminding   one of volcanic ash  and scoria)  one      ;
small yellow crystal, several pieces of   red cherty-like mineral, and ono
                                                 a
quartz-like particle were noticed        ;   manganese grains were abundant."
 Sounding 319.        17th November, 1875.           2225 fathoms.   Lat. 34°   T    S.,

  518            Mr.  J.  Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined
        long. 73° 56'  W.    A  blue mud with a red upper layer containing : —
        Much amorphous blue clayey matter ; many very fine mineral parti
        cles of quartz, mica, and a few of the green glauconitic particles ; a
        good many ltadiolaria and Diatoms.
     The top layers contained no carbonate-of-lime       organisms.   In those in
 the lower part of the tube there were a pelagic Foraminifer and Coccoliths.
 The tow-nets at the trawl each contained a little red mud without any
 pelagic Foraminifera.       On the framework of the trawl were several larjx
 patches of blue mud.
                        Eemaeks ox the foregoing         List.
     Several kinds of deposits have been indicated in the foregoing list. For
 the present these may be classed under the following heads : —
 1. Shore-deposits.
                                  —
    («) Blue and green muds. Met with near the shores of most of              the
           great continents and islands.
    (h) Grey muds and sands.
                                  — Met with chiefly near oceanic islands       of
           volcanic origin.
    (c) Eed mud.
                     — Met with on the eastern coast of South America.
    (d) Coral-mud.— Met with near coral reefs.
 2.   Globifjcrina-ooze. — An abundant    oceanic deposit not met    with  south
       of latitude 50° S.
 3.  Radiolarian ooze. — An oceanic deposit met with only in the Western
       and Middle Pacific.
4. Diatomaceous ooze. — An oceanic deposit met with only south of 50° &
       latitude.
5. Bed and Grey Clays.       — The most abundant oceanic deposit.
    The   above names    have been selected as  indicating those elements which
give the predominating character. of the deposit.          As a rule, when the
debris of continents or     islands, the dead shells  of Foraminifera, the exu
viae of Eadiolarians &c, the frustules of Diatoms, or red or grey clayey
matter — when any of these have appeared to make up considerably more
than one half of the specimen under examination, it has been called a
shore-deposit, a Globie/erina, Eadiolarian, or Diatom ooze, or red or grey
clay.
    Sometimes it has been doubtful whether a specimen should be placed
under one of the above heads or another, on account of the nearly equal
ratio of constituents, or where one deposit overlies another of a different
kind. In these cases the specimen has been placed under that head
with which, on a general view, it has seemed to have most in common,
or to which the surface-layer belonged, and a detailed description has
been added in the list.      A sixth kind of deposit or formation might have
been added, to embrace those bottoms in which a great quantity of the
peroxide of manganese occurs.         This substance, in the form of nodules
or concretions, of incrustations     or in grains, has been found in nearly all

                                             '
                         on board   H.M.S.     Challenger.'               519
  sea-deposits and at all depths in more or less abundance.      However, for
  the present, it has been considered best to treat of its occurrence sepa
  rately, at the some time pointing out those regions where we have found
 it in greatest abundance.
  .  A   few remarks may now be made upon each of the kinds of deposits
 indicated.
     1. Shore-deposits. — It has been found that the deposits taking place
  near continents and islands have received their chief characteristic from
 the presence of the debris of adjacent lands.      In some cases these depo
 sits extend to a distance of over 150 miles from the coast.           Several
 varieties can be recognized amongst these shore-deposits.
                                 —
     (a) Blue and Green Muds. In the great majority of cases the deposits
 near continents and large islands, containing the older and crystalline
 rocks, have been of a blue or green colour ; the only exception appears
 to be the east cgast of South America, where we have a red mud, to be
 presently referred to.
    In   from 100 to 700 fathoms these deposits are often of a green colour,
 due to the presence of green amorphous clayey matter, and dark and pale
green glauconite particles.
    Beyond 700 fathoms they are usually of a blue or dark slate-colour,
having a thin upper layer of a red or brown.         This red layer is a soft
ooze,    whilst the blue mud or clay beneath is very compact and tenacious.
    Much amorphous clayey matter and fine particles of mica, quartz, and
other minerals are found in all these deposits, the mineral particles in
creasing in size as we approach the land.
    Down to 1500 fathoms, we have generally found that Pteropod, larval
 Gasteropod, and Lamellibranch shells were tolerably abundant, and that
there were many of the shore forms of Foraminifera, as Textularias, Eo-
tularias, Nodosarias, Uvigerinas, Lagenas, &c. Pelagic Foraminifera occur
throughout the deposit, but not in such abandance as in a true ocean-
deposit.     The frustules of Diatoms and their broken parts are numerous.
Manganese grains are found in many of the bottoms, usually in the
deeper soundings.       We   have also found imbedded in these muds pieces
of wood, fruits, portions of fruits, and leaves of trees.    Large pieces of
rock, as pumice and granite, and rounded pebbles also occur. Our sound
ings near the southern ice-barrier were muds of a blue colour, containing
many granitic and other pebbles and blocks, mostly rounded, and many
Diatoms, and resembled in most respects the deposits we found off the
east coast    of North America, Halifax to New York.
    Beyond 1500 or 1700 fathoms, Pteropod and Heteropod shells are
usually not found, and in 3000 fathoms hardly a Foraminiferous or other
carbonate-of-lime     organism remains.
    Siliceous organisms occur at all depths, but at times their remains
would seem to be completely removed.
    These green and blue muds have been found to prevail in all the en-

530          Mr.    J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined
closed seas we have visited, as Arafura, Banda, Celebes, and China     Seas,
Inland Sea of Japan ; and in all these the carbonate-of-lime organisms
would appear to be removed from the bottoms in depths less by some
400 or 500 fathoms than on open coasts.
   In the green muds from 50 to 700 fathoms we have found those beau
tiful casts of Foraminifera, Pteropods, Echini-apmss, and other carbonate-
of-lime organisms frequently in great numbers.          These are of a dark
green, pale green, and dirty white colour. In all cases where these green
internal casts occur we have many glauconite grains in the bottom.
Beyond 700 fathoms these casts seldom occur, and when they do they
are very sparingly distributed ; and the same may be said of the glauco
nite grains which accompany them. Biver-muds, in which Pteropods,
Badiolaria, and pelagic Foraminifera are usually wanting, are included in
these deposits.
   The following are the localities in which we have found the blue muds
(an * before the locality indicates that the glauconite casts and grains
have been found there) : —
      * Off coast of Portugal.
         „ Virgin Islands (?).
      * „ Coast of North America, Halifax to New York.
         „ Guinea, coast of Africa.

      *

      * „ New Zealand.
      * „ New Guinea and Philippines, and throughout the            seas of
               the East-Indian archipelago.
      * „ Japan.

   (J)  Grey Muds and Sands. — Near volcanic islands we have found that
the deposits have a distinctive character, from the presence of the debris
of volcanic rocks.     The presence of pieces of pumice, scoria, &c. prevents
this deposit having that clayey character so characteristic of the blue
mud.     The colour is generally grey, but occasionally is a black sand or
a more or less slate-coloured   mud.     In  some  places the shells of oceanic
organisms make up a large part of these muds.
   Down to about 1500 fathoms we have Pteropod, Heteropod, and sur
face Gasteropod shells, and the shore forms of Foraminifera are common.
Deeper than 1500 fathoms, Pteropod shells are rare or entirely removed.
Pelagic Foraminifera are found at all depths ; but occasionally they and
the siliceous organisms are quite absent at a depth of little over 2000
fathoms, and then we have a clay or mud with many small particles of
pumice, scoria, &c.     Manganese appears to be intimately associated with
some of these bottoms, especially where the debris          of augitic lavas are
present, as at Sandwich Islands, Canaries, and elsewhere.                Off the
Desertas, in 670 fathoms, all the dead shells, pieces of Polyzoa, &c. had
a slight coating of this substance, and we have had indications of the
same thing in even less depths.      In 1100 fathoms off the Canaries some
pieces of shell had rather a thick coating ; and in 1575 fathoms, not far
from this place, the dredge brought up a great quantity of a Gorgonoid
axis deeply imbedded in or coated with this black oxide of manganese.
    In some localities  this deposit extends to a great distance from the
islands, as at Hawaii, 200 miles or more.

hues of the green glauconite casts.               One very remarkable exception
         —
occurs : off the Crozets there were (in 600 fathoms) many beautiful
casts of the carbonate-of-lime organisms of a pale straw-colour.           Xone of
the glauconite grains were noticed in the same sounding or locality.
                    — It has already been stated that the deposit along the
    (c) Red Mud.
east coast of South America, from Cape San Eoque to Bahia, differed
from the deposits found along the shores of other continents and large
islands in being of a red colour.          There can be little doubt but that this
red colour   is due   to  the presence    of  the ochreous matter carried into the
Atlantic by the South-American rivers. There are reasons for thinking
that the red colour of some of the deep-sea clays in this region of the
Atlantic may have a Uke origin.
    The soundings near the shore and in shallow water have a deeper
red colour and contain larger mineral particles and fewer organic re
mains than those further from land and in deeper water.              The mineral
particles are chiefly quartz and mica.
    In all these soundings there are many pelagic and other Foraminifera,
Heteropod, Pteropod, larval Gasteropod, and Lamelbbranch sheila, Coc-
coliths, and Ehabdoliths.        Siliceous organic remains, as of Diatoms and
Eadiolaria, are almost quite absent in these bottoms. In some of the
shallower depths a few red-coloured casts of Foraminifera were observed ;
but these were rare, rough, and more or less imperfect.

     (d) Coral-Mud. This is         a deposit     found in the neighbourhood of
 coral reefs.    It is characterized by a large quantity of amorphous calca
 reous matter, by the debris of coral reefs, by many large calcareous forms
 of Foraminifera, and by broken pieces of Polyzoa, &c. All the deposits
 about Bermuda are of this nature, extending from the edge of the reef
 down to a depth of 2500 fathoms.             At 1000 fathoms the mud assumes a
 rose tinge   ; this deepens into a red colour with greater depth and the
 accompanying decrease of carbonate of lime and increase of clayey matter,
 until the coral-mud merges into the red and grey clays of the surrounding
 ocean.    About Bermuda very few mineral particles were found. In some
 of the soundings to the S.W. of the island there were some small pieces
 of a green rock like those at St. Paul's Bocks, and probably serpentine.
 One or two pieces of quartz, or sanidin, a piece of mica, and a small piece
 of pumice (?) were also noticed. Dissolving away carbonate of lime in

about Bermuda.
  At     the    Virgin Islands, at Tongatabu, at Fiji Islands, at Cape York,
Admiralty Islands, Honolulu, and Tahiti we also met with coral-muds.
Except at Cape York, these muds appeared to exist as a narrow band
around the land, and had usually a considerable admixture of clayey
matter and mineral particles.
   Where there was much clayey matter we found usually a few rough
red casts of the Forarninifera.

  2.  Globigerina-ooze. — After the deep-sea clays, this is the most abun
dant deep-sea deposit.    It has occurred at all depths from 250 fathoms
to 2900 fathoms.     The Glohigerinas, which give at once the name and
the chief characteristic to this deposit, are really found all over the bot
tom of the ocean.                    Even in our deepest clays,

selected and all the amorphous matter be washed away, one or two shells
of some variety of pelagic Foraminifera can usually be detected. By
pursuing this method                  I
                         have only failed on one or two occasions.   They
appear to be quite absent in the Arafura Sea.    It however, when they              is,
occur in vast numbers that they form the deposit known         this name                            by           ;
at least such   the sense in which
                     is                  here used.  it   is
  We did not find  Globigerina-ooze in any of the enclosed seas, in the
                                 a
Southern Ocean south of lat. 50° S., nor in the North Pacific north of
lat. 10°    N.
   In the  Southern Ocean only one small species of Globigerina was found
 in the surface-waters  but in the North Pacific many varieties of pelagic
                                      ;
 Foraminifera abound near the surface of the ocean.
    In other parts of the preceding oceans, and in the other oceans we
 have    visited,occurs in irregular patches, being always present in the
                     it
 open ocean when we have depths of less than 1800 fathoms.       Its pre
 sence or absence at depths beyond 1800 fathoms      however, determined        is,
 by conditions at present unknown.      number of varieties occur both as
                                                          A
 to colour and composition.     Some specimens are nearly pure white,
 others have    rose-colour, and others are red or dark brown.
                     a                                           The red
 and brown           colour arises from the presence of the oxides of iron and

524          Mr.    J.  Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined
manganese.      In the white varieties the sediment, after dissolving away
the carbonate of lime, is in some specimens abundant, in others not
abundant, and is either of a red or slate-blue colour. We find the
former colour to prevail in those soundings far from continents and large
islands, and the sediment is not abundant except where pumice or scoria
is present.   The latter, or slate-blue colour, is found in those soundings
more or less near continents        and large islands ; and it is suspected that
this sediment     has its source chiefly from the disintegration of these
adjacent lands.
    Mica, quartz, pumice, scoria, and other mineral particles are met with ;
but in those soundings furthest from land a little piece of pumice or
scoria may be the only trace of mineral particles.
    In some specimens there are very many remains of organisms with
siliceous shells, as Badiolaria, Diatoms, and Challengerias ; but in others
these remains are almost entirely wanting.            In three soundings in mid-
Atlantic between the Canary and Virgin Islands, and in several sounding?
in the South Pacific, manganese in the forms of grains and nodular con
cretions is very abundant.         As a rule, however, this substance occurs
rather sparingly     in   Globigerina-ooze.     In some instances we get little
nodules of these bottoms, the shells as it were being run together by a
siliceous cement.      Many small pieces of cherty-like mineral also occur,
which are angular and soft, and do not look as if they had been trans
ported.    Manganese nodules occurring in the Globyerina-ooze have
often a nucleus of a yellow and green colour, in which Ghbigerina-sheH*
can be seen ; but their carbonate of lime has been entirely removed, and
replaced by a silicate.      There are reasons for thinking that these indica
tions of flint (?) occur only in those samples where the siliceous shells of
Badiolaria, Diatoms, &c. are wanting, and do not occur where these
 organisms are present.        A reexamination of all the bottoms must be
 made before     this    statement    can   be   definitely  affirmed.   Casts   of
Foraminifera occur very sparingly in Globigerina-ooze ; in the purest
samples not at all. In those with an admixture of clayey matter we
have frequently one or two partial casts of a very rough character.             In
two soundings,     Nos.    211  and   301,  in  the Pacific, we   found the  Fora-
 minifera not only filled, but also coated with a red substance, so that we
had both an internal and an external cast, the two being connected by
little rods representing the foramina of the shell.            In these soundings
there was   much   clayey    matter  and  disintegrating pumice and scoria.
    In a few soundings in the Pacific, as No. 304, we have had a
 Globigerina-ooze on the surface of the bottom, and a foot beneath a
nearly pure red or brown clay. Again, as in Nos. 268 and 307, we have
the reverse arrangement, a clay occupying the surface, and the deeper
layers having many Globigerinm.          In all these cases the surface-layer has
been   normal  with    the  other  soundings in the same region as to depth.
In   the first ease     we   might    bring in elevation     to account   for  the

                            on board     H.M.S. 'Challenger.'                     525
 Globigerina-oozB        overlying the red clay, or we might suppose that
chemical      changes are going on in the deeper layers which remove the
carbonate of lime.            In the second case we may account for a red clay
overlying a deposit with many Olobigerince in it by supposing a depression
of the bottom after the latter had been laid down ; or we may believe
tbat agencies are now removing carbonate of lime from the surface-layer,
and that these were not active in some past time.
    This deposit occurs, in one sounding, in the Pacific at a depth of 2925
fathoms      in mid-ocean.         In  the eastern part of the Atlantic      it occurs
also at great depths.

    3.  Iiadiolarian       Ooze. — Organisms   with the siliceous skeletons abound
 in the surface-waters, and apparently also in the deepest waters, of all
 the oceans and seas we have visited *.            The skeletons of these organisms
 are found in all, or almost all, the sea-bottoms.               Even in those cases
 where at first sight they would seem to be quite absent, a more careful
 examination (by dissolving away a large quantity of carbonate of lime
 where this exists, and examining the sediment by careful washing in the
 case of clays, &c.) will usually reveal a Eadiolarian skeleton, a Diatom
 frustule, or broken portions of these.
     It is, however, only in some limited areas that these exuviae rise into
  such prominence as to be characteristic of the deposit taking place.
  Such is the case in the Antarctic, where we have a Diatom-ooze, and in
  the "Western and Middle Pacific, where we have the above deposit.
     * They   are,  however,    much more numerous in the Pacific than in the Atlantic,
  especially in the equatorial waters.

526             Mr.   J.   Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined
   Our deepest sounding (4475 fathoms or 4575, see p. 504) was a Badio-
larian ooze ; with the exception of a little amorphous matter, manganese
particles, a few yellow cherty-like particles, and some pumice pieces, this
bottom was entirely composed of the exuvia; of organisms with siliceous
skeletons — as Eadiolaria, one or two Diatoms, and some organisms which
seem to be undescribed (Challengerias),   but which are numerous in the
deeper waters of the Pacific (see notes on surface animals, p. 536).
   A section of about 3 inches came up. The upper two were of a red
colour, due to the presence of much manganese ; the lower one was a
pale straw-colour, and contained relatively few manganese grains.
  In our trip from the Sandwich Islands to the Society Islands we again
met with Eadiolarian ooze.    Between 7° and 123 north of the equator we
came on a patch represented by   four soundings, some of these containing
not a single Globujerina ; then just on the equator, in two soundings, one
at a depth of 2925 fathoms, we got a Globif/eruia-ooze containing a good
many Eadiolaria. Between 2° and 10° south we again had a patch of
Eadiolarian ooze represented by three soundings, and containing only a
few pelagic Foraminifera or their broken parts. The occurrence of this
patch of Globigerina-ooze in the position indicated (see map, Plate 20),
and the comparative or total absence of the Glob ig m'raa-shells in the

ganese and other mineral particles are much less abundant than in the
adjacent Eadiolarian.     Note also the presence of the south equatorial
current and the dip of some isotherms over the Globigeritia-^aXA. One
or two soundings to the east of Japan might have been classed under
this head  but in them the siliceous remains do not make up over one
            ;
third of the sample in bulk.    Generally    may be said that in the

southern trip, we found Diatoms abundant, both in the surface-waters
and in the bottom.
   About the Crozets, Kerguelen, M'Donald's Islands, and close to the
ice-barrier, the frustules of these organisms were very abundant in the
souudings, but were masked           by   much land-debris.      Between the parallels
of 53° and 03° S., e. between the north edge of the ice and the latitude

remains, a few specimens of one small species of Qlobigerina, a few par
ticles of mica, quartz, and granitic pebbles, also a little amorphous blue
clayey matter.     No manganese particles were noticed. The one of these
soundings which is nearest to the ice contains much amorphous clayey
matter and larger mineral particles than the other two.           "When dried

    5.  Bed and Grey Clays.   — By far   the most abundant oceanic deposits
 are the deep-sea clays. These are of a grey, red, or dark chocolate-colour,
 and are found at depths greater than 2000 fathoms.        The red and choco
late-colours of many of these clays is due to the presence of the oxide of
 iron in the first and of oxide of manganese in the latter instance.       Most
 of them contain some carbonate of lime in the form of Qlobigerina-sheWs ;
 in one or two instances, however,     I  have not been able to find a single
 shell, nor has acid caused the least bubble of effervescence.     The remains
 of siliceous organisms occur also in great numbers in the clays of some
 regions — so much so that, as    I have stated, some of those soundings in
 the North-west Pacific which have been classed as clays might have been
 called Radiolarian ooze.      In most places, however, they are nearly or
  quite absent. These clays are not amorphous in the true sense of the
  word — not amorphous in the sense in •which a chemical precipitate is
  amorphous.     They all contain small white and other coloured mineral
  particles in great abundance —exceedingly small particles, so as to be
  recognized only under the high powers of the microscope.        They contain
  amorphous matter, it is true ; but it is doubtful if this ever makes up so
  much as a half of any sample in bulk.       They also contain larger mineral
  particles, as quartz, mica, pumice, scoria, peroxide of manganese, and
  other mineral particles.    Quartz and mica particles appear to be present
  only in some localities, as the North Atlantic and elsewhere. Peroxide of
  manganese is perhaps always present in the form of grains or nodules,
  sparingly distributed in some regions, in others making up nearly a half
  of the deposit or formation.
    Pumice (the common felspathic or the highly vesicular augitic variety) and
  scoria appear to be universally distributed over the bottom of the ocean,
  and to be abundant in most of the deep-sea clays and present in them all.
  In those clays furthest from continents and islands sharks' teeth, ear-bones
  of whales, other bones of whales, and bones of turtles (?) are very fre
  quently found, all these having usually a more or less thick coating of
  peroxide of manganese.        The following are the depths at which we
  have found these red and grey clays      : —

                                  The Mangatiese in Deposits.
   The peroxide of manganese, in the form of minute grains, concretions,
nodules, aggregations, or incrustations,      occurs widely distributed in
ocean-deposits.   It has been met with most frequently in the deep-sea
clays ; indeed it seems to be present in all of them, sparingly in some
localities, abundantly in others.
   It however, not confined to these clays
      is,                                             has been found in most
                                                           ;   it
of the other deposits and at all depths greater than 500 fathoms. In
the Qlobigerina- and Eadiolarian ooze and in the clays                  usually     it
assumes the forms of minute grains, pellets, and nodules.             In those
bottoms to which        givesit   chocolate-colour,
                                           a           the higher powers of
the microscope show small, round, red-brown grains of manganese, often
with dark spot in the centre.
      a
   The nodules vary from little pellets to masses of         large size and of
                                                                        a
several pounds in weight.     In some regions every thing at the bottom,
even the bottom itself, would appear to be overlaid by and impregnated
with this substance. In the foregoing list, as at No. 318 and elsewhere,
some of the nodules have been described with        little detail. The varie

  Nodules      of   a   black-brown        colour   throughout, the manganese being

          enclosing lines of red clay.

            trie layers, the original nucleus being often very deeply impreg
           nated by spider-like ramifications of the manganese, or nearly the
           whole pumice may be replaced by manganese.               When pieces of
           bone have formed the nucleus we have much the same state of
           things.     The compact bone of the tympanies of cetaceans does
           not, however, appear to alter so rapidly as other bone ; and hence
           it may be that we get ear-bones in such great numbers.
    Sharks' teeth of all sizes (one was 4 inches across the base) are fre
quent, and are sometimes surrounded by concentric layers of nearly an
inch in thickness.         A siliceous sponge (Farrea) was found imbedded in
two inches.
    A   mass    of red clay may occupy the centre of the nodule. The nucleus
is occasionally a mottled yellow-and-green             substance, with agate bands
in some parts, and Globigerina, the carbonate of lime being replaced by
silicate in these last.         This nucleus can be cut with a knife, like new
cheese, or it is hard and brittle, breaking with a conchoidal fracture.
     Large flat     aggregations occur which        seem   to have been formed  on
 hardened flat     portions of the bottom.
     The Olobigerina-BheQa and Badiolaria are at times covered by small
 specks of the manganese j and in the former these are deposited in the
 substance of the shell.
     In  several soundings      and dredgings to the south-west of the Canaries
 we    got very    many large pieces of a branching Gorgonoid which were
 deeply    coated and impregnated with manganese. This was in a depth of
 from 1100 to 1575 fathoms.
     In   670 fathoms,      off the Desertas,    the dead shells, pieces of coral,
 Polyzoa, Ac. were all coated       with a thin film of the peroxide of manganese ;
 and we have had indications of the same thing in still shallower water.
     In some of the Kadiolarian oozes, and in other deposits, we have found
  the manganese more abundant in the upper layers than in the lower, and
 vice vend.
     The   following are the localities where we        have  met the manganese in
  greatest    quantities : —
      Off the Canary Islands.
      Mid-Atlantic, between Canary and         Virgin Islands.

530               Mr.  J. Murray on Oceanic Deposits examined
deepest trawlings have very frequently small branching tubes, composed
of clay and sandy particles, running over their surfaces. These belong
to a Khizopodal organism.         The sarcode which fills these tubes contains
many     large brown pigment-cells, and small bioplasts are collected in
clumps at distances along the length of the tube, or are scattered
throughout it.
    Tubes of a similar nature,        but composed of pieces of Olobigerina,
Kadiolaria, &c., would appear to be rather abundant on some of the
oozes, and to run irregularly over the bottom.
    In the clays we always get some arenaceous forms of Foraminifera
when there has been a successful haul with the trawl. Their shells are
made up of pieces of manganese, clay, and small mineral particles, and
they contain the same kind of sarcodic substance as the tubes above
 referred to.
    An attached calcareous form (c. f . CarpeiUeria)       has been found in rather
 deep   water, and Biloculinas, Nodosarias,       Triloculinas, and other forms
 have been      frequently procured alive.    These last have orange-coloured
 pigment-cells, in which respect they resemble surface Rhizopods.                A
 living specimen of Orbvtlina or Qlobigerina undoubtedly from the bottom
 has not yet been met with.
    In the early part of the cruise many attempts were made by all of the
 naturalists to detect the presence of free protoplasm in or on the bottoms
 from our soundings and dredgings, but with no definite result.             It was
 undoubted, however, that some specimens of the sea-bottom preserved in
 spirit assumed a very mobile or jelly-like aspect, and also that flocculent
 matter was often present.
     Mr. Buchanan determined that the flocculent matter was simply the
  amorphous       sulphate of lime precipitated by spirit from the sea-water *.
  Subsequently a number of experiments were made upon the behaviour
  of this amorphous precipitate when precipitated with different quantities
  of spirit and when treated with colouring-solutions. The precipitate
  was also examined alone and mixed up with some of the ooze.                   The
  ooze was examined at the same time, and in the same manner, but with
  out having been treated with spirit.       The results were shortly these : —
     When sea-water is treated with twice its volume of spirit or less,
           nearly the whole of the amorphous precipitate assumes the crys
           talline form in a short time.
     When treated with a great excess of spirit the precipitate remains
           amorphous, and assumes a gelatinous aspect.
     This gelatinous-like sulphate of lime colours with the carmine and
           iodine solutions, and when mixed with the ooze has, under the
           microscope, the appearances so minutely described by Hackel.
     The   ooze washed     with distilled water, or taken just as it comes up,
           and treated in the same manner with colouring-solution, does not
                              *
                                See Mr. Buchanan's report.

                          on board    H.M.S. 'Challenger'                      531
          show these appearances.         The jelly-like aspect and the matter
          coloured with carmine can always be removed from the spirits
         preserved specimens of the ooze by treating with distilled water.
    In all   cases the jelly-like or mobile aspect of the    oozes is found to be
         due to the presence of the flocculent         precipitate  from the sea-
         water associated with the ooze.
    No free albuminous matter could        be detected.^
    When it is remembered that the original describers worked with spirit-
preserved specimens of the bottom, the inference seems fair that Bathy-
hius and the amorphous sulphate of lime are identical, and that in
placing    it amongst living things, the describers have committed an error.
      Origin of Deep-Sea Clays.           Eelative bate of Deposition of
                              Deposits.    Conclusion.
    The very wide distribution of pumice, vesicular lava, or light scoria) has
been already alluded to.         Some of the bottoms which have been classed
under the head      of clays,  as 2900 fathoms south    of Tongatabu, are largely
made up of pumice in a fine state of division.              Pumice or vesicular
lavas have, in short, been found in all the kinds of deposits, most
abundantly in the vicinity of volcanic islands and in the deep-sea clays.
It appears to be universally present, and its disintegration is most
 probably the chief source of the clayey matter found in oceanic deposits.
North of the Sandwich Islands we for several days got small pieces of
 pumice floating on the surface, most of the pieces being covered with a
fungoid growth.        In this connexion it may be well to remember that
 Mr. Bates states somewhere that he found pumice rather common,
 floating on the surface of the Amazons, over a thousand miles from the
 nearest volcanic region.      Many instances are given by Sir Charles Lyell of
 volcanic ashes having been transported to great distances by the wind.
     At Honolulu Mr. Green informed me that Peles hair had been picked
 up in his garden there after an irruption of Kelauea in Hawaii, a distance
 of about 180 miles from the crater.         If there be an ash after the carbo
 nate of lime is removed by carbonic acid or other agent, this will be
  another source of the clay.
     Mr. Buchanan has determined in the clays the presence of copper,
  cobalt, and nickel, in addition to iron and manganese.             Bemembering
  this, one is tempted to suggest the presence of meteoric or cosmic dust
  in these deposits.
     When we have had a good haul from a red-clay bottom, when the bag
  comes up full of nodules, tympanic bones, and sharks' teeth, we cannot
  resist the idea that we are dealing with things of a vast antiquity, and
  that we have evidences of a very slowly accumulating deposit.              AVTien
  there has been no reason to suppose that the trawl has sunk more than
   one or two inches in the clay, we have had in the bag over a hundred

of these have been imbedded in over an inch of the manganese, arranged
in concentric layers, while others have had just a trace of manganese on
them, or none at all. We have every reason to suppose that the aggre
gation of the manganese around these relics is a very slow process, and
that consequently the occurrence of these deeply imbedded and recent
teeth and tympanies in the same surface-layers argues strongly in favour
of an exceedingly slow rate of deposition.      These vertebrate remains are
most abundant where the manganese abounds, but occur also in the red
and grey clays, especially in those the furthest from the land, and where
we may suppose the rate of deposition to be reduced to a minimum.
    In the Globigerina, Badiolarian, and Diatom oozes we have found
during the whole cruise only one or two shark's teeth and perhaps one
tympanic bone. In shore-deposits they were even more rare.               These
facts, taken with others that will at once suggest themselves, go to show,
as might be expected, that the shore-deposits accumulate faster than the
organic oozes, and these last faster than the deep-sea clay.        The organ
isms in our Badiolarian ooze appear to resemble very closely and in their
relative proportions those described from the Barbadoes earth.           Those
described from the Oran deposit in Algeria are very like those in the
blue muds taken along the course of the Japan stream. The Globigeritia-
oozes which we get in shallow water resemble the chalk much more than
those in deeper water, say over 1000 fathoms.      It is possible that deposits
similar to those taking place in deep water, far away from the great con
tinental anticlines, may never have been elevated into dry land.
    In conclusion, large quantities of the various bottoms have been stored
with a view to future work, and a large amount of material bearing on
the subjects treated of in this Preliminary Eeport have been accumulated.
When these come to be carefully examined and compared, with the aid
of appliances and conveniences not to be had on board ship, many of the
 statements   herein   made may require to be altered and amended, and
 other facts and relations, more curious and interesting than any hinted
 at, may be revealed.
   2. Preliminary Eeport on   some Surface Organisms       and their relation
                             to Ocean Deposits.
                                     '
    Throughout the cruise of the Challenger,' and especially during the
 past two years, tow-nets have been dragged through the surface and
 deep waters of the sea on every possible occasion.       The contents of the
 nets, so far as known, have been carefully noted, and many hundreds of
 preparations have been made with the view of illustrating the organisms
 occurring in different regions and at various depths.      Many new animals
 have been discovered, and many curious relations brought to light. It
 is not now possible to give any descriptions or to report fully with any
 success or satisfaction on such an extended series of observations.

   A few remarks on those organisms which have              an interest    in re
lation to the deposits taking place at the bottom               of the sea is all
that will be attempted.   Soon after the arrival of             the Expedition at
home   I hope to  be able to give a more complete               report on surface
organisms.
  Diatoms. —In the Southern Ocean, south of Kerguelen,     in the Arafura
Sea, off the coasts of Japan, New Guinea, North America, and in en
closed bays and river-deltas, in short, wherever tho specific gravity of
the sea is low from an admixtnre of fresh water, we have met with very
many Diatoms on the surface.     Taking the maps which Mr. Buchanan
has prepared, showing areas of low specific gravity, and comparing these
with the records of the occurrence of Diatoms in great abundance, it is
significant how often these agree.     Again, excepting the area of the
Diatom-ooze,  those places where Diatoms are abundant, and whore the
specific gravity of the water is low, coincide generally with the areas
where the blue muds are found,        e. along the continents
                                       »'.                    and great
islands.   It   may be stated generally that close to these shores we have
in the surface-waters organisms more or less distinct from those occurring
in the open sea. Besides many forms of Diatoms, the true Noctiluca,
 several Pcridinia, larvae of Annelids, and Mollusca, Hydroid Medusas are
more or less characteristic of these shore waters.      In the Antarctic, in
the Arafura Sea, at Hongkong, off Japan, and elsewhere the tow-nets
were frequently filled with   a   yellow slime in a  short time, which con
sisted chiefly of Diatoms. In the Southern Ocean, as has been stated,
the Diatoms form       a peculiar deposit.   In other deposits they are at
times also well preserved, but occasionally are either completely masked
 by shore-debris or removed from the bottom.
   In the open ocean, in the region marked out by the north edge of the
N.E. trade-wind and the south of the S.E. trade, small forms of Diatoms
do not occur in any numbers.       They are represented, however, by three
large species, which are undescribed so far as    isknown. Mr. Wild has
figured two of these in Plate 21. These organisms have an exceed
ingly thin coating of silica and are true Diatoms, though they have been
confounded with Noctiluca.       The nuclei of both these forms are highly
phosphorescent, and to them the diffused phosphorescence of the ocean
within the tropics    generally due. A third large Diatom has
                       is                                         cylin    a
drical shape and   much thicker coat of silica, and
                   a                                not phosphorescent.
                                                       is
These three forms are highly characteristic of the presence of tropical
oceanic waters.  The provisional generic name of Pyroeystis          is   proposed
for the organisms figured in this Plate.
  Coccospheres  and Rhabdospheres. — These minute organisms, which are
regarded as alga), have been found all over the ocean, except south of the
latitude of Kerguelen and in some of the enclosed seas. Their remains,
in the forms of Coccoliths and Bhabdoliths, make up very considerable
                                                            a
portion of the bottom in some of the Olobujerina-ooms.  They are always

534        Mr. J. Murray            on some Surface Organisms examined
associated with the pelagic Foraminifera ; and when these are absent from
the bottom so also are the Coccoliths and Ehabdoliths.
  Pelagic Foraminifera, — All the observations which have been or may
yet be made upon these animals will be collected at the end of our cruise,
and published with those which have been made by Professor Wyville
Thomson.    It is here proposed to record shortly those results which it
is believed have already been attained.
   Calcareous Foraminifera have been found in the surface-waters           of all
the oceans and seas we have visited, excepting           the Arafura and Japan
inland   seas.
  In the tropics they are most abundant, both as to species and numbers,
and are more numerous in the open ocean than near land.
   Our tow-nets have perhaps in no single instance been dragged down
to 200 fathoms without yielding some forms. At times they occur in
vast numbers on the surface, and with a bottle can be picked up from a
boat. In one specimen thus procured the sarcode of the animal was
found thrown out into bubble-like extensions between the spines of the
shell, and over these expansions of the sarcode and along the spines the
pseudopodia moved freely and rapidly.        Mr. Wild has figured this
specimen in Plates 22 and 23, and Professor Wyville Thomson proposes
to describe it under the generic name of Hastigerina.
   This is the only instance in which we have seen one of these creatures
fully expanded ; however, those taken in the net can, when the ship is
steady, be got to expand partially.   Almost always when they come up
in the  net the sarcode  is found to  adhere to and surround closely the
outside of the shell, so much so that the pigment-cells          and oil-globules
obscure the shell, especially in the Pulvinulinas.
  Those   species without spines apparently throw out bubble-like ex
pansions of the sarcode in the same manner as Hastigerina. They have,
however, been seen only partially extended.
   The sarcode matter of these organisms includes very many orange-
coloured pigment-cells  and oil-globules, the shape and size of these
varying with the species.  The sarcode has also many small bioplasts
scattered through           it,
                             quickly colour with carmine.
                                  which                     These are
generally found congregated in the smaller chambers of the shell when
the animal       is   at rest.
  About     a              of these organisms have been found on the
                  dozen species
surface;                or less tropical, others extend into the region of
            some are more
the westerly winds north and south, and one species     found in the Ant
                                                            is
arctic Ocean.
   The shell of the species represented in the Plate has been observed
only once from the bottom, and then only in    broken state.
                                                     a        This     to   is
be accounted for by the fact that the shell   exceedingly thin, delicate,
                                                   is
and fragile.
  The specimens of these Foraminifera taken in the surface-net are of

                          on board   H.M.S. 'Challenger.'                     535
all sizes, from the smallest ones to those which have         been described with
an exogenous growth.          Species only occur on the bottom in those places
where they are found on the surface.            These organisms are found in
vast numbers on the surface over regions where there are only a few
traces of them or their broken parts on the bottom.
    No living specimen of a Globigerina, an Orbulina, a Pulvinulina, or of
the new genera found on the surface, which undoubtedly came from the
bottom, has yet been met with.
    The foregoing observations appear to justify the opinion that these
organisms live only in the surface and subsurface waters of the ocean.
The most potent agent concerned in the removal of these shells from the
 majority of the deep-sea deposits is very likely that suggested by Pro
fessor Wyville Thomson, viz. carbonic acid; yet there may be others.
 Why these shells should be almost entirely absent in some places at a
 depth of 2000 fathoms, and be abundant in some other few places at a
 depth of 2900 fathoms, has still to be explained.            The tow-net seemed
 to show that they were as numerous in the surface-waters of the one
 region as of the other.
    Two varieties of large cells are occasionally noticed in the pelagic
 Foraminifera, not unlike the reproductive cells which have been described
 as occurring in some Infusoria.
     Radiolaria. — Hadiolaria polyzoa, Acanthometrse, or Polycystina? occur
  almost universally in the surface-waters of the ocean.             As has been
  stated, they (in a few places in the "Western,          Northern,   and Middle
  Pacific)  make  up  a large  or principal  part of  the deposits at the bottom.
  In very many places they appear to be nearly or quite absent in the
  bottoms.     In some Globigerina-oozea they are present in considerable
  numbers, in others they cannot be detected.             What agents are con
  cerned in the removal of these organisms is at this time a matter of
  conjecture.
     Deep-Sea EJiizopods. — In April 1875 a plan of sending down tow-nets
  to a great depth was adopted.       These were either attached to the dredge*
  and trawl-lines, or sent down separately to a depth of 2000 fathoms or
   more.    This method has been repeatedly practised since, and with these
  results.
      On every occasion organisms were found in the deep nets which had
   not hitherto, nor have since, been observed in the nets used near the
   surface.   These appear to have a wide distribution, as the same forms
   have been taken  in the  deep nets   in the North, Middle, and South Pacific,
   whilst the surface organisms have varied      in these regions to a consider
   able extent.   These organisms are : —
      Many small crustaceans, usually of a bright orange-colour — Cope-
   pods, Amphipods, and Cypridinas principally.          Many large- Bized Eadio-
   kria, resembling in   most  respects  those forms   described by Hackel under
   the generic name of Calodendrum.

536       Mr.  J.  Murray on some Surface Organisms examined
    Many other Rhizopods, with more or less flask-shaped or bivalved
siliceous shells, which are undeseribed, so far as is known.
    Mr. Wild has figured six of these last in Plate 24 ; for the sake of
convenience we have been accustomed to call the organisms ChallengeridaB.
This provisional name will be retained if it be found that these organisms
are new to science and universally distributed in deep water.
    The shells of all have an exceedingly beautiful tracery, a fenestrated
appearance often, which was at first supposed to be due to perforations
of the shell, but which a closer examination shows to be caused by pit
like depressions.      Some have only one, others have several openings
through which the sarcode flows.           The sarcode of all these deep-sea
Rhizopods     has  many  large   black-brown    pigment-cells.    Small bioplasts
are scattered through the sarcode.            These collect into capsular-like
clumps when the animal is at rest, and are quickly coloured by carmine.
At times these Challengerid® come up with a good deal of the sarcode
outside of the shell ; and two specimens have been seen to throw out
 elongated pseudopodia.
     I should think that not less than fifty species of these organisms have
been taken in the deep nets already.          They all resemble more or less
those forms drawn by Mr. Wild.          It will be interesting to learn if future
investigations will show these organisms to be present in the deep waters
 of the Atlantic as well as the Pacific.          In the Radiolarian oozes the
 remains of these Challengeridaj make up a considerable portion of the
 deposit, and in some other deposits of the North-west Pacific they are
 well preserved.     In the majority of bottoms, however, they appear to be
 quite absent.
     Pteropods, Heteropods, Pelagic Qasteropods. — Species of these orders
 occur everywhere in the surface-waters of the ocean. Their shells make
 up a large portion of some         deposits in shallow    water, where there is
 relatively little land-debris.
     In  depths less than 1500 fathoms they abound ; deeper than this they
 become more and more rare.          At 2000 fathoms and deeper the only
 trace of these shells in the deposits is an occasional Diacria or lanthina
 of a large size.
     Those shells which are thin     and delicate, as Atlanta, Carinaria, and
 Styliola, disappear first from the bottoms.
                              Gmteeal     Rejiaiiks.
     Everywhere we have found life abundant in the surface and subsurface
 waters of the ocean.      If  living creatures are small in number on the
 surface, the tow-net will usually yield many forms if dragged at a depth
 of 100 fathoms or more. We have not met with any really barren
 regions.    Our observations appear to show that there are several regions
 of the surface of the ocean, each of which is characterized by a number
 of peculiar organisms : —

                      on board   H.M.S. 'Challenger.'                      537
    1. A region roughly marked out by the northern edge of the N.E.
trade-wind and the southern edge of the 8.E. trade-wind.
   2. A region lying along the coasts of great islands and continents,
where we have usually a mixture of fresh and salt water.
   3. A region in the Southern and Antarctic Oceans south of the latitude
 of 50° 8.
    In all depths less than 1500 fathoms there would seem to be a direct
relation between the organisms occurring on the surface and the deposits
taking place on the bottom. "Where we have Diatoms on the surface,
there we have their frustules on the bottom.          Where we have Olobi-
gerina and Pteropods &c. on the surface, there also we get their dead
shells or broken parts of them ; and so also for the Badiolaria, Cocco-
spheres, and other organisms. In some areas within the depths referred to
we occasionally do not find the remains of some of the surface organisms
so numerous as we should expect.         In these cases, however,   I  suspect
they are rather masked or obscured by an abundance of shore debris
than removed from the deposit.
    When we consider the specimens of the bottom from depths greater
than 1500 fathoms, the relation is by no means 60 constant.             It still
holds good that when pelagic Foraminifera, Pteropods, Diatoms, Eadio-
laria, or CoccoUths are found on these bottoms, the same varieties of
each of these are found on the surface ; but perhaps in the majority of
bottoms, in depths greater than 1500 fathoms, the exuviae of some or all
of the organisms found on the surface are partially or wholly absent.
When these have been carefully reexamined, the results tabulated and
compared with other observations recorded at the same place, it is likely
some light will be thrown upon the subject.
                   3. Preliminary Eeport on Vertebrates.
    Of the Vertebrate animals collected during the cruise, the chief interest
is very naturally attached to those fishes on which our special investigations
might be expected to give some information. Many specimens have been
taken in our trawlings and dredgings.       Other than the British Museum
Catalogue, we have with us no literature on this subject.        Many of the
specimens    which  we  regard as  new  may  be described,  and some of those
which are believed to be identical with described species may turn out to
be distinct ; therefore for the present it is considered best to give a list
of the fishes, with the determinations which were made at the time of
 their occurrence, and not to cumber this Eeport with descriptions.
    Besides the fishes taken in the trawl and dredge, many small larval
and adult forms have been obtained in the tow-nets.           These last have
chiefly been preserved as microscopic preparations.        In every case notes
have been taken    at the  time  the  specimens were procured, and all have
been labelled and preserved with great care.

538                 Mr.  J.  Murray on Vertebrates collected
    In  the following    List the depths to which the trawl had been darn
are given.      Of course it is not asserted that the specimens came from
these depths     ; indeed we know that many of the Sternoptychid*                and
Scopelidse are surface creatures.
    It will be seen from the list that all the fishes taken         in  the trawl or
dredge have been relegated to known families. The definitions of some
families will require to be altered in order to admit some of the ne*
forms ; but it is not thought that a new family will require to be esta
blished.
    There are many new genera and species. The list includes the dredg-
ings in all the depths greater than 100 fathoms.              If we had given only
 the trawlings in depths greater than 500 fathoms, all the shore form?
 which appear in the list would have been eliminated.             Our dredgings and
 trawlings    in less than  100   fathoms      do not once  give  a specimen of the
 species so characteristic of the hauls in deep water.
     The deep-sea and oceanic forms belong to very few families.
                                    Sternoptychidce.
     These occur at 40 stations, and over a hundred            specimens have been
 taken. Besides those from the trawl, small species have continually teen
 taken in the nets in warm regions.             South of the latitude of 50: S. we
 did not get a single species of this family.
     Many of the pelagic species occur both in the Atlantic and Pacific
 Oceans, i. e. identical species.
                                       Macrwida
  occur at 24 stations, and about one hundred           specimens have been taken.
  They   have   been  met  with  in  all  latitudes, and most frequently in depths
  between 200 and 1000 fathoms.
     In  this family we have many species which cannot be referred to exi*t-
  ing genera. These fishes were almost always blown out and at times
  even burst when taken from the bag of the trawl.               Some of the species
  appear to be universally     distributed.
                                         Ophidiidce
  occur at 18 stations, and 20 specimens have been taken. These fishes
  would seem to inhabit deeper water than the Macrurids, as they have w
  most cases been present in the trawl when it has been down to depths
  greater    than 1000 fathoms.           All of them appear to be undescribed,
  excepting Byildtes fuscu* (?).         One    specimen is quite blind ; in another,
   which is semitransparent, the eyes are represented by small black dots.
   These fishes are apparently universally distributed.
                                         Scopelidce
   occur 24 times, and, 41 specimens have been taken.                 Many of   these
   are truly pelagic fishes, while others have characters which mark            them

                             by   H.M.S. 'Challenger:                            539
out as deep-sea. The majority of the forms cannot be referred to existing
genera or species. Perhaps the most curious fish which we have obtained
belong to this family. Two or three species have the upper rays of the
pectoral fins greatly elongated, these rays being much longer than the
fish in some      cases.  These rays arch over the head, and when erected
simulate in a wonderful way Umbellularias, Virgularias, or Crinoids.
Another species has a large white (phosphorescent?) organ situated on
the head between the eyes.
     These fishes have occurred in all regions, and when the trawl has been
down to depths varying from 255 to 2385 fathoms.
                                        Stomiatidce
 occur at 13 stations, and 15 specimens have been taken.                  These have
been present only when the trawl has been down in deep water, and all
have more or less deep-sea characters.               There are two or three new
 generic forms, and new specimens of Malacosteus and Echiostoma have
 been secured.
                                        Pediculati
 occur    at  7 stations,    and 7 specimens have been taken.             A Chaunax
 from 360 fathoms at the Fijis appears to be identical with that
 described from the sea off Madeira as Chaunax pictm.                 The other fishes
 of this family all belong to the same little group with Melanocitus, One-
 roides, and Ceratias.       One, which     I propose  to describe under the name
 of Ceratias uranoscopus,          came up from 2400 fathoms in the North
  Atlantic, the only living thing in the dredge on this occasion.
                                       Halosauridcs.
      Halosaurus    Owenii occurs at 5 stations,       and 5 specimens have been
  taken.     These seem all to be referable to the described species, and occur

      One specimen was taken off the coast of Japan.             It is a new species.
                                         Murcenidce
   occur at 10 stations, and 20 specimens have been taken.                 This family
   in our deep-water hauls       is  represented by Nemichthys      and  Synaphobran-
   chus.    The Nemichthys in the Atlantic is identical with the one described
   (scolopacea).     One taken    in the Pacific is generically distinct.
      All  the specimens of Synaphobranchvs can,          I think, be referred to the
   species described (pinnatus).          They have occurred widely both in the
   Atlantic and Pacific, and generally with the Macrurids.
                                         Trachinidce.
      A   species   referable   to the     genus   Chcenichthys,   but with    deep-sea
   characters, occurred     in one of the    deep hauls  in the Southern Ocean.

    Only ono small specimen of the Sphyraenidm and                   one of the       Tri-
churidse have been taken during the cruise.
    We have while at sea captured only two species of sharks. One
occurs widely distributed in the Atlantic and Pacific ; the other was
taken off the coast of Japan.
   Whenever the ship           has   been at anchor, and wherever possible, collec
tions have been made of Fishes, Amphibians, Septiles, Birds, and
Mammals.         Collectively these now form a large collection.             They have
been preserved as skins, spirit specimens, and skeletons, and all                  with a
view to future work. In the former three classes we have met                      with a
good many new species. In Birds we may have some new species.                           In
Mammals it is not likely we have any new species except amongst the
Cheiroptera.
   Of the Petrels and Penguins we have very extensive collections,                    both
as skins and spirit, chromic acid, and other preparations.
   Two or three skeletons of very large specimens of the Sea-Elephant
have been preserved, and many specimens              of the Southern Seals.

 III.    " Preliminary Report          to Professor    Wyville     Thomson, F.R.S.,
         Director of the Civilian Scientific Staff, on the true Corals
        dredged by H.M.S. 'Challenger' in deep water between the
        dates Dec. 30th, 1870, and August 31st, 1875."                         By H. N.
        Moseley, Naturalist to the Expedition. (Published by per
        mission of the Lords of the Admiralty.) Received February 14,
        1876.     Read March 16.
   The following Eeport is to          be regarded as merely preliminary,        and   will
                                                                           '
be followed     by a full account of the corals dredged by the Challenger,'
which can be prepared only after the termination of the present voyage.
   Many specimens have been sent home for greater security, and are
thus not available for comparison.             Moreover, in the case of corals, it is
impossible to determine, with any accuracy, specific relations without
making comparisons with museum collections, which, of course, has been
impossible in the present instance.
   The list of corals obtained here given has been made as accurate as
circumstances would permit.               The amount of corals obtained by the
'Challenger'      in   deep  water    has  been small, considering the very large
number      of dredgings which have been made. Corals have been yielded
by only    about   forty-eight of the numerous dredgings and trawlings. Of

                      Corals dredged by H.M.S. ' Challenger.'                      545
these forty-eight hauls, twenty-five were made in 1873, thirteen in 1874,
vnd ten in 1875. The much larger proportion of coral-yielding hauls
obtained in the earlier part of the cruise is no doubt partly due to the
fact that the dredge was then most frequently made use of, whereas sub
sequently the trawl has been almost exclusively employed, since it yields
so much better general results. The majority of deep-sea corals being
simple and imbedded often partly in the mud, are more readily gathered by
the dredge. It is remarkable, however, that the trawl does bring up some
times abundantly such small discoid forms as Pungia symmetrica ; and
one of the best hauls of corals obtained was made with the trawl. It
¦was    that which yielded, on Sept. 26th, 1874, between the Ke Islands and
 the B.inda       group, in 129 fathoms, two most beautiful new species of
 StepTuinophyllia, a very large new species of Deltocyaihus, a new Plaiy-
 trochus, besides several simple Eupsammida and CaryopJiylliin<t.                   The
 following is a list of the corals obtained from depths of 50 fathoms and
  upwards, with a statement of all the various localities and depths at
 which       each form has occurred.

                       Caryophyllia clavus (Scacchi).
   Professor Martin Duncan (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. 1870, vol. v.
4th ser. p. 289) has remarked on the wide variation displayed             this                       by
species, and, after an examination of        long series of specimens, has
                                                              a
concluded that C. clavus, C. Smithii, C. cyathus, and C. borealis are to
be regarded as varieties of one and the same species, for which the
name C. clavus     adopted by him in his final description of the corals
                         is
dredged     H.M.S. Porcupine.' Many varieties of this form have been
             by               '
obtained by the Challenger       but the series obtained in each separate

locality have been remarkably uniform, showing        similarity of variation a
produced in the species by the action of certain external conditions.
This fact has been found to hold good, not only in the case of Caryo
phyllia clavus but also in that of Dcltocyathus Agassizii and Fungia sym
metrica, as       will   be subsequently       As instances may be cited
                                                     described.
the two following hauls of C. clavus  — On July 10, 1873, in the neigh
                                                        :
bourhood of the Azores, in lat. 37° 24' N., long. 25° 13' W., about thirty
specimens of the coral were obtained from 1000 fathoms.    Many of them
were in the fresh condition with the soft parts uninjured.    The corals
were all sharply conical, with narrow, pointed, unattached bases, and all
uniformly curved.    They were from      bottom of fine mud, where only
                                                         a
very small particles are present for the attachment of the young coral.
On dredging off the island of Fayal in the Azores in        depth of 50                a
fathoms, another series of C. clavus was obtained.  Here the bottom was
composed of irregular masses made up of            coarse volcanic sand      a
cemented by Setpida-tubea.     The adult CaryophyUias were attached to

 550                        Mr. H. N. Moseley          on the true
 these masses by broad bases, and were all remarkably small, do dcobt
 from the unfavourable condition in which they existed on a volcanic
bottom.
    The largest of the series of 30 specimens of the curved variety of f.
clavus measured 2 centims. in height.                 The soft parts of the animils
 were transparent and almost colourless.
                                      Acanthocyathus, sp.
    Obtained     off Kadavu,        Fiji Islands, August     3, 1874,  in 210     fathoms.
 The specimen appears to be closely allied to A. Orayi as described by
 Milne-Edwards*.            It differs in being attached, not free ; but the pedicle
 of attachment is very fine. A. Grayi has its lateral costae provided with
three or four spines, very strong, horizontal, and compact.                         In the
present specimen the spines are developed only on one of the literal
costre,   and indicated        by indentations     on the other.    The caliele is onl
in horizontal section, as in A. Grayi. Three species of Aeanthotyaikw
have been described, viz. A. Grayi, recent, locality unknown ; A. Hsi-
tinysa, of Miocene age, from Malta (M.-Edw. & H., I. e.) ; and A.
spiniger, recent, from Japan, lately described by Saville             Kent t.
                            Trochocyaihus coronatus (Pourt.).
    The corallum is white.            It is free, but with a small scar of adherens-.
It is  circular in horizontal section, with a broad flat base, with the plane
of which the walls of the caliele, sloping outwards, make an angle of
about 60°.      At the junction of the wall of the caliele with the base, the
base is continued horizontally outwards into twelve stout spines, irre
gularly beset with small pointed tubercles.                 The spines correspond in
position with the primary and secondary costte.                  There are sis system?
of septa, and four cycles, with a partial fifth cycle in large specimens.
The septa of the four cycles are complete.                  All the septa are exsert.
The primary, secondary,           and   tertiary septa bear pali, those of the tertiary
septa being the most developed.                The columella is large and composed
of a tubercular mass of contorted papilla;.                     The largest specimen
measures 27 millims. in diameter of the caliele, and 32 millim?. in
extreme diameter between the tips of the exsert septa.                    Its extreme
height is 20 millims.
    Five specimens of this coral were obtained off St. Thomas, D. W.L, in
390 fathoms.         One of the specimens, being very young, was seen to be
identical with the young and imperfect specimen figured and described
by Count Pourtales as T. coronatus +.                  The young form differs verr
much from the adult, the spines being scarcely at all developed.                     In its
tendency     to  develop     a  fifth  cycle  of septa this species conforms with tte

       This coral has been dredged on five occasions. On one occasion thirteen
specimens, all dead, were obtained.    On another, July 10, 1873, lat. 37°
26' N., long. 25° 14' W., fifty specimens were procured at one haul, most
of them with the soft parts in situ. An examination of this latter fine
series gives the following results.    Although the series obtained near
St. Thomas, D. W. I.,'appeared to bear out Pourtales's assertion that the
 young coralla of this          are cup-shaped, and that they gradually
                               species
 become more saucer-shaped as age advances, such      not the case in the
                                                                      is
 long series of fifty specimens. In this nearly all the larger specimens
 have the ealicle deeply cup-shaped, whilst the younger ones are flatter,
 and some of the very small ones (2-5 millims. in diameter) absolutely
 flat. Some of the specimens are 14 millims. in diameter,       shade larger     a
 than Pourtales's largest specimen. The series presents points of well-
 marked variation from the West-Indian specimens.        The coralla are all
 characterized by having their primary and secondary septa, as well as
 their pali, extremely exsert but the pali never project so high as the
                                      ;

 "West Indies. No tendency towards the horned variety described                               by

                 is
 more cup-like than specimens hitherto obtained, approach the fossil D.

                                      by
 D. Agassizii to be not specifically distinct from D. italicus.    A direct
 comparison of the long series of specimens of the recent species obtained
 by us with the fossil form will no doubt determine this point.
           Deltocyathus Agassizii (horned variety of Pourtales).
   M. de Pourtales, in his description of Deltocyathus Agassizii, gives an
 account of varieties of that species in which the primary costse are large
 and prolonged beyond the margin of the ealicle, forming        star.  One       a
 mutilated specimen      is   figured by this author,         in which the primary        costso
 are    prolonged     into horn-like appendages             as     long    as   one fourth   the

552                       Mr. H. N. Moseley on the         true
diameter of the calicle *. In sounding off Bermuda, on April 17, 1573,
in about 200 fathoms, a finely preserved specimen of this variety wm
obtained, in which the horn-like appendages are developed to a remark
able degree.  The diameter of the calicle is 9 millims. ; the length of the
horns or spines is 3"5 millims., or more than one third the diameter of
the calicle. The horns have no accessory prong as in Pourtales's spec-
men ; they are slender, rounded, and taper to a fine point. A some
what smaller horn is developed in relation with one of the secondary
costiB,   although  the remaining secondary costce show no                       tendency to
elongation.    The horned or stellate variety of D. Agassizii                    appeared    to
Pourtales,  at first, to present good specific characters ; but               the eiamim-
tion of intermediate forms showed that it was not specifically distinct.
None of these intermediate forms have been obtained by us, the single
specimen of the extreme condition of the variety standing quite isolated.
The specimen, which is in most excellent preservation, shows further
points of iuterest. Thus the pali, as a whole, project more prominently
above the general elevation of the septa than is the case in the norm*!
specimens ; and the V or delta formed by the junction of the secondary
with the tertiary pali is prominent and conspicuous ; so that in this
respect the coral approaches the fossil species D. italicus, as figured by
Bronn t, more closely than do the normal species ; and there are, further,
present around the columella, or, rather, to be considered as formin; part
of  it,six small rounded projections covered with minute spines placed
                                                                                        be
regularly, one opposite each of the secondary septa, as appears to     the
case  in the fossil form.   In other respects, however, the specimen show
the same differences from D. italittis as are presented                     by
                                                                    the normal
specimens    and  as are  described  by Pourtales, viz.  the cost*  are  covered
with fine sharp granulations, not formed of large grains, and the colu
mella, or rather its central portion, shows no traces of               threefold a
arrangement.      The corallum      an almost flat disk, much flatter than any

   During   a visit which  I paid to Boston in the spring of 1S73, Count
Pourtales informed me that he had obtained          series of specimens

this species differs more strongly than D. Agassizii from D. italicus, the
columella being very diffuse and finely trabecular, whilst there is no trace
of the rows of tubercles on the cost*'.                    A fifth cycle of septa is fully
developed,      whereas      the    other    two  species of the genus have only four
cycles.     All the septa bear pali disposed in four crowns, the quaternary
pali being largest. The diameter of the corallum is 3 centims.                               The
disk of the living animal was of a light ochre-yellow colour, somewhat
reddened towards the margin of the calicle.                     The tentacles were white.

    The corallum        is compressed and wedge-shaped, without trace of ad
herence, and prodded with lateral aliform expansions derived from the
lateral costse.       It has six systems of septa and four cycles. The septa
 are exsert      with rounded superior borders.                  The columella is elongate
 and   fascicular. The corallum is of a pale reddish colour.                        In outward
 aspects   this  coral    resembles      the   genus   Endopachys        *,  but shows  no trace
 of perforate      structure.        It appears also related to the genus Spheno-
 trochus  t, in which,      however, there are only three cycles of septa, and the
 septa are    not    exsert.     Sphenotrochus crisp>us has the lateral costa; more
 developed      than those of the faces.               It  is placed provisionally in the
  genus Platytrochus,       which, however, has in the species known only three
  cycles  of septa.      The Platytrochi have broad, lateral cost®.                  PI. Stokesii

      The corallum is white           ;  it is shallow and saucer-shaped ; it has a
  short,  rudimentary pedicle, with small scar of adherence. The primary
  and secondary costa? are prominent              and serrate.          There are six systems
  of   septa  and five cycles.             The whole      of the       septa are exsert, the
   primary   and    secondary       extremely      so,  projecting 1 eentim. above the
   margin of the calicle.         The quinary septa unite with the quaternary,
   the quaternary with the tertiary, and the tertiary with the secondary.
   The   primary septa remain free throughout their whole course to the
   columella.     The columella is large and oval, and composed of contorted
   fascicular matter.
      The extreme diameter of the corallum between the tips of the exsert
   septa is 5*75 centims., the extreme height 2-15 centims.
      A young specimen of this coral, with the soft parts in situ, was
   dredged on 10th July, 1873, in lat, 37° 26' N., long. 25° 14' W., from
   1000 fathoms     ;  and a single adult specimen was obtained from off Por

nainbuco, Brazil, in 675 fathoms.            It   was without soft parts, but only
recently dead.
                           CeratotroeJius   platypus, sp. n.
   The coralluin is shallow and circular, with a wide horizontal base, from
which the low calicular wall rises abruptly and almost vertically.                  A
rudimentary    peduncle is present attached to a small spiral shell, which,
together   with   the peduncle, becomes buried and obliterated in fully
grown specimens. Primary and secondary costa) are slightly marked ;
they are simple, without teeth.           There are six systems of septa and five
cycles. The quinary septa are incomplete.                  The septa are not fused
with one another.         The primary       and     secondary septa are extremely
exsert.    "Well-marked pali are present on three of the septa of the larger
specimen ; otherwise pali are absent. The columella is rudimentary.
   Extreme diameters of two specimens 4-6 centiins. and 3*5 centims. ;
 extreme heights of the same 2'2 centims. and 1*9 centiin.                 They were
procured together      in  lat. 34°   13'  S.,  long.   151° 38' E., in 410   fathoms.
 Both specimens had evidently         been dead a long time.
                            CeratotroeJius   discoides,  sp.n.
   This species resembles C. diadema, but is evidently specifically distinct.
The corallum is of the same shallow saucer-shape.                  The septa are less  .
exsert than in C. diadema, and there are only four cycles of septa, the
fourth cycle being imperfect.          The secondary and tertiary septa are not
fused to one another.         The columella is little developed, and made up
only of the fusion of the swollen inner ends of the septa ; it is ex
 cavated in its centre.       A scar of attachment is present, and similar to
that in C. diadema.        The cost.D are serrate.        The diameter of the coral
lum is  2-1  centims.      The   specimen     is  evidently adult.   Only one speci
men has been obtained, from 075 fathoms, lat. 8° 37' S., long. 34° 2S'             W.,
off Pernambuco.
                             CeratotroeJius nobilis, sp. n.
   This  species  differs from the three preceding in being deep and cup-
 shaped,  the  base   being rounded, conical in form, and not flattened.             A
 scar of attachment is present.           The costa) are beset with 6hort teeth.
The septa are exsert with rounded summits.                 There is no trace of pali.
 Only one specimen has been obtained, 114 miles from Fayal, Azores, in
 1000 fathoms.
           Note on tJie four Species of Ceratotrochus        above described.
   The four    species   of corals above described are evidently very closely
related to one another.         In all the septa are remarkably exsert, in C.
platypus extraordinarily       so.   All show traces of original attachment, and
are subpedicellate.       In all but C. platypus the costa) are armed with
short spines or teeth.         In its general form C. platypus recalls Trocho-
eyatJius coronatus, and it is remarkable that it shows a tendency to

                      Corals dredged by   H.M.S. ' Challenger.'           555
develop pali.         The corals have been   placed provisionally in the genus
Ceratotrochus.  New genera will           possibly have to be formed for C.
platypus and C. diadema.
                            Flabellum alabastrum, sp. n.
    The corallum is of a beautiful light pink colour, and is very thin and
fragile.         It
               is wedge-shaped, with an attenuated pedicle. The lateral
cost® are sharp, with slightly prominent irregular edges ; they make
an angle with one another of from 120° to 140°.         The external surface
of the corallum is covered with a glistening epitheca.      The primary and
secondary costae of the faces are almost as well marked as the lateral
costae, and appear as irregularly dentate ridges, separated by slight de
pressions.    The calicle is compressed from side to side in its centre.
Its upper margin is curved, describing about one third of a circle, and is
deeply indented, the primary and secondary costae being prolonged iuto
 prominent pointed processes. There are six systems of septa disposed
 in five cycle3.   The primary and secondary septa are, approximately,
 equal ; the tertiary, quaternary, and quinary successively narrower.
 The quaternary septa join the tertiary at a short distance before reaching
  the columella.   The septa of the fifth cycle are incomplete.   Three per
 fect specimens obtained had about the same dimensions.           Extreme
 height of the calicle 5 centims., longest diameter 6-5 centims., shortest
 diameter 3 centims.    The complicated, sharply-toothed margin of the
 calicle    forms   the most striking feature about this Flabellum.         Its
 extreme     fragility is remarkable in so large a species.      It appears to
 belong to the division of the genus Flabella subpedicellata of MM.
 Edwards and Haime, and to the subdivision of these characterized by
 having the costao prominent and ridge-like on the faces, as well as on
 the lateral margins.      These corals, however, have the fifth cycle of septa
 complete.      Two of the specimens obtained were alive, and expanded
 themselves when placed in sea-water, notwithstanding the depth from
 which they came.        The inner margin of the disk around the elongate
 mouth presents a regular series of dentations corresponding with the
 septa, and is of a dark madder colour ; the remainder of the disk is of a
 pale pink.     The tentacles take origin directly from the septa ; they are
 of an elongate conical form ; those of the primary and secondary septa
 are equal in size and placed nearest the mouth and at an equal distance
  from      together with the tertiary tentacles, which are somewhat shorter,
           it,
  but are placed in the same row with them.        The tentacles of the fourth
  and fifth cycles are successively smaller, and placed at successively
  longer distances from the mouth.       Placed on either side of each tentacle
  of  the fifth cycle, and again    somewhat    nearer to the margin of the
  calicle, are a pair of very small tentacles which have no septa developed
  in correspondence with them.       The number of tentacles       thus ninety-
                                                                  is
  six. The tentacles are light red in colour.        Between their bases are

556                    Mr. H. N. Moseley        on the true
stripes of yellowish red and pale grey.        This coral was dredged twice in
the neighbourhood of the Azores from 1000 fathoms ; five specimens,
three living and two dead, w ere obtained.
                             FlaheUum apertum,    sp. n.
   The corallum is much compressed at the baso, where it forms a short
pedicle, which is attached in one specimen to a minute rolled particle of
basalt. Above the pedicle the walls of the corallum curve outwards, so
as to form a widely open, almost cup-shaped calicle.             The summits of
the   calicle at  the termination    of the  long  axis  are  a little lower than
those at the termination of the short axis.             The' wall of the calicle
presents twelve prominent           costal ridges separated by intervening
rounded excavations.        The primary ridges are more marked than the
secondary, and tho lateral costs slightly more prominent than the others,
and continued      almost to the apex of the pedicle.         The surface of the
wall and costal ridges is smooth, and covered with a glistening epitheca.
The margin of the calicle is deeply and irregularly dentate, with sharply
angular prominences corresponding to the primary and secondary costs.
The septal arrangement is remarkable for its simplicity and symmetry
as occurring     in a Flabellum.      There are four cycles of septa in six
systems,    and  these  are  present in every specimen obtained without any
irregularity, the systems being all of the same breadth. The columella
is little developed, and composed of scanty outgrowths from the inner
ends of the septa.
    Extreme height of tho largest specimen 2 centims. ; longer axis of the
calicle 3-4 centims., shorter axis 2-3 centims.
    The mean proportion of the axes of the series is about 100 to 137.
This Flabellum has a wide range, having been obtained by us off the
 coast of Portugal, and also off Prince-Edward Island in the South Indian
 Ocean, in 000 and 310 fathoms respectively.
                            Flabellum angulare, sp. n.
    The corallum is tluii and fragile and of a pearly white, covered
 externally with a glistening pellicular epitheca.           The calicle is vase-
 shaped, widely open, the diverging walls making with one another an
 angle of about 110°.      A short cylindrical pedicle is present. The mouth
 of the calicle is even and pentagonal in outline ; from each angle of
 the pentagon a stout costal ridge, very slightly dentate, runs down to
 the pedicle.     Between these costs the wall of the calicle presents five
 faces, almost flat, but with slightly marked secondary costs. The septa
 are in five systems and four cycles ; they consist of extremely fragile
 lamins covered with granules on their faces. The septa are complete,
 except the quaternary, which reach to a very short distance only from
 the calicular margin.      The columella is well developed and trabecular,
 formed of outgrowths          of the inner ends of the septa; it is deeply

placed in the calicle, the free vertical margins of the primary nnd
secondary septa extending above it for a considerable height.
   Extreme breadth of the calicle 2-45 centims., extreme height 1-1
centim.
    The coral was obtained in lat. 42° 10' N., long. 63° 39' W., from
1250 fathoms off the coast of Nova Scotia.             The single specimen as yet
obtained is evidently abnormal in its arrangement in fives.                       This
arrangement in fives is perfect. There are exactly 40 septa 10 primary
                                                                         —
and secondary in dimensions, 10 tertiary, and 20 quaternary.
                                Cyatliolielia axillaris.
    A  single specimen of this species, broken but quite fresh, was obtained
from 825 fathoms, in lat. 0°45' 8., long. 120° 50' E.               This very peculiar
form wTas    hitherto     known    only   from  Japan.      It  is quite a new genus
amongst deep-sea corals.
                                Cryptohelia pudica (?).
    Of Cryptohelia Piercii, Pourtales only obtained very small and badly
developed specimens.          A large series of specimens of this genus has
been    dredged by us.       They show great variation ; and, some being evi
dently identical     with   C. Piercii (Pourt.), others seem to show that this
species is merely a dwarfed form of Cryptohelia pudica of Milne-Edwards
and Haime,       from which our best-developed specimens are apparently
indistinguishable.        Further, as has already been pointed out by Pour-
tales, the genus        Endohelia of Milne-Edwards and Haime * appears
indistinguishable from the genus Cryptohelia.             We dredged specimens of
an undoubted Cryptohelia, apparently of the same species as our other
 deep-sea specimens, off Japan in 775 fathoms, in the living condition.
The genus Cryptohelia appears to be a characteristic deep-sea one, with a
 remarkably wide range, as with most other deep-sea forms.                   We have
obtained it in the neighbourhood of the Canary Islands and off the
 Danish West Indies in the Atlantic, whilst Pourtales obtained it from
off Bahia, off Bahia Honda, and off Sombrero, D. W. I.                    We further
 obtained it near the Kermadec Islands              in  the   South-west Pacific and
 off the coast of Japan.        M.-Edwards's original specimen was from New
 Guinea, and therefore probably not from deep water.                    The coral was,

  558                     Mr. H. N. Moseley         on the true
                 Stephanophyllia   complicata and S. formosissima.
     Two species of corals, procured from 126 fathoms in the neighbour
  hood of the Ke Islands, have been referred to the genus Stephanophyllia.
  Both species are discoid, and have their wall extremely perforate ; in
  fact composed merely of finely trabecular tissue.            Two genera of discoid
  corals, Micrabacia and StepJianojriiyllia, are given by M.-Edwards and
  Haime*, which present this peculiarity of having their wall covered with
  minute   perforations, so as to be sieve-like in appearance.              The genus
  Micrabacia is placed amongst the imperforate corals ; whilst Stepha
  nophyllia is considered one of the Eupsammida).                The differences be
 tween the two genera seem difficult to define. Both are remarkable for
 having the cost® corresponding in position to the interspaces between
 the septa, and not to the septa themselves.               The present species are
 placed in the genus Steplianophyllia, because in one species all the septa,
 excepting    the primary, fuse together before reaching the columella;
 whilst in the second species a peculiar extreme fusion and contortion of
 the septa takes place with the advancing age of the coral, which renders
 it very like Stephanophyllia Jlorealis figured by Quenstedt t. The alter
 nation of the costa) with the septa, the presence of five cycles of septa,
 and perforation of the base here occurring are characters common to
 both genera, Micrabacia and Stephanophyllia.                The two species here
 described are placed provisionally in the genus Stephanophyllia ; a new
 genus may have to be formed for them.              They seem to have little or no
 affinity to the Eupsaminidae.
                         Stephanophyllia    complicata, sp. n.
    The corallum is circular, free, and without trace of adherence ; it has
the form of a biconvex lens, the base being very slightly curved, and the
upper surface greatly so.        The under surface, or wall, is perforated by
rows of oblong holes arranged in regular series along the interspaces be
tween the costae.       The costa) are fine ridges covered with small swellings
and granules, which radiate out with great regularity from the centre of
the basal disk ; they commence in the centre from six very short roots
of origin, which immediately bifurcate, thus becoming twelve. The bi
furcation of each of the costal ridges proceeds at successive distances
from the centre, until at the margin of the adult coral there are 06
costas present, 16 in each system.          The costa) at the margin of the calicle
are slightly grooved, showing a tendency to divide again.               The perfora
tions between the costa) form           about 22 concentrically arranged rows.
The coral is very convex       above   the septal meshwork, rising in an even
curve which culminates at the columella.              There is scarcely any central
fossa.    There are six systems of septa and five cycles. The primary
septa are thin straight lamella) with untoothed margins, which proceed

directly from the periphery to the base of the columella.          At about half
their length from the periphery to the centre of the calicle is a notch
followed by a sudden rise, which forms thus a distinct palus, from the
summit of which the line of the inferior margin of the septum slopes
sharply down to the base of the columella.        The secondary septa are also
straight thin laminae ; they can be traced in the adult coral no further
than for about one third the distance from the periphery to the columella,
since they are here covered by the tertiary septa, which, bending over
the secondary septa at this point, bring together their upper margins, and,
fusing with one another, form stout laminae, which run in a radial direc
tion to join the columella, and are the stoutest and most conspicuous

 septa in the coral.      From their point of junction with the secondary
 septa, the tertiary septa curve outwards towards the primary septa on
 either side in each system ; and each of them being joined on its side
 next the primary septa by a curved quaternary septum, curved lines of
 septal matter are formed which are fused by short, transverse, synapti-
 cular laminae to the primary septa, at points very near the centres of the
     vol. xxiv.                                                      2 s

5G0                  Mr. H. N. Moseley        on the true
lengths of each of these. Thus is brought about the peculiar arrange
ment which forms the most striking feature presented by the adult coral,
and which consists in the present* around the elongate columella of sLv
symmetrically   arranged oval hollow spaces, each of which is enclosed
by a loop-like lamina, cut it were, of hard tissue, and bisected longitu
dinally by the inner end of tlie palus of the corresjwnding primary septtim
(see accompanying diagram, p. 559).
   In their further course, the tertiary septa are bent from side to side in a
most remarkable manner, and fusing at successive distances outwards with
the shorter quaternary and still shorter quinary septa, which are likewise
extremely undulate in their course, a series of chambers is formed, which
chambers are closed at their peripheral ends by processes of synapticular
matter.   The chambers are arranged symmetrically in each system on
either side of the secondary septum, and successively decrease in size
and increase in number      from   the    centre outwards.     The    chambers
opening all over the coral give it a most remarkable         honeycombed    ap
pearance.
   The columella is an elongate, thin, vertical lamina stretched in line
with an opposite pair of primary septa. At its base it is provided with
rootlets, which join the primary and fused tertiary septa.
   In a young specimen of this coral, without reference to which the true
nature of the complicated structures in the adult could hardly have been
determined, the corallum is almost symmetrically biconvex and perfectly
circular ; but the columella is elongate, as in the adult. The columella
is papillar rather than laminar, and represents the rooted base of the
adult columella.    There are sixty perfect cost® present at the margin
of the calicle, and the commencement of two more in each system         e. (i.
twelve in all). There are twelve concentric rows of perforations in the
base. The septa are not nearly so much contorted as in the adult, and the
synapticular junctions between them not being as yet formed, the division
of the septal cavities into successive chambers    not apparent as in the
                                                   is
adult.   No superficial fusion of the primary with the curved extensions
of the tertiary and quaternary septa has as yet taken place hence no
                                                                  ;
six-rayed star or flower appears in the centre.         Stout transverse
granular projections are present on the upper margins of the septa, the
Sources of future synapticular   connexions.   Only four cycles are com
plete in each system.    Two members of the fifth cycle are present in
each system, and are those nearest theprimary septa on each side. An
additional   pair of quinary septa  just commencing to grow in each
                                     is
system, and branching off from the peripheral ends of the quaternary
septa which are next the secondary, but on that side of them which               is
nearest the primary, t. e. opposite to the secondary.     A very short
branch of the costa belonging to the interspace between the quaternary
and secondary septa passes into each interspace formed between these
newly grown quinary septa and the quaternary adjoining.

 treme height from the summit of the columella to the centre of the hase
 7 millims. ; of the young specimen— extreme diameter 6 millims., height
 3-5 millims.       Three adult dead specimens and one living young one were
 obtained.
     In   the development of a flower-like series of oval chambers around the
 elongate columella, this coral most strikingly resembles Stephanophyllia
                                                         " White Jura"
florealis of Quenstedt, which is a fossil of the                          (= Oxford
 Clay) formation.           The oval chambers here in the first series around
 the columella are twelve in number, and alternate with twelve in the
 second series.        In  S. eomplicata, six alternate   with six.  In S.florealis
 there appears       to  be no trace of the bisection of these chambers       by the
 straight primary and secondary septa as in S. eomplicata ; but the fossil
  specimens are, according to Quenstedt, always so much mutilated that
  their structure can only partially be made out.              Possibly the twelve
  chambers     of S.florealis may represent the twelve of S. eomplicata, formed
  by the bisection of the six inner by the primary septa, which might
  appear as figured in S.florealis in much-worn specimens.              Comparison
  with actual specimens will determine this point.             In S.florealis forty-
  eight    septa only are distinguishable ; but it is highly probable that
  structures so slight as the quinary septa of S. eomplicata might be
  indistinguishable in a mutilated fossil. The coral appears to fall into
  that    division of the Stephanophyllias distinguished by Milne-Edwards
  as having the secondary septa smaller than the tertiary, and in which
  the tertiary septa fuse together in front of the secondary, which do not
  reach the centre.        The coral, in fact, resembles S. suecica, a fossil from
  Ignaberga, Sweden ; but in this coral the columella is rudimentary.             On
  the other hand, Quenstedt's S. florealis has been supposed by Milne-
   Edwards to be Turbinolid, and allied to the genus Thecocyathus.
                           Steplianophyllia formosissima, sp. n.
       The corallum is discoid, with the base flat in the centre and slightly
   curved towards the margin.         It is white and very light and fragile, much
   more so than in S. eomplicata, being composed of a fine trabecular net
   work, through which the light penetrates freely, as through a fine sieve,
   when the coral is held up to the light.         The base is composed of a series
   of fine, radiating, costal rods connected by transverse trabecule, which
   have a general concentric disposition.         The septa are composed, like the
   remainder of the corallum, of fused trabecules; but these are stouter than
    those composing the base, and more perfectly fused, so as to form, in
    most regions, continuous plates pierced by rounded perforations.           There
    are six systems     of septa and five cycles. The upper margins of the septa
    rise  in a curve   from points distant a short space from the margin of the
    calicle, and, ascending to some height above the level of the base, sink
    down again internally to the wide, oval fossa occupied by the columella.
                                                                      2 s 2

The primary and secondary septa are straight.     Their upper margins lie
at a lower level than those  of the remaining septa, and are only very
slightly toothed. The primary septa are free from adherence.          The
margins of the tertiary, quaternary, and quinary septa are deeply dentate,
the teeth being curved towards the columella.    The quinary, quaternary ,-
and tertiary septa fuse with one another laterally and by their upper
margins at successive distances from the periphery of the coralluin,
forming six deltoid masses of septa. The tertiary septa, forming the
sides of these deltoid masses, are bent over, sloping away from the pri
mary septa, so that at the apex of the delta the upper margins of these
tertiary septa fuse and cover over the inner ends of the secondary septa.
There is no separation   of the septal interspaces into chambers, as in S.
Jlorealis, by development of synapticulac ; but the quaternary and quinary
 septa are more or less bent over above, so as to fuse along part of their
upper margins, and roof in the spaces between them.     The septa cor
respond to the interspaces between the costse. The columella is a large,
oval, spongy mass composed of fine trabecule.
   Measurements        of   the largest   specimens   :   extreme diameter 3*9 centims.    ;
extreme height        l'l   centim.       Other specimens measure in diameter about
2*5 centims. and 2 centims.
   This coral was obtained near the Ke Islands together with S. compli-
eata, and also  found living with Euplectella aspergillum at Cebu, Philip
pines, in 95 fathoms.    Several living specimens have been preserved in
spirit for future examination of the soft parts.  In the living animal the
disk is of a madder- red colour, much darker                  towards   the margin of the
calicle. The tentacles are simple and conical ; the inner are white with
dark madder tips, and the outer of a light madder colour with vivid
emerald-green radial stripes on either side of their bases.  The margin
of the mouth is white.   The corallum is conspicuously white, the fleshy
coloured parts of the coral not extending to the very edge of the calicle.
A white     zone thus sets off the dark-coloured             central parts of the coral.
                                Fungia symmetrica,         Pourt.
  This     species    of Pourtales's      has been proved by our dredgings to be one
of the most constantly    recurring deep-sea animals with a world-wide
distribution. As will be seen by reference to the list of localities, it has
been dredged by us 15 times. It occurs in the North and South Atlantic,
near the ice-barrier in the S. Indian Ocean, off the West Indies, in the
North and South Pacific Oceans, and amongst the Moluccas.          It has a
more extended range in depth than almost any other animal, having been
obtained by us iu 30 fathoms off Bermuda, and at all intermediate depths
down to 2900 fathoms.     Specimens from 2900 fathoms were obtained
with the soft parts preserved, and specimens from 2300 fathoms, of which
30 or more were obtained at one haul, were full of ripe ova. Fungia
symmetrica      is,

from a greater depth than 1600 fathoms.               This coral occurs, moreover,
on all kinds of bottoms — on Globigerina-mud in the Atlantic; amongst
growing branched corals (Madracis asperula) off Bermuda ; on a siliceous
bottom, composed almost entirely of diatom-skeletons,                  in the South
Indian Ocean ; and on red clay with manganese nodules in the N. Pacific.
It further sustains a range of temperature of 1° C. to 20° C. The
specimens from great depths are much larger than those from shallow
water, and are very delicate and fragile.            Pourtales's largest specimen
measured 1 centim. in diameter. We have obtained specimens measuring
3 centims.    in diameter    ; and the specimens from the deep Northern Pacific
average 2 centims. in diameter.          The specimens from the diatomaceous-
mud bottom        were, though large, evidently growing under unfavourable
conditions    as   regards the formation of a corallum, the bottom containing
only a trace of lime ; hence their coralla were so fragile that they broke
at the slightest touch.           From an examination of the long series of
specimens      of  this  coral  obtained   by us, there seems no doubt of their
belonging     to one   species  ; and certain series obtained near Bermuda and
the   West Indies are undoubtedly identical with F. symmetrica as figured
and described by Pourtales.           The larger specimens, however, seem to
 show close affinities with the Loplwserince.         Pourtales speaks of the near
 resemblance of F. symmetrica to Cycloseris hexagonalis.

 They are    instructive as showing how shore forms may be washed down
 into deep    water.

                                   Madracis asperula.
    This coral was originally described from Madeira.            Pourtales describes
 it from west     of Portugal in 36 fathoms, and from St. Nicholas Channel
 in Bahia de Cadiz in 120 fathoms.           The coral occurs in great quantities
 on a shoal off Bermuda, known as the South-west Bank, in 30 fathoms.
 Masses     of it  came   up in the dredge, and a number of specimens' on
 fishing-lines.     The   coral  was also dredged on the shores of St. Vincent,
 Cape-Verd Islands, and at Fernando de Noronha.
                           Flabellum   variabile of Semper.
     In dredging in the Arafnra Sea numerous specimens of this species
 (which, according to Semper, includes F. Stokesii, F. Owenii, F. acvle-
 atum, and F. spinostim of M.-Edwards) were obtained. The series shows
 all stages    of the multiplication of this coral by fission as described
 by   Semper *.      Occurring with F. variabile were found Ehodopsammia

socvdis      and    R. parallela, which were obtained with F. variabiU by
Semper in his dredgings at the Philippines.                       The coral-fauna of the
Philippines of moderate depths                seems thus to extend       southwards    to the
Araf ura Sea ; and this is borne out by the fact that in deeper water
Stephanophyllia fonnosissima was obtained near the Ke Islands and also
off Cebu, Philippines.
                                     Hcliastraa     cavernosa.
     Off Barra Grande, Brazil, two huge masses of this species were
brought up by the trawl from 30 fathoms.                      The masses, which were of
the usual convex form, measured nearly two feet in the diameter of the
 flat base.        The corals were living.             They were bored by Lithodomi,
 which, however, were dead.                This is the only certain evidence obtained
 during our expedition of the existence of massive reef-forming species at
 so great a depth as 30 fathoms.                Madracis asperula mentioned above is
 hardly a reef-forming             species  ;  but at the south-west        bank, Bermuda,
 it is in such quantities           that it must contribute         to reef-formation    to a
 considerable extent.

   Besides Fungia symmetrica, the genera Caryophyllia, Flabellum, and
Cryptohelia are remarkable, but in a less degree, for their wide bathy-
metrical range.
   Only about 27 genera of corals have as yet been proved to exist in a
depth of 250 fathoms and upwards.           A list of these genera is here given
(p. 565), compiled from the reports of Count Pourtales and Prof. Martin
Duncan, and from my own notes. The various depths at which the genera
have been obtained are shown in columns.            The letter  A  represents that
the coral was obtained by the U. 8. Coast Survey at the stated depth,             B
that it was dredged by H.M.S. 'Porcupine,' C by H.M.S. ' Challenger.'
In  the last column S. denotes that the genus occurs in Secondary forma
tions, T. in Tertiary beds.
                            Geographical    Distribution.
   The extraordinarily wide distribution of Fungia symmetrica           has already
been referred to.       Cryptohelia pudica occurs off the Canary Islands, off
the West Indies, off fiahia, in the South-west Pacific, and off the coast
of Japan. Flabellum apertum occurs off the coast of Portugal and off
the Marion Islands in the South-Indian Ocean.               In this respect deep-
sea corals agree with almost all other deep-sea animals — the same forms
of starfish, sponges, Crustacea, &c. having turned up in the dredge over
and over again in all parts of the world from deep wTater with tedious
reiteration.      Some deep-sea corals, however, appear, as far as our
present knowledge goes, to be remarkably limited in distribution, and
some groups to be specially developed       in particular places.     It is remark
able that Pourtales     does not record the occurrence of a single       Flabellum
amongst the corals obtained by the IT. S. Survey.              No Flabellum was
                                                       '
obtained in the corresponding region by the Challenger.'                One appa
rently abnormal specimen, here described            as   Flabellum   angulare, was
obtained not far from Halifax, Nova Scotia, but none in the West-Indian
region.     Various species of Flabellum have been dredged by the ' Chal
         '
lenger in deep water in all parts of the world, and two species were
 obtained by the
                      '
                        Porcupine.'     It is further singular that only one
 Stylasteracean    was  obtained,  and   at only one dredging, by the ' Porcu
pine.'     Pourtales describes seven genera of this group and eleven species
 obtained from deep water, most of them from 270 fathoms, off Cuba,
where this group seems to be especially developed.               We have dredged
 specimens    of  the  group  at  least  eight  times.    A  considerable   number,
however, of the species of deep-sea corals dredged by us have been
obtained very seldom indeed and in few specimens, in several cases only
one specimen having been obtained.             Thus of Trochocyathus coronatus
Pourtales received only one mutilated specimen from off the coast of
Florida, whilst we dredged five specimens on one occasion only off St.
Thomas.        Of Ceratotrochus diadema two specimens only have been
dredged at two localities in the Atlantic.         Ceratotrochus platypus, C. dis-

                                                           '
                      Corals dredged by         H.M.S.       Challenger.'                    567
aides, and C. nobilis have been dredged but once, two specimens of the
first of the three having been obtained, and only a single one of each of
the others.         Ceratotrochus platypus was obtained off the coast of New
South Wales         ; the other three species of Ceratotrochus in the Atlantic.
These Ceratotrochi appear not to occur in the Pacific, nor in the seas of
the   East-Indian archipelago and Philippines. In the deep waters about
the   Philippines and near the Ke Islands their place seems to be taken by
the Stephanophyllias            and Platytrochus      rubescens   and Deltocyathus mag
nificat.
           Families and Genera of Corals, occurring in the Deep Sea.
    The following is a list of the genera of corals as yet obtained from the
deep sea from depths of 50 fathoms and upwards, compiled from Count
 Pourtales's and Professor Martin Duncan's works, and from the prelimi
 nary determinations          of our own series made by myself, which will, how
 ever,  I expect,      need    some modifications       hereafter, but not such as very
 materially to alter the results.

                     following Pourtales, we placed with the Turbiuolidas

twenty genera of Turbinolidse.        The family next most abundant in
genera      that
            is   of the StylasteridiB, which has six genera in the list.
1'urther, twenty-six of the genera in the list are those of simple corals,
and only sixteen genera of compound forms.         The excess of the genera
of the Turbinolidw      what might be expected, since this

which contains most extratropical shallower-water        forms, and which
may   thus be supposed  to be best  suited to low temperatures  at consider
able depths.   "With regard to the genera and species procured by the

    Of the forty-two genera on the list just given twenty occur in                             the

known from earlier deposits than the chalk. The remaining genera of the
list are known only from Tertiary formations.    Of these twenty genera,
however, thirteen were known before deep-sea dredging commenced, to
occur both in the recent and fossil condition, and hence they must occur
in not very deep water, whilst some of them, as Caryophyllia and Fla
bellum, occur in very moderate depths.     Seven of the fossil genera, viz.
Trochocyathus       *,    Thecoryathus, Deltocyathus, Platytrochus, Ceratotrochus,

         made during the earlier part of the Voyage of H.M.S.

        Naturalist to the Expedition.                 (Published by permission of

        Read March 16.
     On our way from England to Lisbon we had continually very bad
 weather, and could hardly do any thing but put books and instruments
 into their proper places.            In Lisbon we paid frequent visits to the
 Museum, the fauna            of Setubal (near the capital) being particularly
interesting, as it is one of the few places in which deep-sea animals
go up into shallower water and are accessible to fishermen.                   Professor
Barboza       showed      us  the Hyalonema which had been got there, and
pointed especially         to the sharks and Chimaerida which have been dis
covered near Lisbon.            On our way to Gibraltar we had        some dredgings,
but were in the latter place more busy at getting up the catalogue of
books and instruments, which since that time has been printed by order
of the Admiralty.            We also visited nearly daily the Gibraltar market,
without, however, finding any thing that was particularly interesting.
     Only when we left this port we got into proper working order ; and               I
began to examine more especially the worms which were brought up, a
class to which      I   had paid much attention before joining this expedition,
more especially the Annelids and Gephyreans.                  I made sketches of the
former, and was, however, very much astonished to find that they all
agreed very much with the genera of shallower                   water — a fact which
has since been corroborated by Professor Ehlers's               interesting paper on
    * Future comparison of     specimens may, however, show a relation between some of
the varieties  of the species here called F. symmetrica and some Lophoserinte.

                                                         '
as by our own experience during our stay in the Challenger.'               Though
I  afterwards did not examine them with so much care as at the beginning,
I nevertheless have continued during the whole time to collect thein as
well as possible, and to examine those which wanted to be drawn when
alive or which seemed to be particularly interesting.        To the latter forms I
shall  refer in the course of  this report.
    Of the Gephyreans I have worked out immediately all those forms which
were not quite common Sipunculids, and shall give a short account of
them below.
   The other classes of worms (Balantxjlossus, Nemerteans, Poh/gorditis,
Nematodes, &c.) have been met with rarely in deep water, but have all
the more been taken care of.
   Having caught, on our way from Gibraltar to Madeira, a large female
of Cystisoma Xeptunus, and been able to work out the then perfectly
unknown structure of both sexes of this interesting Amphipod, my atten
tion was drawn towards the Crustacea, all the more so as the dredgings
from deep water brought up forms which proved to be of the highest
interest and peculiar to those depths.       These  I have, as far as they were
anatomically interesting,   worked    out   during  our  cruises in the Atlantic
and the Antarctic, when                      I
                            I found that had laid a good foundation to
our knowledge of     the deep-sea Crustacea, and that after that new forms
or new and peculiar genera (as far as their anatomy or zoological position
goes) rarely turned up. These researches, as far as the Atlantic Crustacea
are concerned, have been presented in a paper to the Linnean Society
(Linn. Trans. 2nd ser. Zool. vol. i. pp. 23-59, pis. 6-13).
   The surface Crustacea had of course during that time also attracted
my attention, and had been always collected ; but only in the Antarctic
and in the Pacific, when    I  had more time to bestow upon them, I began
systematically to work out the development or the anatomy of all those
forms which seemed to me especially interesting.
   Many drawings and notes have of course also been made on other sur
face animals, especially Pteropods, mollusks, &c. ; and they have, as far
as   I was able to determine them, been put down in the " surface-book
                                                                                 "
on the days when they were found.
    This surface-book, as well as the    " station-book," have   been  during the
whole time under my charge, as       I also had to bottle and label the Inver
tebrates which were brought into the laboratory.
    Whenever we were in harbour, and the place was little- or unknown,
I had to collect the Invertebrata,   especially land-shells, insects, Crustacea,
and worms, in which excursions       I took of course as many of the Reptilia
or other Vertebrates as could be procured.        Shooting birds has been done
by me in some places, especially in the South-Sea Islands, but never regu
larly, and more for recreation than for collecting systematically.

more interesting animals which were got in the dredgings,         so far as they
fall   under the above-mentioned categories, then say something on the
surface-animals, and finally on the result of my excursions on shore.
                                 The Atlantic.
    Here and there on the coasts of the Atlantic deep-sea animals have
been found either washed on shore or floating dead on the surface of the
sea. Certain Crustacea and fish on the coasts of Madeira and the Medi
terranean, Umbellularia and Cirroteuthis in the high north, were animals
 considered very rare, and about the habitat of which nothing certain was
 known. Much of this uncertainty has been cleared up by the three suc
 cessive English dredging-expeditions ; and I shall give at the end of this
 report a short statement regarding those animals known before deep-sea
 dredging began systematically.      There is in the Atlantic only one place
 in which Hyalonema had been of late years regularly found, and this was
 considered to be a place, like Japan, where alone this sponge genus might
 be procured.      Since that time matters have greatly changed, especially
 as far as the distribution of the glassrope sponges goes ; for now we
 know that genera like Hyalonema, Euplectella, Aphrocallistes, Farrea, &c.
 are the most characteristic inhabitants of the great depths all over the
 world, and with them ordinary siliceous sponges, some of which rival the
 Hyalospongise in beauty.
     Umbellularia was found three times in the Atlantic after the Swedes
  had rediscovered this genus, which nearly a century ago had been found
  by a whaler on the coasts of Greenland.      Professor Kblliker has already
  worked out this species, which he considers to be different from the
  northern one. Alcyondria and Antipathes have also been constantly
  brought up, and the latter is especially characteristic of great depths.
     We owe to American expeditions a good deal of what was known
  about the bathymetrical distribution of corals and of Echinoderms ; but
                                           '             '
  especially the latter have during this Challenger        expedition yielded a
  very large variety of species, the greater part of which is very likely new
  and has partly been described already by Professor Wyville Thomson.
  I have been greatly interested in Crinoids for the sake of their parasites
  (Myzostomum), most of which were, however, got only in the Pacific;
  and  I shall say a few words about their very extraordinary mode of living
  when giving an account of the worms found in that ocean.
     The Platodes are a group which has been rarely met with ; here and
  there of course Cestodes or Trematodes in young or old stages might be
  found inhabiting the invertebrates and afterwards the fish ; but nothing
  has come to my knowledge about them, as the latter were far too precious
  to be dissected for helminthological purposes.     Nemerteans do go down
  to great depths ; but they were rarely got here, only once off the coast of
  Brazil, in 1200 fathoms ; and the worst is that when you do get them
  they are generally in pieces, either by friction among stones and mud or

572           Dr. R. von Willemoes-Suhm on Observations
by breaking themselves up into small pieces like certain Synaptre.             Of
Rhabdorcela and Dendroccela I never saw a trace ; but they are still more
liable to be spoiled or overlooked than the former.
    There are,   I think, a few free Nematodes ; but certainly they are very
scarce.   Of great interest is, however, a case of parasitism, which may be
 compared to the attacks which on shore the young Gordii make on our
grasshoppers.       1 found once in a shrimp from a great depth a worm
coiled up  in  its carapax, and afterwards the same thing when on our way
 to New Zealand ; and we made sure that the worm which was contained
in the second shrimp was a young Gordiaeean.             During our Antarctic
cruise we have also got two free-living Nematodes, which we suspect very
 much to be the mature animal ; anyhow it is quite certain that shrimps
in great depths are liable to be attacked by considerably large Gordiaceous
 worms.
    Of Bryozoa there is    a great variety in nearly all depths where animals
have been found ; but only one of them, being a very striking form and
differing in its features from the hitherto known species, has attracted
our attention and been described by Professor Wyville Thomson under
the name of Narenia ajathiis.      It has been got three times, in 350, 1525,
and 1950 fathoms, near the coasts of Portugal, as well as off those of
Brazil. In the dredgings near the latter coast the fauna of Bryozoa was
especially rich.
    Gephyreans were got now and then, especially in cases where a great
deal of mud had been brought up.         Whether their first order, the chseti-
ferous ones, are represented in our collections of the Atlantic (we consi
der, of course, Sternaspis to be an annelid) is uncertain, as       I find men
tioned on our list only a fragment, which might be ascribed to Echiurus,
from 39 fathoms, and a very large worm, perhaps allied to Bonellia, with
which it shares the presence of only one genital pore,       but which has lost
the anterior portion of its body.      The consequence is    that we are unable
to find out whether hooks have been present or not ;         anyhow this speci
men, which has a length of 76 millims., and which            came up off Nova
Scotia from 1340 fathoms, is a very interesting one.
    The unarmed Gephyreans were more commonly got. Of the genus
Priapuhis we had a specimen from 2750 fathoms on our way from Ber
mudas to the Azores ; and Ch<r.toderma (Loven's curious little worm with
calcareous spines in its skin) was found twice in depths of 390 and 1250
fathoms.    I was    rather astonished never to find Halienjptus, as       I had
expected that this genus, which inhabits the Baltic and the high north,
would be very common in deep water.
   A curious intermediate form between Priapulids and Sipunculids came
up from 1945 fathoms off the island of Ferro.         This worm has no ten
tacles and no proboscis like the former, but has at the same time the
anus in the anterior part of its body (Sipunculids).       Its pharynx is very
short, and is attached to the body by four retractores.        Its inside shows

                                                                 '
           made during the Voyage            of H. M.S.              Challenger.'                573
six to seven folds, and is covered with papillae, which towards the mouth
change into chitinous protuberances.     In each of these one finds some
unicellular glands, granulated   cells showing a nucleus and a nucleolus.
Unfortunately the posterior portion of its body had been destroyed before
we got it.
  The commonest Gephyrean genus is undoubtedly Sipunculns, in shallow
water as well as in deep water ; we got it here three times, in depths
from 350 to 2500 fathoms.
    We have   been   particularly looking out for Phoronis, but have never
been able to find    it,
                       and feel now nearly sure that    does not inhabit, as
                                                                     it
a  rule, the great depths. Sternaspis, however, has been got in 1700
fathoms of water, and besides this annelid another form (600 fathoms off
Gomera), which has an intestine coiled up like that of a Gephyrean, and
only three pairs of setigerous feet in the posterior portion of its body.
It in many ways peculiar but am unable as yet to determine its
    is                             ;     I
systematical position from want of books of reference.
   Among the tube-building annelids the Clymenidae, Terebellidse, and
Serpulidee are characteristic inhabitants of great depths, and go, like that
Myriochele, sp., which      have figured
                            I               Nature,' 1873), to

which for various reasons       we had expected to find       in rather deep water.
Of free-living annelids, however, there        large amount, Aphroditidae,
                                                   is   a

the families chiefly represented.     found that sometimes genera which
                                       I

Ehlers.
   Having described shortly before       joined this expedition
                                         I                           northern        a
form of Balanoglossus {B. Kupferi, from the Oeresund near Copenhagen,

this peculiar worm which came up near the west coast of Africa from
2500 fathoms.    Unlike its northern cousins, this species has very bright
colours, its head being yellow, its collar bright red, and its body yellowish
red.   The head alone has     width of 18 and
                               a                  height of 11 millims. In

now mention that in most tropical places in the Pacific           found this I
genus to be an inhabitant of the shallow water, as constantly found the

larva known under the name of Tornaria, and sometimes such stages of
its development which have been shown by Meeznikoff and A. Agassiz to
belong to Balanoglosms.
   Parasitical Cirripedia are by no means rare on the shallow-water
shrimps, and are found as well among those coming from great depths.
We have noticed      a   Peltogaster here and there, but feel sure that                   a   careful
examination of the Macrurous Decapods will show many more cases.
  Both groups of the Cirripedia Thoracica are well known in fossil slate         a                  :

and it is not uninteresting to find that Balantu, a crustacean which was
eminently developed in the Tertiary formation, is now nearly entirely
confined to shallower water, but that the Lepadid Scalpellum. which ii
mostly found in the Cretaceous formation, is now-a-days widely spread
in the greater depths.       Indeed it has    been  the only Cirriped   which we
have often met in depths from 925 to 2850 fathoms, and was got in the
Atlantic six times, one of them having been described by Professor Wytilie
Thomson     under the name of Scalpellum regmm (' Nature,' 1873).
    Of  free-living Copepods there are none on our list, nor do           I think
that any are living below the range of the so-called surface-animals;          bat
their parasitical relations are found as well on the deep-sea fishes         at on
those from shallower       water — as, for example, on a Lophioid allied to
 Ceratitu, which came up from a depth of 2400 fathoms, and is sure, from
the mode of living peculiar to that group of fish, to have come from            the
 bottom.
    There are no Ostraeoda to be mentioned here ; and of A mphipoda i which.
 however, are by no means wanting in deep water) only one specimen of
 Eusirus cuspidatus has been put down by me ; but perhaps some more
 might be found among the siftings.
     Very peculiar are the deep-sea Isopods    ; for besides the ordinary Arctn-
 rus-form which we got from 450 fathoms, there is a very peculiar family
 of which Pars has described five genera from the Norwegian coast, all of
 which are blind.      The body is divided into two portions ; the anterior one,
 consisting of a head with four segments of the pereion, is short, and the
 posterior,   consisting of the three remaining pereion-segments, rather
 long.    The first pair of legs is short and prehensile ; but the three follow
 ing pairs have an extraordinary length, and are very thin and slender,
 and the last three pairs are terminated by paddle-shaped joints and act
 as natatory organs.      Very peculiar is also their abdomen, which consists
 of only one segment, on the end of which we find two small serigerous
 papillte.   Of these Munopsidae, the legs of which break unfortunately
 very easily, we got a large and very soft species from 2175 fathoms on
 our passage from Bermudas to the Azores, and another spiny specie*
 not far from there from 1675 fathoms.
     When dredging off the coast of Brazil near Pernambuco we fell in for
 the first time with an Isopod, which, from a superficial resemblance with
 the fossil Trilobites, has enjoyed for some time a certain notoriety : I mean
 Seroli», the flat crustacean which has long been known as inhabiting the
  southern coast of America.        "We never found it again in the tropics,
  neither in deep nor in shallower water, but shall have to mention it fre
  quently among the Crustacea of the Antarctic.
     A blind Tanais was brought up from 1400 fathoms.
     C'vma, which, according to Claus, has its nearest relations among the
  Isopods, is not common in deep water, and was found only once in 1000
 fathoms near San Miguel, Azores.

     Stomatopoda     are entirely confined to the shallower water of the tropical
and temperate regions. "We never met with one far away from the land,
though their young stages are widely spread all over the surface of warmer
seas.
     The most interesting Crustacea which have been got are undoubtedly
the Schizopods, several new genera of which were brought up, which aro
both interesting for anatomical and physiological reasons. These have
been partly figured in 'Nature' (Gnathophausia, 'Nature,' 1873), and
afterwards fully described by me in a paper " On some Atlantic Crus
 tacea," which has been or will be published by the Linnean Society. Here
 only a few words about them.
     The normal Schizopods, as is well known,        have their carapax fixed to
 the pereion, with the exception of the aberrant genus Nebalia, in which
 the latter is unattached, and resembles a shell enclosing the anterior por
 tion of the body. Our deep-sea genera, however, have (at least most of
 them) a carapax which is neither the one nor the other, but resembles
 very much the shield-like carapax of the Phyllopod genus Aput.                 In
 other respects they are, however, nearly allied to the established families,
 though some of them have characters which are peculiar to several of the
 shallow-water forms, but have as yet not been found united in one genus.
  Moreover some of these abyssal Crustacea are blind, or show peculiar
  modifications of the organs of sight, as well as of the chitinous outer parts,
  which have lost the optical apparatus.
     Petalophthdlmus inermis is the name which        I  have given to the most
  remarkable of these Schizopods, as in it the optical apparatus of the eye
  is entirely wanting, while its ehiHnous parts have remained        in the shape
  of a concave plate-like organ supported by a peduncle.         This plate shows
  neither a trace of    the organs  of vision nor any appendages ; it consists of
  a double chitinous layer, and nothing is to be seen in it but the fluid of
  the body and the attachment       of the muscles, which are to be found in all
  stalked-eyed Crustacea.       Its appendages show this form to belong to the
  family Mysidae, there being six legs (second gnathopod and the five pereio-
  pods), no branchiae, large breeding-lamella; in the female, and only rudi
  mentary pleopods in the male. The carapax, as we have said above, leaves
  in both   sexes five segments entirely uncovered.
      But besides the looseness of the carapax there are peculiarities in the
  male of this Schizopod which have been found nowhere else ; for its first
  antennae,   the palpus mandibularis, the maxilliped, and the first gnathopod
  have been converted into enormous prehensile organs, and the latter shows
   a large lamellar    appendage like the maxilliped in the female.         These
   elongated appendages have in the male six times the length which they
   have in the female.
      This is the only Mysid which was got from great depths (1900 and
   2500 fathoms).      The next family, the Euphausiidas, was represented by a
   very large species, red and opaque, which came up in tho South Atlantic
      vot,. xxiv.                                                   2 T

 576           Dr. R. von Willemoes-Suhm           on Observations
 from a depth of 1900 fathoms.          It is in bo far remarkable as it was in
 the Atlantic the only Schizopod in which the carapax is attached to the
 posterior segments of the pereion.
    The most characteristic Schizopods in great depths belong to the Lopho-
gastridto, from which they differ, however (like Petalophthalmus from the
shallow-water Mysidae), by the looseness of the shield, and by a pair of
lateral eyes, which hitherto were only known among the Euphausiidae.
These lateral eyes, however, in Gnathophamia never exceed two in
number, and are invariably fixed on the outer margin of the second
maxilla.     The carapax here is bent backwards, and thus leaves a place
open, which enables these sense-organs to perform their duty.
    In all other respects these Schizopods are true Lophogastrids, some
of them, however, exceeding very much in size the small shallow-water
species {L. typicus) which Sars has described from the Norwegian coast.
There are three species : — 1. Gnathophamia gigas, length 142 millims.,
found only once in the Atlantic from a depth of 2200 fathoms near the
Azores.     It is not impossible that this is the animal which Dohrn has
got in a very badly preserved state from the coast of Africa (without any
appendages, and evidently somewhat crushed), and described under the
name of Lophogaster ingens. He does not, however, mention the eyes
on the second maxilla, and says that the carapax was fastened to the
pereion ; and for this reason       I have to wait until  I can myself compare
the specimen in the Hamburg Museum with those caught by us. This
would of course in no way affect the validity of the characters upon which
the genus Gnathophautia has been established, but induce one to put the
specific name of Gn. ingens, Dohrn, instead of Gn. gigas, mihi. 2. Gn. zoea,
a smaller form, length 60-80 millims. This species is the commonest Schi
zopod, as we got it five times from 1000-2550 fathoms.              Many males
and females have been caught, and its anatomy has been thoroughly
worked out.      3. ¦Gn. gracilis, a still smaller spiny species, of which only
one specimen was got from 1500 fathoms, not far from the rocks of St.
Paul.
    A third  genus in which the carapax is not attached is ChaUtraspis, which
has got very long walking-legs       with large claws to them (Ch. unguifer),
and is most nearly allied to the Lophogastridce, though it may perhaps
be necessary to establish for it a new family.        Its organs of vision offer
nothing particular.      I  must refer about further details to my above-
mentioned paper, and can here only state that it was got four times, in
depths of 350, 675, 1850, and 1900 fathoms, in the Middle and Southern
Atlantic.
    Decapoda Macrura were very common : nearly every haul brought up
Peneids and Caridids, sometimes of large size and having often a very
peculiar look ; but    I  do not think that any thing very interesting, ex
cept a series of new forms with a more or less spiny carapax and longer
or shorter legs than usual, will be found among them.

    In   a very successful       dredging in 450 fathoms off St. Thomas we got
an Astacid, which          I   have described and figured under the name of A.
zaleucus, as    it is totally without               eyesof eye-stalks, and
                                                            or even     a trace
is distinguished by an enormous development of the right claw.         The
animal has never been got since, but may perhaps, when a female shall
have been found, form the type of a new genus.        In the mean time                                        I
have called it Astacus, as it seemed to be nearer to the crayfish than to
Nephrops, to which it would be convenient in so far to put          as this                    it,
genus contains only   salt-water forms.  This       question which  is
                                                                    ahas to

are so nearly   allied to the fossil Eryonidae (from the Solenhofener
Schiefer), that     becomes doubtful whether

Mason, these Crustacea have already been described by Heller under the
name of Polycheles, from    specimen which was got in the Mediterranean
                                     a
near the coasts of Sicily, this will of course be the name to be adopted.
I am unable for the present to compare Heller's figure with our speci
mens, and shall have to reconsider the question when working out the
Crustacea of this expedition. There are some points in Heller's descrip
tion which still make me doubtful about    and in order not to confuse

     "We got once a Lupea and a Gecarcinus on the coast of Brazil from a
depth of 350 fathoms ; but these can scarcely be considered deep-sea
animals.    It  is,however, remarkable to find that Gecarcinus, a genus
which lives in holes on shore, should ever go for breeding-purposes    to
such   a considerable depth as that, unless we here have   species before
                                                                     a

known among the Telphusidte    nor the Gecarcinid®, but which, of course,
isnot altogether out of question.
  Naturalists who have dredged much in shallow water are accustomed
to consider Nymphon as       form which lives above the bottom, climbing
                              a
up into the Ftuus and never burrowing into the mud like Pycnogonum,
also to find the latter in greater depths than the former at least these
                                                                     ;
were my experiences on the northern coast.    But in the deep sea just
the reverse    the case Pycnogonum
               is         ;             either very rare or altogether
                                                 is
wanting there, while Nymphon and the allied genera Zetes &c. are pretty
common, and evidently walking gravely with their long legs over the
muddy bottom.     In the Atlantic we got Nymphon from 1250 and Zetts
from 350 and 1075 fathoms, none of them being particularly remarkable,
either for size or any thing else.   Some of the females had the well-
known larval forms,  which         by
                              Claparede and others have been sufficiently
described.
   Brachiopoda were on the whole scarce. We had once      very large     a
 Waldhemia with exceedingly small animal, which was got ou our way
from Gibraltar to Madeira from 390 fathoms, and several times some
small Brachiopoda     from 850 to 1000 fathoms, the genus of which was
not determined.
   Also Ascidians were        by
                            no means common.       Though the true genus
Ascidia (transparent Tunicata without     stalk, taken in the wider sense)
                                                a
does occur in great depths,   Ido not remember its having been found in
the Atlantic, where only    very fine species of Boltenia was found near

   The Lamellibranchiata and Gastropoda have been duly collected and

which      goes to considerable   depths.    This one, however, was brought up
only    later.
    Everybody who for some time has been in the habit of visiting the
fish-markets of the Mediterranean knows how great a rarity the " gre
nadier-fish " (Lepidoleprus or Macrurus) is considered to be by the fisher
men of      those shores, and how little was known as to where those curious
Scopelids Sternoptyx, Chauliodus, and others might live. The latter are
washed on shore from time to time, and are sure to          come   into the hands
of   naturalists,   as the fishermen     know their value.   In the Italian fish-
markets they were all the more eagerly looked                after, as Professor
Leuckart       had described in them a sort of sense-organs running along
both sides of the body, which he considered, with some doubt, to be
 organs of sight. But the supply was scanty, and very few zoologists who
 paid a visit to these places were able to get them.
    Now     these riddles are solved  ; for we know that Macrurus is one of the
 commonest inhabitants       of the depths, and that with them the Sterno-
 ptychidae very generally come up. Like other deep-sea animals and those
 specimens which from time to time were washed on the shores of Italy
 and Madeira, we have also found them occasionally floating about on
 the surface of the sea; and one species, a small, elongate, blackish fish,
 at least seems to belong to the pelagic fauna ; but the majority, especially
 Sternoptyx and Chauliodus, are so rarely got on the surface, and so con
 stantly brought up from greater depths, that           I  must regard them as
 inhabitants of that zone.
    One of the Scopelids which came up from great depths (1600 and
 1900 fathoms) in the Atlantic is very peculiar for its blindness and its
 flattened head, on the top of which there is a peculiar sense-organ of a
 silvery colour, 10 millims. long and 9 millims. wide.           I examined this
 organ at that time with a lens, and it seemed to me to consist of three
 layers : — 1, a very thin transparent epidermis ; 2, a layer of hexagonal
 small columns resembling in miniature the lateral electrical organs of a
  Torpedo ; and 3, a silvery tapetum.        Without giving any opinion about
                                           I
 the nature of these peculiar organs, should like to point out the analogy
 which seems to me to exist between them and those organs which Leydig
 has figured from the scales of certain Eeptilia in Max Schultze's 'Archiv,'
  1873.
    This fish was afterwards also got in the Pacific.
    Of   the other inhabitants   of the depths (the Ophidiids, Lophioids, &c.)
  I have little to say,   especially as, after our leaving the Atlantic, these
 fish were preserved in the upper-deck laboratory, where        I have only  seen
 but never studied them.
                             Surface of the Atlantic.
    Only   a  few of the Atlantic surface-animals    have been worked out by

tions of the Pacific.       I do not think     it advisable to fill up this report
with general remarks on         a fauna which is so well     known    as the surface
of the Atlantic.
                            The Islands of   the  Atlantic.
    On our first visit to the Madeira fish-market we got a number of Mora
mediterranea specimens, a fish which we had got a few days before in
deep water. We also secured a fine Bery.v, which, being one of the oldest
genera of Acanthopterygians,         is especially remarkable.
    In St. Thomas we spent a few days after a four weeks' cruise, but did
little in the way of collecting, except catching some fish in the trammel
and some dredging.         The Professor secured in this place a great number
 of Echinoderms.
    Numerous excursions were made in Bermudas, partly inland, when                   I
 tried to catch as many insects as possible on the beach, where the
 shallow-water animals were secured by wading.              Hungary Bay was my
 chief place of resort. Here the forest approaches the beach, and afforded
 opportunities     for collecting of all kinds.       There mangrove-trees were
 growing in large swamps, crowded with a Grapsus which ascended these
 trees ; and under the stones which covered the muddy ground                 I found
 plenty   of  land-crabs   belonging    to different   genera  of  the   Telphusida?.
 When looking for these         I  discovered a land-Nemertean, being the first
 one found in the western hemisphere (the only animal of this kind having
 been found by Semper in the Philippines).              This species was described
 and figured in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' for
  1874 (xiii. p. 409), under the name Tetrastemma agricola.
     In Bermudas we also made frequent excursions in the steam-launch,
 which enabled me to get specimens of a Nebalia which                 I  had noticed
 before among      Crustacea   collected  by Mr.   Murray.    This   species (N. lon-
 gipes), which    I   have worked out and described in the ' Transactions of
 the Linnean Society,' is remarkable in many ways, as its legs are far less
  " phyllopodal " than in the other species known before, and, as in the
  male of this American Nebalia, it is the first and not the second antenna
  (N. Oeoffroyi) which has been enlarged and transformed into a prehensile
  organ.
     In the Azores we had only a few days, and in Madeira there was no
  landing on account of the small-pox being there. Our next collecting-
  places were the Cape-Verd Islands, first St. Vincent and then St. Iago.
                                                I
     In the barren, island of St. Vincent made a trip into the mountains,
  and was very much struck by the utter barrenness of the place. Cathartes
 percnopterus, crows, and a few small birds were the only living beings
  we saw flying about.       Under stones we got some geckos (Platydactylm)
  and a Lycosa, and near a water-pool a few dragonflies were seen.              These
  were, with    the  exception of a few beetles, the only animals which could
  be found, though we looked about a good deal.

    In   the mean time  Mr. Moseley had found out that there were certain
  spots in the valleys where the tamarisks grew higher than in other places
  and in clusters, forming a small oasis in this desert place, and that these
  are the places round which the insects assemble in considerable numbers.
  Here a MyrmeleonAaxva, eagerly watches the ants, large colonies of which
 are to be found.              Its imago was also found, folding its wings, when
 settling, like a Perla, and when flying very much resembling an Agrion,
 a genus which was not found in these places.           Some Ichneumonids
 (especially  a large black species with yellow antenna)) and many Diptera
 (especially an Osmia) are to be seen ; and of Orthoptera there are small
 and large Acridia and a Qryllus burrowing under the stones. Of Coleo-
 ptera we got perhaps fifteen to twenty species, most of which belong to
 Melasomata, a family which is so characteristic of all the countries sur
 rounding the Mediterranean. On dead corpses of donkeys, goats, &c, which
 the inhabitants   leave on the spot where they die, one might find a Silpha,
 on sunny places fine species of Cicindela, and on the leaves of the tama
 risks Coccinellidffl are not uncommon.    Hemiptera were scarce, only one
 Cimex having been found ; and so were Lepidoptera, both perhaps partly
 because the season was not propitious. Myriapoda were represented by
 a large Scolopendra and a Oeophilus.
    The Araneidae are comparatively very abundant (no Scorpions found),
 a magnificent     large yellow species of Epeira extending its net between
 the branches of the tamarisks, and a yellow crab spider, as well as a
 Salticus, living commonly on the ground.      Under small labiaceous plants
 a very fine green spider, not unlike a Theridium, occurs, numerous spe
 cimens of which will be found in our bottle.      It makes an irregular web
 in the middle of the shrub, and comes out only when you lift the plant
and shake     it,then running away with the utmost speed.
    On the beach two Crustacea are to be found both are rather interest

ing.    One of them        Bemipes, which may be seen half-burrowed in the
                           is  a
sand, only its head sticking out and watching for its prey.      The boys in
the place catch     it    by
                        throwing    piece of meat on the ground immediately
                                        a
after the waves have gone back, when the Bemipes will come out and try
to seize it. The other crustacean, which makes holes on the beach in
the dry sand,       is     ippeus, known from Egypt, Syria, and these
                         Ocypoda
islands.  It one of the species which have the eyes on the sides of the
               is
stalk, which itself surpasses the eye in length, and  terminated by
                                                                  is               a

Pakemon, Pagurus, Eunice, Aplysia, and many shells were easily picked

Dactyloptervs,      and   a     fine specimen of Zygoma malleus, caught by       Mr.
Balfour.
  In    St. Iago I       frequently visited the palm-groves       close to the town,
where
    I      caught many insects and watched the land-crabs (Gecarcinidic),

 582          Dr. R. von Willemoes-Suhm on Observations
which had undermined the whole of the place with large holes.               In the
evening one of them, a Cardisoma, was caught by the seeking party, and
on closer inspection was found to have eggs and young ones just come
out of them under its abdomen.             This was of considerable interest,
because we    knew   that  the  West-Indian     Gecarcinus undergoes no meta
morphosis, but that another species was said to do so by V. Thompson,
who had seen dead Zoi;as in its eggs.        This Zoea, however, had not been
drawn (as far as could be made out), and the whole thing had been
doubted, according to statements given by Fritz Miiller. We were there
fore very much satisfied not only by ascertaining that the young ones also
of this species were Zoeas, but by being able to make an accurate sketch of
those which had already left the egg.         No doubt these would have left
the mother on her nocturnal excursions to the sea, and undergone there
the ordinary metamorphoses.
   On the 28th of August we landed on the rocks of St. Paul, where
nobody is known to have made collections since Darwin's well-known
visit to the place.    On the barren rocks there are hardly any insects to be
found, and nearly    all there is of animal life is more or less dependent on
the bodies or nests of the two birds which cover these rocks, Anous sto-
lidus and Sula fusca. These nests were carefully searched not only in
the island, but also afterwards in the laboratory, where          I had taken a
box full of them in order to secure as many specimens of the insects as
possible.   The following animals were thus procured : — (1) a Chelifer,
several specimens from the nest of Anous stolidus (the best places to find
our European Chelifer are the nests of Hirunda urhiea) ; (2) three spe
cies of spiders ; (3) a tick, very common ; (4) a small dipter ; (5) pups
of Olfersia, the pupiparous     parasitical fly  ; (6) a microlepidopter  ;  (7) a
lepidopterous   larva.
   Darwin   does  not mention the Chelifer in his list, but has, on the other
hand, a   Quedius (beetle) and a wood-louse, which       I  have not been able to
find.
   All  over the island    a large Grapsus    is very common, preying on the
eggs and young ones of the birds.         In pools large black Actinia may be
seen, and many small fish which come and go by high water.                In the
lobstcr-pots we got several small specimens of a Palinurtis.
   On the main island of Fernando Noronha we only took a short walk,
as we then thought, in order to look over the place and see where collect
ing might be most profitably done, but, as it proved afterwards, never to
return. Large quantities of pigeons were seen in the woods, lizards in
quantities everywhere {Euprepes punctatus), and under the stones a small
Gryllus was to be seen by thousands.           Besides these   I  only noticed a
centipede.
   On the second day we paid, with Captain Nares, a visit to Mount St.
Michael, Eat Island, and Platform Island. The rather steep rocks of
the former are the resting- and breeding-places          of Anous stolidus, Sula

fit sea,           aquila, and Phanicurus athereus, great numbers of
             Tachypterus
which may be seen flying about.
  Among the creepers which cover the stony ground       found several   I
green       Cicada1, a Locusta, and very large yellow        spiders,       which     are also
very common on the mainland.
   On the beach I found a large               Nerita and the Grapsus (c.        f.   strigosus)
from the rocks of St. Paul.
     Rat Island. — Among the white Convolvulus we saw and caught some
specimens of a Polyommatus, the only butterfly which was seen, with the
exception of a few small Microlepidoptera. Pigeons are common here.
                   —
  Platform Island. The rocks on the beach are covered with a small
JHytilus ; and among these mussels specimens of a Patella were found.
     In    each island our stay was extremely short.  Every thing, however,
that came in our way was eagerly collected     ; nevertheless the result will
not      give an idea of the Fernando fauna, as no collecting               could be done
on     the mainland.
   loth October, 1873. — Landed on the lower ground of Tristan d'Acunha,
and remained six hours on shore collecting every thing I could find. On
the beach I saw underneath the seaweeds many Diptera, all of one spe
cies, and under the stones Oniscus, lulus, and a Lumbricus.       Besides
these there was a small Scolopendra, but scarcer than the former.   Here
I  also found a small Linuuv in great quantities, which was just laying
eggs (the corresponding species in northern Europe does so in April).
In a pool near the beach, the water of which was brackish, saw a small      I
whitish Oligochset.
   Of land-mollusca            I
                        found a small species resembling in shape our
genus Zonites, and secured a good many specimens of them.
   Several small spiders were gathered among the grasses and under
stones.
   Proceeding then towards the settlement,              I
                                               examined in many places
the dung of cows and sheep, but could find no trace of the Aphodii,
Geotrupes, and other beetles which, with us, are invariably to be found
underneath it. All         I
                     got was a small Staphylinus. Going into the houses,
 and asking for any objects of natural history which might have been col
 lected and kept by the inhabitants,          I
                                       got quantities of a Buccinum found
 on the beach, with Patella, Chiton, and others, also a dried sea-urchin
 and   a   living Procellarut glacialoides.      This bird, which is common on the
 antarctic     coast of South      America,   seems to be unknown to the fisher
 men of Tristan.     Of course we also made inquiries about the butter
 flies, none of which had been seen flying about, asking especially if they
 had not a dried specimen of them in a book or on a pin.       They, how
 ever, had none, said      it was not the proper time of the year for     and         it,
 described    it           —
                   minutely very likely Vanessa  urtka,    species
                                                             a     common  all
 over the    world.
     There are no wild mammals on the island except rats and mice, no

58  i    On Observations during the Voyage of              H.M.S. ' Challenger.1
reptiles, and no amphibia.          Of the three species of land-birds we only
saw the Thrush (Xesocichla eremita, Gould), which seems to be common
and very tame into all the three islands of the group.                The yellow Embe
riza brasiliensis, so common in the other islands, seems to have become
extinct in Tristan Island, or never to have been there ; for the two desti
tute Germans on Inaccessible Island told me that the Tristan people had
tried to introduce the bird into their island, but they did not know whether
they had succeeded.         Oallinula nesiotis is still to be found high up in
the hills. Several specimens of it had been sent to Capetown, and one of
them had been sold last year to a merchant-ship.
    KUh October. — Landed in the morning on the lower ground of Inac
cessible Island, and collected a good deal among the PA^Ziea-shrubberies
on the small hill.      Here we got several Curculiones, an Hemipter, a moth,
and many caterpillars, besides the insects already mentioned from Tristan
Island. The two Germans gave me their popular names for the butter
flies, of which they distinguish two species (a " Fuchs and a " Perlmut-
                                                                    "
            "
terfalter — Vanessa and Argynnis).
    In the pond at the foot of the waterfall we got several specimens of an
Hydrobius.
    The Xesocichla and Emberiza were very common. Of Nesiotis, which
the Germans declared to be a smaller bird than the Tristan one (?), some
pairs had been seen previously on the lower ground,                     but  they were
commoner on the top of the hills.
    17th October. — Collected     some     beetles    and other animals     among the
Phylica trees and on the corpses of dead puffins, as well as in the nests
of the albatrosses. Xesocichla and Emberiza were very common ; no Nesiotis
was seen.

V. "Preliminary Report to Professor Wyville Thomson, F.R.S.,
       Director of the Civilian Scientific Staff, on Crustacea observed
       during the cruise of H.M.S. 'Challenger' in the Southern
       Sea." By the late Dr. Rudolf von Willemoes-Suhm, Natu
       ralist to the Expedition.      (Published by permission of the
       Lords of the Admiralty.) Received February 14, 1876. Read
       March 16.
   In  the following paper it is intended to give a short account of the
Crustacea found at the bottom as well as on the surface of the sea
                                            '
during the antarctic cruise of H.M.S. Challenger.'           Our expedition,
as is probably well-known to most readers, left the Cape on Decem
ber 17, proceeded towards the Prince-Edward Islands, and landed on
one of them.     Between these islands and the Crozets, on which landing
was impossible, we had several successful deep-sea dredgings.       From the
Crozets we sailed to Kerguelen, where we stayed nearly a month, and
where a great deal of shallow-water dredging was done. Proceeding
from this large island to the south, we penetrated beyond* the antarctic
circle, and had four successful deep-sea dredgings near the ice-barrier.  On
our way to Australia we were able to trawl five times.
   The surface animals were generally       collected  by the towing-net at
every station by lowering the net to a depth of 50-100 fathoms, where,
as experience has shown us, nearly the same quantity of animals are found
during the day which at night are to be got from the very surface. In
fine nights, when the ship was gliding very slowly through the water,
the net was of course always put out, and its contents were carefully
preserved ; but during our antarctic cruise such nights were rare, so
that in most cases we had to lower the net in the daytime, during the
manipulations of dredging and sounding.
   In   shallow water  near the shores of the antarctic    islands we found
scarcely any of the higher Crustacea.    Only on the north coast of Marion
Island (Prince-Edward group,      the  northernmost    of the islands which
we visited) a small Caridid shrimp was got in considerable numbers.
Besides there was a Serolis, different from the only species which we had
met with (in 700 fathoms off the coast of Brazil). On the south coast of
Prince-Edward Island there were no Decapods at all in a similar depth,
only Scrolls came up in the dredge.      Near the same place, however, we

 586            Dr. R. von Willemoes-Suhm on Crustacea
 got a successful dredging from 310 fathoms, showing that the conditions,
 whatever they may be, which do not allow the higher Crustacea to live in
 shallow water near the antarctic islands (a fact which will be shown to be
 also the case near Kergueleu and Heard Islands), do not apply to greater
 depths ; for now we found plenty of higher Crustacea, fine Caridid decapods,
 Galatheas, and large spiny brachyurous crabs, allied to Pisa and Maia, of
 the finest red colour.      This was the only time we got near the islands a
 dredge in such an intermediate depth as 310 fathoms.
    Halfway between Prince-Edward Islands and the Crozets we had two
trawlings in greater depths, both successful and very important, as they
showed clearly that also in these southern regions of the Indian Ocean
 several of the animals are to be found which inhabit the deep sea of the
Atlantic.     Euplectella, Hyalonema, Umbellularia, Brisinga, Pourtalesia, as
 well as Macrurus and JIalosaurus were all well-known forms to us, and
 in most cases,   I  should think, the same species which we have found all
over the Atlantic.      The Crustacea were represented by several Sealpella,
 which were attached to Bryozoa by the same bluish Serolis which we got
the first time on the coast of Brazil in 700 fathoms.             An Arcturus was
rather common, and so was an Isopod, which is very characteristic for
the antarctic deep sea, but which nearly always comes up completely
spoiled, as it loses all its antenna; and legs, evidently breaking like glass.
We    succeeded    only once in getting a specimen, 24 millims. long, in
which the second antenna) and the legs were preserved ; and this one
 shows that it has a very long flagellum of the second antenna and the
third and fourth pereiopods elongated and exceedingly thin. Its sub
sequent pereiopods are foliaceous swimmerettes, and its abdomen con
sists only of one segment.          All this, besides its blindness, shows that it
is a member of the family Munopsid®, established by Sars, who has de
scribed several genera.        Besides this larger species we found a smaller
one in the antarctic deep sea which probably belongs to the same genus,
but is rarer and equally very liable to lose all its appendages.           Another
Munopsid, which, however, may belong to a different genus, was found
formerly by us in deep water (2175 fathoms) in the Atlantic, between
Bermudas and the Azores, in lat. 38° 3', long. 39° 13' W.                     It is
very large, 40 millims. long, and perfectly transparent and soft, so
that it collapses as soon as taken out of the water.           Its first antenna is
of moderate size, the second is broken. The first pereiopod is a prehensile
organ ; the three subsequent ones are broken.              The last three feet are
terminated by exceedingly large foliaceous joints, and the abdomen con
sists of one single segment.         The large posterior pereiopods make this
strange   animal   look  still  stranger ; but it is in every respect a normal
member of the family Munopsida).               I shall describe all these species
when    I  come  home, and        shall be   able to compare them with Sars's
drawings.
   The deep-sea dredging between Prince-Edward Islands and the Crozets

            observed during the Cruise        of H.M.S.                           587
brought us also an immense ostracod, gigantic if compared to those
forms which are known to us as common inhabitants of the fresh and
salt water.       Its soft sculptured shell    has  a length   of 25 millims. and    a
height of 1G millims. The small cover formed by two excisions of the
shell before the head has by itself the considerable length of 3 millims.
I   think this is the largest of all Ostracods known, only equalled in size by
a    Silurian form       found in the island of Gothland, and described as
 Cytherina      baltica.    According to Quenstedt there seems to have been
some doubt whether this is really an Ostracod, as it is ten times larger
than any living form hitherto known. This deep-sea form shows that
there is no reason for that ; but unfortunately it does not allow me to
 decide to what family it belongs, for nothing is left of the animal inside
the shell but the head with the eyes, the two antennas, and what               I  con
 sider to   be  a  palpus   mandibularis.    The   shell is rather  soft and flexible,
 divided by five lines, originating from a central point in its anterior part,
 into as many fields, the largest of which on the posterior and inferior
 side is sculptured.         The eyes are very large, pedunculated, and con
 sequently movable.          So far the description of the animal does not
 prevent     its  being    put into the family Cypridinidas ; but the antennas
 seem to me very different from those known in that group ; for here
 the funiculus antennas prima) has got four joints, the last of which has
 on the upperside an accessory prolongation, which resembles somewhat
 the scale on the lower antenna of higher Decapoda, but seems not to be
 in articulation with the funiculus. The flagellum seems to consist of
 twelve joints with a tuft of hair at the top. But about this number             I am
  not quite sure, as      I could not count them in a satisfactory way without
  spoiling   the  precious unicum.      The lower antenna has, as far as      I  could
  make out, only a single flagellum (whereas the Cypridinida) have got two),
  consisting probably of nine joints.           The palpus mandibular, finally, re
  sembles in its shape very much the one which is found among the Decapods,
  consisting of two joints, the last of which is covered with hairs on its
 inner side.
     Probably this new and gigantic Ostracod belongs to one of the esta
  blished families, a fact which,     I  hope, will be elucidated by further dis
  coveries on our future cruise in the southern hemisphere.
     This is not the only example, however, of gigantic forms in the deep sea,
  for the same trawlings brought up two specimens (from 1375 and 1G00
  fathoms) of a Gammarid Amphipod the larger of which has a length
   of 60 millims. and a height of 35 millims.                Though we now know
  that certain Hyperids (Cystisoma Neptunus, both sexes of which we found
  in the Atlantic, and described in the Phil. Trans. 1873 ; see also
  Trans. Linn. Soc. 1875, 2nd ed. Zool. i. p. 24) attain the considerable
  length of more than 4 inches, these transparent                     and elongated
  animals do not make such an impression as the Gammarids, which are
  besides in no way peculiar, being perfectly normal, and approaching

588              Dr. R. vou Willemocs-Suhm on Crustacea
perhaps most the genus Typhimedia.                 I shall therefore give later a
more accurate description of them, and here only direct attention to the
fact that in the deep sea, as well as in the sedimentary strata, animals are
found which, compared with their relations living now-a-days and in shallow
 water, are of a very  considerable  size ; and  I may perhaps    best in this place
 add that in this dredging       of 1375 fathoms      a lymphoid (Pycnogonid)
 was got measuring nearly two feet across the leys.
    The Sehizopods appear to gain most by the deep-sea investigations ; for
 strange forms have been discovered by us as in the Atlantic, and strange
forms continue to come up as we go on with the researches in the other
oceans. The Chalaraspis unguifer, which constitutes a new family (as
has   been  shown in my paper on the Atlantic Crustacea) allied to the
Lophogastridse, and characterized by the presence of all the pereiopods,
 the looseness of its dorsal shield, the absence of accessory eyes, &c.,
is one of the characteristic     members also of the antarctic deep-sea fauna.
It was got in these dredgings, as well as in those on our way from the
Antarctic to Australia, when another new genus of this family came up, of
which   I shall   speak afterwards.      In these trawlings near the Crozets we
got another     Schizopod,  a  new  species of my genus Petalophthalmu*, first
found in the tropical deep sea of the Atlantic.             It is a form differing
from the Mysidoe by      the  looseness   of its dorsal shield,  by large plate-like
duplicatures of the chitinous substance in the place where we are accus
tomed to find the eyes, and by the presence of breeding-lamellse at the
base of all the pereiopods.       I must refer for the details to my previous
paper, where     I have discussed its zoological position and its nearest rela
tions,  and may here only repeat that the male of the Atlantic species
P. armvjer, v. W. S., differe'd very much from the female and showed
characters hitherto never found in a Schizopod.            Its first antenna, palpi
mandibulares, maxillipeds, and first gnathopods are transformed into very
powerful prehensile organs. In this species, which is much larger than
the Atlantic one (length of the female 62, of the male 55 millims.), nothing
of the kind exists. The male is only a little smaller than the female, has
of course no breeding-lamella), and is only distinguished by the presence
of two small recurved tubes, situated behind the last pair of pereiopods,
and having evidently the function of copulative organs.                 Besides the
pleopods are larger than in the female, and have, as is the case in many
Mysids, got two rami.        I  shall call this species Petalsphthalmus inermis,
as the chief difference from P. armiger consists in the resemblance of the
male to the female and in its size.        The parts of the mouth as well as the
other appendages are very much alike in both species. Drawings of
most of them have been made, and will be published on a later occasion.
As we got many specimens of this larger species,          I examined    the curious
petaliform organ which morphologically represents the eye, and found
that it consists of nothing but a double chitinous layer, which contains a
small quantity of muscular tissue.

                                                              '
              observed during the Cruise      of H.M.S.         Challenger.'         589
     The same petaliform organs, but on much shorter stalks and of
different size, are met with in another animal which came up in these
dredgings, and which belongs to the proper Mysids, as its carapax is not
loose, as in Petalophthalmus, but adheres to the segments of the pereion,
as in ordinary shallow-water Mysids.              It has a length of 35 millims.,
and, being a male, is distinguished by two, small, tube-like copulative
organs at the base of the last pair of pereiopods. A form of the same genus
was afterwards found in shallower water near Kerguelen, the females of
which had got young ones in their pouches, showing that they undergo
 the same metamorphosis           as Mysis does.          They are in consequence
closely allied to this genus, and have nothing to do with Petalophthalmus,
 though the eyes have undergone the same retrogressive metamorphosis as
in this genus.
     In these   dredgings we caught several of the higher Decapods, Galatheas,
 several specimens of Pagurus, and Caridid as well as Peneid shrimps.
 One     of the Caridids     was important to us, as it was the same             species
 which we had formerly got in quantities               in  deep water     off the coast
  of Brazil between Pernambuco and Bahia.                  It   has a very solid and
  spiny carapax and large eyes.         From a morphological point of view all
 these crabs and shrimps have, however, scarcely any interest.
     When cruising near the Crozets we dredged in a depth of 210 fathoms,
  where     only a Scrolls was got, and again in 550 fathoms, where no
  Crustacea came up at all.
     In Kerguelen Island, where we stayed nearly            a month, much      shallow-
  water    dredging took place in the different harbours, most of which was
  done by     Prof. "Wyville Thomson himself, while        I was on shore     collecting
  the land     animals of the place. There is no Qammarus with terrestrial
  habits nor any Oniscas to be found in these barren islands, animals
  which still exist on the Tristan d'Acunha Islands.             In the pools on shore,
  however, a small brachyurous crab was found, which was never got by the
  dredge not even in the shallowest water.           Also in the pools it is by no
  means common, so that         I  only got three specimens. One of these, a
  female, had empty eggshells attached to its pleopoda ; and             I think that a
   Bmall Zoea, the only larva of higher Crustacea which           I was able to get on
  the surface, belongs to this species;          for  all  the   dredgings down to a
  hundred fathoms near Kerguelen Land never yielded any of the Decapod
   Crustacta except the small    Mysid which has been already mentioned.
      The shallow-water fauna        near Kerguelen may be divided into two
   zones  —  the one going from a few fathoms down to forty, and charac
   terized   by small silicisponges, a Spatangus, Cribrella, and especially by
   Herolis ; and the second from 40-120 fathoms, inhabited by large silici
   sponges (Jiossella antarctica, Carter), a large red     Euryal, Comatula, another
   Serolis, by Cuma, Tanais, and Anceus.        These two zones of course are not
    strictly separate, as many  of  their inhabitants   go from one into the other ;
    but  I do not think, for example, that Spatangus will be found to be any

                                           think that Rosalia will              be
found at all in a depth of 25 fathoms.
  The Crustacea inhabiting the shallower water are several species              of
Serolis, Spharoma, Arcturus, some Gammarids, several species of CaprtUa.
one of which has a very slender and long manus, and some Pycnogooxk
There is scarcely any thing interesting to be found in that zone. la
the second zone of deeper water (though not deep-sea fauna, which
we scarcely ever have found in less than 500 fathoms) we had a richer
harvest; Tanais and Praniza, very curious amphipods, Mysids and Xebaii*
are the inhabitants, about which  Ishall now say a few words.
   A Tanais  having a length of about 17 millims. is very common, md
though not deviating by any means from the typical species of the genus,
it has a peculiarity connected with its propagation ; for the females, in
stead of having breeding-lamellae, as the other species of the genus hare,
carry their eggs, like Copepods, in small cutaneous sacs attached to the
genital opening at the base of the fifth pair of pereiopods.    These sacs
extend as the development goes on, and attain a diameter of 3-4 millims.
Professor Wyville Thomson having discovered among the eehinoderms of
Kerguelen Land many forms which do not undergo any metamorphosis, bof
develop in pouches of their parents, this peculiarity in Tanais deserves
to be noted, not exactly as comparable to those facts, but as an anomaly
in the group to which the animal belongs.
  Less common than this Tanais was an animal which very closelr re
sembles the European Anceus tnaxillaris {Praniza, Leach), of which I jot
several males and ovigerous females.
  A larger species of Serolis, which           is predominant and most
                                                    the
characteristic form of all the Crustacea in the shallow water of the
Antarctic islands, was also to be found in this second zone.    With it an
Amphipod occurred, a Gammarid, distinguished by a bright red fnyntal
prolongation of the head and having no eyes.       These          I

might be discovered in some form or other in the red proboscis ; but mr
expectations were not justified by the results of the dissection.       The
organ is divided by a line along its top into a right and a left portion.
The chitinous layer has got no facettes, and the whole organ is filled bv a
finely granulated red pigment.   What its function may be cannot say,  I
having never met with any thing like it.

   Besides a small Cuma, which was very common, we found in the deeper
zone outside Christmas Harbour the only decapod which was brought

up by    the dredge during the whole time of our stay in Kerguelen, where
dredging has been effected at least in seven different places. This was
a small Mysid with petaliform plates instead of eyes, allied to the
larger   species which was brought up from the deep sea.          It has a length
of    12 millims., and was not rare, as numerous males and females with
young ones in their pouch were found in the mud. The females have
got (as all Mysids have) two pairs of large breeding-lamellse, which form
 a pouch for the reception of the young.
     Possibly this Mysid genus is already described by Sars, who has esta
blished several genera, the descriptions of which are unfortunately not on
 board.
     These are the Crustacea of the shallow water near Kerguelen — all
 belonging to the lower divisions, whose breeding-lamellae form a pouch
 for the reception of the young. The only Decapod among them is (which
is very remarkable) an animal in which the pouch is not wanting ; so
 that it seems that in the shallow water near the Antarctic Islands higher
  Crustacea liave not been able to find  those conditions which are necessary for
 their development.    The Echinoderms which have found the same diffi
 culties have partly overcome them, by being represented here, especially
 by forms which have no metamorphosis, and in which the young ones
 find protection with the mother. The Crustacea (with only one excep
 tion, the Brachyurous crab in the pools) which develop with free-living
 larval stages have not been able to resist influences which seem to be
 especially hostile to the larval stages of these groups.       In the deep sea,
  however, as well as on the surface of the ocean, we find higher and lower
  Crustacea distributed in the same way as they are in other regions of our
  globe.
     Between Kerguelen and Heard Island we dredged in 150 fathoms, but
  got only a Scalpellum, an Arcturus, and a spiny Amphipod, which is the
  corresponding form to the Oammarus loricatus of the north. Near Heard
  Island, in 75 fathoms, we found the same animal and a Sjahatroma, but no
  other crustacean at all.
     Near the ice-barrier in the South we had three deep-sea hauls in 1260,
  1675, and 1975 fathoms, but got only very few Crustacea, a spiny Isopod,
  the Munopsid which has been mentioned before, and a large Serolis (in
  1975 fathoms), which has been figured by Mr. Wild, and which we pro
  pose to call T. Bromleyana, in honour of Mr. Bromley, Lieutenant in
  H.M.S. ' Challenger,' who has been many a time in charge of the deep-
  sea dredgings.   The males of this   species  have a length of 54, the females
  of 46 millims. ; and both sexes are distinguished by a fine blue colour,
  with a red spot extending over the midst of the body and the eyes. The
  lateral segments of the pereion are terminated in long spines, which
  are directed backwards, and attain in the male the length of 59 millims.
  and 43 millims. in the female.
     On our way from the ice-barrier to Melbourne four successful hauls were
   vol. xxrv.                                                        2 u

got in depths of 1950, 1800, 2150, and 2600 fathoms.      In the second of
these hauls we found a rhizocephalous eirriped in the open breeding-pooch
of a very large Hymenaster, which is about to be described by Professor
Wyville Thomson.      Such crustaceans have, however, as          far   as   I can   see,
never been    described from an echinoderm     ;   and   I   am not quite            rare
whether the specimen in question had not been detached from one of the
shrimps which came up at the same time and tumbled into the open pouch
of the Hymbiaster.      Another Cirriped, a Scalpdlum, was caught in the
last dredging (2600 fathoms), showing once more that Cirripeds are
among those Arthropods which may be met with in very great depths. Of
Isopods there were specimens of the described Munopsid, and fragments
of another hitherto unknown member of this tribe.
   The Schizopods yielded again several very interesting forms. Pttato-
phthalmus inermis came up from 1950 fathoms, and from the same place
we got the posterior part of a cast Gnathophausia skin.       This genus, three
species  of  which   have been  described   by  me  from   the   depths of the
Atlantic, is allied to Lophogaster, but distinguished by its carapace being
not attached to the five posterior segments of the pereion, and by acces
sory eyes on the second maxilla.       It is difficult to tell from this frag
ment whether it belongs to one of     the described species : in size it seem*
to me to have been intermediate between G. gigas and G. zoea.               The
 Eupbausiidse are also represented by a very interesting new form, a large
 species of Thysanopoda (from 1800 fathoms), a genus which has hitherto
 not been found in deep water.      It has a length of 50 millLms., and                is,
like the deep-sea Euphausia which     I    have described         in my      preceding
paper, perfectly untransparent.     Iam not able to say how many pairs                 of
accessory eyes  there are in this species, but
                                             I  think that they exist, and
that black spots between the first pleopodsmay turn out to be such organs
of   sense.
     Of Chalaraspis there was  specimen of the species which
                                a                             have men

tioned already (C. wigvifer), and another very remarkable form which                  I
shall call C. alata. In this one the large carapace very thin and soft,
                                                             is
perfectly loose, and covers three of the abdominal segments.      The last
legs are not elongated like in C. vnguifer, but somewhat shorter; the first
of them somewhat enlarged and recurved in its first joints.
  Among the higher Decapods there were two species of Galaikea and
some Peneid and Caridid shrimps, which are not particularly interesting.

ger during the last three years has been drawn up in compliance with
a request on the part of Professor Wyville Thomson, which was com
municated to me on the 23rd June, 1875. As my time at sea is fully
occupied with the daily laboratory work,                 I
                                                    was obliged to postpone
preparation of the report until our arrival at Valparaiso, where the
whole of my time was devoted to it. Three weeks, however, is too short
a time to prepare even a preliminary report with satisfaction, and there
are doubtless many things in the present one for which                    I
                                                                  must crave
indulgence.    In venturing to publish the few geological notes which                         I
have embodied,       I
                    feel that a special apology is required, as my knowledge
of rocks is, at best, but superficial.         I
                                          was emboldened to do so, however,
by considering that the islands to which the notes refer are principally
such as are but seldom visited by any one, and that, as it was my good
fortune to be able to visit them, it was right that             I
                                                           should make what
                 I
observations could and record them, in case amongst them there might
be some which would be of value to the geologist.
                 Observations   on the Specific     Gravity of Sea-water.
  As    the value of these results depends to a great extent on the nature
of the means taken to collect the water, and on the delicacy of the
instrument used for determining its specific gravity,                 I
                                                                   shall shortly
describe them both.
    The samples of water are collected either in an ordinary canvas
bucket, or in one of two kinds of metal "water-bottle," according as it
is to be taken from the surface or from depths below it. The use of the
ordinary hand-bucket needs no explanation.              When water is to be

 of 1875, of which an abstract has been published in the 'Proceedings,'

nected by a straight rod, so that they are simultaneously either open or
shut, or at least at the same phase of being open or shut.       When water
is to be collected by its means, the stopcocks are opened and the instru
ment     sunk to the required       depth,   having been previously securely
fastened to a sounding-line.      The operation of sinking must be carried
on without a check, owing       to  the peculiarity of the closing-apparatus.
When the required depth has been reached, the line is checked, hauled in
a few fathoms, let go again, and finally brought to the surface by means
 of a donkey-engine.     The rod connecting the stopcocks is furnished with
 a metal plate, which, during the descent, is retained in a vertical position
 by the passage of the water on both sides of it.        When, however, the
 direction of motion is reversed, the plate falls down into a horizontal
 position, when, by its passage through the water, it exercises such a
 downward pressure on the rod that the stopcocks are closed. Arrived
 at the surface, it contains the water which it had enclosed at the depth
 in question.    A small safety-valve allows of the escape of the surplus
 water, which, owing to the greater density of the water below the sur
 face, it has enclosed in excess of what it can hold at atmospheric tem
 perature and pressure.      The apertures of the stopcocks being necessarily
 smaller than the diameter of the cylinder, the efficiency of the instrument
 in really changing the water as it descends was tested before leaving
 England in a freshwater lake, the water with which it was filled at the
 surface containing some yellow prussiate of potash.       It was found that
 the water fetched, under these circumstances, from depths over 1|
 fathom was unacted upon by solution of perchloride of iron.         The rate,
 therefore, of change of water      is satisfactory, as we can be certain of
 obtaining an average sample of the last two fathoms passed through
 by the instrument.
     Representing the specific gravity of distilled water at 4° C. by 100,000,
 I   found that of ocean water at 15c,56 C. to vary between the ex
 tremes of 102780 and 102400 ; so that, to be of any value at all, the
 possible error in the results must not exceed 10. The hydrometer used
 for these observations is fully described in the paper above referred to.
  Its description is briefly as follows : —
     The stem, which carries a millimetre-scale 10 centimetres long, has
 an outside diameter of about 3 millimetres, the external volume of the
  divided portion being 0- 8607 cubic centimetre ; the mean volume of the
  body is 16045 cubic centimetres, and the weight of the glass instrument
 is 160-0405 grammes. With this volume and weight it floats in distilled
  water of 16°  C,  at about the lowest division (100) of the scale. In order
  to make it serviceable for heavier waters, a small brass table is made to
 rest on the top of the stem, of such a weight that it depresses the
 instrument in distilled water of 16° C. to about the topmost division (0)
 of the scale. By means of a series of six weights, multiples by 1, 2,
 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the weight of the table, specific gravities between

  1-00000 and 1-03400 can be observed. It is not necessary that these
 weights should be accurate multiples of the weight of the table ; it is
 sufficient if they approach it within a centigramme, and their actual
 weight   be  known with accuracy.          The weights of the table and weights
in actual   use  are : —
               Weight of  table                          0-8360 gramme.
               Weight of weight No.      1               0 8560

 For oceanic waters the hydrometer             is always used with the table and
either No. IV. or No. V. weight.
    When     the   mechanical     part of the construction of the instrument
 was finished, with the exception of the closing of the top of the stem
 (which instead was widened into a funnel-shape large enough to receive
the ordinary decigramme weights), the calibration of the stem was effected
by loading the stem with successive weights, and observing the conse
quent depressions in distilled water of known temperature.               This done,
the top was sealed up and the instrument carefully weighed.                The ex
pansion of the body with temperature was determined in a similar
manner by reading the instrument in distilled water of various tem
peratures.     The coefficient of expansion of the glass was then found
to be 0-000029 per degree Centigrade.
    For using this instrument at sea about 900 cub. centimetres of sea-water
are taken, and the containing cylinder placed on a swinging table in a
position as near the centre of the ship as possible. The observation with
the hydrometer, loaded with the necessary table and weight, is then
effected in the ordinary way, the accuracy of the readings being but little
affected by rolling; pitching, however, is found to have a distinctly
disturbing effect ; and when it is in any way violent, it is advisable to
store the specimen of water till the weather improves.
    The temperature of the water at the time of observation is deter
mined by one of Geissler's " normal

                                                or standard thermometers, gradu
ated into tenths of a degree Centigrade; and it is essential for the
accuracy of the results that the water, during the observation of the
hydrometer, should be sensibly at the same temperature as the atmo
sphere, otherwise the changing temperature of the water makes the
readings of both the hydrometer and the thermometer uncertain.               At low
temperatures (below 10° or 12° C.) a tenth of a degree makes no sensible
difference in the resulting specific gravity ; but at the high temperatures
always found at the surface of tropical seas, rising sometimes to 30° C,
the same difference of temperature may make a difference of 3 to 4 in
the resulting specific gravity.

596                 Mr.  J. Y. Buchanan     on Chemical   Work
     llaving obtained the spocific gravity of the water in question at a
temperature which depands upon that of the air at the time, it is
necessary, in order that the results may be comparable, to reduce them
to their values at one common temperature.           For this purpose a know
ledge of the law of expansion of sea-water with temperature is neces
sary.      This had  been   determined  with sufficient accuracy for low tem
peratures      by Despretz    and others ; but as the temperatures at which
 specific-gravity observations are usually made are comparatively          high,
 their results were of but little use, directed as they were chiefly to the
 determination of the freezing and maximum-density points. When the
 late Captain Maury was developing his theory of oceanic circulation, owing
 to difference of density of the water in its different parts, he found the
 want of information on this important subject. At his request the late
 Professor Hubbard, of the National Observatory, U.S., instituted a series
 of experiments, from which he was enabled to lay down a curve of the
 volumes of sea-water at all temperatures from considerably below the
 freezing-point to much above what obtains even in the hottest seas.
 The results are published in Maury's ' Sailing Directions,' 1858, vol. L
 p. 237, and have evidently been carried out with great care.                The
 composition of different oceanic waters varies, even in extreme cases,
  within such close limits, that the law of thermal expansion is sensibly
  the same for all of them ; of this Hubbard's experiments afford satis
  factory proof. In the Table which gives the results of all his experiments
  he takes the volume of water at 60° F. as his unit. In order to avoid
  much useless calculation,     I have been in the habit of reducing my results
  to the same temperature (150-56 C), while, for a like reason,          I  have
  retained the specific gravity of distilled water at 4° C. as the unit.     The
  choice of a common temperature to which the results should be reduced,
  and of a unit of specific gravities, is a purely conventional matter ; and
  in choosing the above-mentioned ones, in the first instance,     I was moved
  solely by a desire to save calculation.     For every water, however, there
  is one temperature to which it would be natural to reduce its specific
  gravity, namely, the temperature which the water had when in its place
  in the   ocean  ; and in this   sense all my results during the cruise have
  been reduced.       Hubbard's Table of the change of volume of a mass of
  sea-water with change of temperature enables us very easily to reduce
  any observed specific gravity from the temperature of observation to any
  other temperature, say 15°-56 C. In the paper it is transcribed from the
   '
     Sailing Directions.'

    By means of the results given in this Table a chart of isothermals
 was constructed, giving by inspection, as soon as the specific gravity
 at any one temperature is known, its reduced values at any other.                 In
 this way the specific gravity of every water has been reduced to its
 value at 15°-56C. and at the temperature which it possessed when in its
 place   in the  sea.
    The results obtained since leaving TenerifHe on 15th February, 1873,
 are given in a series of Tables, in which those relating to surface-water
 are collected together and grouped in sections, as Teneriffe to St.
 Thomas's, St. Thomas's vid Halifax to Bermuda, and so on.                      Those
 relating to bottom-water are collected in larger groups         — the first contain
 ing all those observed in the Atlantic, the second those in the Southern,
 the third those on the western side of the Pacific Ocean, and the
 fourth those observed between Japan and Valparaiso. Where series of
 observations on waters        from    intermediate  depths    have been obtained,
 each series is given by     itself.    By far the greater number of the obser
vations relate to surface- waterv the specific gravity of which was, as a
rule, taken once a day when at sea, the temperature of the water being
at the same time observed with the standard thermometer above men
tioned.
    With    a single   exception, off the coast of Brazil, the densest water
 which we have met with in the ocean was found on the section from
Teneriffe to St. Thomas's           in the heart of the north-east trade-wind
territory, where, from the strength and dryness of the wind, the amount
of evaporation must be very large. Bound about the Canary Islands
the mean specific gravity was found to be 1*02730 ; to the westward it
rises steadily until in longitude 28° W. it has reached 1-027G2. Between
longitude 28° W. and 54° W. the mean specific gravity is 1-02773, the
maximum being 1-02781.            On approaching the West Indies it rapidly
falls off to an average of 1-02719 in the neighbourhood of St. Thomas's ;
and   if we take into account all the observations made on the western
side of the Atlantic, from St. Thomas's northward to the edge of the cold

598               Mr.   J.  Y. Buchanan    on Chemical      Work
water which separates the Gulf-stream from the coast of America, we
obtain the same average, 1 •02719. Between Bermuda and the Azores an
almost perfectly uniform specific gravity was observed, the mean being
1-02713, and the extremes        1-02694 and 1-02727.         As Madeira is ap
proached    the specific  gravity rises until  it  reaches  1-02746   close to the
island itself. The mean specific gravity on the eastern side of the North
Atlantic, between the latitude of St. Thomas's and that of the Azores, is
1-02727, or slightly higher than that of the water on the western side.
    After leaving the Cape-Yerd Islands, the ship's course lay almost
parallel to the African coast, and at an average distance of about 200
miles from it. Proceeding thus in a south-easterly direction, the specific
gravity fell rapidly from 1-02092 off St. Iago on the 10th August, to
1-02632 on the 12th, after which it retained the low mean specific
gravity of 1-02627 until the 21st August, when the course was changed
to a westerly one along the equator.               The specific gravity of the
water on this day was the lowest hitherto registered for a surface-water ;
it was 1-02601, in lat. 3° 8' N., and on the boundary line between the
equatorial and Guinea currents.           The same low specific gravity was
observed in following the equatorial current as far as St. Paul's rocks,
after which it quickly rose as the Brazilian coast was approached ; and
the maximum of 1-02786 was obtained on the 26th September, when
off the entrance to Bahia, in latitude 13° 4' S.
    The observations in the South Atlantic were limited to a line down
the western side as far as the Abrolhos Bank, and thence across to the
Cape of Good Hope. In the region of the south-east trade-wind, there
 fore, we have only a few observations close to the coast ; and as we have
seen in the North Atlantic, on the voyage from Teneriffe to St. Thomas's,
the specific gravity is higher in mid-ocean than either on the east or
the west side, so in the South Atlantic         it is possible that the  same may
hold good. From the Abrolhos Bank to Tristan d'Acunha the specific
gravity sinks steadily from 1-02785 to 1-02606, and from Tristan to the
Cape of Good Hope, along a course lying between the 35th and the
37th parallels of south latitude, the mean specific gravity was 1-02624.
Between the same parallels of north latitude the mean specific gravity
was 1-02713.
    It must be remembered        that the results obtained can only be held
good   for the  season   of the year in which they were observed, and that
the observations in different latitudes were made in different seasons,
and, further, that all the observations north of the line as far as 20° N.
were obtained on the eastern side, and those to the southward of it
as far as 30° S. were obtained on the western side of the ocean ; so
that it would be unwise to attempt to draw any general conclusions
from such imperfect data.           Considering,     however, our four parallel
 sections, we have at least this positive result — that in the month of
 June and mean latitude 36° N. the Eurface-water in mid-ocean has a

                    done on board    H.M.S. ' Challenger.'                599
mean specific gravity of 1-02713, that in the months of February and
March and mean latitude 22° N. the mean surface specific gravity is
I- 02773, that in the month of August and mean latitude 2° N. it is
1-02624, and that in the month of October in mean latitude 36° 8. it is
1-02621.
    On the way to and from Halifax in the month of May some obser
vations were obtained in the cold water with which the north-eastern
coast of America is surrounded, the mean specific gravity being 1-02463.
On the 1st May in the Gulf-stream the specific gravity of the water
was 1-02675, and its temperature 23°-9 C. ; and the next day it was
1-02538, and the temperature 13°-3 C. If the results be reduced to their
values at the respective temperatures of the different waters, we have for
the specific gravity of the Gulf-stream water 1*02445, and of Labrador-
current water 1-02584 ; so that the fall of temperature very much more
than counterbalances the want of salt in the water. In the same way we
find the mean specific gravity of the water referred to the temperature
which it has in the ocean to be — in latitude 36° N. and month of June
1-02548, in 22° N. and months of February and March 1-02592, in 2°
N. and month of August 1-02335, and in 36° 8. and month of October
102659.
    Leaving Simon's Bay on the 17th December, 1873, the ship proceeded
in the direction of the Marion Islands. Immediately outside the Cape
 the warm water of the Agulhas current was met with, which possessed a
comparatively high specific gravity, averaging on the 18th, 19th, and 20th
December 1-02657 at 15°-56 C, and 1-02477 at the average temperature
 (21°-9 C.) of the water. As we advanced in a southerly direction, the
specific gravity as well as the temperature sank rapidly; and on the 26th,
when off the misty and snow-capped islands of Marion and Prince
Edward, the surface was 5°-3 C. and the       sp. gr. 1-02518.   After leaving
 these islands, and  until on the way  northward   to Australia we had passed
the 50th parallel of south latitude, the specific gravity of the surface
 remained remarkably uniform. Between the Marion Islands and Ker-
guelen's Land the average specific gravity was 1-02512, between Ker-
 guelen's and the edge of the pack-ice it was 1-02506, along the
verge of the pack-ice it was 1-02476, and between the pack-ice
 and the 50th parallel it was 1-02514 ; thence to the Australian coast it
 rose daily, reaching 1-02638 off Cape Otway.          Except when amongst
 loose ice, there was hardly any variation at all in the specific gravity all
 the way between Marion Island and the 50th parallel ; when amongst
 the ice the specific gravity was liable to sudden and considerable fluctua
 tions, going down on the 14th February to 1-02419, and on the 18th to
 1-02418, the ship being on both occasions surrounded by broken pack-ice.
  During the same trip the specific gravity at the temperature of the water
  was also very uniform, the mean being 1-02690.
    Leaving Sydney a loop-like course was made, by way of New Zealand,

   600              Mr.  J. Y.    Buchanan on Chemical Work
  Tongatabu, and the Fiji Islands, back to the Australian coast at its
  northernmost     point, Cape Tork.        The mean specific gravity of the
  western part of the sea between Australia and New Zealand was
  1-02647, and that of the eastern part 1-02622, while in Cook's Strait
  itself it was only 1-02593. Between New Zealand and the Kermadees
  the average specific gravity was 1-02630, and between the Kermadec
  Islands and Tongatabu it was 102651 ; round the Fijis it was 1-02661 ;
  and between the Fijis and Cape York a very uniform specific gravity
  was maintained,     the mean being 1-02643.        We thus see that in the
  western part of the Southern Pacific the specific gravity of the surface-
  water is very uniform, varying but little with latitude, showing a very
 marked difference from the Atlantic Ocean, a difference which was
 observed to obtain in all parts of the Pacific.
     From Cape York to Hong Kong the course lay through the remarkable
 series of so-called enclosed seas.       The mean surface specific gravities in
 these seas were as follows      : — In and around Torres Straits, 1-02655 ; in
 the Arafura Sea, 1-02549      ;   in the Banda Sea, 1-02603 ; in the Molucca
 Passage, 1-02517; in the Celebes Sea, 1-02562; in the Sulu Sea, 1-02496;
 in the sea enclosed by the Philippine Islands, 1-02532 ; and in the China
 Sea, 1-02518.      On the way to Hong Kong we traversed the Sulu and
 China    seas  just at the time when the south-west      monsoon had ceased
 and the north-east one began to blow.          When we returned by the same
 route as far as the south point of Mindanao, the north-east monsoon had
 already persisted for more than two months ; and the effect of the com
 parative dryness of this wind is very evident in the surface specific
 gravities.    The following average values were found : — In the China Sea,
 1-02534 ; in the Philippine Sea, 1-02532 ; and in the Sulu Sea, 1-02570.
 On the other hand, the few observations made in the northern part of the
 Celebes Sea showed a diminution of specific gravity, the average being
 1-02496.     Outside the south point of Mindanao a strong and steady
north-easterly wind was met with, and for the next ten degrees in longi
tude the mean specific gravity was 1-02596.          On nearing the coast of
New Guinea the specific gravity went down rapidly, averaging for a few
days before our arrival at Humboldt Bay 1-02519.           That a very large
river must here empty itself into the sea was evident from the amount
of drift-wood with which the sea was covered, and from the superficial
distribution of the light water. The specific gravity of water at 50
fathoms below the surface was almost perfectly uniform, varying from
1-02611 to 1-02636 during the whole cruise from Mindanao to Admiralty
Island. When about twenty miles off Humboldt Bay the specific gravity
of the water fell as low as 1-02420. Between Humboldt Bay and the
Admiralty Island the surface specific gravity was very uniform, varying
from    1-02583 to 1-02600, except in one position (lat. 2° 30' 8., long.
144° 7' E.), where it felj to 1-02554"; but a series of observations on
waters taken from different depths at this position showed at once the

                      done on board      H.M.S. ' Challenger'              601
superficial nature of the variation ; the water at        10 fathoms from the
surface      had a specific gravity  of  1,02580.  Although there was here no
                              I
drift-wood to be seen, have little doubt that we had to do with warm
water, although the nearest point of New Guinea was at least 80 miles
 distant ; and indeed Capt. Scoresby, who sailed along this coast much
 closer in shore, observed in this part large quantities of drift-wood, and
 inferred the existence of a large river in the neighbourhood.
      North of Admiralty Island the specific gravity is somewhat higher ;
 between the equator and 3° north latitude the mean is 1-02648 ; thence
 all the way north to Japan it remains very uniform, the mean being about
  1-02600.
      Leaving Japan in the month of June, the course lay entirely between
  the parallels of 34° and 40° N. as far as the meridian of 155° W. The
  specific gravity was slightly greater on the western side of the ocean than
  on the eastern.      The following mean specific gravities were observed for
  every ten degrees of longitude : —
                       140    to 150 E                  102586.
                        150   to 160                    102574.
                        160   to 170                    1-02585.
                        170   to 180                    102568.
                       180    to 170 W                  1-02569.
                        170   to 160                    102544.
                        160   to 155                    102532.
   Arrived at 155° W. longitude, a southerly course was pursued by way of
   the Sandwich Islands and Tahiti, when the following mean specific
   gravities were observed : —
                        35    to  25 N                  1-02618.
                       25     to  15                    1-02593.
                        15    to   5                    1-02574.
                         5N.to     5 8                  1-02649.
                         5 8. to  15                    1-02658.
                        15    to  25                    102099.
                        25    to  35                    1-02620.
    Whence it will be seen that the minimum value is reached between 15°
    and 5°N. latitude, the lowest value actually observed having been
    1-02488 in latitude 7° 26' N.       The maximum to the south between 15°
    and 25° is very much more pronounced than that to the north of it ; in
    fact round about Tahiti is the only spot in the Pacific where        I have
    observed the specific gravity reaching 1*02700 ; the actually highest
    observed value was 1-02728 on the 3rd October, when the ship was
    being swung a few miles off Papeete Harbour.
        The easterly course to Valparaiso was made principally between the
     parallels of 35° and 40° S. latitude.     Prom 125° W. longitude to Valpa
     raiso the mean specific gravity was 1-02534, the maximum being 1-02552
     and the minimum 1-02513.

 G02                 Mr.    J.  Y. Buchanan      on Chemical Work
    A   large number of observations on the specific gravity of the waters at
 the bottom and intermediate depths have been made.                     In a preliminary
 report like    the  present   it  would be out of place to enter upon the discus
 sion of so extensive a subject, even did the time at my disposal admit of my
attempting it.      I therefore content myself with giving the numerical results.
It   is to be hoped that in the homeward cruise through the Atlantic a
more complete series of observations in this direction may be obtained, as
those obtained on the way out were only sufficient to show that this ocean,
and especially its northern part, differs greatly from the rest of the
world-sea in density, as it does in temperature and in many other parti
culars. As a general rule, in both oceans between the parallels of 40° X.
and 40° S. the specific gravity (reduced to 15°-56 C.) is greatest at or
near the surface, and decreases more or less regularly until a minimum
is reached, generally about 400 fathoms from the surface, when there is
a slow rise, the bottom-water             being rather heavier.        This general law
obtains in the Pacific and in the South                 Atlantic;   but from the few
observations obtained in the North Atlantic,               there are indications     of a
departure from it.         Although in the case of surface-water the variations
of specific gravity with latitude are very considerable, more especially in
the Atlantic, the water below 200 fathoms presents great constancy, the
variations being comparable with those of the temperature at the same
depths.       In intertropical regions, and generally where there exist alter
nating    wet   and dry seasons, there are usually more than one maximum
and minimum in the series between the surface and the bottom.                       How
long   it  takes  in  quiet  seas   for fresh water    to   diffuse downwards     in  the
sea, will be seen by inspection of the results obtained on the 22nd
February, 1875, above referred to, when about 80 miles off the mouth of
one of the large rivers of New Guinea, and the sea covered with drift
wood.       The specific gravity was at the surface 1-02537 ; at 10 fathoms,
1-02578; at 20 fathoms, 1-02584; at 40 fathoms, 1-02594; at 50
fathoms, 1-02636 ; and at 100 fathoms, 1-02658, where it obtained its
maximum, the temperature being sensibly the same down to 50 fathoms,
namely from 28° C. to 28°-4 C.
             Observations   on the Carbonic    Acid contained in Sea-water.
    The carbonic acid when boiled out of the water is received by baryta-
water of known strength ; its consequent loss of alkalinity is measured
by hydrochloric acid of corresponding strength.                   Having observed that
the presence of sulphates in sea-water               is one of the potent agents in
the retention of the carbonic acid*,              I   always add 10 cub. centims.
of   a   saturated     solution     of chloride of barium to the water before
commencing         the operation.       This facilitates greatly the liberation of
the carbonic acid, and            also causes the water to boil tranquilly, even
to   dryness, without showing any tendency towards bumping.                          The

quantity of water          used has been almost invariably 225 cub. centims.,
and the property            possessed by sea-water of retaining its carbonic
add with great           vigour makes it possible        to perform the determina
tion of it even          a  couple  of  days   after   its  collection.   As a proof
of this, on the         10th July, 1875, the surface-water was found when
freshly drawn          to   contain 0-0291 gramme carbonic acid per litre.
 A. quantity likewise of the freshly drawn water was boiled in vacuo
 for an hour and fifty minutes in order to collect the oxygen and
 nitrogen, and then allowed to cool protected from the air.                       One
 portion of this water was exposed to the air in a flat dish outside
  the port for three hours, and in another portion the carbonic acid was
 at     once determined.       It contained   0*274 gramme per litre, whilst the
  water exposed to the air contained 0-6273 gramme. The effect, then, of
  boiling in vacuo was only to remove about 5 per cent, of the whole
  amount, whilst free exposure to the air had no effect whatever.              As the
  determination of the carbonic acid takes a considerable time, it is only
  by taking advantage of this property that I have been able to determine
   it in   samples from depths in the same locality ; for where boiling in
   vacuo has so little effect, there is no danger of losing carbonic acid
   ¦when the water is carefully decanted.
        As in  the great majority of cases, where the carbonic acid has been
   determined,    the oxygen and nitrogen have also been collecte d, and are
   being preserved until our return home, when they will be analyzed : it
    would be useless to attempt to discuss the results of the carbonic-acid
    determinations at present, and before these analyses have been made,
    especially as there is likely to be some relation between the amounts of
    oxygen and of carbonic acid.         Independently, however, of the relations
    which may subsist between the two bodies, it may be gathered from the
    inspection of the accompanying Table that, taking surface-waters alone,
    the amount of carbonic acid present is many times greater than would
    be contained in the same volume of distilled water under the same cir
     cumstances.     I  have again and again exposed distilled water, surcharged
     with carbonic acid, to the air, and after even a very few minutes the
     carbonic acid was completely gone; on adding to 225 cub. centims. of it
     5 cub. centims. baryta-water, the mixture remained perfectly clear ; and
     on titrating with hydrochloric acid there was no diminution of alkalinity.
         The temperature of the water on this occasion was 18°-3 C. On that
     particular day, namely the 8th July, 1875, when in the middle of the
     North Pacific, there was no determination made of the carbonic acid in
     the surface-water; but two days later,when the temperature of the surface-
     water was 18°-9 C, 225 cub. centims. of it contained 0-0066 gramme carbonic
     acid. Had there been 0-002 gramme C02 in the 225 cub. centims. distilled
      water, it must  have been detected and determined.         Hence, under the same
      circumstances, this particular sea-water, whose specific gravity was 1'02528
      (at 15°-56 C, water at 4°
                                    = 1 ), contained at least thirty times as much

 GO 4            Mr.   J. Y. Buchanan    on Chemical    Work
 carbonic acid as an equal bulk of fresh water would have done. Further,
 as might have been expected from the above observations, the amount of
carbonic   acid contained by surface-waters of the same temperatures
increases with the density, and consequently is greater in the surface-
water of the Atlantic than in that of the Pacific, the two oceans being
very markedly distinguished from one another by the different densities
 of their surface-waters.    Thus we have a mean of 0-0466 gramme GO,
per litre in Atlantic surface-water of temperature between 20° and 25° C.
 and mean density 1-02727 ; whilst in the Pacific the mean is 0*0268 gramme
in water of 1-02594 mean density ; and the mean amount of carbonic
acid in Atlantic water of temperature above 25° C. and mean density
 1-02659 is 0*0409, whilst in the Pacific the corresponding water is of
 mean density 1-02593, and contains 0-0332 gramme C02per litre.          As a
 rule, other things being equal, the amount of carbonic acid diminishes
as the temperature increases ; thus the mean amount of carbonic acid in
waters whose temperature was between 15° and 20° was found to be
0-0446 gramme per litre, the mean density being 1-02642, whilst we
have seen that in the Atlantic the surface-water of temperature above
25° C. and of mean density 1-02659 contains 0-0409 gramme per litre.
Also there is usually more carbonic acid in waters taken from the bottom
and intermediate depths than in surface-water; but if regard be had to
the temperature of the water, it will be seen that there is but little
difference in the amount in waters of the same temperature from what
ever depth they may have been derived.      This seems to indicate that the
animal life at the bottom and at great depths cannot be very abundant,
otherwise there could hardly fail to be a decided excess of carbonic acid
in the deep water, owing to constant production and want of the means
of elimination of the gas. On this subject, however, it would be prema
ture to speculate before the determination of the oxygen, from which we
may hope for much information.
   I  have made a number of experiments to detect the presence of car
bonates in sea-water.     If any were present, they should be found in the
residues from the determination of the carbonic acid ; and     I had been in
the habit of testing by adding a little acid to them, and invariably with
the same result — that carbonates were not present ; at the same time it
appeared to me to be very unlikely that such should be the case, when
there is plenty of carbonate of lime in the shells of the animals living
and dying in it, and also plenty of carbonic acid in the water to dissolve it.
It was also not improbable that the very considerable amount of sulphate of
baryta in the residues might disguise the effervescence.  I therefore evapo
rated a separate portion (about 150 cub.centims.)of the water in a platinum
dish to dryness, removed the soluble salts with a little water, and added a
few drops of strong hydrochloric acid, which was allowed to flow slowly
 over the inner surface of the dish, when even the smallest trace of car
 bonates could be detected by the appearance of minute bubbles on the

                       done on board    H.M.S. ' Challenger.'                  605
platinum surface. In this way I have examined a number of waters
between Tahiti and Valparaiso, and with the general result that in ocean-
water carbonates are never present except in small quantities, and in
many samples they have been absent altogether. They are generally
present in waters at or near the surface, disappearing, however, as the
depth from which the water has been taken increases. They are generally,
though not invariably, absent in waters from greater depths than 400
fathoms. They are present or absent in bottom-water according to their
occurrence in the bottom       ; although here also there appears to be excep
tions, as I have observed water taken from         a " Globigerina-ooze
                                                                          "
                                                                            bottom
which contained no carbonate.
     In  connexion with carbonic acid     I may mention that    I have frequently
tested waters, and especially bottom-waters, for organic matter. None
 of the    methods in use for determining this substance in drinking-water
 giving    satisfaction when applied to sea-water,      I  had to content myself
 with endeavouring to detect its presence. If the jelly-like organism
 which had been seen by some eminent naturalists in specimens of ocean
 bottom and called Bathybius really formed, as was believed, an all-per
 vading organic covering of the sea-bottom, it could hardly fail to show
 itself when the bottom-water       was evaporated to dryness and the residue
 heated.      In  the numerous     samples of bottom-water which        I  have so
  examined, there never was sufficient        organic matter to give more than a
  just perceptible greyish tinge     to the  residue, without any other signs of
  carbonization     or burning.    Meantime my colleague, Mr. Murray, who
  had been working according to the directions given by the discoverers
  of Bathybius, had actually observed      a substance  like " coagulated mucus,"
  which answered in every particular, except the want of motion, to the
   description of the organism ; and he found it in such quantity that, if it
   were really of the supposed organic nature, it must necessarily render
   the bottom-water so rich in organic matter that its presence would be
   abundantly evident when the water was treated as above described. There
   remained,    then, but one conclusion,      namely, that the body which Mr.
   Murray had observed was not an organic body at all ; and on examining
   it and its mode of preparation       I  determined it to be sulphate of lime,
   which had    been eliminated  from the sea-water, always present in the mud,
   as an amorphous precipitate on the addition of spirit of wine.               The
   substance when analyzed consisted of sulphuric acid and lime ; and when
    dissolved in water and the solution allowed to evaporate, it crystallized in
    the well-known form of gypsum, the crystals being all alike, and there
    being no amorphous matter amongst them.
       These observations were made chiefly on the voyage from Hong Kong to
    Yokohama in the first quarter of the year 1875; and it subsequently
    occurred to me that an approximate determination of the organic sub
    stance in sea-water might be effected in the following way : — Supposing
    the amount of carbonic acid in the water to be known, let a little per

                                                and let the carbonic acid
be determined in the usual way by boiling the solution.        the water            If
contained any easily oxidizable carbon compound, we should obtain more
carbonic acid in the second than in the first determination, and the differ
ence would correspond approximately to the amount of organic carbon
present.             In   several waters which  I                       to this prin

In another concretion, belonging to the same class, the manganese   seen                      is

of the whole mass has thus become manganese. On the face of              fresh                a

From the edge of the black layer inwards, however, the mass            stained           is

a    certain quantity of nickel and cobalt.                   A    concretion of the fourth       class

came up on the 17th June. It is an irregular nodule, about 1| inch
long, of a brownish-black colour, having its outside surface mammillated
all over. This mammillated surface is so peculiar that, by its means, the
manganese may be at once recognized.            When broken it is found to
consist of irregularly concentric layers of peroxide of manganese, alter
 nating with fine    seams of calcareous and earthy matter.      It  contains a
 small, white, earthy nucleus.      The broken surface resembles the figuring
 of polished walnut wood. It consists of peroxide of manganese, alumina,
 iron, silica, small quantity of lime, magnesia, cobalt, and phosphoric acid.
 Heated in the tube it gives out, like all these concretions, water with a
 strong alkaline reaction.
      The most remarkable      occurrence of peroxide of manganese on the
 bottom was met with on the 18th February, in latitude 35° 45' N. and
 longitude 20° 12' W. The dredge was put over in 1500 fathoms, and
 came up full of dead coral of a jet-black colour on the surface.          Some
  of the sticks adhered to large black masses, and on breaking them the
  inside was seen to be perfectly white, the black substance forming merely
  a very thin rind which cracked off easily on receiving a smart blow.
   This black rind, as well as the masses to which some of the sticks were
  attached, consisted of peroxide of manganese, the white part or inside
  having the composition of ordinary coral (chiefly carbonate of lime). The
   black masses to which some of the sticks were attached present, bike the
   concretions already described, a minutely mammillated appearance on the
   outside, and when broken across are seen to consist of concentric layers,
   blacker and more compact towards the outside, and browner and more
   earthy towards the inside. The layers are separated from each other by
   numerous very fine layers of mud, chiefly carbonate of lime.            They
   increase in number towards the inside, and in some instances can be
   seen to be composed in part of fragments of foraminiferous shells. The
   black mass was found on anatysis to consist of peroxide of manganese,
   alumina, oxide of iron, silica, small quantities of lime and magnesia, and
   traces of copper, cobalt, and phosphate of lime. Compared with the
   manganese concretions already described, they appear to have the same
   chemical composition, and their internal structure in layers points to a
   similar mechanical origin ; in fact they differ from the others only in
   being fragments    of much larger concretions.      Where the coral sticks
   adhere, they do not penetrate into the mass at all, but their flat roots
   are as sharply divided from the black mass as the black rind is from the
   inside coral.
       On the 27th June, amongst the concretions, a fragment of slate, coated
   on the outside with mammillated peroxide of manganese, was brought up.
      The preceding notes on the occurrence of the manganese nodules was
   written at the Cape of Good Hope, and sums up our knowledge of the
   subject at the close of the Atlantic cruise.     In the Antarctic Ocean the
    soundings  obtained  showed   in  a remarkable   manner  the general com-

pnrative    shallowness, the depth being in general under 2000 fathoms.
Whenever the dredge or trawl was used in that ocean it brought up
large quantities     of stones ; but they were invariably fragments, more
or less rounded, of. granitic and igneous rocks, and           I   did not notice
any manganese.        On the 13th of March, however, when approaching
Australia, the depth increased to 2600 fathoms          ;  a very large    haul of
manganese nodules was obtained, presenting the same general charac
teristics as those in the Atlantic.       In the Pacific the amount of man
ganese found has been immense, there being hardly a           sounding where it
could not be detected in small particles amongst the mud ; and, indeed,
in many parts the nodules occur in such quantity that the sounding-tube
has brought them up in considerable numbers at one time ; they have
also frequently come up sticking to the bottom of the water-bottle.
Here, however, they have chiefly come under the observation of my
colleague Mr. Murray, and will be treated of in his Eeport.            Chemically
they are very much alike, as far as quantitative analysis can supply
information. They all contain one of the higher oxides of manganese in
preponderating amount, cobalt and nickel in notable quantity, and'copper
 in traces, besides argillaceous and often sandy matter.         I hope, when the
cruise is over, to be able, by means of quantitative analysis, to render a
detailed account of their nature, from which it may perhaps be possible
to obtain some hints as to their origin and development.

 at the bottom of the sea,      I  have taken every opportunity of examining
 specimens of peroxide of manganese from terrestrial sources; and in
 many cases    I have   found them to resemble the marine mineral        in several
  points, especially in nodular structure and in giving ofE alkaline water
 when heated. Some peroxide of manganese which             I  got from the mines
 near Paarl, about thirty miles from Cape Town, had most perfectly
 nodular structure, but was extremely hard, whereas our nodules, when
  freshly brought up, can generally, although not invariably, be easily cut
 with a knife ; but they increase very markedly in hardness when exposed
  to the air, even for only a few weeks.       I do not attach very much im
  portance to the fact of its giving out alkaline water, for this is a pro
  perty which    I have found to be very generally possessed by rocks and
  minerals.    Of the zeolites, for instance, which were found in Kerguelen,
 there was not one which did not give out alkaline water with a very per
  ceptible empyreumatic smell when heated.
     It has  been   mentioned     above that the dredge frequently brought up
  large quantities   of  stones  in the Antarctic Ocean.     Amongst them were
  almost invariably fragments of granite or syenite, as well as of both
  basalt and trachyte.      On the 2nd February, 1874, when between Ker
  guelen and Heard Islands, a very large quantity         of stones was brought
  up in the dredge from a depth of 1C0 fathoms.           Amongst them were a

                        done on board     H.M.S. ' Challenger.'               609
piece of granite, also two varieties of basalt, one coarse-grained with
porphyritic olivine, and the other exceedingly fine-grained and compact,
without      any separate crystals being visible to the naked eye.         It was
chiefly    remarkable from the fact that the stones, though fresh from the
bottom and still quite wet outside, were, when broken, perfectly dry
inside, the moisture not having penetrated beyond the thickness of a
sheet of paper. The edges of these stones were less rounded than those
of the     other species which accompanied them. In order to be perfectly
 sure that there was no mistake,           I  broke about a dozen of them, the
 species being easily recognized by the edges of the stones being less
rounded than those of the others, and always with the same result ; while
 those of the other species were not "only wet inside, but, especially in the
 trachytic ones, decomposition in concentric shells had made considerable
 advances.       As a drop of water applied to the fractured face was readily
                              I
 and quickly absorbed, can only account for the dryness inside by con
 sidering that the stones in' question had passed but a very short time
 under water. As they were found in lat. 52° S., and the first iceberg
 was only met with in 60° S., it would be difficult to imagine that they
 had come ice-borne from the Antarctic land ; at the same time it was
 equally difficult to imagine any other adequate means of conveyance
 than ice.     I  believe that they come from Heard Island, whose ice-bound
 shores are constantly despatching miniature bergs into the sea, which,
 from their insignificant size, would suffer rapid destruction alike from
 the violence of the seas and from the temperature of the water, which,
 on the occasion in question, was between 3° and 4° C. Many small ice-
 masses, such as      I  have supposed, were floating off the southern shore of
  Corinthian Bay, which on this side had a continuous icy coast-line formed
  by a glacier descending from the central high grounds which culminate
  in Kaiser Wilhelm Peak, and reaching the sea both on the west and on
                                                     I
  the east side of the inhabited isthmus, as have described in my short
  note on the island.         The position where the stones were dredged is
  within 100 miles of Heard Island, and through the above-mentioned
 agency there must be a constant conveyance of the debris of the island
 out to sea, which would account for the very stony character of the
  bottom found.
                             Observations  on Searivater Tee.
     Many different opinions have been expressed as to the nature of ice
 resulting from the' freezing of sea-water, all agreeing, however, in one
 point, that when melted the water is unfit to drink.               During the
 Antarctic cruise      I took an opportunity of examining some of the broken
  pack-ice, into which the ship made an excursion on the morning of the
  25th of February, and also some ice which had formed over night in a
  bucket of sea-water left outside the laboratory port.
     The piece of pack-ice which         I examined was in substance clear, with
  many   air-bells, most    of  them  irregularly shaped. Two portions of this
                                                                 2x2

G10                 Mr.     J.  Y. Buchanan       on Chemical    Work
ice were allowed        to melt at the temperature of the laboratory, whioh
ranged     from  2°  to   7° C.     The melting thus took place very slowly, and
made it possible to examine the water fractionally. My experiments
 consisted in determining the chlorine in the water by means of tenth
 normal nitrate of silver          solution, and observing the temperature of the
 ice when melting.
     A lump, which when melted was found to measure 625 cub. centims.,
 was allowed to melt gradually in a porcelain dish.              When about 100 cub.
 centims. had melted, 50 cub. centims. were taken for the determination
 of the chlorine      ;  they required 13*6 cub. centims. silver solution, corre
 sponding      to 0-0483 gramme chlorine.             When 560 cub. centims. had
 melted, 50 cub. centims.            were titrated,   and required 1*6 cub. centim.
 silver solution, corresponding to 0-0057 gramme chlorine.              The remainder
 (65 cub. centims.)          of  the  ice was then melted and 60 cub. centims.
 titrated ; they required 0-39 cub. centim. silver solution, corresponding
 to 0-0014 gramme chlorine.              We have, then, in the first 50 cub. centims.
 0-0483 gramme chorine, in the next 510 cub. centims. 0-0579 gramme
 chlorine, and in the last 65 cub. centims. 0-0015 gramme.                  Hence the
 whole lump (625 cub. centims.) contained 0-1077 gramme chlorine, or,
 on an average, 0-1723 gramme chlorine per litre.               A qualitative analysis
 of the water showed lime, magnesia, and sulphuric acid to be present.
     Another piece of the ice was pounded and allowed to melt in a beaker.
 When about half w-as melted, the water was poured off and found to mea
 sure 95 cub. centims. ; 75 cub. centims. were titrated with silver solution,
 and required 1-9 cub. centim.              The remainder, when melted, measured
 130 cub. centims., and required 0-9 cub. centim. silver solution.              Hence
 the   first fraction    of   95  cub.  centims.  contained  0-0085  gramme   chlorine,
 and the second of 130 cub. centims. 0-0032 gramme chlorine.                The whole
 quantity (225      cub.   centims.)     of ice, therefore, contained 0-0117 gramme
 chlorine, or, on an average, 0-0520 gramme per litre.
     From these results it is evident that the ice under examination was
 very far from being an homogeneous body ; and, indeed, nothing else
 could be expected, when it is borne in mind that the ice in question owes
 its existence, not only to the bond fide freezing of sea-water, but also to
 the snow which falls on its surface and is congealed into a compact mass
 by the salt-water spray freezing amongst it.
     The ice formed by freezing sea-water in a bucket was found to have
 formed all round the bottom and sides of the bucket, and forming a
 pellicle on the surface, from which, and from the sides and bottom, the
 ice had formed in hexagonal planes, projecting edgewise into the water.
 The water was poured off, the crystals collected, washed with distilled
 water, pressed between filtering-paper,               and one portion melted.       It
 measured 9 cub. centims., and required 4 cub. centims. silver solution,
 corresponding to 0-0142 gramme chlorine, or 1-5780 gramme per litre.
 The other portion was used for determining the melting-point. The

                        done on board     H.M.S. ' Challenger?                    611
thermometer used was one of Geissler's normal ones, divided into tenths
of a degree Centigrade, whose zero had been verified the day before in
melting        6now.     The melting-point of the ice-crystals was found to
be — 10,3.         The temperature of the melting mass was observed to re
main constant for twenty minutes, after which no further observations
were made.
     In   the same     way the melting-point of the pack-ice was determined.
The fresh       ice began to melt at —1°; after twenty minutes the thermo
meter had risen to — 0o-9, and two hours and a half afterwards it stood at
 — 0o,3,     having remained constant for about an hour at — 0°*4. Another
portion of the ice rose more rapidly ; and when three fourths of the ice
was melted, the thermometer            stood at 0°.
     These determinations       of the temperature of melting sea-water ice show
 that the salt is not contained in it in the form of mechanically enclosed
 brine only, but exists in the solid form, either as a single crystalline
 substance,      or as a mixture    of ice and salt crystals.    Common salt, when
 separating from solutions at temperatures below             0°, crystallizes in hexa
 gonal planes ; sea-water        ice, therefore, may possibly have some analogy
 to the    isomorphous      mixtures  occurring amongst minerals.
      A  very important practical consequence follows from these observa
 tions, namely,      that pack-ice, though unfit to drink when a lump of it is
 melted as a whole, may serve as a source           of fresh water if melted frac
  tionally.     As the melting-point of the salt ice is lower than that of pure
  ice, it melts first, and at the same time, by keeping down the temperature
  of the mass to its own melting-point, it prevents any of the fresh ice
  being wasted.        "When the salt ice has all been melted the brine may be
   thrown away, and the remainder of the ice will supply fresh water.               If
  a thermometer         be kept in the ice during the process of melting, it
  will indicate by its reading when drinkable water is being formed.
              Observations   made on Shore   in some  of the Islands visited.
       Viewed from the sea, the island of St. Vincent, one of the Cape-Verd
   group, presents an extremely rugged and desert appearance, which it pre
   serves even upon the closest inspection.          The hills round the harbour
   consist of interbedded igneous rocks, the individual beds being seldom
    over three or four feet thick, and generally only about two feet, dipping
    at a gentle angle away from the centre of the harbour.              These beds are
    much cut up by vertical dykes of basaltic rock running in two principal
    directions, namely, north and south and east and west.            They frequently
    present an eminently columnar cleavage in the direction of their breadth.
    Many of the beds which form the mass of the hill are of similar nature
     and cleave in the same way.         The rock on each side of these basaltic
    masses,    whether     beds  or   dykes, is generally much altered, and has
     suffered considerable disintegration and decomposition, being frequently
     transformed into a mass of kaolin in the neighbourhood of the basalt.

612               Mr. J. Y. Buchanan       on Geological   Work
The effect of heat in rendering         many minerals  which occur  in igneous
rocks decomposable by acids is well known, and may furnish an ex
 planation of the above-named phenomena.          As the dykes extend to the
very tops of the hills, and the adjacent rock is weathered away leaving
them projecting, the outline of the hills gets a peculiar serrated appear
 ance, which is very characteristic of the island. The spurs which project
 from the main ranges into the plains are always found to depend for their
 height and direction on one of these basaltic dykes, which can be followed
 all the way along their crest.
     In many of the rocks, where their character is cellular, their cells are
 filled with geodes, in some cases of carbonate of lime, and in others of
zeolite.    The rocks are nearly all of a porphyritic character from crystals
 of augite separated out.      The most common rock contains large augites
 in a light grey ground-mass.      The crystals are frequently arranged in
 bands with their longer axes parallel to each other and in the direction
 of the bands. Xothing approaching to either obsidian or pumice was
 observed in any part of the island.        Besides the igneous rocks, there is
in the plain on which the town stands and to the south of it a calcareous
 formation consisting of shells, corals, and rounded pebbles of the neigh
 bouring rocks, united by a firm paste of a white and sometimes of a
 reddish colour ; also, from the constant prevalence of winds from one
 quarter, the sand from the beach has been distributed over the plains
and in the valley.      At the south side of the harbour there are dunes of
blown sand, which in some places is consolidated into rocks similar to
those of Bermuda.         Here, however, the sand does not consist purely of
carbonate of lime, but of the debris of shells and volcanic material mixed.
Hence the consolidation of it into rock is not so easy, even if there was
 the quantity of rain to do it.     On the sand hills the wind produces the
usual beautiful ripple-mark, and the mixed character of the sand makes
the levigating action of the wind very apparent, the light calcareous
particles being swept into the eddies under the crest of the ripple, the
heavy volcanic debris remaining on the surface.         As the colour of the
latter is generally black and that of the former white, a sand hill looks
lighter or darker according as it is viewed from the weather or from the
lee side.
     Wo were told that on the other side of the island there were tolerably
perfect craters ; we were, however, unable to visit them.        In the neigh
bourhood of the harbour there was no vestige of recent volcanic action.
At St. Paul's rocks the ship was made fast to the rocks, and as we re
mained there over thirty-six hours we had ample time to thoroughly
explore them.       They were visited by Darwin in the ' Beagle,' and several
times later by other ships.     As the nature of the rocks appears to pre
sent some     difficulty to geologists,  I made as complete a collection of
them as    I could, and they will be sent home with the other collections
from this place.        The white enamel-like incrustation mentioned by

                       done on board         H.M.S. ' Challenger.'                       613
Darwin,      I found     only on the southern island.             On the northern island
the bulk      is composed of what          I  take to be Darwin's
                                                                        i;
                                                                           yellowish harsh
stone, split up into numerous pseudo-fragments."                       These last have an
appearance which recalls that of weathered orthoclase crystals.                        All of
these rocks give off alkaline water when heated in the closed tube, and
 consist of hydrated silicate of magnesia with alumina and protoxide of
 iron in subordinate quantity. They may therefore, I think, be classed
 as serpentine ; and the above-mentioned resemblance to orthoclase crystals
 may perhaps afford some indication of the parent rock. Of the more
 recent veins mentioned by Darwin, some are bordered on both sides by
 black bands. These bands consist of a hard infusible substance. The
 powder has a dirty greyish green colour, and effervesces with dilute
 hydrochloric acid, leaving        a   brown insoluble residue.          In  strong hydro
 chloric acid it dissolves with evolution of chlorine, and the colour pheno
 mena of dissolving peroxide of manganese.                    It was found to consist of
 phosphate      of lime,  peroxide    of  manganese,     a little  carbonate of lime and
  magnesia, and traces of copper and iron. Like the other rocks it gives
  off alkaline water in the closed tube.
      At Fernando Noronha some of the smaller islands at its N.E. ex
  tremity were visited.        The highest of these, St. Michael's Mount, forms
  one of the prominent peaks which are characteristic of the group.                     It is
  very steep and formed entirely of phonolite, which occurs columnar at
  the base and massive towards the top. On the western side, where we
  landed, the columns are inclined to the horizon at an angle of about 30°.
  Their transverse section looks nearly square, the corners, however, being
  considerably rounded off.          The columns are for the most part slender,
  and their mass is of a dirty green colour.              In this the sanidin crystals
  are arranged with great regularity, with their broadest faces in a plane
   perpendicular to the length of the column.              The sides of the mount are
  covered with loose blocks of massive phonolite fallen down from above,
  and retained in position on a very steep incline by the branches of most
  luxuriant creeping plants.          On the weathered sides of these blocks the
   sanidin crystals, and also the hornblende ones, though in less degree,
  project sometimes as much as a quarter of an inch.                 This rock possesses
  also, in a most eminent degree, the characteristic property from which
  it has derived its name of phonolite ; when struck with the hammer it
  rings like a bell.     The mount is cleft from top to bottom in two places,
  nearly at right angles to each other.             These clefts are filled up with a
   hard flinty looking substance, which appears from its structure to have
   been gradually deposited by water trickling down the sides.                  Its mass is
  concretionary    and   sometimes      foliated  ;  its colour   is white,   to  yellowish
   white or brownish yellow.          It scratches glass with ease, and does not
   effervesce with acid.        Plates of 2 to 3 millims. thickness are quite
   translucent.    Heated in the forceps it does not fuse, but turns perfectly
   white, and is then     easily crumbled       between the fingers.         In  the closed

614               Mr.  J. Y. Buchanan      on Geological    Work
tube it gives off alkaline-reacting and empyreumatic- smelling water.          It
was found to consist of phosphate of alumina and iron, with some silicate
and sulphate of lime.
     Besides St. Michael's Mount,     Eat Island and Platform Island were
landed upon.       Eat Island is the largest of the secondary islands, and
the one most distant from the main island.        It is composed on the west-em
side of massive basaltic      rock, and on the eastern     of sandstone.     This
latter probably overlies the basalt, as     in its structure it bears the marks
of having been deposited in drifts, and the sand is calcareous, consisting
of shell debris. On our way to and from Eat Island we had to pass all
 along the western side of Booby Island.           The wave-worn cliffs showed
 that the island was entirely formed of the above-mentioned calcareous
 sandstone.     No igneous rock was visible at all; and as the peculiar wind
 blown stratification marks are continued below the level of the sea, it is
 probable that the land here is sinking, or at least has sunk.
     Platform Island consists of a mass of perfect basaltic columns rising
 out of the water, and supporting a covering of massive basalt, on which
 is spread out the platform of calcareous rock, on which are the ruins of
 an old fort, and from which the island doubtless takes its name.
     A day was spent on each of the islands of the Tristan d'Aeunha
 group.      It consists of three : — Tristan, the largest, Inaccessible, and
 Nightingale. The last is more properly a group of islands studded all
 round with isolated rocks.       The difficult nature of the ground in Inac
 cessible and Nightingale, and that combined with the uncertain state of
 the weather when at Tristan, rendered excursions to a distance from the
  landing-place impossible.      The rock specimens, therefore, which have
  been collected are all    from   the neighbourhood of the landing-places.
  Each island has its distinctive features.     Inaccessible is a raised plateau,
  bounded on all sides by cliffs over 1000 feet high, which plunge directly
  into the sea. Looked at from the sea, there is no appearance of a crater
  on the top, the only inequalities in the surface being apparently due to
  erosion.     The waterfalls,   which tumble from the cliffs,       afford  most
  picturesque proof of the abundance of water above.         Tristan Island, like
  Inaccessible, consists of a very similar plateau, bounded by cliffs of about
  the same height and almost equally impracticable.           This plateau, how
  ever, is surmounted by a lofty peak rising to the height of 8300 feet
  above the sea.     Nightingale Island differs from the other two as much
  in geological structure as in outward appearance. The principal island
  rises from the sea in low cliffs, nowhere on the eastern side exceeding
  30 or 40 feet, and generally lower.       At the south end the ground rises
  from these cliffs by several steep ascents to the peak 1105 feet high,
  which on its northern side presents a nearly perpendicular face of about
   half its height from the sea. The rest of the island is more undulating,
   the light grey rocks appearing only here and there through the openings
  in the long tussac grass. Of recent volcanic action there appears to

be   no trace.     The shore cliffs consist of a conglomerate, or rather
breccia, of generally light-coloured doleritic fragments in a white fel-
spathic matrix.      These are overlaid, in places, by a bed of old igneous
rocks.    The peak, which                 I
                                did not reach, is composed of light grey sub-
columnar rock. All along the top of the cliffs, and about 35 feet above
the sea, an ancient beach is seen to run ; and the huge caves, at a con
siderable height above high-water mark, afford additional evidence of the
rising of the land.        The middle island, which                         I
                                                           explored, consisted
entirely of the above-mentioned breccia, and even at its highest point
(150 feet) it was much water-worn. Dykes are by no means so frequent
 in this as in the other islands.   Where they occur penetrating the breccia,
 the latter appears to be rendered more easily decomposable, the result
 being that the dykes form the axes along which creeks or inlets indent
  the shore.   In the island of Tristan, the gully behind the settlement, in
 the centre of which the spring rises which supplies the village brook, is
 formed in a similar way.      It is backed by a vertical dyke (if a mass at
 least sixty yards wide can be called so) of rock similar to that observed
  on Nightingale, and, like               it,
                                   has altered the adjacent rock considerably

          apparent.   In one of the specimens collected the rock in the

     the case,      it   furnishes    additional         evidence of the rising of the land in
     these parts.
        During the cruise between the Cape of Good Hope and Melbourne
     three islands were landed on, namely, Marion, Kerguelen, and Heard
     islands.  On the first of these day was spent. The soft mossy nature
                                                     a
     of       the ground     made     the walking very heavy, which, combined with the

GIG             Mr.  J.  Y. Buchanan    on  Geological Work
necessity of being at any time prepared to join the ship in case of change
of weather, rendered any expedition far from the coast impoasibk.
Viewed from the sea, the rocky shores are seen to be surmounted br ta
undulating country covered with herbage, which, as the height inas«et,
passes into a barren mountain cluster with many sharp and somennw
perfectly conical peaks. The highest of these were covered with smw,
and for the greater part of the day enveloped in mist ; the lower one
were mostly' of a bright brick-red colour.      Where the coast cliffs wuM
be viewed they showed layers of compact and brecciated lavas of no great
thickness.    Having landed at the mouth of a watercourse,        I  traversed
the beach    to the westward    until I  reached the next stream, whkh I
followed some distance inland.     When the swampy moss-covered ground,
whose uniformly dull green colour was relieved here and there by the
snowy plumage of the nesting albatross, had been left behind, the stream
was found to flow over an apparently very recent stream of black cel
lular lava, whose ripples and eddies were still perfectly fresh, except in
the very centre, where they had suffered some slight abrasion         ; of any
hollowing action on the part of the water, however, there was         no tract,
the windings and little waterfalls being still determined by the original
inequalities of the solidifying rock.     The lava was basaltic, containing
much olivine.     Close by the bed of the stream rose several of   the aboTe-
mentioned red conical hills.     One of these, the highest within   reach, and
the only one   I had time to ascend, consisted of a heap of loose scoria
dipping away on all sides at a regular and very steep angle. Few of
these pieces of scoria were more than six inches in diameter ; and had it
not been for the occasional clumps of moss, which alone afforded a sore
footing, the ascent would have been a matter of considerable time. At
the top was a perfectly conical pit, and slightly below the summit, on the
north side, were three smaller and similar pits. The scoria of which
the hill is made up consisted of a highly cellular red ground-mass, with
indications of augite, without, however, any perfect crystals being dis
cernible.   Besides the red scoriae, there were some of a chocolate-brown
colour, with frothy exterior and compact kernel.      The shape of some of
them resembled the almond-shaped bombs found in many volcanic dis
            I
tricts ; but did not notice any with the dense outside and highly cellular
core so characteristic of the true volcanic bomb.     Besides this hill there
were five or six others precisely simdar in appearance, and rising out of
the same valley or depression in the ground. From the top of the hill
this depression could be seen to be bounded, towards the interior, by a
semicircular clili of rock, in some parts columnar, and open towards the
sea.    Above this cliff rose the snow-covered cones and peaks of the in
terior, which, wherever the snow had been removed, showed the aame
red colour and steep sides, so that there can be little doubt of their being
similarly formed to those on the lower ground.      On leaving the stream-
bed and returning to the eastward over the spur of the mountain, the

above-mentioned cliff had to be skirted, and it was found to consist of a
light grey compact doleritic rock..
   From these few observations it may be concluded that the island con
sists of a foundation of older igneous rock ruptured and surmounted by
recent volcanoes.   That these have been active at no very ancient date              is,
I  think, rendered probable         by
                                the perfect preservation of the forms of
 the cones with their summit craters, and by the fact that the mossy
 vegetation so luxuriant at their base, and retaining this luxuriance on
the certainly older mountain-spurs to an elevation at least equal to that
of the top of the cone ascended, has as yet spread up their sides only in
straggling isolated patches.
  The evidence afforded by the want of erosion deserves all the more
weight when the position of the island remembered, where, of necessity,
                                                   is
 the   rainfall must     be considerable.
   The island of Kerguelen was visited at various points on the north
 eastern and south-eastern coasts. The first part touched at was Christ
 mas   Harbour, already visited by Cook, Ross, and other navigators.                 It
 is
 a      deep inlet     surrounded      by
                                   high rocky banks, which are in many
 places     quite precipitous.    At   the

 beds being easily traced all round the harbour.       Where the sides are
 not precipitous the summit of the ridge    attained    is           by

    from each other in nature, and without having caused any apparent
    disturbance  in the arrangement of the beds which surround them.

landite.   These minerals are very plentiful in this part of the island ;
mid when rounded by the action of water, they form remarkable white
pebbles on the otherwise dark-coloured volcanic sand.    Up to the sum
mit the alternation of beds of compact subcolumnar rock of amygdaloid
is pretty regular. The amygdaloid is of two kinds ;                        in one the cells
are small, very thickly disseminated, and completely                         filled up by a
zeolitic          the other has larger cavities, less thickly spread, and
            mineral     ;
generally only coated with crystals, while seams filled with crystalline
matter are also frequently met with. The cavities contain generally
analcite,the seams heulandite.       The ridge on the southern side is
higher than that on  the  northern ;  and from  on            it,

of considerable altitude, and often so sharp and steep in outline that at
first never doubted they were recent volcanic mountains.

view of them, however, showed them generally to consist of the same
horizontally bedded rock found               underneath   ;   and   it   was impossible   to
avoid the impression that they might be the remnants of   higher plateau, a
of  which  all but these peaks had been  removed by  the rodent action of
ice, of which there   abundant evidence.

   Prince of Wales's Foreland          an elevation formed by slender basaltic
                                          is
columns, many of which were clustered together into what,                perfect,   if
would have formed spherical agglomerations.           The basalt contained large
cavities filled with olivine.    Behind this rocky point the usual flat-topped
range  of   hills stretches inland,  which consists of the same basalt with
much olivine, only not columnar, but in tabular masses with almost slaty
cleavage.
  Nearly opposite Prince of Wales's Foreland, and on the other side of
the entrance to Royal Sound,    very remarkable hill of
                                        is   a             castellated          a

worn rock at the crest, which gives it its castellated look, consists of a
light-coloured ground, in which are enclosed pieces of the recent scoria-
ceous lava which occurs immediately beneath it and large crystals of
augite. These crystals, though apparently perfect when imbedded in the
rock, were not found otherwise than broken when weathered out ; and in
 places inside these natural battlements, where there was free play for the
 usually boisterous wind, all the lighter sand had been blown away, leaving
 the ground covered by a jet-black gravel.            Both these crystals and the
 rocks show the abrading effect of blown sand, the crystals having lost
 their regularity of form and the rocks having acquired a more definite
 shape than would have been the case had the weathering proceeded
 equally on all sides. Here, however, and still more remarkably so in
 Heard Island, the constant and violent westerly winds, wherever they
 have an opportunity of charging themselves with sand, sculpture the
 rocks into shapes of apparently unnatural regularity. From this hill
 another similar but smaller one could be seen close to the base of the
      Sugar-loaf." It resembled more a circle of DruidicaJ stones protruding
  "
  through the moorland than a hill ; my time, however, was too limited to
  admit of my visiting either it or the imposing Sugar-loaf, the structure
  of which appeared from a distance to be quite peculiar.
       On entering Greenland Harbour, which at its head is only separated
  by a narrow neck of land from Eoyal Sound, the eye is at once struck by
  the strange protrusions of light grey rock through the ordinary horizontal
  basaltic beds which form the hill-ranges.         The most extensive of them,
   which occurs on the summit of the range on the western side of the
   harbour, has at a distance a very strong resemblance to a ruined castle.
   I was able to examine two of them, one on the summit and one down
   nearer the landing-place, both on the west side of the harbour.             The
   rock in both of them is identical, and consists of a light, greenish-white
   phonolite protruding through the horizontal beds of augitic rock.         These
   cylindrical masses of phonolite         are columnar  at  the  outer edges, the
   columns     lying horizontally and being arranged radially.      This columnar
    structure, however, disappears a few feet      from the  outside, and the rock
   is simply massive.        The effect of weathering has been to split it up into
   loose blocks, which lie thickly scattered over the ground enclosed.         The
    whole outside line being constructed of horizontal columns, forms a sort
    of natural cyclopian wall, much more capable of resisting the degrading
    influence of the weather than the massive inside ; hence we might expect
    that as they always protrude on a hill slope, the rock being disintegrated
    in the centre would slip down the hill, forming a heap or talus of rubbish
    below, and overwhelming the wall encircling the lower edge, but at the
     same time falling away from the wall of the upper edge, which, thanks
     to its artificial structure, is able to keep together its fragments ; and, in
     fact, this is what we observe.       The upper wall of the more distant one,
     W'hich stands out a prominent object on the summit of the ridge, is over

    G20               Mr.   J. Y.   Buchanan on Geological Work
   50 feet high, and presents a perfectly smooth wall-face to the outgide.
    As it stretches down the hill-slope, which here is very steep, its height
    diminishes irregularly until it is lost in the heap of loose stones which
    covers the lower wall and the whole inside.
       The rock is hard and compact, of          a tight  greenish grey colour, with
    much of the appearance, though none of the ring, of phonolite.                 Xear
    the outside, or in the columnar part, the rock is closer-grained           than    in
   the centre, and has a distinct cleavage in a plane perpendicular to the
   length of the columns.           It gelatinizes partially with hydrochloric and,
   and the solution       contains   much soda and      some    sulphuric acid.     It  is
   therefore probable that both nepheline and nosean are present.
       Another prominence on this side of the harbour is formed of precisely
   similar material.       It is a round, greenish grey hill covered with phono-
   titic rock lying about in angular fragments, generally of a size to be easily
   lifted. The rock is very similar to that of the hills just described ; and
   it seems to belong to the same class, differing from the others owing t»
   the complete disappearance of the outside wall, large pieces of which lie
   scattered on the slope like portions of dislodged masonry.
       It is to be remarked that in neither of these cases was there any dis
   tortion in the beds in which the phonolite occurred.           The line of junction
.  of   the  highest  one  with  the  augitic rock was   very  well  shown, and I wis
   enabled to get specimens from it. For some feet from the line of judo
   tion the basalt is considerably altered, the large crystals of augite and
   olivine disappearing as the line of junction is approached.              This line is
   in general quite decided ; there are many angular particles of the pfcono-
   tite completely surrounded by the basalt, whereas basalt imbedded in
   phonolite was not observed. Further, the grain of this basalt, in im
   mediate proximity to the junction, is very fine, becoming rapidly coarser
   till the basalt at 10 feet from the junction has the porphyritic appearance
   which it presents at other parts of the hill.           These two facts appear to
   point    to the  phonolite  as  being  the more  ancient   of the two, and to the
   basalt as having flowed round it. How the phonolite came to be sticking
    up in the pillar-like form which it must have had is very difficult to say ;
   but the peak of Fernando Noronha, however it may have been formed,
   is always evidence of the possibility of such a thing.           There is no neces
   sity for supposing that the portions of these phonolitic masses which we
   see should be sections of cylinders : they may equally well be sections of
   domes. The other view that the phonolite had burst through the lava
   appears to me to be untenable in view of the facts above stated.
       Of the similar hills in Christmas Harbour, Table Mountain consists of
   columnar basalt with large cavities filled with olivine.             The columns
  starting normally to the cylindrical surface of the enclosing rock curve
  upwards, and, unlike the phonolite, are continued well into the mass of
  the hill.      The top of this hill is covered with loose fragments of basaltic

of the columnar with      the bedded    rock   ;   in fact there appeared to have
been next to no fusion between the two.
  The corresponding hill on the south side of the harbour is formed entirely
of   volcanic conglomerate, intersected here and there by dykes, some of
which show on the outside the obsidinn-like bands produced by rapid cool
ing, which were observed in considerable abundance at Tristan d'Acunha.
   Fossil wood is found on the south side of Christmas Harbour imbedded
in the igneous rock. It occurs in stumps and smaller branches. The
colour varies from yellowish white to chocolate-brown and black. Its
hardness is also very variable.      Even in the perfectly white pieces there
is still much organic matter remaining. The bark has been transformed
into a brown crystalline mass of greasy appearance, which effervesces
¦with acid.    The inside of one rather large trunk, the core of which had
probably rotted away, was entirely filled up with a mass of igneous rock
with elongated cavities filled with crystals. Iron pyrites was occasionally
 observed. Parts that internally consisted of nothing but trap-rock often
 presented on the outside the fibrous appearance of the simply silicified
 wood ; the thickness of this rind, however, was insignificant.
     A species of brown coal occurs on the south side of Christmas Harbour
 between two layers of basalt, and only a few feet above the sea.         It   is,
 practically, of no  use, being too  poor  to  burn at all alone.
     Near the eastern point of Howe Island much amygdaloid was found,
 the geodes here consisting almost exclusively of agate. The tops of the
 hills were thickly strewed with such as, in the lapse of time, had been
 weathered out of the matrix.       Many of these presented       very striking
                                                                   a
  appearance, one of the corners of the cast of the cavity having been
  neatly planed off, and in some instances even highly polished, in others
  covered with  a natural etching of great beauty. The occurrence of these
  abraded faces is, I  think, further evidence of the recent prevalence of
                              a
  ice-action over the whole island; and    it must be remembered that glaciers
  actually do reach the sea-level  in fiords  on the main island not more than
  twenty miles distant.

  in different localities. In Christmas Harbour they are almost exclusively
   zeolites in Cumberland Bay those who have visited

   silica with which the cavities were filled occurred entirely in compact
   masses of agate or chalcedony.      The cavities were usually quite full, the
   geodes being solid and forming an accurate oast of the cavity.        Where
   this was not  the case the interior  presented   finely
                                                     a     mammillated  surface.

         I     observe the zeolites, so common in the last-named locality,

    Scoriao were only met  with on one occasion, namely, on the hill called
"  Cat's ears," at the entrance to Boyal Sound ; but, as far as could be
decided by a view from the sea, they seemed to be by no means rare on
the southern coast, where the cliffs, worn by the violence of the south
westerly gales, show sections of what undoubtedly is red seoriaceoos
 matter.   The whalers who_frequent the harbours of the island chiefly for
sealing purposes, and from whom much valuable and reliable information
was obtained, affirmed the existence of an active volcano on the western
side of the island, as well as of springs of mineral water, both hot and
cold, and of petroleum.
   It is much to be regretted that our time was too limited to allow of our
visiting the but little-known coast of the western side of the island.
   The group of Heard and M'Donald islands was visited after leaving
                                                     I
Kerguelen. M'Donald, the smaller of the two, is, believe, quite inacces
sible. The ship anchored in Corinthian Bay, Heard Island, on the after
                                I
noon of the Oth February, when had the opportunity of spending about an
hour and a half on shore.    The landing-place was at the head of the bay on
a flat sandy beach at the mouth of a river which comes out of one of the
magnificent glaciers which form a continuous ice-wall along the south
western shores of the bay. Like all glacier-streams it was very muddy.
The island here is very narrow, not more than a mile broad, and the
sandy plain stretches from sea to sea ; it, in fact, forms the heads of
three bays, namely, Corinthian bay facing to the north-east, the open
sea towards the south-west, and a narrow bay which runs in between
two remarkable promontories on the north-east.        The connexion of these
two promontories with the main island by means of this sandy plain is
so low that a depression of a few feet would suffice to separate them
from each other and from the mainland.        The sand is very dark-coloured
and highly magnetic, and was being blown with such violence by the then
prevailing south-west wind, that it was necessary, when exposed to it, to
use some protection for the face. Nowhere have           Iseen the abrading
power of blown sand better exemplified than on the isolated rocks which
have rolled down from the heights above and remained fixed in the sandy
plain, exposed to the constant strong south-westerly gales, driving the
sharp volcanic sand against their sides. Iu this way they have frequently
been cut and dressed as by a mason's chisel.         It      is,
                                                            however, not the
south-westerly   winds   alone which   produce  this effect  but from their

great predominance they have given the rocks the peculiar
appearance, much resembling that assumed        by
                                              the trees growing on        a
coast exposed to the trade-winds.    If favourably placed rocks be carefully
examined, the effect of every prevalent wind will be observed in the facets
which  ithas produced on the surface.      The largest facet, and the one
which determines the general appearance of the rock,      the one turned
                                                               is
towards the west; and I  do not doubt that the areas of the others would
afford useful information as to the relative prevalence of other winds.

Of     the promontories above mentioned, the one which extends towards
th3     west is a lofty mountain rising precipitously from the sea oa the
1NT.E. and S.W., and terminating in two peaks. Between these two
peaks a glacier descends to the edge of the cliff overhanging the sea on
the north-east side, over which the ice-masses fall with a thundering
noise. The other promontory or peninsula is covered by a flow of very
recent lava, the eddies and ripples on the surface being still quite fresh.
 This stream of lava proceeds from the base of a recent but much dilapi
 dated crater, which having sprung up close to the sea could only have
 been preserved by renewing its substance with constant eruption. "When
 this   ceased, the degrading action of the waves began to tell              ; and at pre
 sent it is worn into a group of fantastic-looking peaks, the vertical sides
 of which are marked by the layers of scoriae dipping away from the
 centre. The lava-streain covers the whole of the peninsula, and from
 having been worn by the waves it forms a range of low black cliffs along
 the north side of Corinthian Bay. In the face of these cliffs many large
 cavities, bubbles in the once molten lava, had been opened, and were
 tenanted by the nesting Cape pigeon.
     The glaciers which cover the whole of the southern side of Corinthian
  Bay have been prevented from encroaching on the beach at the head of
  it by a sharp conical hill      of scoria), behind which the ice-covering stretches
  from sea to sea.

      Sin, — I have the honour to report that we left Stanley Harbour in East-
   Falkland Island for Monte Video on the afternoon of the              Gth of   February,
   and on the 8th we sounded          in lat. 48° 37' S., long. 55°   17' "W., about 200
   miles to the   N.E. of Stanley, in      a depth   of 1035 fathoms.       The trawl was
   lowered, but it was unfortunately carried away, after the weights, which
   were at a distance of 300 fathoms in advance of the trawl, had been
   brought in board. The rope looked much chafed, as if it had been ground
   against rocks.       The sounding-machine brought up no sample of the
      vol. xxiv.                                                              2 Y

   bottom   ;  but a tow-net attached to the dredge-rope at the weights con
  tained a little gravel and one or two small organisms.           The bottom-
  temperature was l°-7 C.
     The following day was fine, with light uncertain winds ; on the 10th it
  was blowing half a gale and the sea was running too high for sounding-
  operations.      On the 11th the weather was fine, the wind becoming more
  moderate towards noon ; at 10 a.m. we sounded and put down the trawl in
  2040 fathoms, with a bottom of bluish mud containing many Olobigeriwr,
  and a bottom-temperature of +0o-3 C.            The position of the sounding
  was lat. 42° 32' S., long. 50° 27' W., about 200 miles to the eastward of
  Valdes    Peninsula. Temperature-soundings        were taken down to 1500
  fathoms (Curve 318, Plate 27). This sounding gives a singularly rapid fall
  from 140-2 on the surface to 2°C. at 125 fathoms; the edge of the Ant
  arctic indraught appeared to be pushed up against the American shore
  by the western border of the southern branch of the reflux of the equa
  torial current, as the Labrador current is banked up by its northern
  branch, the result being no doubt increased in both cases by the flinging
  up of the polar water against the western land-barrier on account of its
  low initial velocity.
     On the 12th we sounded in 2425 fathoms, and took          a series of tem
  peratures    ; the upper temperatures were decidedly higher than they were
  the day before, 5° occurring at 125 fathoms, 2°-5 at 700, and 2°C. at
  1100 fathoms.       The position   of the sounding was lat. 41° 54' 8., long.
  54° 46' W. ; it was nearly double the distance of the previous sounding
  from the 100-fathom line, which here nearly corresponds with a steep
  submarine cliff of great height.      The bottom-temperature was — 0o-4 C.
  (Curve 319, Plate 27).       On the 14th we sounded in 600 fathoms on the
  plateau extending from the South- American caast, opposite the estuary
  of the Eiver Plate, 144 miles from Lobos Island.           "We took a set of
  temperatures to the bottom, and found the gradation, so far as it went,
  much the same as the day before ; the bottom-temperature           was 2°-7C.
  On this occasion the trawl was most successful, and gave us a very
 fair idea of the fauna of moderate depths along the coast ; probably not
 fewer than sixty species of different groups were recovered, including a
 very handsome Pennutula between two and three feet in height, some
 deep-sea corals of very special interest, which are being worked up by Mr.
 Moseley, and some fine Echinoderms            and sponges.    On the 15th we
 anchored in Monte-Video Boads.
     We left the anchorage at Monte Video at daybreak on the 25th
 of February, and after swinging ship for errors of the compasses, we
proceeded down the estuary.          In the afternoon the trawl was put down
in thirteen fathoms to get an idea of the fauna of the brackish water.
The    species procured   were comparatively few ; but among them was a
plentiful supply     of an  interesting Alcyonarian Ccelenterate of the genus
lleailla, which was new to us.         On the two following days we crossed

                from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video.                 625
the    shallow-water   plateau, and on the 28th we sounded and trawled in
1 900    fathoms    over the ledge;.    A serial temperature-sounding gave a
bottom-temperature of 0°-0C., l°-0 at 1725 fathoms, 3°-0 at 600
fathoms, and 20° at 50 fathoms (Curve 323, Plate 29). The trawl was not
 very successful, but it brought up a few things of some interest ; among
thern an example of a small sea-urchin, of which we had previously taken
 single specimens at widely distant stations, off the coast of Nova Scotia",
near Gomera Island, near New Zealand, and near Japan. The bottom
 was chiefly river-mud with very little carbonate of lime.
     On the following day we sounded in 2800 fathoms, and again lowered
 the trawl. The bottom was a greyish mud, with little or no carbonate of
 lime, and the bottom-temperature was — 0o-4 C. The trawl-line parted
 near the ship in heaving in.
     On the 1 st of March we proceeded on our course, and on the 2nd we
  sounded in 2650 fathoms, with a bottom of grey mud and a bottom-tem
 perature of 0o,4 C.      The trawl was put over, and a series of temperature
  observations was taken to 1500 fathoms.          (Curve No. 325, Plate 29.)
  This sounding is very instructive ; the isothermobath of 3° C. is found at
 600 fathoms, so that we have a mass of water at a lower temperature
 2000 fathoms     in thickness  ; 2°-5 C. occurs at 1900 fathoms, and zero at
 2400.    The very marked hump of the curve extending from a depth of 125
 fathoms to a depth of 255, and corresponding with the wide spaces between
 the isothermobaths of 15° C. and 6° C. on Plate 28, evidently indicates the
 position and volume of the Brazil current, the southern deflection of the
 equatorial current after its bifurcation at Cape St. ltoque. The trawl came
 up containing an unusually large number of organisms for this depth,
 including two specimens of an undescribed species of Eupleetella, some
 corals, several Echinoderms illustrating three of the orders, some beautiful
 examples of a species of Shjlifer commensal on one of the Holothurians,
 and several fishes.
     Next day we sounded in 2775 fathoms, and took temperature-sound
 ings.    This series (Curve 326, Plate 29) presented a marked difference
  from that of the previous day. All the lines from that of l°-5 C. had
  risen most palpably, most of them between 100 and 200 fathoms.
  Even the surface participated in the fall of temperature, having sunk
  from 21°-6 C. to 19°-9. This is evidently a space in the Brazil current
  occupied by colder water, like the peculiar cold interdigitations which are
  so marked in the Gulf-stream.        The position of this sounding was lat.
  37° 3' S., long. 44° 17' W. A serial temperature-sounding on the follow
  ing day, at a distance of 80 miles to the eastward, where the depth
  was 2900 fathoms and the bottom-temperature — 0°-3 C, showed by the
  sinking of all the isothermobaths     that we had again entered the normal
  flow of the Brazil current.
     On the 6th of March it was blowing hard from the S.W. with a heavy sea.
  We sounded in 2900 fathoms, with a bottom of grey mud and a bottom
                                                                2x2

temperatures   of — 0o-3 C.   ; but the weather was too boisterous to admit of
a serial temperature-sounding.        On the 7th tha ssa was more moderate,
 and we sounded in 2i75 fathoms, with a bottom-temperature of — 0°-6C.,
 and took the temperature scries represented by Curve 329 (Plate 30).
 The bottom was again a very fine grey or slightly reddish mud, almost
 free from calcic carbonate ; samples of water were obtained for specific-
 gravity determinations and analysis down to 2000 fathoms.
    On the 8th of March we sounded in 2440 fathoms, with               a b .-ttom of
 light red mud, and    a bottom-temperaturo      of  — 0o-3C.  ;  and   on the 9th,
 somewhat to our surprise, we sounded in 1715 fathoms, with a bottom
 of " Olobigerina-ooze" and a temperature of 10-3C. The sea was heavy,
 and trawliug-operations        wero consequently rather difficult ; the trawl
 was lowered, however, on account of the remarkable shallowness of the
 sounding ; but it unfortunately came up foul, and the observation was
 lost
    It seems that this sounding      was on the central meridional rise which
 separates the western from the eastern trough of the Atlantic at a depth
 apparently nowhere much beyond 2000 fathoms, near its western edge.
 As usual, the lower isothermobathic         lines  showed a tendency to rise
 slightly in the shallower water.
    On   the 10th the morning was misty and raining, with the wind
 northerly, shifting to the southward towards noon. We sounded in
 2200 fathoms, " Olobigerina-ooze," with a bottom-temperature of +0°-4G.
 The trawl    was put over  ;   but on being recovered, it was found to have
 been down on its back, and it contained only a few fragments of one or
 two sponges. Crustaceans, and Echinoderms.
    We ran on during the 11th and 12th, and on the 13th we sounded on
 " Olobigerinn-oozo " at a depth of 2025 fathoms, with a bottom-tempera
 ture of l°-2 C.   The trawl again     came up empty and reversed, some        frag
 ments adhering to the net, showing that there was a varied fauna, and
 that much interesting material must have been got from a successful haul.
    The position    of the sounding on the 14th was lat. 35° 45' S., long.
 18° 3'  W.    the depth was 1915 fathoms, the bottom
                                                             "

 and the bottom-temperature l°-5 C, the distance from Tristan d'Acunha
 310 miles.     The trawl came up again foul, with only some fragments to
 indicate the presence of an abundant fauna.         As we had already crossed
 our outward track in 1873, and as the temperatures at depths unin
 fluenced by the changes of the seasons seemed to verify in every way our
former work, we thought it unnecessary to go further to the eastward on
the direct line, and we took a north-easterly course towards a point in
the meridian of the Island of Ascension, which was distant from us about
1085 miles.
    We ran on next day, and on the lGth the position of the ship was
lat. 32° 24' S., long. 13° 5' W., 1470 miles almost due south of Ascension,
and 280 miles north by west of Tristan d'Acunha.

     "We sounded in 1425 fathoms on " Globigerina-ooze," with a bottom-
temperature of 2°-3 C. The trawl had failed so frequently of late, that
we determined to send down instead a large light dredge, which we had
had made at Hong-Kong for the shallow-water sponge-producing seas of
the Philippines. It came up with scarcely any ooze, and with only a
small number of animal species ; but among them were many very perfect
specimens of the rare little sea-urchin, Salenia varispina.       It is singular
that although there were a large number of hempen tangles attached to
the dredge, and they seemed to have done their work well, none of the
Bryozoa so characteristic of moderate depths, with a bottom of " Olobi-
gerina-ooze," in the Atlantic were taken on this occasion.               In the
evening we made sail due north.
     This portion of the voyage divides       itself into two parts with very
different conditions — the nearly meridional passage from the Falkland
 Islands to Monte Video, a distance of 1100 miles ; and the line from
Monte Video to Station 335, a little to the south of the parallel of 35° S.
for a distance of 2100 miles.
      Between Stanley and Monte Video four observing-stations               were
established, numbered on the charts and diagrams from 317 to 320. Two
of these were in comparatively shallow water near the edge of, but still
upon, the plateau which extends from the coast of South America to a
distance of nearly 400 miles, and includes the Falkland Islands ; the two
remaining soundings, 318 and 319, were well beyond the cliff of the pla
teau at depths greater than 2000 fathoms.         The shallow- water soundings
 were upon hard ground ; in the two others the bottom was a greyish mud,
 to a great extent composed of land detritus.         All these soundings, the
 two deep ones particularly, indicate the presence of a great underlying
 mass of cold water, the isothermobath of 2° C. occurring at Station 318
 at a depth of 125 fathoms.     At Station 319 the 2°-C. line is at 1100
 fathoms, and the other isothermobaths up to 5° C. show a corresponding
 rise.   I attribute this remarkable difference between two soundings so
 near one another to the banking of the cold water against the submarine
 cliff by the Brazil current ; sounding 118 seems to have fallen directly
            "
upon the cold wall."
     At the deeper sounding (319) the thermometer fell, for the first time
in our experience in the South Atlantic, below the freezing-point ; but the
 relations of this very low bottom-temperature will be better understood
 when we come to consider the section between Monte Video and Tristan
d'Acunha.
     On the line between Monte Video and Station 335, fifteen observing-
 stations were established.    The first three of these, 321 to 323, were on
the estuary of the Biver Plate, or (323) just beyond the edge of the delta
 at its mouth ; the next seven, 324 to 330, gave a section     of  a wide  inlet
 into the western     trough of the South Atlantic with      a mean depth     of
  2750 fathoms ; and the remaining     five stations, 331 to 335, were on the

central rise, with an average depth of 1850 fathoms.                  The mean bottom-

temperature of the seven deep soundings is
soundings    on   the  rise 10,3  C.  ;  the   isothermobath     of 0o,0 C. is at a depth
averaging 2400 fathoms, a depth which it never much exceeds except
where the cold water rises against the American coast, as at Stations 319
and 323 ; it therefore occurs in the line of the seven deep soundings only:
and there it forms the upper limit of a mass of water with a temperature
below zero, 320 square miles in section.                Perhaps the isothermobath of
l°-5 G. may fairly be taken as the upper limit of the very cold water :
the section of the Antarctic indraught below that temperature is here
about 800 square miles.          (The transverse section of the Gulf- stream i?
about 0 square miles ; there is no volume of water at all in the Labrador
current, below      l°-5 C. opposite Halifax, that temperature                being  only
found at the bottom.)
   The isothermobaths         of 2°,     2°-5,   3°, and 4° C. are very constant       it
1500, 900,     GOO,  and 400 fathoms respectively for all the stations on the
                                               " cold wall," where all the lower tem
parallel except Station 323 on the
perature-lines are at a much higher level, and at the shallow sounding
at Station 331, where all the liues below that of 4° C. rise slightly.                We
must be    careful,   however,    not   to  attach    too  much    importance to slight
deviations of the colder lines.            On the scale used in Plates 26, 28, 32,
and 33, the mean interval between the isothermobaths of 2° and 3' C.
in the Atlantic is 1000 fathoms ; so that a rise or fall of 100 fathoms,
which    is very prominent on such diagrams, actually represents only
one tenth of a Centigrade degree, an amount very small in itself, and,
it must be remembered, entirely within the limit of error of obser
vation   with    a deep-sea thermometer            ;  it is only where there is a con
cordance among several lines in such a              rise or fall that the indication is
of any real value.
   The mean temperature of the surface of the water at the anchorage
at Monte Video was 22°-5 C. ; at Station 320, just before entering the
estuary, it was 19°-7 C. ; at Station 323, on the edge of the plateau, it rose
to 23° ; and a temperature of 20° C. or a little above it was maintained
up to Station 328, except at Station 326, which                 I have already referred
to as occupying a cold space.            After reaching Station 328 the tempera
ture began to sink, and only recovered its former height when we moved
northwards.
   The curves deduced from the serial temperature-soundings along this line
are represented in groups of four on Plates 29, 30, & 31. At Station 323
the temperature of the water fell rapidly and tolerably evenly, with only
a slight   prominence between 150 and 250 fathoms, to 5° C. at 350
fathoms    ; it then took a slower, but still a symmetrical sweep down to
zero at 1900 fathoms.         At Stations 324 and 325 the lines fell, with still
only  a slight protuberance       in the same position as before, to 3° C. at 600
fathoms, when they sank very slowly to 1° C. at 2000 fathoms, and then

               from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video.                    629
again a little more rapidly to — 0o-4 at the bottom.        At the next Station
(320)   all the   upper  temperatures   were   remarkably    low, corresponding
                 "
with the cold interdigitation" in the Brazil current.          Stations 328 and
329 repeat Stations 324 and 325 with little variation ; at the three Sta
tions 330, 331, and 332 there was a most marked hump on the curves,
occupying roughly the space between 150 and 250 fathoms ; and at the
three succeeding stations, 333, 334, aud 335, the hump wore out and
finally disappeared.
   The high surface-temperatures      between the mouth of the Eiver Plate
and Station 328 are doubtless due to solar radiation        (early autumn tem
perature) phis the additional warmth of the Brazil current, which is
logged from the 29th of February to the 10th of March as running in a
generally southerly direction at an average rate of 20 miles a day. The
rapid fall for the first 150 fathoms represents mainly the loss of the heat
due to direct radiation, which does not affect the curve to a depth much
greater than 100 fathoms ; and the hump from 150 to 250 fathoms re
presents the extra effect of the current, which appears to have there an
average depth of 250 fathoms ; it seems, however, not to be very con
stant, either in volume, direction, or rate.
   To recapitulate briefly the more important points with regard to the
distribution of temperature : —
   1. The section between Monte Video and the meridian of Tristan
d'Acunha includes, besides the soundings on the South-American plateau
and the sounding on the
                             " cold wall," a series of soundings in a western
trough with an average depth of 2750 fathoms and an average bottom-
temperature of — 0o-4 C. ; and a series of soundings on the middle bank
of the Atlantic, with an average depth of 1850 fathoms and a mean bot
tom-temperature of l0-3 C.
   2. In the trough a huge mass of Antarctic water at temperatures
ranging from l°-5 C. to — 0o,6 C. is creeping northwards at depths
greater than 1800 fathoms ; on the rise very little water at a lower tem
perature than l°-5 C. passes northward ; but that is only on account of
the absence of the required depth, for the isothermobaths of 10,5 and 2°
C. are practically   at the same level over the central plateau and over the
trough.
   3. On the surface a warm current, perhaps about 800 miles wide, and
affecting the temperature of the water to a depth of 250 fathoms, con
tinuous to the northward with the southerly deflection of a part of the
equatorial current, passes to the southward, taking a slightly easterly
direction on account of its higher initial velocity.
   4. As a rule, the temperature falls rapidly throughout the section to
a temperature of 3° C. at 600 fathoms, and then extremely slowly to
the bottom.
   "We had always attached special importance       to the temperature-sound
ings on this   section, for we  had  expected  them  to throw some additional

 C30      Prof. W. Thomson on the Voyage of the ' Challenger'
 light upon the observations taken in the "West Atlantic in the year 1*73.
These seemed at first sight to present certain anomalies ; thus in our
somewhat hurried run from Bahia to Tristan d'Acunha, we appeared to
have missed the source of supply of water at an unusually low tempen-
ture which we found near the island of Fernando Jsoronha.            The rack
has  fully justified our anticipations.
    Diagram A, Plate 32, represents the vertical distribution of tempe-
rature at Station 112, lat. 3° 33' S., long. 32° 16' W., 21 miles to the
N.E. of Fernando Noronha. Diagram B gives the temperatures at
Station 129, lat, 20° 12' S., long. 35° 19' W., nearly halfway between A
and C, which represents the distribution of temperature at Station 327,
one of the most characteristic in the section at present under considera
tion. The depth at Station 327 is 2900 fathoms, and the depths at the
two other stations 2150 and 2200 respectively ; and it will be seen that
at the latter stations the bottom-temperatures         correspond almost pre
cisely with the temperature at Station 327 at like depths. The isothermo-
bath of 2° C. is at the same height, 1500 fathoms, at the two southern
stations ; and at the northern station only, near the equator, it sinks to
1800 fathoms.      The isothermobaths of 2°-5 and 3° C. correspond almost
exactly in level at Stations B and C ; at Station A all the isothermobathii
lines under that of 4° C. down to the line of 1° C. are much lower than
at Stations B and C ; that is to say, that at the equator between 4s C.
and 1° C. the water is considerably warmer than it is further soath.
The isothermobathic lines of 4° and 5° C. seem everywhere in the
Atlantic to mark broadly the line of demarcation between the upper
zone!   where the temperatures are obviously affected by the diffusion        of
water by wind-currents, and the lower zone, where the temperatures           are
continuous    with those of the Southern Sea. In the North Atlantic they
are markedly lower than they are to the south of the equator ; that is to
say, there is a much larger body of water above them heated by con
duction, convection, and mixture.
    I have  given in Plate 33 a general diagrammatic scheme of the verti
cal distribution of temperature in the western trough of the Atlantic,
constructed     from our serial temperature-soundings       in the years 1S73
and 1876. The diagram extends from lat. 42° S. to lat. 42° N., and in
cludes &3 its southern limit the banking up of the Antarctic indraught
                                                                  "
against the South-American coast, and as its northern the cold wall
of the Labrador current.        This Plate seems scarcely to require mwb
comment ; but there are one or two points to which            I would wish to
direct attention.
    At Station 327,  so often referred to as a typical sounding on our present
line, there is a mass of water 400 fathoms thick at a temperature below
zero.    Station 131, 600 miles south of Martin Vas, is on the edge ot the
central plateau, with a depth of 2275 fathoms and a bottom-temperature
of 0°-7 C; the deep passage therefore probably lies, if it have not

                 from the Falkland Islands     to Monte Video.                631
already come to an end, between long. 280,9 W. and the coast of
America.
     The distribution of the lower temperatures is much the same at station
131 as it is at station 327, the isothermobaths sinking slightly. At
station 129, which is right in the middle of what may be supposed to be
the direction of the current, the depth is 2150 fathoms, and the tempe
rature 0-6 C. ; the cold-water trough has therefore probably stopped
before reaching this point ; all the belts of water at given low tempe
ratures are evidently continuous, although the isothermobaths of 3° 0.
and. 2°-5 C. are now sinking rapidly. The accumulation of water above
3° C. in temperature is still more apparent at Station 112, nearly under
the    equator.
     The next station, No. 15, is the first of a series of rather deep sound
                                                    "
 ings taken after crossing the "Dolphin Rise (the central bank of the
 Atlantic) on our voyage from Teneriffe to Sombrero in 1873.                  The
 deepest of these soundings are a little      above   3000 fathoms     ; and they
 look from their position very much as       if they were in the axis of the
 Antarctic indraught ; but the temperature in no case falls below l°-3 C. ;
 and, tracing southwards, we find that a belt of shallow soundings (not
 more than 2000 fathoms) extends from the central plateau about lat.
 21° N., long. 40° 30' W., to the coast of South America, somewhere
 about Cape Orange.       Going northwards, we encounter much greater
 depths, but no temperatures lower than l°-3 C. ; the whole mass of water
 to the very bottom rises steadily, though only slightly, to the northward,
  the merely local depression, which never reaches l°-3 C. along the line of
  the Labrador current, being scarcely worth mention.          It is evident that
  the water of the Atlantic is not generally affected by an indraught from
  the Arctic Sea. The diagram (Plate 33) shows very well the effect on the
  relative positions of the isothermobathic lines of the rapid removal of
  the warm surface-water over the region of the equatorial current and
  counter- current in the gathering up of the higher lines near the equator,
  and of the curl of the warm water to the north and south as the Gulf-
  stream and the Brazil current after the bifurcation of the equatorial
  current, in the depression of the isothermobaths of 20°, 15°, and 10° C.
  to the north and south of the equatorial region.
     The causes of the very perceptible rise in temperature of the whole
  mass of the water of the North Atlantic will require further investiga
              I
  tion. As have said elsewhere,      I am inclined to attribute it mainly to
  the banking in and accumulation of the northern reflux of the equatorial
  current, and its gradual mixture with the water beneath ; and it seems
  to me that this cause is adequate to the effect.     Still, even if this be so,
   we have to discover how that mixture takes place ; and as there appears
   reason to believe that evaporation is in excess of precipitation in the
   Atlantic, it seems almost certain that differences in specific gravity and

682        Prof. W. Thomson on the Voyage of the ' Challenger'
other causes    come   into play, though   not very obviously. It is most
probably   a phenomenon of considerable complexity.
  I will   not refer to the thermal conditions of the eastern trough of the
Atlantic    at present ; they are somewhat different, and will require
separate   illustrations after we have recrossed the basin, which we hope
to do in the next six weeks.
  To recapitulate the general facts and conclusions with regard             to the
distribution of ocean temperatures in the western trough of the Atlantic
it seems to me : —
   1. That this trough (and the Atlantic as a w^hole) must be regarded in
the light of an inlet or gulf of the general ocean of the " water hemi
sphere," opening directly from the
                                    " Southern Sea."
   2. That the water of the Southern       Sea simply wells up into the
Atlantic, and that all the temperature bands of the Western Atlantic are
essentially continuous with like temperature bands in the Southern Sea,
with these modifications : — that (a) above a certain line, which may be
roughly represented by the isothermobathic lines of 5° and 4° C. the
temperature of the water is manifestly affected by direct radiation and
by the very complicated effects, direct and indirect, of wind-current* ;
and (b) that the whole mass of under-water gradually and uniformly
rises in temperature towards the head of the gulf.
   3. That water at any given temperature (below 4°            C.) can only occur
in the Atlantic where there is a direct communication           with the zone at
water at the same temperature              in the Southern Sea without the inter
vention of any continuous barrier.      (The actual result of the present
arrangement of such barriers         is,
                                    that, however great the depth may be,
no water at a temperature lower than 1°"3         found to the north of the
                                                         is
equator, and no water below the freezing-point in any part of the
trough except in the depression already described between the month               of
the River Plate and Tristan dAcunha.)
    4. That the water of the Atlantic       not sensibly affected in tempe
                                                is
rature  by any cold indraught from the Arctic Sea.         purposely neglect
                                                              (I
the Labrador current and the small branch of the Spitsbergen current              ;
for these certainly do not sensibly affect the general temperatures         of
                                                                          the
North Atlantic.)*
    5. That although there  is   considerable flow of surface-water through
                                 a
the influence of wind-currents from the Atlantic into the Southern Sea, that
 flow does not seem to be sufficient to balance the influx into the basin        of
the Atlantic (the constant influx being proved by the maintenance            of  a
general uniformity in the course of the isothermobathic lines, and          by
                                                                          the
maintenance in all the secondary basins of the minimum temperature due
to the height of their respective barriers)    that for several reasons (the
                                                     ;
lower barometric pressure and the supposed greater amount of rainfall            in
the Southern Sea, the higher specific gravity at the surface than at greater

               from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video.                  633
depths ia the Atlantic, the higher specific gravity of the surface-water in
the Atlantic to the north than to the south of the equator), it is probable
that the general circulation is kept up chiefly by an excess of evaporation
in the region of the North Atlantic, balancing       a corresponding   excess
of precipitation over evaporation in the water hemisphere.
    Determinations of the specific gravity of the surface-water have been
made daily.      The mean of these for the section between Stations 323 and
335, the temperature reduced to 15°-56 C., is 1-02620. Of the eighteen
days occupied in running the section nine were dry and fine, and on
nine rain fell either continuously or in showers. The mean for the nine
dry days is 1-02630, and for the nine wet days 1-02591. The maximum
surface specific- gravity for the section (1-02680) was at Station 323, at
the point where probably the Brazil current has most effect on the surface,
and the minimum (1-02494) was at Station 326 after a heavy fall of rain.
The mean specific gravity of the surface-water        at the temperature    at
which it was procured was 1-02502.
    The specific gravity of the bottom-water was determined at ten
stations on the section. Jteduced to a temperature of 15°-56 C, the
mean     was 1-02601   ; the maximum,    1-02650, was at Station     323 at a
depth of 1900 fathoms     ; and the minimum, 1-02580, was at Station 326 at
2775 fathoms.       The mean specific gravity of the bottom-water at the
depth at which it was procured was 1-02811, showing a difference be
tween the two means of 0-00210, due to difference of temperature alone.
    It seems  from these observations that the differences of surface spe
cific gravity due to differences of salinity along the section are very small,
and that, with the exception possibly of station 323, which is abnormal
in many respects, they depend mainly on the rainfall.
    The difference between the mean surface specific gravity, the tempe
rature reduced to 15°-50 C, and the mean bottom specific gravity under
the same conditions is also very slight ; the actual specific gravity at every
point is practically determined by the temperature ; and consequently
the bands of equal density are, like the bands of equal temperature,
 virtually continuous with those of the Southern Sea.
    There seems to be little doubt that the specific gravity of the surface-
water is considerably higher in the North Atlantic than it is on the
 present section. On one section between Teneriffe and Sombrero, in
 1S73, Mr. Buchanan found the mean specific gravity at the surface (the
 temperature     reduced to 15°-56 C.) to be nearly 1-02760 ; from the
 sin-face it fell rapidly to 1-0260, at a depth of about 600 fathoms, after
 which it remained nearly the same to the bottom.
     Throughout the whole of this section the trawling-operations have
 been singularly unsuccessful.     Out of ten trials in depths over 1000
 fathoms only four produced any thing like satisfactory results ; and this
 was the more unaccountable, as the comparatively moderate depths of
 most of them were such as usually to make the process almost certain.

I
    In  many cases, however, even when the line parted or the trawl came up
   foul, fragments sufficient were preserved to show that the fauna of tie
   region was by no means deficient.
      The first successful trawl was at a depth of 600 fathoms, on the edge of
   the South-American plateau.       As at most places where we have had >
   fair opportunity of working at such depths, the number of       species   pro
   cured was very large.     Sponges were abundant, including a large ncm-
   ber of corticate forms, and several specimens of a species of the fine
  hexactinellid   genus Eossella, identical with or very closely allied    to R.
   antarctica, so common at Kerguelen.       I  have already referred     to the
   large Pennatulids and to the remarkable corals belonging to the        family
   Stylasteridas, a group which Mr. Moseley, in an important paper which
   I  beg to submit along with this, has determined        to belong, with the
   Milleporidve, to the Htdeozoa,    and not to the  Anthozoa,    as previously
   supposed.
       All the orders   of Echinodermata    were  well represented. Bryoaa
   were abundant, and included      fine masses  of Tubulipora, Idimnm. and
    Cellepora, such as are found in like depths off the west coast of Ireland
   Numerous crustaceans occurred, among them large species of Arrtmt,
   of Gammarus, and of other genera, recalling the northern crustaceous
   fauna, along with species of Serolis and markedly southern Schizopois.
   Mollusca were, as usual, few ; there were two or three fishes of deep-
  water types.
       The next   trawling-station was on the 28th of February in 1900
   fathoms (No. 323) ; the number of species was not so great as on the
   previous occasion, but the different groups were fairly represented. We
   got here a single stem only of Rhizocrimis lofotensis, one of the rare
   crinoids belonging to the Apiocrinida;. "We have been unfortunate in never
   having found perfect specimens of this pretty little species, although
  fragments have come up frequently at widely separated stations.
      Bryozoa were abundant, of more characteristic deep-water types than
   on the last occasion.   There were two species of deep-water fishe? be
   longing to the Macruridse.    At Station 325 the depth was 2650 fathoms,
   and the number of species procured was, as 1 have already mentioned,
  unusually large for so great a depth. The assembly of forms was of the
  usual deep-sea character.     There were a considerable number of species
   of Fungia symmetrica, a generally distributed deep-sea coral ; and the
  specimens at this station were of a much larger size than we had
  previously met with. There were many Echinoderms, including several
  species of a singular group of Holothuridee, allied in some respects to
  Psoitis, which we find widely distributed at great depths ; they are prin
  cipally characterized by an almost continuous calcareous plating, which
  runs out over long, tubular, spine-like appendages.
      The next three trawlings were unsuccessful ; and at Station 33o, on
  the 16th of March, we determined to try a large light dredge. This was

                    from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video.                                                                                                                      635
dragged along the bottom freely for a considerable distance ; and although
the number of species procured  was  small, we thought ourselves fortunate
in securing fine examples of Cidciris varispina.
   The following Table gives the general distribution of the principal
animal groups at the different stations between the Falkland Islands and

        OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Sir "William Edmond Logan was born at Montreal on the 20th
of April, 1798. His education was commenced at Montreal, where he
remained until, in 1814, he was sent to the High School of Edinburgh. In
1818 he was taken into the house of his uncle, Mr. Hart Logan, a
merchant in London ; but, in 1829, after a short visit to Canada, he
accepted the management of a copper-smelting work at Swansea.
   His attention was soon attracted to the geology of the district,
especially to the Coal-measures of the great South-Wales Coal-field,
of the western half of which he constructed, entirely at his own
cost, a geological map, on the scale of 1 inch to a mile, with hori
zontal sections on a scale of 6 inches to a mile, and vertical sections on a
Bcale of 40 feet to an inch.        While engaged in this work he dis
covered the true relation     of the clays charged with Stigmaries     under
lying   eachbed of coal, and proved them to be the soil on which the
plants, afterwards turned into coal, had grown.     In 1840 he com
municated this discovery to the Geological Society. This work was so
completely and accurately executed, that when Mr. De la Beche began
the Government Geological Survey of that area he adopted the whole of
it,which Mr. Logan generously handed over to him for the benefit of the
Survey  ;and the sections became in   measure the models on which all the
                                       a
Coal-measure sections of the Survey were afterwards constructed. Having
given up his connexion with the copper-works, Mr.Logan was appointed by
the Colonial Government, in 1843, to organize and carry on     Geological
                                                                 a
Survey of Canada, his native country, with which his family had long been
connected   ;and this work, by his own labours and the help of his assistants,
he carried on as   Director of the Survey till the year 1869, when, in con
sequence    of increasing years, he resigned the appointment, and Mr.
Selwyn, now one of the Fellows of this Society, was appointed as his
successor. The admirable geological work that he did in Canada, and the
beautiful geological maps and sections thereby produced, are well known
to the geological world for he not only unravelled and laid down on
                         ;
maps all the complicated Devonian, Silurian, and Huronian rocks of          a
vast region, but he first discovered underneath all these the true strati-
graphical relations of the Laurentian series, which had previously been
vaguely termed granites.   He thus showed that they consisted of two great
divisions, the Lower Laurentian gneiss and the Upper Laurentian gneiss,
which lies quite unconformably on the lower Beries, both of them con
taining thick interstratified beds of crystalline limestone.

     While engaged in this work    he discovered,  in one of the bands of lime
stone belonging to the Lower Laurentian series, the oldest known fossil,
Eozoon canadense, the structure of which has since been made the subject
of elaborate memoirs by Dr. Dawson, of Montreal, and Dr. Carpenter,
who consider it to belong to the Foraminifera.         The subject was and is
of high importance in geology, and at the time of the discovery excited
much interest among geologists and biologists.
    In 1S51 Mr. Logan was eleeted a Fellow of the Eoyal Society : in 1S56
the honour of knighthood was conferred on him, in recognition of his
great services to geology ; and the award of the Wollaston Medal by the
Geological Society, in the same year, and of a Eoyal Medal by the Boyal
Society in lbG7, marked the esteem in which his scientific achievements
were held.       Among other distinctions he was LL.D., F.G.S., and Vice-
President of the Natural-History Society of Montreal.
     Sir "William Logan died on the 22nd of June, 1875, at Castle Malgwyn,
in the house of his sister, Mrs. Gower, in his 77th year ; and it may truly
be said of him     that no man was ever more esteemed and beloved by a
numerous circle of friends.
     By .the death of Daniel Hanbtot the Society        has lost a very learned
 and highly cultivated pharmacologist, who had for some years occupied
 one of the first places among the scientific men of Europe.            Besides
 advancing the science of pharmacy by his numerous writings, he led
 the way     in promoting   a scientific education among druggists, in con
 ducting examinations in London which greatly improved their status,
 in promoting the welfare of the Pharmaceutical Society, and in organi
 sing those pharmaceutical conferences, of which he was twice the Presi
 dent, that meet annually at the time and place of meeting of the        British
 Association.
     Mr. Hanbury will     be best  known to posterity by the work, brought
  out shortly before his death by        Dr. Fliickiger and himself, entitled
  " Pharmacographia : a History of .Drugs," which may be regarded as a
  monument of his profound knowledge and great capacity. His published
  papers, more than sixty in number, dating from 1850, are all original
  investigations into the origin, history, botanical and chemical characters,
  names, uses, and commercial value of drugs ; and it may bo said of
  them that, in point of accuracy and scientific method, they are perfect.
  Hence but few readers have ventured to criticise his statements, so well
  and widely known was his caution and his mastery of all the subjects
 on which he wrote.
      Nor were his scientific labours confined to the library and labora
  tory ; he travelled much, not for commercial objects, but in pursuit
  of pharmaceutical information, and always with one definite object of
   inquiry, to which all others were subsidiary.        He journeyed in Syria
  with Dr. Hooker in 18G0, and made many visits to Middle and Southern

                                       iii
France and the Mediterranean, during which he formed an extensive
acquaintance with men of science and foreign institutions, and with the
contents of their museums, libraries, botanic gardens, and drug-stores ;
and he contemplated, for the same purpose, a visit to India, which,
but for his untimely death, would have been undertaken, for he was a
man who never spoke of intentions which he had not predetermined to
fulfil.
   Mr. Hanbury was born on September 11, 1825, and was the eldest son
of Daniel Bell Hanbury, Esq., of the firm of Allen, Hanburys, and Barry,
of Plough Court, Lombard Street, of which firm Daniel was himself a
partner till a few years before his death, when he retired to .devote him
self to the favourite pursuit of his life.    To his other accomplishments
he added the skill of a water-colour artist, and his works are distin
guished by accuracy of drawing and truthfulness of colouring.        He was
familiar with several European languages, was a facile manipulator,
distinguished for the completeness of his collections, the perfection of
his pharmaceutical museum, and the amount of information embodied in
the notes that accompanied his own specimens and those he so liberally
distributed to scientific institutions and individuals.    He was a member
of the Society of Friends, a Fellow and Treasurer of the Linnean Society,
in which he took an active interest, and a Fellow of the Chemical Society.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1867, and was a member
of its Council at the date of his death, which took place at Clapham,
March 24, 1875, of typhoid fever, supervening on an attack of inflam
mation.
    Gustat Bose, born on the 18th of March, 1798, was the youngest of
the four sons of Valentin Rose, Assessor of the Ober Collegium Medicum
at Berlin, and brother of the illustrious chemist, Heinrich Bose.         He
lost his father early.   An excellent mother guided the education of the
four sons, whose youth fell in a hard and laborious time. All four
brothers served their country in the war of liberation.        Gustav, only
seventeen years old at the time of the battle of Waterloo, was not in any
engagement, but made the long march under arms from Berlin to Orleans.
He began life as a mining engineer, but was attacked by an inflammation
of the lungs.     The scientific pursuits to which he devoted himself during
his recovery, as well as the intercourse with his brother Heinrich, induced
him to give up his engineering pursuits and to devote himself entirely to
science.    He went to Stockholm and worked under Berzelius.         In 182G
he was appointed Extraordinary Professor of Mineralogy, and in 1839
Ordinary Professor at Berlin, and, after the death of Weiss, Director of
the Boyal Mineralogical Museum at Berlin.          For the sake of making
 scientific observations he travelled through a wide expanse of country —
 Scandinavia, England and Scotland, Italy and Sicily, France and Austria.
 In the year 1829 he travelled with Von Humboldt and Ehrenberg to the
                                                                a2

 Ural, the Altai, and the Caspian         Sea and the boundary of China.           This
journey    laid  the  foundation   of the  knowledge    of  the  Mineralogy     of  the
extensive Kussian Empire.           His researches in Germany were devoted to
the Silesian mountains.
    G. Hose was the first     in his own country who determined accurately the
angles of crystals with the aid of the reflecting goniometer.             He took an
important    part   in the labours   which   led Mitscherlich    to the  discovery   of
isomorphism.        His labours embrace every department of Mineralogy               —
crystalline forms and their combinations, the physics of crystallography,
the chemical composition and the artificial production of minerals, and
the art of crystallographic drawing.           The knowledge of the association
of minerals in rocks (petrography) was founded by him, as he was one
of the first who taught how, with the aid of the microscope, to investigate
the minerals invisible to the eye in a very thin polished plate of stone.
    He applied himself with especial delight to the study of Meteorites,
those wonderful bodies which fall on the earth out of the depths of space.
The structure of the iron meteorites, the mineralogical constitution of
the stony meteorites revealed themselves to his acute research.             His mind
busied   itself  perpetually   with  the  extraordinary    difference   between the
formation of the stony matter in those cosmic masses and in the solid
crust of the earth.        It is truly remarkable that his most beautiful
 mineralogical discoveries were not made in operating upon rare minerals,
 but upon such as exist in all collections, and of which many have been ex
 posed to observation before. To these belong the distinctions of the forms
 of quartz and its various twins; the crystallization of pyrites, sought after
 by many in vain.        The secret of making such discoveries consisted in
 this, that he never sought after the form alone, but always contem
 plated the totality of the physical appearances.          During the last year of
 his life his inquiring thoughts were especially directed to the diamond.
  Few mineralogists are capable of conjecturing that the diamond in its
 form yet exhibits perplexities.         So occupied was he with this problem,
 that he dictated to one of his sons the results of this last intellectual
 labour only fo*r-and-twenty hours before his end.
    He saw his best friends and truest companions of his labours,                Mit
 scherlich, Magnus, Haidinger, and above all his brother Heinrich, called
 away from their work.         Their departure and his increasing solitude filled
 him with sorrow. Tet he derived consolation from the reflection how much
 science had been promoted by his departed friends.             In the year 1870 he
 celebrated his Doctor's     Jubilee, having in this year completed the half
 century    of  his  teaching career. He never sought distinction, though
 many honours fell to his share. When created a Knight of the Order
 " Pour la Merite," the honour appeared to him to             be almost    too great.
 Imperishable is the remembrance which Gustav Rose has                    left behind
 him in Science ; though not imperishable yet more touching is the
 remembrance which he has left behind him in the hearts of all with whom

he    was acquainted.        In his   science and in the many sided relations of
his    life he had no enemy, no opponent.         To live in peace and friendship,
which       is often difficult for the   best, was to him inevitable.         As his own
efforts were always directed to truth and goodness, he assumed the same
to be the case with others. In their efforts he saw nothing but good.
"When the deeds or words of others failed to meet his approbation, he
could not suppose there was a dishonourable motive for their conduct.
This  explains the fact that those who lived at variance with one another
united in respecting him. On the 11th of July, 1873, he gave a lecture.
Notwithstanding great weakness he wrote a long scientific letter in the
evening, and concluded with the words, " Eest will do us good : we will
go again to our old quarters at Friedrichshaf en ; would we were there                 !'*
Scarcely had he ended the letter when he was attacked by fit of shiver    a
ing, an indication of an inflammation of the lungs, which in less than
four days, on the 15th of July, closed his life, in the 76th year of his
age.
   Gustav Eose took an active part in the foundation of the " Deutsche
Geologische" Society, of which he was President from the year 1863
until his death and almost every volume of the Zeitschrift of that
                                                              '                    '

     Chbistopheb Hansteen was born at Christiania on the 26th September,
  1784.    He attended the Cathedral school of that city; and in the year
  1802 he entered the University of Copenhagen, where he studied first
  law and afterwards mathematics.        In 1800 he became       teacher of   a
  Mathematics in the Gymnasium of Fredericksburg in Zealand.         It was
  in the year 1807 that he began to take an interest in terrestrial magne
  tism and in 1812 he obtained the prize from the Eoyal Danish Academy
        ;
  of Sciences for his answer to the following question — "Is      necessary,
                                                                  :           it
  in order to explain facts in the earth's magnetism, to suppose more than
                                   "
  one magnetic axis in the earth         ?
     In the year 1814 he was appointed to the chair of Astronomy and
  Applied Mathematics in the University of Christiania, founded by
  Frederick IV. of Norway.
     In 1819 he published, at the expense of the King, his greatest work,
    Untersuchungen iiber den Magnetismus der Erde,' in       quarto volume
                                                                      a
 '
  of  650 pages.   It was illustrated with copper plates and an Atlas of
   magnetic charts, and also contained an abstract of the history of the

                                     vi
subject. This work was only preparatory to his great object.    He wished
to make a mathematical analysis of all the observations in the light of
Euler's theory of magnets ; and he strove to test Halley'sspeculations
as to the existence of four magnetic poles in the earth, and to give a
satisfactory answer to the critical problem presented by the Danish
Academy of Sciences.
•
  His Declination chart for 1787 was more accurate and    full than similar
charts already published by Halley, by Mountain and Dodson,        and by
Churchman.
  He decided that there were two magnetic poles in the northern and
two in the southern hemisphere ; and he inferred from the secular changes
in these lines that the northern magnetic poles were moving obliquely
towards the east, and those in the south towards the west.      He calcu
lated approximately  the period of complete revolution for each pole, and
called attention to the following coincidence, namely, that the shortest
time in which all the poles will return to the same relative position
agreed closely with the period of revolution in the precession of the
equinoxes.
  By the liberality of the Norwegian Government he was enabled to go
to Siberia, in company with Due and Erman, to search for the ideal
point of the Asiatic Pole of Magnetism.   They started from Berlin on
the 25th of   April, 1828, and reached Kiachta and Irkoutsk.   The Eussian
Government   offered every facility for the success of the expedition, and
the results were important.  Ten magnetic observatories were established
in the Eussian Empire by the recommendation of Humboldt, and great
results   were obtained by Gauss, Sabine, Lamont, and others from the
materials   collected by Hansteen and Erman.     Hansteen ascertained
beyond dispute the existence of a magnetic pole in Siberia supplementary
to that in British America, and also the biaxial character of the earth's
magnetism.
  Hansteen's  elaborate treatise on Terrestrial Magnetism contains a dis
cussion on the Isoclinic and Isodynamic lines, and on those of Declina
tion.     His Magnetic Atlas contained maps of dip and intensity.
   These observations have of course up to the present time been added
to in so far as the increased number of observations in tho Arctic and
•Antarctic regions, in the United States of America, and at the numerous
magnetic observatories have supplied more accurate and abundant data.
Tho work  has been described as a monument of industry, learning, and
mathematical skill.
  Soon after his Siberian expedition Hansteen prevailed upon the Nor
wegian Government to erect in Christiania an observatory fitted up for
Magnetic Observations, and he was appointed Director of this Institution.
  Hansteen reaffirmed the Decennial period as the result of 25 years of
observation in Christiania, changing      it,
                                      however, from 10 years to 11"33;
and the coincidence between this period and that of the solar spots has

                                    vii
since been reestablished  by Wolf, who, after prolonged attention to the
subject, proved the spot-period to be a little over 11 years. In 1837 the
Trigonometrical and Topographical Survey of Norway was commenced,
and Hansteen was placed at the head.
   In 1856, when he had completed his 50th year as a teacher of Science,
his jubilee was celebrated, and a medal struck in commemoration of it.
   In the year 1861 he retired from active work. His great work was
translated   into German soon after its publication ; and he also made
various contributions in that language to Schweigger's ' Journal,' to Pog-
gendorff s ' Annalen,' and to the ' Astronomischen Nachrichten.'
   He published some valuable contributions to Meteorology and Astro
nomy.
  He was     a member of the  American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
of the Academies of Paris, Berlin, and St. Petersburg, and a foreign mem
ber of the Eoyal Society.
   His death took place on the 11th of April, 1873.
   Charles EuoiifE Delaunay was born at Lusigny, in the Department of
the Aube, in the year 1816. He studied at the Ecole Polytechnique, of
which school he became a distinguished pupil.    In the year 1836 he
joined the Ecole des Mines.   While there he wrote several reports on
the Coal-seams of the Valley of St. Etienne and Creusot, as well as on
the principal iron and steel works of France, which were remarkable
for clearness of thought and skill in theoretical speculations ; and he
was still a pupil in the School when a proposal was made by his
former masters at the Ecole Polytechnique that he should be appointed
as Teacher of Geodesy in their school.       There were difficulties in the
way of this ; but the anxiety to obtain the benefit of the talents of young
Delaunay was so great that the Council of the school, at the head of which
was M. Cordier, gave their sanction to the arrangement, and Delaunay
was appointed.  He subsequently became a Professor in the Ecole Poly
technique, and later on also in the Ecole des Mines.     Prom the year
1845 to 1850, Delaunay held a Professorship in that section of the Ecole
des Mines which was specially devoted to the instruction of Engineers,
whether attached to the Corps des Mines or ihose connected with the
mining industry of France.  He had classes for descriptive Geometry,
Storeotomy, Machine drawing, Analytical Mechanics, and Elementary
Physics, and his teaching is said to have been most successful.   In   1850
Delaunay attached himself exclusively to the Ecole des Mines. He was
appointed to successive grades in the Corps des Mines, and became
Engineer in Chief in 1858.  In 1867 he was raised to the first class pf
his rank.
   His first memoir, " Sur la Distinction       Maxima et des Minima
                                              des
 dans les questions qui dependent de la Methode des Variations," was
 published in 1841 . Other important works followed     it,
                                                      on the Theory of

                                       viii
the Precession of the Equinoxes, Theory of the Motion of the Moon, ele
mentary treatises on Astronomy and Mechanics, and many miscellaneous
papers in the Comptes Sendus,' Connaissance des Temps,' and in the
                 '                     '
 Journal of the £cole Polytechnique. He was also the author of some
 excellent elementary books on astronomy and mechanics.       Soon, however,
 his attention became engaged by astronomical questions, and before long
 he was entirely absorbed by them.        He published an important treatise
 on the Theory of the Tides, and about the same time the question of the
 Lunar Theory began to occupy him.
     His greatest work, ' La Theorie de la Lnno ' (the first part of which
 occupied him fourteen years), was published in 1860 as an entire volume
 of ' MemoLres of the Academic des Sciences. It made his name famous
                 '
 among astronomers.      In 1862 the Royal Astronomical Society of London
 elected him one of their Associates ; and in February 1870 Professor J.
 C. Adams presented to him, in the name of the President, the Gold Medal
 of the Society, in acknowledgment of the high opinion of his work enter
 tained by English astronomers.
     During the same time he published a number of papers relating to the
 theory, one in particular on the secular acceleration of the mean motion
 of the moon, which was then a subject of much controversy.
                                            '
     The second volume of his ' Theorie appeared in 1867. The prepara
 tion of the Lunar Tables necessary for the completion of the work was
 undertaken by the Bureau des Longitudes, under the direction of
 Delaunay.     A government grant of funds was obtained for the pur
 pose, and the tables were in course of preparation at the time of his
 death.     It was uncertain whether the calculations were sufficiently
 advanced to bo carried on without him ; but M. Puiseau, Member of
 the Bureau des Longitudes, says, " Quoique l'auteur ne soit plus la pour
 y mettre la dernicre main, il ne sera sans doute pas impossible de terminer
 ce monument scientifique.        Esperons pour la gloire de lastronomie
 f rancaise que ce service sera rendu a la science, que ce supreme hommage
 ne manquera pas a notre illustre confrere."
     In the year 1854, when the administration of the observatory of Paris
 was separated from that of the Bureau des Longitudes, several of the
 members of its staff retired      to a house in the Rue Notre Dame des
 Champs, where they established a small observatory.         Delaunay occu
 pied  an  apartment in the same house, and there he      formed  a life-long
friendship with Mathieu and Laugier. It was there that he worked out
 most of his researches, seldom going out except to give his lessons at
 the ficole des Mines or the Sorbonne.         He often began work as early
 as five in the morning, and invariably continued until late in the evening.
 From this tranquil life    he  was called    away in 1870 by the Emperor
Napoleon the Third to       succeed  M.  Leverrier as Director of the Paris
 Observatory.      Many alterations and improvements had taken place in
the Observatory since the death of Arago, and Delaunay soon became

                                       ix
 convinced    o£  their importance.  But  he had not long been    installed in
 his new office when the terrible      war between France and Germany
 broke out  ;   and his whole time and attention were soon absorbed in the
 preservation of the observatory from the effects of a bombardment.        All
 the delicate instruments      were dismantled   and stowed   away and the
 observations suspended.       On the restoration of peace the observatory
 was soon restored to order and the observations were resumed.
    Feeling the great want of public and private observatories in France,
 Delaunay,     in conjunction with Leverrier, made an application to the
government for the establishment of a certain number of geodetical and
astronomical stations in different places. The observatories were to be
established according to plans arranged by Delaunay and the Bureau des
Longitudes.
    To Delaunay is owing the independence of the Observatory of Mar
seilles, which had hitherto been in connexion with the Paris Observatory,
also the foundation of one at Toulouse and the plan for one at Besancon.
His energies were devoted to making the Observatory of Paris the great
centre of astronomy in France. Shortly before his death he remarked,
" We are going to do many things. The Observatory intends to devote
all its energies to the reobservation of Lalande's Catalogue, to continue
the ecliptic star-charts commenced by Chacornac, to observations of
double stars ; and, finally, we are making preparations for new determi
nations of the longitude of Brest, Greenwich, and Neufchatel."
    He continued his observations of the minor planets during the second
half of the lunation with great success, excepting during the siege.
   Delaunay lost his wife a few years after his marriage.        He has left
one son, who is guardian of the Forests of Vitry le Frangais.        His aged
mother, to whom he had been a most devoted son, survived him.
    It remains only to relate the painful circumstance of his death.       On
Tuesday, July 30th, 1872, he left Paris in company with his cousin M.
Millot, Controller of the Post, for a few days holiday. On the following
Sunday he wrote from Bayeux that he intended spending a few days at
Cherbourg, and should return to Paris on the following Thursday. On
the Tuesday following a telegram was received in Paris announcing that
he and his cousin and two boatmen had been drowned by the upsetting
of a pleasure-boat in the roadstead of Cherbourg.       It is a singular fact
that both his father and brother perished by drowning.
   Delaunay was a member of the Academic des Sciences of the Institute
of France, and towards the close of his life had occupied the Chair. He
was a Doctor of Science, a member of several learned societies, and was
elected a foreign member of the Boyal Society in 1869.

   Thoxas Hewitt Key was born in London on the 20th of March, 1790.
He was the youngest son of Dr. Key, a London Physician, and half-brother
of Charles Aston Key, the eminent surgeon.
    T. H. Key was sent to the Eov. Samuel Dewe's school at Buntingford
in Hertfordshire, where he remained nearly ten years. From this school
he went to St. John's College, Cambridge ; but he removed to Trinity
College, Cambridge, during his undergraduateship, and obtained a scholar
ship in his new college. He took his degree in 1821, and was nineteenth
wrangler.
    Mr. Key's inclination was to go to the bar ; but in compliance with the
wish of his father, to whom he was a most dutiful and affectionate son,
he began to prepare for the medical profession, and he studied nearly two
years at Guy's Hospital ; but his purpose was changed by the acceptance of
the Professorship of Mathematics in the University of Virginia, IT. S., under
the following circumstances.    Inthesummerof 1824anagentfromtheState
 of Virginia came to England to choosefour professors for the new University
of Virginia, which had been established by the Legislature at Charlottes
ville in a central position in the State, and near Monticello, the residence
of Mr. Thomas Jefferson. The course of instruction was planned by Mr.
Jefferson, himself a Virginian, and once President of the United States.
 He was the Hector of the new University, and even the architect, though
he was then past eighty years of age.        He also made out a catalogue
of valuable books Jor the university library, and the agent was empowered
 to purchase the books in England.      Mr. Jefferson, as Hector and head of
 the Board of Visitors, superintended the affairs of the University till his
 death in 1820.     In the simple inscription which he left for his tomb on
 the hill named Monticello, he describes himself as " the author of the De
 claration of Independence, the act for Religious Toleration, and the Eeetor
 of the University of Virginia."    The Presidency of the United States is
 not mentioned.     Mr. Jefferson thought that it was a greater honour to
 have been the active founder of a University in his native State ; and he
 expected that it would be a great benefit to the country.     Fifty years of
 experience have confirmed his expectations, and the University of Virginia
 is now a valuable school.
    Mr. Key before leaving England married Miss Sarah Troward, daugh
 ter of Itichard Ironmonger Troward, who was solicitor for the prosecution
 in Warren Hastings's trial. This happy marriage continued to his death,
 and he had the rare felicity of celebrating his golden wedding on the 28th
 of September, 1874.
    In Virginia Mr. Key was a successful teacher of mathematics, a science
 for which he had a great natural capacity, and he was much beloved by
 his pupils. In the summer of 1825, during the absence of the Professor
 of Ancient Languages, Mr. Key, in addition to his own classes, taught
 the Greek and Latin classes in the University.       He left Charlottesville
 in 1827 much regretted, and returned to London. During his residence

                                         XI
in    Virginia   he began his etymological study of the Latin language, which
tie    prosecuted  to the end of his life.
      In 1 823 he was appointed Professor of Latin in the University of London
in    Gower Street.    The University of London was opened on the 1st of
October, 1S28. An attempt was made to establish in Gower Street a school
ira connexion with the new University for supplying it with well-prepared
pupils. The design was good, but the school did not promise much suc
cess. In 1833 this school, or a school in place of           it,
                                                       was established in
the University buildings in Gower Street, and Mr. Key, the Professor of
I«atin, and Mr. Maiden, the new Professor of Greek, were appointed
joint head masters. In 1842 Mr. Key gave up the Professorship of
Xiatin and took the Professorship of Comparative Grammar with the un
 divided headship of the school, which he held to the day of his death.
 Professor Maiden still continued to teach the sixth Greek class in the
 school till recently.
    In 1836 the present University of London was established, and the
 University of London in Gower Street received Boyal Charter, and took
                                                       a
 the name of University College, which       now has. This Charter was
                                                  it
 annulled by Act of Parliament of the 24th of June, 1869, whereby the
 College was reincorporated with additional powers, and divested of its
 proprietary character.
    The school of University College has been       good place of education
                                                       a
 under the two original head masters and the subsequent head mastership
 of Mr. Key only. It has given more enlarged and useful education for
                                     a
 boys than could be got at most schools   and one proof of success
                                              ;                         the
                                                                       is

                                                       it
 in the world. For some years the number of boys was not large, but
 there was   steady increase.
             a                  In 1868 the number was about four hun
 dred, and in 1875, the last year of Mr. Key's life,   was above six hun

 dred.
      Mr. Keywas employed from 1828 till his death in November 1875 as
 a teacher and head master in University College School, and also, first, as
 Professor of Latin and afterwards of Comparative Grammar in University
 College. He was the first Professor of Comparative Grammar in the College,
 and    will be very difficult to supply his place. It
       it                                                stated in the Eeport
                                                            is
 of the Council, February 23rd, 1876     : — "Since 1842, when Mr. Key was
 appointed   to the Professorship    of Comparative Grammar, the science of
 Philology has been more generally studied than had previously been the
 case  and there can be no doubt that the increased interest with which
        ;
 the subject    now regarded
                 is               to some extent attributable to the zeal
                                   is
 with which he devoted himself to his professorial duties, and to the ex
 tensive erudition which he displayed in lecturing on the subject in which
 he took an enthusiastic interest, which gave to his lectures  charm ren
                                                                   a
 dering them most attractive, and communicating his enthusiasm to many
 of the students."

                                      xii
   A  few words must be added on other matters, in which Mr.        Key's    ac
tive mind and great abilities enabled him to do much service to     his coun
try in other ways. He was like the Roman in one respect of          whom C.
Cwsar said, " Whatever this man wills, he wills it with all his might." He
 was a zealous and efficient supporter of the Reform Bill for the improve
ment of the constitution of the House of Commons, of the Bill for the repeal
of the Corn Laws, and of the Bill for the repeal of the duty on paper ; and
he also took an active part in the elections for Marylebone when Admiral
Charles Napier was elected.       Mr. Key was one of the founders of the
London Library      in St. James's Square and a member of the Committee,
and also a member of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.
He was until a few years before his death a regular attendant at the meet
ings of the Philological Society of London, and for some years President
of the Society.    His contributions to the Proceedings of this Society were
numerous : there is a list of them in the preface to his Philological Essays
(18G8).    He was one of those who assisted in originating the formation
of the body of Volunteers ; but he Jived long enough to think that the
country was trusting too much to the Volunteers, and that it required
other and more complete defence.
   Mr. Key was an acute observer of facts, and he possessed in a remark
able degree the power of judging of evidence and of character, as he
showed in the case of Lord Cochrane, afterwards Earl of Dundonald, one
of the greatest seamen that this country has produced.      Lord Cochrane,
with his uncle Cochrane Johnston, was tried in 1814 for conspiracy and
fraud, unjustly convicted, and disgraced.     In 1847, when Lord Dundonald
was not yet f idly restored, Mr. Key was led to read the report of the trial,
and from a careful examination of the evidence, he was convinced of Lord
Dundonald's    innocence.    At this time he became acquainted with Lord
Dundonald, and he has left many papers which he received from him.
Mr. Key had the satisfaction at last of seeing the veteran seaman restored
to all his honours and liis great name cleared from an unmerited stain.
   In 1856 Mr. Key wrote an excellent pamphlet on the division of profits
in the London Life Association, in which he was one of the insured.       He
showed here his capacity to deal with problems of life insurance, and
powers which would certainly have raised him to eminence as a lawyer.
The changes which he recommended were not made at the time, but they
have since been substantially adopted, to the great benefit of the members
of the Association.
   Mr. Key's literary labours will     be  briefly noticed. He made a good
map of ancient France (Gallia) for the Useful Knowledge Society's Atlas.
This map was accompanied by a map of Prance in Provinces, as they ex
isted before the Revolution of 1789. He was very fond of geography, and
taught it well in the school of University College. He wrote several articles
in the Journal of Education of the Useful Knowledge Society, among which
was a review of an English translation of Zumpt's Latin Grammar, and of

the school editions of Terence, with remarks on the metres of Terence.
Xn the review of Zumpt's Grammar he made the first proposal, as far as
he knew and as far as the writer knows, to apply the crude-form system
of     the Sanskrit Grammarians to the classical languages; and he says
(Appendix I. Key's Latin Grammar, edition of 1858), "The system had
 been previously expounded in the classical lecture-rooms of the Univer
 sity of London " (now LTniversity College)*. In 1829 Mr. Key had
 attended the Sanskrit class of the learned Dr. Kosen in the then Univer
 sity of London ; but he had never time to prosecute the study of Sanskrit
 beyond the elementary part.
       Mr. Key contributed to the Penny Cyclopaedia of the Useful Knowledge
 Society some valuable articles, chiefly on Language.               Among them were
 articles on the letters of the Alphabet, the article on the Alphabet, and
  one on the metres of Terence. These papers were for the most part
  collected in     a little volume (1844), and there was prefixed to it a Prefatory
  Iietter   to   his  colleague, the Professer of Latin in University College.
  This Prefatory Letter gave rise to a controversy. Those who are curious
  about the matter will find further information on it in the Preface to
   Mr. Key's Philological Essays.
       hi 1846 Mr. Key published a Latin Grammar on the system of Crude
   Forms, and in 1862 what he says he niay call a third edition of the
   same, " corrected and somewhat           enlarged."    In 1846 few Latin scholars
   knew what crude forms were. The book was used in University College
   School, but the teaching of Latin and Greek on this system had been a
   long time practised there. The book sold slowly, for no persons are slower
   in making improvements in education than the common teachers of Latin.
   In Appendix I. to the Grammar Mr. Key has explained the Crude Form,
   upon which system, as he says, every Sanskrit Grammar is constructed ;
   and he has attempted to show " the practical advantages which it offers
   even for elementary instruction."           It will perhaps be a long time before
   this system comes into general use in teaching the Greek and Latin lan
    guages ; but there are now many teachers and scholars who know whatit is.
    The study of Latin is a necessity in England, and can never be neglected
    in a good education.        "VVe may hope that it will be taught better than it
    has been ; for the aid which Latin, when it is taught well, gives towards
    the etymology of our own highly Latinized tongue, is, as Mr. Key says,
    " a secondary but still an important consideration ; and here again the
    crude forms have a marked advantage over the nominatives."                Mr. Key's
    Latin Grammar is an excellent work, superior in its design to any other,
    and, as some persons think, in the execution also. Those who are not yet
       * Mr. Key says in a note : — " In the year 1836 was published the Bromsgrove Latin
     Grammar, by the Rev. G. A. Jacob (late Scholar and Tutor of Worcester College, Ox
    ford), which is drawn up in a great measure, but far from uniformly, upon the crude-
    form Bystetn.   Mr. Jacob subsequently published a Greek Grammar on the same plan."

  prepared to use the crude-form system iu their teaching will find the
  part on Syntax very useful*.

     The Philological Essays of Mr. Key were                    part published for the
  first time, in part reprinted from the Transactions of the Philological So
  ciety, but with many changes or additions."              Of the useful essays in this
  volume, the following, in Two Parts, is worth a careful study : — Quae-
                                                                                  "
  ritur. The Sanskrit language as the basis of Linguistic Science ; and the
  labours of the German School in that field, are they not overvalued?"1
  The author acknowledges the deepest obligations of all classical students
  to the scholars of Germany ; and he adds that in the question which he
                                      " overvalued " is "
  is now considering, the word                                 quite compatible with an
  admission of great value;" and this great value he does not deny.                      He
  also acknowledges the signal services of Bopp, the founder, as he is named,
  of the science of Comparative Grammar.                  The particular objections to
  some of the opinions of the Sanskritists can only be learned from the essay.
  The objections to some of the theories of Bopp appear to be unanswerable :
                                                       "
  some of those theories are properly termed extravagancies," and it is hard
  to conceive that any student of language can accept them.
     The second part of " Quaeritur
                                             "
                                                treats of the ' Vergleichende Gram-
          '
 matik of Bopp, the first portion of which was published in 1833.                     The
 book was republished with some changes and considerable additions in
 1857-60. Mr. Key objects to the precedence which Bopp gives " to
 writing over sound ;" or, in other words, to languages which are written
 over languages which are only spoken ; and he objects for this reason,
that " the error, so to call it, has told unfavourably on the arguments
that follow."      Accordingly Mr. Key objects to Bopp's designation of a,
», u as the three original vowels, which             error proceeds from Bopp not
looking
            " upon the materials for oral language as belonging to the domain
of physical science, and wholly independent of those other forms of lan
guage which are addressed to the eye."               Bopp's error also proceeds from
knowing nothing of Professor Willis's experiments (p. 272) on the vowel-
sounds, which sounds          " pass    by imperceptible gradations from the one
extreme t (the sound in feet) to the other u (or oo in boot)."             The varieties
of   vowel-sounds      are  therefore    infinite,  or   practically  unlimited — a fact
which a careful observer of human speech would certainly know. Another
objection     made to Bopp's work is this : — " The German philologer de
parting from the course marked out by his Indian authorities, refuses to
accept the doctrine that all words are traceable back to verbs."                    This
matter is discussed by Mr. Key at some length.
     Mr. Key's last work is on ' Language, its Origin and Development '
(1874).       By language he means oral language ; and he says, " in this
sense the word language            will  be always      used, unless    the contrary be
    * There is an article by Mr. Key on the
                                             advantages of the crude-form system in Bell's
'                                '

stated."        He adds, "a nobler subject of study cauuot        be conceived,  for it
forms       the main instrument of man's superior development, to which he
owes it       that he stands so far above the rest of the animal world." We
 shall     here consider only the theories of the origin of language ; but the
 remainder of the book will well repay the labour of those who will read
 it    carefully.
       The theory of James Harris, in his 'Hermes,' is that a "word is a voice
 articulate and significant by compact." This theory may now be allowed
  to    repose quietly with Rousseau's theory of the Social Contract ; no man
  will disturb their rest. There are two other theories of the origin of
  Language, one of which is thus stated by Professor Max Midler: — ''that
  man in his primitive and perfect state possessed the faculty of giving ex
  pression to the rational conceptions of his mind;" "that this faculty was
  an instinct, an instinct of the mind as irresistible as any other instinct;"
  and further, " the faculty peculiar to man in his primitive state, by which
  every impression      from without received its vocal expression from within,
   must be accepted      as an ultimate fact."       This theory puts an end to all
   inquiries on the      origin of language. "Whether the progenitors of the
   human race were       one perfect pair or many perfect pairs, they could trans
   mit their language    to their chddren in the way in which it is now transmitted.
   But language is subject to change in the course of time and under new
   circumstances ; and it is easdy corrupted, as we know.              The conclusion
   from this theory is that all languages which have existed and exist now,
   even the imperfect languages of savage people, are derived from this
   language of man
                        " in his primitive and perfect state."
       The other theory is that of Mr. Key, and of others also, that language
   has been made by man.          All men speak, and all have the same organs of
    speech ; but there is a wonderful diversity in their speech ; and yet, as
    they use the same organs, we may expect to find some resemblance in
    their language, varied, however, by circumstances which are very different
    and often very difficult to estimate. Mr. Key says,         "I   conclude with the
    expression of a strong opinion that original language is mimetic, in other
    words, consisted solely in the imitation of natural sounds ;" and in another
    place he says that "it is all but universally admitted that some portion of
    language owes its origin to an imitation of the sounds of nature."
        According to this theory man in his primitive state was not perfect,
    and he could not even speak ; his progress towards speaking was like his
    progress to other useful sciences and arts, slow and laborious through
    long ages of suffering and sorrow.          The ancient writers had a perception
     of this melancholy truth, as Horace (Sat. i. 3. 99) when he wrote
                          " Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,
                            Mutum   et turpe pecus," &c. ;
     on which   Lyell ('Antiquity of Man ')        says, ".The opinion entertained ge
     nerally by the classical writers of Greece and Eome, that man in the first
     stage of his existence was but just removed from the brutes, is faithfully

                                       xvi
 expressed by Horace.      The picture of transmutation given in these verses,
 however severe and contemptuous the strictures lavishly bestowed on it
 by Christian commentators, accords singularly with the train of thought
 which the modern doctrine of progressive development has encouraged."
 Those Comparative Grammarians, then, who accept this theory may still
 find something to do ; and they may try to explain the slow steps from
 imitation of natural sounds to the state in which language has existed and
 exists now among nations named civilized, and also among other nations
 where it is still near to its supposed original and rude condition.       Mr.
 Key has done something towards this end ; but future students of lan
 guage may and ought to do more.
    Mr. Key left an unfinished Latin Dictionary, the work of many years,
 for the Latin Language was the chief subject on which he was employed
 as a st udent and teacher.   In the Preface to his work on Language   (March
 1874) he describes the Dictionary as filling more than 2400 pages of
 quarto MS., and including nearly all those words in which he thought
 himself able to make some improvement.         In the interval between 1S74
 and his death he made large additions to the MS., and his friends hope
 that the work may be published.       It will probably contain things which
 some seho'ars may    not accept ; but it will certainly contain much valuable
and original   matter, such as may be expected from the long labours of an
excellent Latin scholar and a student of language generally.
    Mr. Key was tall, and his personal appearance was very striking and
 agreeable, especially when he was animated.        His countenance expressed
 great  force of character  and penetration.    A   marble bust of him by T.
"Woolner, E.A., was presented to University College a few months before
his death by some of his old pupils and friends.
    The character of Mr. Key may be partially known by those who read
what he has written. It was as elevated as his intellectual powers.        He
was singularly modest and unaffected, but bold and free in his opinions.
He was     a very good-tempered    man, and an agreeable companion, an af
fectionate husband and father, a teacher beloved by his pupils, a faith
ful and generous friend, and a man of unspotted integrity. No person
knew him so well and so long as the writer of tins notice, who for more
than half a century enjoyed his friendship without one moment of inter
ruption.
    Ciiaiu.es "Wiieatsto'e was born in February 1802, in the vicinity
of   Gloucester, and was educated at a private school in his native
city, at which he evinced his predilection for Mathematics and Physics.
In 1823, at the age of 21, we find him, in conjunction with his
brother, long since deceased, engaged in the manufacture and 6ale of
musical instruments in London.        But his genius was not long in finding
opportunities of development ; for in the same year he made his first con
tribution to science in a paper published in Thomson's ' Annals of Philo

                                         XV11
sophy,' entitled
                     " New experiments on Sound," containing the results of
his earlier experiments on the vibrations of chords, rods, and surfaces,
which excited so much attention among physicists, that it was repro
duced the same year in the ' Annates de Chimie,' and in the following
year in Schweigger's Jahrbuch.' His next papers, also on Acoustics,
            '
were published in the ' Quarterly Journal of Science,' on " New experi
ments on Audition," in 1827, and on " the Kaleidophone," in the follow
ing year. This elegant philosophical toy consists of a steel wire fixed
 vertically in a heavy base, or in a vice, and surmounted by a silvered
 glass bead.      If this, by an appropriate displacement, be thrown into a
 compound vibration, consisting of the simple vibration of its entire length
 accompanied by that of the first harmonic subdivision, a series of beauti
 ful circular or elliptic epicycloidal curves are revealed by the persistence
 on the retina of the reflection of a fixed light from the glass bead ; and
 if a rectangular wire be employed, the dimensions of which are such that
 its periods of vibration in two planes at right angles to each other are in
 the simple harmonic ratios of 1 : 2, 2 : 3, or 3 : 4, the curves formed respec
 tively by the superposition of these two modes of vibration will be beauti
 fully exhibited.      Subsequently, by an aptly contrived mechanism, Wheat-
  stone   succeeded   in  obtaining a visual combination of rectangular vibra
 tions in any given ratio to each other. The principle of the kaleidophone
  ¦was subsequently applied in the construction       of a photometer.   In this
  instrument a silvered bead is made to describe rapidly a narrow ellipse,
  or to oscillate in a straight line by means of an epicyclic train of the
  simplest construction ; the relative brightness of two lines, formed by
  the reflections of two lights to be compared, may be very readily estimated.
      At this period of his life Acoustics (doubtless in relation to his busi
   ness) engrossed the chief part of Wheatstone's attention.             He was
   especially interested in the application of the free reed to musical instru
   ments ; and the elegant little Symphonion, which, from the many objections
   to the needless employment of the breath, soon gave place to the bellows
   of the Accordion, offered ample evidence of the success of his labours in
   this direction.   In   the construction  of these instruments,  the admirable
   mode of fingering, in which the successive notes are placed in double rows
   alternately on opposite sides of the instrument, so that consecutive notes
   on either side, which may be touched by the same finger, always belong to
   the  same chord, must    not remain unnoticed.
      In  1828 Wheatstone     wrote on the resonance of columns of air, and in
   1831 on the transmission       of musical sounds through rigid linear con
   ductors, a subject which was subsequently well illustrated at the Poly
   technic Institution by the transference to an upper room of music played
   iu the basement. In the same year he contributed to the British Asso
   ciation an experimental proof of Bernouilli's theory of the vibrations of
   air in wind instruments.       His principal contribution to Acoustics is a
    memoir on the so-called Chladni's figures, produced by strewing sand on
       vol. xxtt.                                                      c

elastic planes, and throwing them into vibration by means of a violin-bow
 drawn across the edge ; this was presented to the Eoyal Society in 1833.
and subsequently published in their Transactions, and is probably the
 most remarkable of his early scientific labours ; for he showed that, in
 square or rectangular plates, every figure however complicated was the
resultant of two or more sets of isochronous parallel vibrations ; and by
means of some simple geometrical relations he carried out the principle
of the " superposition of small motions " without the aid of any profound
mathematical analysis, and succeeded in predicting the curves that given
 modes of vibration should produce.
    In 1834 Wheatstone was appointed to the chair of Experimental Physics
at King's College, London.       In fulfilment of the duties of his office he
 delivered a course of eight lectures on Sound in the early part of the fol
lowing year     ; but his habitual  though unreasonable distrust of his own
powers of utterance proved to be an invincible obstacle, and he soon after
wards discontinued his lectures, but retained the professorship for many
years.     Although any one would be charmed by his able and lucid expo-
sition of any scientific fact or principle in private, yet his attempt to
repeat the same process in public invariably proved unsatisfactory.          An
anecdote may here bo mentioned in confirmation of this his peculiar idio-
syneracy.      Wheatstone and the writer of this memoir were for several
years members of a small private debating society, comprising several
familiar names in science, art, or literature, that met periodically at one
another's houses to discuss some extemporized subject, and every member
present was expected to speak : Wheatstone could never be induced to
open his lips, even on subjects on which he was brimful of information.
Several of his more important investigations were for the same reasons
from time to time brought before the public by Faraday in the theatre
of the Eoyal Institution.
   In   1835 Wheatstone      communicated to the British Association a paper
" On the Attempts which have         been made to imitate Human Speech by
                         "
Mechanical      Means  ;   and he produced a much improved edition of De
Kempelen's speaking-machine ; but his researches in this direction were
not long continued, and have since been far surpassed by others.
   The analogies of vibratory motion led the philosophic mind of Wheat
stone from the subject of sound to that of light. In 1838 he communi
cated to the Eoyal Society an account of some remarkable and hitherto
unobserved phenomena of binocular vision, with a description of the
reflecting    stereoscope, an instrument by which these phenomena were
first illustrated.    The conception that the idea of solidity is derived from
the mental combination of two pictures of the same object in dissimilar
perspective, as seen by the two eyes respectively, is undoubtedly and solely
due to Wheatstone.         In demonstration of this principle he drew two
outlines of the same geometrical figure or other object, just as they would
be seen in perspective by either eye respectively ; and these outlines were

                                       xix
so placed that they     might  be seen each by one eye,     but visually super
posed, either by reflection or by refraction ;    this he effected by a combi
nation of lenses either with plane reflectors or with prisms.       All that is
really due to Brewster in relation to the stereoscope is the use of wedge-
shaped segments of larger lenses, in which the lens and prism of Wheat-
stone are combined ; the construction now universally adopted, and popu
larized by the application of photography.
   In 1852 Wheatstone presented a second memoir on Binocular Vision
to the Boyal Society, in which he produced a striking confirmation of his
former views by the invention of the Pseudoscope, an instrument in which
the perspective pictures of a given object as seen by the two eyes respec
tively are reversed by internal reflection from the bases of two right-
angled prisms, and convex objects appear to be concave, or vice versa ;
thus a globe on which figures are traced will appear to be concave, and
the inside of a painted basin or saucer to be convex, or the object as it
 were turned inside out.
   The use of this instrument has produced some curious illustrations of
mental phenomena : with most persons an object, of which the convexity
or concavity is unknown, will at once appear inverted ; but when the real
form is known, with some persons experience appears to overrule visual
perception, and they cannot succeed in seeing the inversion of the object ;
with others the appearance derived from previous knowledge persists for
a shorter or longer period, and then suddenly gives way to the visual
impression,   and the object appears to be suddenly turned inside out;
while with others, again J the change is more or less gradual, and during
the period of transition the visual impression is uncertain and indistinct.
In this   memoir    the idea of the mental      character of binocular   vision
was still further supported by experimental evidence that the apparent
magnitude of objects is governed by the relative position as well as the
size of the visual pictures.    In fact the whole of these investigations may
be viewed   in their relation to mental conditions   ; and when thus regarded,
they possessed a higher interest than that which arose from their great
value as contributions to physiological optics.
   At one period, indeed, Wheatstone's attention was for n time directed
to problems of mental philosophy, and especially to the jittwi-mechanical
solution of some of them, which was hoped for by the followers of Gall
and Spurzheim ; he was an active member of the London Phrenological
Society, then presided over by Dr. Elliotson ; and in January 1832 he
read at one of the meetings a paper on Dreaming and Somnambulism,
                                                   '
which was published in extenso in the ' Lancet of that date. This paper
is remarkable, like all his writings, for the extreme clearness with which
known facts are stated, and the deductions based upon them.
   Amongst Wheatstone's many ingenious inventions may be mentioned
his automatic apparatus for recording periodically the height of the baro
meter, and the temperatures of the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers, by
                                                                  c 2

                                         XX
moans   of wires descending vertically in the open tubes, a circuit closed
by the contact   of the wire with either column of mercury indicating by
electro-magnetic action the moment at which the contact takes place,
and by inference the position of the point of contact.       Precisely the same
principle, with minor modifications, has of late years been practically ap
plied by Padre Secchi, and more recently by M. van Eysselberghe.
   Another is the electro-magnetic counter, by which the number of any
given repeated mechanical actions is readily and certainly recorded ; and
the electric chronoscope, by which very small intervals of time may be
determined (as, for example, in estimating the velocity of projectiles),
must also be mentioned.
   Cryptography,    or the art of writing in ciphers, is indebted to him for
a compendious apparatus, by which the characters representing            the suc
cessive letters of the written    communication    are periodically changed by
the machine, so as to defy the ordinary well-known methods of decipher
ing.   The receiver, possessing a machine set by agreement in the same
manner as that of the sender, can immediately decipher the dispaU'h by
reversing the process by which the cipher was constructed.
   The fact, discovered by Brewster, that the plane of polarization of the
sky is always 90° from the sun, gave rise to Wheatstone's
                                                                  " Polar Clock,''
which consists of a doublo-image prism and a thin plate of selenite en
closed in a tube placed parallel to the earth's axis.        When the prism,
which carries an index traversing a circular arc marked with the hours,
is turned round until no colour is perceived, the index, when once ad
justed, will mark the hour of the day ; this is a pleasing philosophical
toy, but of little practical utility.
   The namo of Wheatstone is intimately connected with the earliest
development of spectrum-analysis.          In a paper on " The Prismatic Ana
lysis of Electric Light," read before the Meeting of the British Associa
tion at Dublin in ISlio, he announced the existence of bright lines in the
spectrum, emitted by the incandescent vapour of metals volatilized by the
heat of an electric discharge.      He was then the first to demonstrate the
fact that the spectrum    of the   electric spark from different metals pre
sented respectively more or less numerous rays of definite refrangibility,
producing each a series of lines differing in position and colour from each
other, and that thus the presence of a very minute portion of any given
metal might be determined.        " We have here,'' he adds, " a mode of dis
criminating metallic bodies more readily than that of chemical examination,
and which may hereafter be employed for useful purposes."            This remark
has been abundantly verified by the many important recent investigations
that have been based on spectrum-analysis — such, for example, as the dis
covery and isolation of thallium by Mr. Crookes.
   It would occupy too much space to enumerate all Wheatstone's inge
nious contrivances ; but his most important contribution to the wants or
conveniences of civilization, the practical electric telegraph, must now be

                                          XXI
considered.        On this point it has been justly remarked by De la Eive*
that " the     philosopher who was the first to contribute by his labours, as
ingenious as they were persevering, in giving to electric telegraphy
the practical character that it now possesses, is undoubtedly Mr. Wheat-
stone."      He has no more claim to the title of " inventor " of the elec
tric telegraph than any one of those who have long preceded him in pro
posing unpractical schemes for transmitting signals to a distant station,
first   by franklinie, and subsequently by voltaic electricity.          The earliest
of these appears to be Stephen Gray, who in 1727 suspended by silk
threads a wire 700 feet long ; and on applying an excited glass tube to
one end of the wire electrification was observed by an assistant to occur
 at the other end. Similar experiments were made by Dufay a few years
 subsequently, and by Winckler of Leipsic, by Lemonnier of Paris in
 1746, and by Dr. Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, in 1747, one of whose ex
periments had a remarkable (but then unnoticed) bearing on electro-tele
graphy, namely, the employment of the earth to conduct the return cur
rent : he stretched a wire across the Thames, one end of which was
 attached to the exterior coating of a Leyden jar, while the interior coat
 ing was connected to earth through the body of the experimenter, and
 the other end was held by an assistant, who grasped an iron rod ; the
moment the latter dipped the rod in the river both felt a shock.            He sub
 sequently experimented on much longer circuits, one of which was 10,600
 feet in length, suspended from wooden poles erected on Shooter's Hill.
 Franklin made similar experiments across the Schuykill at Philadelphia
 in 1748, and De Luc about the same time across the Lake of Geneva.
     The earliest definite scheme for the employment of franklinie electri
                                                               "
 city for telegraphic purposes was propounded by C. M.," an anonymous
                                      '
 writer in the ' Scot's Magazine for 1753 ; this required a separate insu
 lated conductor for each letter ; and a very similar idea was subsequently
 carried out at Geneva by Lesage in 1774.              Lomond was the first to pro
 pose in 1787 the transmission of various signals through a single line-
 wire ; this he effected by the varied movement of the pith balls of a deli
 cate electroscope ; and Cavallo in 1795 proposed to effect the same object
 by varied combinations of sparks and pauses. In 1816 Francis Eonalds
 proposed the hopeless scheme of employing two perfectly isochronous
 clocks to indicate continuously the same letters or numerals at the two
  stations,  the signal intended being indicated           by simultaneous sparks at
 both.     This telegraph was offered to the Government by the inventor, who
 received an official reply from the then Secretary of the Admiralty, that
 " telegraphs of any kind are now wholly useless, and no other than the
                                        "
  one now in use will be adopted — a conspicuous example of the slow
 progress proverbially due to the inertia of great bodies.
     The first proposal to employ voltaic electricity for telegraphic purposes
  appears to have been made by S. T. Siimmering, a surgeon, to the .Aca-
                        * 'Treatise on Electricity,' pt. vii. ch. 1.

demy of Sciences at Munich in 1808 ; this involved a separate insulated
conductor for each letter and numeral, any two of which might be indi
cated by a small evolution of gas from two corresponding gold points
immersed       in  a common fluid.      A very similar system was suggested by
Prof. Coxe      of  Philadelphia  in 1810,  who proposed to indicate the signals
by the decomposition of some metallic salt.          Prof. Schweigger of Erlan-
gen proposed to reduce the number of conductors in Sommering's tele
graph to two, and to employ an electric pistol to call attention at the
receiving station .
    In relation to the dawn of practical electro-telegraphy, the names of
 Froment in France, of Gauss, "Weber, and Steinheil in Germany, and of
 Morse in America, will immediately suggest themselves, but to Charles
 Wheatstone is undoubtedly due the merit of having been the first to
 render the electric telegraph practically available.        In 1834, the year of
 his appointment to the Professorship, he devised an experiment which at
 once attracted the attention of scientific minds throughout Europe, and
 ultimately had a large influence in determining the direction of his future
 labours.      Ilis object was to ascertain the rate at which an electric wave
 travels through a metallic conductor.         For this purpose about half a mile
 of copper     wire  was insulated  by suspension in the vaults under King's Col
 lege  ;   and three interruptions of this circuit were made by three pairs of
 small brass knobs, with a small interval between them, placed in a
  horizontal line at a few inches distance from each other, one being
  near each end of the conductor, and the other one at its middle point.
  It was presumable that the positive and negative terminal sparks pro
  duced by the discharge of a Leyden jar through the insulated wire would
  be absolutely simultaneous, but if any perceptible time were occupied by
  the passage of the wave, the middle spark would occur later than the
  terminal    ones.    To determine this a small plane mirror mounted on an
  axis parallel to the line of sparks was made to revolve with great rapidity
  by a train of clockwork.         If any sensible angle were described by the
  mirror during the" passage of the wave, the middle spark would be seen
  either above or below the line joining the other two, according to tho
  direction of rotation of tho mirror.        This in fact proved to be the case ;
  and    from   the estimated   amount  of displacement and rate of rotation, the
  velocity of transmission was inferred to be over 250,000 miles in one
  second; but from the nature of the observation the limits of error are
  necessarily very wide.        This experiment was subsequently repeated with
  an extended circuit of nearly four miles, which was further utilized in the
  transmission of electric signals by the deflections of a galvanometer-
  needle.
     In     1830   Mr. W. F. Cooke having been struck, during          a  visit to
  Germany,        by the applicability    of an electric telegraph devised by
  Baron Schilling to practical and especially to railway purposes, brought
  back with him on his return to London a working model of Schilling's

                                      xxiii
 apparatus, to which ho directed the attention of Faraday and of the then
 Secretary of the Eoyal Society, Dr. Eoget, by whom he was informed
 that Wheatstone had been for some time engaged in analogous investi
 gations.    An introduction followed, and shortly afterwards Wheatstone
 entered into partnership with Mr. Cooke, and a patent for a five-needle
 telegraph (which from the number of insulated conductors was deemed
 too expensive for general use), and subsequently another patent for the
 two-needle telegraph, the first that came into general use, were taken
 out  in their joint names.
    To Mr. (now Sir W. F.) Cooke much credit is undoubtedly due for
the tact and ability he evinced in directing public attention to the impor
tance of the electric telegraph, and in conducting the joint enterprise to
a most successful     commercial  issue  ;  but to Wheatstone   alone must be
ascribed the inventive genius and fertility of scientific resource which led
to the many successive developments of the electric telegraph — the letter-
showing dial telegraph in 1840, the type-printing telegraph in 1841, the
 magneto-electric dial telegraph, a subsequent extension of the same to
type-embossing, and lastly the automatic telegraph, by which messages
are transmitted with such unprecedented rapidity. It must also be borne
in mind that the idea of subaqueous telegraphy was first developed by
Wheatstone.       It appears from his manuscripts that in 1837 he devoted
a good deal of time and attention to this subject ; and in the Bulletin de
1' Academic lioyale de Bruxelles for October 7, 1840, in a notice by Prof.
Quetelet of his telegraph instruments, it is remarked :
                                                             — " On sera sans
doute charmc d'apprendre que l'auteur a trouve le moyen de transmettre
les signaux entre l'Angleterre et la Belgique, malgre' l'obstaele de la mer."
But it appears that his first practical   essays at submarine telegraphy were
made in the autumn of 1844 in Swansea Bay, with the assistance of Mr.
J.  D. Llewellyn.
    More recently the Society of Arts, in tendering precisely the same award
for public services to the two former partners, failed to discriminate be
tween very successful commercial tact and ability, and both inventive and
constructive genius of an exceptionally high order ; under these circum
stances   it is not surprising that Wheatstone       should have declined the
proffered distinction, considering that he could present no claim to that
commercial merit which it must be, from its title, the special function of
that Society to foster.     But scientific honours were profusely bestowed
on the great physicist ; he was elected a Fellow of the Boyal Society in
1836, a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1855, and a foreign
Associate of the Academy of Sciences of France in 1873 ; he moreover
possessed thirty-four distinctions     or diplomas conferred upon him by
various governments, universities,    and learned societies, of which eight
are German,      six French, five English, three Swiss, two Scotch, two
Italian, two American, and of Irish, Belgian, Bussian, Swedish, Dutch,
and Brazilian each one. In 1868 the Government of Lord Derby con

                                        XXIV
ferred on him the honour of knighthood, an honour so variously bestowed
that it can only be viewed as a bare recognition of scientific labours
which have rarely been equalled in their extent, their variety, and their
fruitfulness.
   Charles "Wheatstone was not less conspicuous for his sagacity in per
ceiving the practical bearings of ascertained scientific principles, than for
his ingenuity in devising suitable mechanical means for their application
to useful purposes.      He was one of the first, if not the very first, in this
country,  to appreciate the importance of Ohm's beautiful and simple law
of the relation between electromotive force, resistance of conductors, and
resulting current; he thence rightly inferred that in establishing electric
intercommunication      between two distant stations by means of the deflec
tions of a galvanometer-needle, or the attraction of an iron keeper by an
elect romagnet, the coil of which is actuated by a current sent from the
other station, the resistance of the coil must necessarily be small compared
with that of the intervening conductor, and hence that a coil of much
larger resistance than was at first contemplated might be beneficially em
ployed : Ohm's law in fact affords the means of determining in any given
circuit the quality of coil by which the largest amount of dynamic energy
may be imparted to the moving mechanism.
   Very early in his electrical researches "Wheatstone perceived the necessity
of some more accurate means of measuring resistances and the strength
of currents than even the most sensitive tangent-galvanometer presented ;
it occurred to him that small differences between two currents might
be much more accurately determined by sending them          in opposite directwns
through   the coil   of  a sensitive sine-galvanometer,    the needle of which
will then be affected only by their difference, than by estimating the small
differences of displacement of the needle due to small differences in a
single current. Accordingly he devised the well-known
                                                                " Bridge,'" which
has been, and must ever continue to be, the basis of all accurate quanti
tative determinations in electricity.        In this instrument the two por
tions of  a divided current are conducted in opposite directions through
the galvanometer-coil and again reunited ; and the resistance sought is
interposed in one circuit, and
                                   " balanced " by known resistance interposed
in the other circuit until the needle is brought to zero. The form of
this instrument    has varied considerably from that originally proposed,
but the principle is precisely the same.
   As necessary adjuncts to this instrument, Wheatstone proposed as a
unit of resistance one foot in length of soft pure copper wire, weighing
100 grains, and constructed a series of " resistance-coils," each coil con
taining some decimal multiple of the proposed unit ; he also devised the
" rheostat,"
              consisting of   a fine wire wound in the thread of a screw cut
on the surface of a cylinder of non-conducting material, any portion of
which wire may be put into or taken out of the circuit by merely turning
the cylinder on  its axis by  a handle.     But several circumstances rendered

                                       XXV
 Wheatstone's proposed unit unavailable, viz. the difficulty of maintaining
  uniformity in the size and quality of the wire, the variation of resistance
 produced by any molecular disturbance, such as change of temperature,
 stretching or bending, and the instability of resistance, even when the
 wire is protected from mechanical disturbance ; and the British Associa
 tion unit is now generally adopted.
    Wheatstone    was the first to appreciate the importance of reducing to
 a minimum the amount of work to be done by the current at the receiv
 ing station, by diminishing as far as practicable the mass and therefore
 the inertia of the moving parts ; this was beautifully exemplified in that
 marvel of ingenuity the magneto-electric letter-showing         telegraph, now
 generally adopted for private telegraphic communication, in which the
 wheel attached to the index is as delicate as the scape-wheel of a small
 Geneva watch.     And there are one or two more points of construction in
this admirable instrument which, as exemplars of the mind of the inven
tor, should not escape notice.     Faraday had discovered that if a soft iron
keeper   furnished   with  armatures  revolve in front of the poles of a per
 manent magnet, instantaneous currents in opposite directions are deve
loped as the revolving keeper approaches to and recedes from the position
of maximum induction ; accordingly Wheatstone placed four fixed arma
tures coiled alternately in opposite directions in front of the poles of a small
but powerful permanent magnet, and made the keeper alone to rotate in
close proximity to the iron cores of the armatures ; as therefore the
extra currents induced by the keeper in receding from one and aj>proach-
ing the other pair of armatures coincide in direction and reinforce each
other, four equal currents, alternately positive and negative, will be de
veloped by each revolution of the iron keeper ; and these, by causing a
pair of magnetic needles, moving on an axis passing through their common
centre of gravity, to oscillate between a pair of small electro-magnets, ac
tuate the index of the receiving instrument.
    Another peculiarly happy and simple contrivance in this apparatus
must also be mentioned.       The letters of the alphabet surround the trans-
mitting-dial ; and opposite each of these is a stud at the end of a radial
lever, the depression of which closes a short circuit, which intercepts all
currents when the index arrives at the corresponding letter, and the in
dicator of the receiving instrument consequently stops at the same letter,
it having been first ascertained that they start in unison.     It then became
necessary   that the  depression of any  other  lever should raise  the one pre
viously depressed ; and for this purpose some very complicated arrange
ments of interacting levers were first devised, but the plan adopted is
remarkable for its simplicity : a circular endless chain lies in a groove
beneath all the levers, in which there is just
                                                  " slack " enough to allow of
the depression of one lever ; consequently the depression of any other pulls
up the former, and opens the short circuit previously closed.
   The catalogue of Wheatstone's valuable labours is still far from being

                                           xx vi
   exhausted   ; but it must now suffice only to mention some of his unpub
   lished and incomplete researches, of which many exist, and will bo, it is
   hoped, by some means made public.           At the early part of his career, when
   his thoughts    were   mainly directed  to Acoustics,  he endeavoured to inves
                                               "        " or qiudity of tone in dif
   tigate the causes of the differences of timbre
   ferent musical instruments,        presuming it to depend on the nature of
   superposed secondary vibrations, and of the material by which they are
   affected. This the writer has frequently, but in vain, urged him to com
   plete and publish    ;  but such was the fecundity of his imagination that he
   would frequently work steadily for a time at a given subject, and then
   entiroly put it aside in pursuit, it may be, of some more important or
   more practical idea that had presented itself to his mind.       A short treatise
.  is in existence on the capabilities of his well-known wave-machine, in
   which rows of white balls, mounted on rods, are actuated in two directions
   perpendicular to each other by guides or templets with suitable curved
  outlines ; by means of this machine many combinations of plane and
  helical waves may be demonstrated,          and especially those related    to the
  theory of polarized light.
      In furtherance of this subject he devised a new form or mode of geo
  metrical analysis, to which he gave the title of Bifarial Algebra, in which
  both the magnitudo and the relative position of lines on a plane surface
  are designed to be represented by the introduction of two new symbols to
  represent positive and negative perpendicular directions.          The same prin
  ciple has also been extended to three dimensions, with a further proposal
  of new symbols, under the name of Trifaml Algebra. On this subject
  a brief treatise exists in manuscript.
      Amongst the subjects of his more recent but still incomplete in
  vestigations    in   Light   and   Electricity   the  following   may    be  men
  tioned : —
              Colours of transparent and opaque bodies.
              Colours obtained by transmission and reflection.
              Absorption-bands in coloured liquids.
              Spectroscopic examination of light reflected from opaque and
                    dichroic bodies.
              Electromotive forces of various combinations.
              Inductive capacities of various bodies.
              Experiments on electro-capillarity.
             Telegraph construction.
              Construction of relays.
      Such of these as may be found sufficiently advanced to be of any scien
  tific value will probably be made public in a collective form.
      Charles Wheatstone was married on the 12th of February, 1847, and had
  a family of five children, who survive him, Mrs. Wheatstone            having de
  ceased many years. He died in Paris on the 19th of October, 1875, whence

Ixia     remains were removed to his residence in Park Crescent, and were
 followed      to their last resting-place in the cemetery at Kensal Green by
 xx   numerous assemblage of attached friends, with some of whom ho . had
  maintained an uninterrupted intimacy from his early manhood, and by
  several leading members of the scientific world, who felt it due to his great
  merit     to pay this last tribute of regard to his memory.
       This memoir cannot be more suitably concluded than by the expressions
  of M. Dumas, perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences,
  Tittered on the occasion of the removal of the remains from Paris : —
        " To render to genius the homage which is its due, without regard to
   oountry or origin, is to honour one's self. The Paris Academy of Sciences,
   always sympathizing with English science, did not hesitate, during the
                                                                             '

   his coffin to offer him a last homage. A foreign Associate of the Aca
   demy of Sciences, exercising by a rare privilege in virtue of that title all the
    rights of its members during his life, we are bound to render to his mortal
   remains the same tribute which we render to fellow-countrymen who are
    our colleagues. The memory of Sir C. Wheatstone will live among us
    not only for his discoveries and for the methods of investigation with
    which ho has endowed science, but also by the recollection of his rare
    qualities of heart, the uprightness of his character, and the agreeable
    charm of his personal demeanour.           The friends that he has left among
    us, unable to avert destiny, hope that they were at least able to soothe
    the last hours of his life— of that life which, alas ! was closed away from
    his beloved home, from that family circle the sweet recollection of which
    animated his last hours, and to which        the eye of the dying one turned
     once more, before his soul, quitting its earthly tenement, took its flight
     to a better world."      '
        Justus Lizbio was born at Darmstadt on the 13th of May, 1803.
     He went to school at the Gymnasium of that town. His father was a
     dealer in drugs and colours.       Experiments in the production of colours
     and chemical products undertaken by his father early excited in the
     youthful Liebig a fondness for chemistry, which was further developed
     by the study of the chemical works in the Darmstadt Library.              It is
     stated that in the fourteenth year of his age there was not a volumo of
     a chemical journal in this large library that he had not read through, and that
     there was no chemical experiment which he had not repeated when his
     means permitted.        The ease with which he obtained all that was
     requisite for experimenting      procured    for him early great dexterity   in
     the art of analysis.
        His was one of those fortunate natures which early becomes conscious
     of its power, and he soon made up his mind to be a chemist.          His father

                                        xxviii
   yielded to his wish to devote himself wholly to chemistry ; and Liebig
   took the only means then available of cultivating thescienceand placed him
   self under the tuition of a druggist at Heppenheim.      He remained there,
   however, for only ten months.        His taste for analysis found there no
   6cope, and at last an explosion of fulminating silver in the house of his
   master suddenly terminated his pharmaceutic career.        He then returned
  to Darmstadt, where he passed half a year in further study.         At the age
  of eighteen we   find him   at  the  University  of Bonn, and he afterwards
  studied at Erlangen, where he took         a degree, and where   he published
  his first chemical paper in 1822.
     This paper first appeared in Biichner's * Repertorium fiir die Phar-
  macie,' Band xii., under the title " Ueber die Bereitung und Zusam-
  mensetzung des Brugnatellischen        und Howard'schen     Knallsilbers, von
  Herrn Liebig, der Cheinie Beflissenen aus Darmstadt." Prof. Kastner
                                                           "
  accompanies this paper with the following notice : — The readers must
  receive with indulgence this first attempt of a young chemist.            The
  author has already studied chemistry zealously in Bonn, and has pursued
  his studies here in Erlangen in the same spirit."
     Liebig had felt while at Erlangen the necessity of going to Paris to
  complete his education ; and he was fortunate enough to obtain from the
  Grand Duke of Darmstadt a travelling stipend for that object. In 1823
  wo find him in Paris.     It was his earnest wish to be admitted to Gay-
  Lussac's Laboratory ;   this,  however, could not be, as Gay-Lussac at that
 time admitted no young people.          He succeeded, however, in entering
 Thenard's Laboratory, and there he resumed his investigation of fulmi
 nating silver.
     This research brought him to the meeting of the French Academy of
 Sciences in July 1823, which was to form an era in Liebig's life.          He
 read a paper
                " On an Analytical Examination of Howard's Fulminating
 Silver and Mercury Compounds."           At the conclusion of the meeting, as
 he was engaged in packing up his preparations, a Member of the
 Academy came forward and entered into conversation with him.             "With
 the most captivating friendliness the stranger made inquiries about
 Liebig's studies and other occupations and plans, and invited him to
dinner at the Palais Royal.           They separated without Liebig having
had courage to inquire who the stranger was.               It was Alexander
von Humboldt, who had returned to Paris the day before from Italy
after a long absence.     Humboldt now recommended his young country
man, who had so quickly and completely won his heart, to his friend
Gay-Lussac, for Humboldt knew too well from his own experience the
value of working under Gay-Lussac.
    The time which Liebig spent with Gay-Lussac is indisputably the
most interesting part of his student life.       "We may imagine the pleasure
these two men must have had in their intercourse : the one 45 years of
age and at the summit of his fame, the other scarce 20 years old, but full

                                         XXIX
o£ promise of future greatness.          It is related by Liebig that when they
had accomplished some difficult work, such, for instance, as satisfac
torily finishing a difficult analysis, Gay-Lussac would often take him
by      the hand and the two would dance together around           the laboratory
 table.
      The result of Liebig's study under Gay-Lussac was that the latter
 recommended the youth so strongly to the Grand Duke Ludwig, that
 the Grand Duke on his own responsibility appointed him Professor
 Extraordinary of Chemistry at the University of Giessen. It will easily
 be understood that Liebig was regarded with jealousy by the majority
 of his elder colleagues, and found but little support and sympathy in his
  endeavours for the reform of chemical instruction.
       Liebig, however, was able to overcome all obstacles. Two years after
  wards he was promoted to the Professorship of Chemistry.              He made
  every arrangement within his power, even at his own personal expense
  and risk, for his own and his students' work. His reputation rapidly
  increased ; and when it had at last spread to such an extent that young
  chemists came from all parts of Europe to work under him, the State at
  length resolved to build him a large Chemical Laboratory outside of
   Giessen.
       Liebig's scientific activity may be divided into two periods, the first
   from 1824 to about 1839, which was specially devoted to pure Chemistry,
   and the second from 1840, when his labours in the department of
   Applied Chemistry began to       be prominent.
       There is scarcely a branch of chemistry into which Liebig's activity
   did not extend. Perhaps no other chemist excepting Berzelius had
   accomplished so many difficult investigations.      The 'Annalen der Chemie
   und Pharmacie,' which he edited conjointly with others, contain more
   than 200 papers on various branches of pure and applied chemistry.
       Great as were Liebig's services in all branches of the science, that of
    Organic Chemistry is chiefly indebted to him, and he is accordingly
    called the founder of Organic Chemistry.        There may be a difference of
    opinion as to how far its foundation was already laid, but it cannot be
    denied that Liebig contributed more than any other chemist of his time
    to the edifice.
       The so-called organic substances originating in plants and animals
    had, at the period when Liebig entered on his scientific career, been
    already the subject of many chemical researches, and it was already
    known that all, unlimited as they are in number, contained carbon
    combined with hydrogen, and sometimes oxygen or nitrogen in regular
    proportions ; but just as it was supposed that they owed their origin to
    other than chemical forces, it was imagined that their relation to each
     other was something quite different from that subsisting       between inor
     ganic mineral substances.
        But Liebig soon    came   to the distinct conviction  that even   if there

                                      XXX
were a generic difference between organic and inorganic substances, no
chemical difference could be assumed.        lie was convinced that there
could be only one chemistry, and took upon himself the task of effecting
a scientific connexion between the two branches.       His investigation of
fuliniuic acid had already carried him iu this direction.      He and Gay-
Lussac had found     it to be a compound  of  carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen,
and he then discovered the corresponding compound of cyanogen with
sulphur, and investigated melam and its other products of decomposi
tion.
   After Graham      had established the tribasic character of the common
phosphates, Liebig showed that     some organic salts had a   similar consti
tution. But peculiar difficulty      was presented by   the constitution of
certain neutral   organic substances, such as alcohol, ether, essential oils,
&c. Liebig endeavoured to get a key to their constitution by investi
gating the action of simple materials upon them, such as chlorine and
bromine, &c., and often led his students into this line of work.
   In (his way   a great number    of the most remarkable substances wore
discovered, some of which in future years were of practical use, though
the object of the investigator was purely scientific.      Thus Liebig dis
covered chloral long before Liebreieh discovered its medicinal qualities.
   These labours of Liebig appeared at first to the masses as a useless
toying with chemistry, and were often laughed at. To this the very
unusual names selected may possibly have contributed : as an instance
we may mention      the following  : — When   he found out the composition
of  a to him   most important compound, which he looked upon as alcohol
which    had parted with some of its hydrogen, he named the new sub
stance Aldehyde, an abbreviation of alcohol dehydrogenisatus.           This
strangely sounding word excited the astonishment or even the derision
of those who had been accustomed to hear new mineral substances
named either after the places where they had been discovered or after
their inventors, or after distinguished or influential persons, or to hear
people speak of Scheele's and Schweinfurt green or Berlin blue.
   For Liebig the chief difference between organic and inorganic sub
stances was that      the former  contain  compound radicals,   whereas the
latter are similarly built up of elements. A joint research of Liebig and
Wohler on the subject of compound radicals was fruitful of important
results.    They examined oil of bitter almonds and benzoic acid, and
discovered    the radical benzoyl, a group of three elements, which was
capable of combining like an element with chlorine, hydrogen, &c.
    Berzelius was greatly interested in this discovery, and declared that it
 was the dawn     of   a new  day in Vegetable Chemistry.       He went so
 far as to say that he would like to see the first radical discovered,
 which consisted of more thau two simple substances, named Proin or
 Orthrin.
    Xo man is infallible; and Liebig, of course, made occasional mistakes.

                                      xxxi
 It  is said by Dr. Pettenkofer that if he thought a substance was this or
 that, or contained some particular body, he would frequently ask a student,
 in whom    he had confidence, to examine the substance. If the student failed
 to find at once what     Liebig expected, his confidence in the skill of the
 student always fell much more quickly than his confidence in the justice
 of his original idea. He would even naively say, " But you must find
 it." If the student still failed to find it he would sink still lower in
 Liebig's opinion, but would be sure to raise himself again if he took an
independent tone and gave indisputable proofs that Liebig's idea was
 erroneous, and suggested a better explanation of the phenomena.            Of
 course it was natural that this habit of adherence to an idea once taken
 up increased on Liebig with years.
    But what furthered Liebig's progress so much alongside with his
 unusual mental gifts and quickness of comprehension was his methodical
 way of working. He saved himself and others an immense amount of
 time in research by adopting good methods.
    Liebig had learnt elementary analysis with Thenard and Gay-Lussac ;
 but when he set to work with such intensity at Giessen to determine
the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen of organic bodies, it must have been
 most annoying to himj to require so much time and apparatus.         Just as
 he had in his early years at Erlangen made up his mind that he must go
to Paris to complete his education, so he now saw that he must contrive
a simpler method     of elementary analysis if Organic Chemistry was to be
developed.      This important task occupied him for some years, but he
accomplished it at last.       By degrees he got the apparatus into such a
simple and sure form that it surpassed in quickness and accuracy the
ordinary methods of mineral analysis.         This being accomplished, the
 questions about the quantitative composition of organic bodies could now
be easily answered.
    The five-bulb   apparatus which Liebig contrived to make out of glass
tubing enabled him to absorb with facility and accuracy the carbonic acid
formed by the combustion of organic bodies. It has become an emblem of
the Giessen school. Probably the most important service rendered by Liebig
to science was the establishment of the Giessen School of Chemistry.       He
had experienced in his own person the difficulty of getting a training in
the higher branches of the science from the lack of chemical schools.
This difficulty had at length been overcome in his case ; but only his
individual wants were thus satisfied by his accidental meeting with A.
von     Humboldt, by whose means he wa3 admitted to Gay-Lussac's
Laboratory. What he had obtained by a happy accident he made acces
sible to all ill Germany.      The founding of the Chemical Laboratory in
Giessen, for purposes of public and practical instruction, was quite an
epoch in the history of science. "What unexampled activity reigned in
those Chemical Halls ! There met and worked from morning to evening
the future professor of chemistry, the future manufacturer.           All the

                                         XXX11
   dialects of Germany might be heard there, nay every European language,
   and in one hall, somewhat predominating, the English language — all
   mixing and yet in order, for every one felt that he was striving for a
   noble object ; he was serving science ; in other words, he was a pupil of
   Liebig.     And how inspiriting was this meeting together of earnest
  youths under such a master ! Many a noble and life-long friendship was
  founded by community of work and aims.           And Liebig had mostly a bit
  of good advice or a happy thought, which helped one who had got into
  either a scientific or an experimental difficulty, and which would float
  him again in the right direction.
      All who know what this school of Liebig on the Lahn was, and what
  other opportunities there existed for chemical study, will easily compre
  hend that there was a time when any one who had a longing for
  thorough chemical study felt an irresistible call to Giessen.        Liebig is
  much to be applauded and admired in that he knew* so clearly the kind
 of school he must make in order to effect real good. Others before him
 had felt that chemical students ought to do practical work in the labora
 tory   ; but they had not the support of public opinion, or of the governing
 bodies of educational institutions, and were not strong enough to break
 through the hindrances around them.           It is even told that when one
 professor at a small University attempted to have a little practical school
 of Chemistry,      his colleagues regarded it as a useless squandering of
 reagents and coals ; and the few students who went to this class were
 quite pitied by the rest for their credulity in fancying the professor
 would be so foolish as to show them the right operations and make them
 professors too.
     From the very first Liebig went on the principle of teaching his pupils
 chemistry without any reference to special applications, and of putting
 them in possession of the knowledge which they were afterwards to
apply.       The application he left to themselves.       Just then many so-
 called technical schools were being founded where it was intended that
 only such parts of natural       science should be  taught as were useful for
some branch of industry.         In   such a school the future brewer should
 study malt and hops, the dyer colours, the agriculturist soils and
manures, and so on, but not be burdened with subjects of which the
pupil iu his future career was not likely to make any practical applica
tion.      Liebig stedfastly opposed this unintelligent utilitarianism.
     People in great technical businesses soon began to see how perfectly
in the right Liebig was iu this idea ; and he was constantly applied to,
not merely for chemical teachers, but even for chemists, and not merely
for chemists to assist in chemical works and soda manufactories, but
for paper manufactories, colour works, breweries, &c.
    In this way not merely eminent investigators and teachers came forth
from Liebig's school, but many very distinguished practical men. Two
other subjects yet remain to be mentioned           to complete the picture of

Xiiebig's       scientific           '
and       his '
                Letters on Chemistry.'
      Before Liebig's time there was no periodical which was exclusively
devoted to Chemistry. Chemistry was then more nearly connected with
pharmacy; and as in the practice of pharmacy the results of chemistry
came so closely into application, Liebig's first researches were published
in      the Magazine for Pharmacy founded by the apothecary Hiinle, and
afterwards continued by the apothecary Geiger in Heidelberg.
      In    the year 1832 Liebig founded, in conjunction with Geiger, the
' Annalen        der Pharmacie,' which now became entirely his organ.        With
the      publication of the 33rd volume, "Wohler became one of the editors, and
 the     title was changed to ' Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie,' in order,
 as Liebig said, to bring the title and the contents more into unison.
 Later on Kopp, and still later Erlenmeyer and Volhard, all pupils of
 Liebig, joined in the editing.
       The ' Chemical Letters,' as is well known, originated in a series of essays
 published in the Augsburg Gazette.               These letters were remarkable
 specimens of exact science popularized for educated people.
       Liebig's active mind led him to an earnest consideration of the chemi
 cal processes involved in agriculture and physiology.         Having paid more
  attention to the study of organic bodies than any other chemist, he
  naturally felt a desire to consider these substances in connexion with
  their functions, and the circumstances under which they were developed.
  How fruitful his labours were in this direction is already well known.
       "What is called Liebig's agricultural chemistry was developed in two
  periods. The first period from 1840 to 1846 in Giessen, and the second
  from 1856 to 1862 in Munich, whither he migrated in 1852. His views
  on vegetable and animal physiology were first expounded in               a work
  which was published by Vieweg in Brunswick              in  1840, with  the title
  " Die Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologic"
       This book originated in the following manner : — The British Associa
   tion for the Advancement of Science, at its Liverpool Meeting in 1837,
   requested Liebig to publish a report of the present state of knowledge in
   the department of Organic Chemistry.           He expressed his willingness to
   do so, but proposed that Dumas should share the task with him.          Dumas
   seemed disinclined, and Liebig brought out his 'Agricultural Chemistry.'
   The result of its publication was astonishing.       It went through no less
   than six important editions in six consecutive years, and excited an
    immense amount of interest.        The stir made by this book was so great
    that Dumas, as the first chemical authority in France, felt it necessary
    one year later to publish a somewhat similar work in the French lan
    guage, and formally to claim for France on this occasion the main prin
                                             " Elles appartiennent u notre dcole
    ciples enunciated in Liebig's work :
     dont l'esprit est venu s'exercer sur ce terrain nouveau."
        Many of Liebig's countrymen expressed strong dissent from his views        ;
    VOL.  xxiv.                                                         d

and Berzelius at first expressed himself as very doubtful about them, and
after some years got into actual hostility with Liebig about this applica
tion of chemistry, which he called " Probabilitats-Theorien."             In his
 Jahresbericht of 1841, Berzelius said that Liebig's book was executed
 with all the talent which one would expect of so distinguished an author,
 but he does not conceal his opinion that Liebig had erected an edifice
 which was but too insecure.        He said that Boussingault was working in
 the same field as Liebig, but was taking the long and difficult road,
 answering every inquiry by one or more experiments, that he did not
 give his answers so quickly, but they might be relied on.
     This partly cautious, partly dissentient, and partly actually hostile
 attitude of the agriculturists, physiologists, and chemists seemed only to
 tune to a louder key the enthusiasm and applause of the general public ;
  but this was probably no satisfaction to Liebig, for of all the applauding
  crowd who besides his own pupils surrounded him, not one was able to
  bring Berzelius     over to different views, to weaken the experiments of
  Braconnot, and the objections of Boussingault, or to convince the scep
  tical agriculturists and controversial physiologists.
      Then, perhaps for the first time in his life, Liebig may have oft felt
  right lonely, despite the homage of the masses ; for even his best friends
  and scholars saw too well that Liebig in this high flight (this book) had
  often maintained more than he had proved, that the proof was in many
  points still wanting.
      At no time did Liebig profess to be the first who had made chemical
  experiments in agriculture.       In fact, in the dedication of his book to
                                            I
  Alexander von Humboldt, he says, " hardly know whether even a part
  of the little work which     I make bold to dedicate to you is my own."
      What, then, was it which caused so much excitement ? It was the idea
  which Liebig brought so prominently forward, that plants alone are
  capable of assimilating inorganic materials, such as carbonic acid, water,
   and ammonia, and of building up complex substances such as albumen,
   starch, and fat, &c. ; while animals live upon these complex products
   and reduce them to simpler ones.
      Liebig undertook the determination       of the ashes in several parts of
   many varieties of plants and from different localities.       He cared little
   for analyses of soils hitherto considered so important, especially how
   much humus an earth contained, but he wanted specially to know what
   each plant did with the earth on which it grew.
      It soon appeared that all plants    leave qualitatively  the same mineral
   constituents   in their ashes, but that every kind of plant,  so to say, yields
   its own peculiar ash, inasmuch as different kinds, even when growing on
   the same soil, take up its mineral constituents in very different propor
  tions.     It was soon found that wheat, rye, barley, &c. have their
   distinct  ashes, also the grains of a corn compared      to the corresponding
  straws.

                                     XXXV
     As it was not enough to know the   ashes of a particular plant grown
in a particular region, but was desirable to get them from as many
different plants, fields, and regions as possible, so Liebig procured ashes
from all possible localities.  Just as a merchant writes letters of busi
ness to all parts, so Liebig sent about letters everywhere for analyses of
ashes.
     In order
           to make the work of analysis as easy as possible, his pupils Will
and Fresenius had worked out and published an excellent method of ash
analysis ; and in a short time thousands of analyses were made of the
most different plants and parts of plants in very different localities. He
found that each plant takes an exact quantity of mineral matter and in
an exact proportion, which may be recovered again from its ashes ; and
he concluded that whatever else the plant requires for the formation of
its combustible constituents is derived from the carbonic acid, water,
and ammonia of the air.     From these views Liebig laid down the rule
that to keep a wheat or corn-field fertile one has only to return to it the
mineral constituents which have been taken out by the crops, and in the
proportions in which those minerals are present in the ashes of each
crop.
   Liebig induced the distinguished alkali manufacturer Muspratt, in
Liverpool, to prepare mineral manures for wheat, rye, oats, clover,
potato, and other fields.    The different manures were manufactured
according to a method invented by Liebig, which consisted in melting
together the necessary substances, so that salts easily soluble in water
were brought into an almost insoluble form that the rain might not carry
them off out of reach of the germinating     seed.  Liebig was as much
convinced of the soundness of his mineral theories as of the working
power of his mineral manure.    But matters turned out differently from
what he anticipated, and a heavy trial was in store for his great genius.
   The English agriculturists saw no result from his artificial manure,
ceased to buy     it,
                 and again had recourse to dung and        other substances,
and the factory in Liverpool ceased to work. Nay,          even Liebig was
himself convinced           by
                       his unsuccessful experiments        in agriculture   in
Giessen that his mineral manure could not make         a   barren   soil more
fertile.One single ray of hope came to cheer him after years of failure.
Itturned out that after    length of time those fields when no longer
                                 a
manured at length became more fertile.    But here again was        new
                                                                      a
riddle for him.
    Meanwhile adversaries rose up, not merely to expose the uselessness
of his manure, but also to show that new methods must be adopted
in order to reach practical end.
                        a
    In the foreground stood an English agriculturist, Lawes, who soon
joined with an excellent chemist, Gilbert, and made on one of his estates
experiments with all sorts of manures, which they manufactured and
tried in many different ways.    It was shown that the more soluble         a

                                          xxx vi
substance    is,   the more effect   it  that the yield of a field
                                          has   ;                     often       is
increased merely       by
                       the addition of bone-ash rendered    soluble by sul
phuric acid (so-called superphosphate)     but that above all ammonia and
                                                    ;
aramoniacal salts, or, as they at last boldly stated           it,
                                                         combined nitrogen
must be added to the fields iu order to secure good crops        and for  ;            a
while the value of      amanure was simply estimated                 by
                                                             the amount of
 nitrogen   itcontained, whereas Liebig's theory had pointed out the
atmosphere as     sufficient source of supply of ammonia.
                   a
    Liebig's adversaries   were at this time banded together under the
appellation of Nitrogenists (StkhsUiffltr).             They thought they had driven
Liebig for ever from the field.
   In spite of all Liebig remained true to his theory and would not yield.
He controverted the conclusions of Lawes and Gilbert, but without
success.    The President of the English Agricultural Society, Pusey,
ranged   himself   distinctly on the side of Lawes and Gilbert.         As the
masses only judge          results, the sale of the book
                            by                                Chemie in ihrer
                                                                     '
Anwendung     auf  Agricultur   und  Physiologic,' which at first could not be
printed fast enough, became smaller and smaller, and after 1846 no new
edition appeared.
   In his latest writings on the subject of the mineral theory Liebig
acknowledged that ammonia may with advantage be supplied to cereal
and some other crops in the manure    but contended at the same time
                                                    ;
                                      "                    "
that  itwas naturally included among    mineral substances    which he
had originally referred to. As, however, he had clearly explained that
the ashes of   plant contain the mineral substances which ought to be
                   a
added to the soil for the growth of such plant, the statement that
ammonia     really
            is       mineral compound, and ought to be included in his
                       a
rule regarding mineral substances, really conceded in substance the
argument of his opponents.
  Since the year 1845 Liebig had paid more and more attention to the
second part of the task which he had set himself in 1840, the application
of chemistry to animal physiology, and was in full work at this when
King Maximilian II. entered into        correspondence with him with the
                                                a
view of calling him to Munich.    Liebig had in the course of his distin
guished career declined so many calls (shortly before this one   brilliant    a
call to Heidelberg), that they had little hope of persuading the eminent
man to come to Munich, but they induced him nevertheless.         To his
honour be   itsaid he did not in the least render the task more difficult
 bygreat pretensions, merely stipulating that he should not be required
to conduct so large   laboratory as he had done at Giessen, so that he
                         a
might have more time for his own work.      His migration took place in
the autumn of 1852, when in his 49th year.
   After some time he resumed at Munich his agricultural experiments,
and at last found out why his mineral manure had not the desired effect,
and why (lung and even mere ammoniacal salts alone had so great an effect.

    In  the year 1862 appeared his great work, in two volumes,
                                                                            «

cheinische Process der Ernahrung        der Vegetabilien  und   die Naturgesetze
des Feldbaues.'       This was tha crowning work of Liebig's agricultural
labours, and his doctrine is now universally recognized ; and no thought
ful agriculturist ever now supposes that he need but add superphos
phate or nitrogen or guano and his fields will be for ever fertile. It is
now in agriculture but a question of the best appliances necessary to do
justice to the theory of Liebig. In Germany agriculturists have thank
 fully acknowledged this by the foundation of the Liebig Stiftung.
     In close connexion with the subject of nutrition is Liebig's work on
 flesh, which first gave us a more exact idea of the chemical composition
 of muscle, that is by far the greatest and most massive part of our
 bodily organs.      One result of this work is the Liebig's Meat Extract,
 now well known to the whole world, of which so much has been said,
 and whose value has been as often over- as underrated.
     Liebig spent the remainder of his life at Munich, where he died on
 the 10th of   April, 1873.
     AuGtrsTE   Abthur     de la Btve, born at Geneva on the 9th of October,
 1801, was the son of Charles Gaspard de la E.ive, Professor of Chemistry
 and Physics in the Academy of Geneva.           He studied first at the College
 and then at the Academy.           After working at science for a time he
 devoted himself to the study of law for two or three years.              He had
 inherited his father's taste for science.       In the year 1822 he became
 deeply   interested   in Ampere's investigations ; and when Ampere's theory
 of the magnet had lost its best support, the young Auguste de la Eive
 came to his assistance.      He performed    a series of  delicate experiments,
 which    Ampere     came   expressly  to Presinge,   the country place of the
 De la Eives, to witness.       The memoir " On the Influence of Terrestrial
 Magnetism upon a movable frame traversed by a Voltaic Current,"
 written by the young physicist on this occasion, contains not only the
 new results which he had obtained, but the learned and conclusive theory
 by which Ampere connects them with his own views, thenceforth com
 pletely triumphant. This first research not only brought him into con
 nexion with Ampere, but paved the way for his long and intimate
 friendship with Faraday.
     In October 1823 he gave up his legal studies and succeeded M. Prevost
 as Professor of Physique Generale at the Academy.            On the occasion of
 his candidateship he published a thesis, " Dissertation sur la partie de
 l'optique qui traite des courbes dites caustiques."        He had also to give
  some lessons at the Academy and a public conference on the theory of
 the pendulum.        On the death of M. A. Pictet in 1825 he resigned the
 chair of Physique Generale to succeed to that of Experimental Physics.
 He often gave, in addition to his regular lessons, some special course on
 Electro-chemistry, or courses for a general audience, conjointly with
 M. Marcet, besides others for the industrial classes.

                                       xxxvni
     Auguste  de la   Eive contributed evidence in favour of the general   con
clusion that it is as impossible to create force as to create matter.       He
also gave much attention to the cause of the Aurora Borealis, taking up
the subject where Arago had left it; and by means of an apparatus
arranged by himself ho was able to 6ho\v the chief peculiarities of this
phenomenon.        By the passage of electricity through a rarefied gas be
caused the appearance of a luminous ring animated with a rotatory
movement round this same pole. This experiment is so remarkable that
it will always bo admired even by those physicists who, considering the
aurora to have its source higher up than the terrestrial atmosphere, at
tribute to it a cosmical origin, which De la Rive would never admit.
     Shortly before he was attacked by the malady which finally killed him,
he wrote to Dumas, " Aidez-moi b. defendre une theorie fondee sur des
faits incontestables ; elle ctait deji eelle de Franklin et d'Arago, avec
 moins de precision.      Les auteurs qui ne songent qu'aux aurores bril-
 lantes oublient que presque tous les jours il y en a qui se passent sans
 eclat, dans les regions polaires ; je ne connais pas un seul observateur
 place dans nos contrees septentrionales qui n'ait ndopte les vues que j"ai
 exposees.    N'est-ce pas une presomption en leur faveur que d'avoir pour
 elles tous ceux qui vivent au milieu des phenomenes qu'elles cherchent
 a expliquer ?     Faudrait-il les abandonner, quand on a seulement contre
 elles ceux qui ne les observent que de loin en loin, sous l'impression
 aveuglante d'une surprise qui ne laisse pas toujours une entiere liberty
                    "
 d'appreciation ?
     In connexion with this subject we may mention that Auguste de la
 Bive and his friend M.       de  Marignac made experiments      to show that
 ozone is modified      oxygen,   oxygen   which has undergone a change by
 the action of electricity.
     The investigations of Auguste de la Bive gave rise to a new and
 now flourishing branch of industry, Galvanic Gilding.            Hitherto the
 only effectual method known of gilding bronze was by the use of
 mercury; but the process was most injurious to the workmen, as
 their hands came in contact with the dangerous metal, and their chests
  were exposed to the action of mercury vapour during the heating opera
  tion.   A prize had been offered by the French Academy to any one who
  could find  a method which should remove the dangers from this trade ;
  but nobody had hitherto solved the problem.          The Academy has since
  been more fortunate.     The process of galvanic gilding has been developed ;
  and we must not forget Hint the learned and disinterested physicist
  Auguste   de la  Bive with his own hands gilded the first pieces by the
  electric process.     He it was who showed how to put nn end to the dis
  tressing bodily and mental sufferings of these workmen.          For this dis
  covery, published    in 1640,  he received the Prix Monthyon  of  3000 francs
 from the French Academy.
      A. de la Bive made numerous observations on the causes of the
   second reflections seen at sunset on Mont Blanc, and attributed them to

                                      XXXIX
the last rays of tha sua falling on    soma layers of vapour collected     in the
upper regions of the atmosphare.       He showed that these vapours, them
selves  characteristic  of  fine weather, are formed by actual particles of
dust &c, whether mineral or organic, suspended in the air, where they
 float when dry, falling to the ground when made heavy by moisture.
 "When abundant they cause a haziness of the atmosphere, when in small
  quantity the clearness of the atmosphere returns.
     Even the insects fluttering about obey this law. If swallows skim the
  ground at the approach of rain and reascend in fine weather, it is because
  in the first case the insects charged with damp cannot rise, and in the
  second case are relieved from this weight and mount high up in the air.
      A. de la Rive took a deep interest in political questions. Ho was
   always liberal in his views, but at the same time determined to resist
  extreme democracy.
     After the revolution of Geneva, at the period of the war of the Son-
   derbund, he resigned his professorship and gave up public life. He
   was, however, on the occasion of the annexation of Savoy to France,
   appointed to watch over the interests of the Helvetic Confederation in
   London. He was received with great distinction by the Queen, and on
   his return made one of the Assembly elected to revise the constitution
   of Geneva.   After this work was accomplished he retired entirely from
   public affairs.
       In the spring of 1873 he was attacked with paralysis, but was, never
   theless, able to read in a feeble voice on June 5th his annual report to
   the Societe de Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle.              In the November
   following he    had a severe  stroke   of paralysis  .on his way to Cannes, but
   managed to reach Marseilles, where he died on the 27th.

        De la Rive's principal work was the Traite d'Electricitd Theorique et
    Appliquee,' in three volumes, which appeared between the years 1854
    and 1858, in which he published his theory of the Aurora Borealis, first
    brought forward in 1854, and illustrated by the experiment now well
    known to physicists of rotating the voltaic arc of light around the pole
    of a magnet, as any other ponderable conductor would rotate.              This
    work was published simultaneously in France and England.
        During a period of fifty years he made many contributions to Science,
                                        '
    which were published in the           Memoires de la Societe de Physique et

    d'Histoire Universelle de Geneve or in the ' Bibliotheque Universelle.'
    Prom 1836 to 1845 he edited the literary and scientific parts of the
     '
       Bibliotheque Universelle,' which were then united.        He compiled alone,
     as supplementary to   it,  the Archives de rElectricitc,' in five volumes,
                                  '
     1841 to 1845, and conjointly with De Marignac and others the
    '
       Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles,' in thirty-six volumes,
     1846 to 1857, and the Nouvelle Pcriode           of the same Recueil, iu nine
                            '                    '
     volumes, 1858 to 1860.     He was also the author of numerous biographies

                                     xl
 and of papers on optics, critical and scientific notices.     He   took   an
active part in the Society for the Advancement of the Arts, and      was for
several years General President of the Society.      He twice presided, in
1845 and in 1805, over the Helvetic Society of Natural Sciences.       With
the  Prix Monthyon,  received from  the  Academic des Sciences  for electro
chemical gilding, he founded a quinquennial prize to be given to the
author of the discovery most useful to Genevese industry, and he
augmented this    sum by a legacy.      He was  a foreign member     of  the
French Academy and of the Eoyal Society.
