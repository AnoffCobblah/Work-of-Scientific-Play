     A paper was                “ Researches into the Structure of the'
                   read, entitled
 Spinal Cord.” By    Jacob  Lockhart Clarke, Esq. Communicated by
 Samuel Solly, Esq., F.R.S.     Received October 15, 1850.
    The author having undertaken a series of observations with the
 view of determining,     possible, the relations which appear to sub
                                 if
 sist between the spinal nerves and the respiratory nervous centres,
 was led into a  more extended inquiry than he at <U+FB01>rst contemplated,
 the results of which are communicated        this paper.
                                                        in  After stating
 that the observations were made, by means of         microscope 0f the
                                                                    a
_best construction, upon many thousand preparations         of the spinal
 cord of Man, of the Calf, Sheep, Pig, Dog, Cat, Rabbit, Guinea-pig
 and Frog, he describes the methods adopted in making these prepara
 tions. The following are the results of his observations.
    At the lower extremity of the spinal cord, the posterior gray sub
stance consists of    single mass, formed by the coalescence of the
                             a
two posterior horns, and consequently the gelatinous substance ex
tends across the middle line.   The anterior gray substance, however,
is divided by the anterior columns into two distinct horns, which
curve inwards and taper to       rounded point.
                                         a        The spinal canal                       is
                                                     '
large and nearer the anterior surface of the cord.
   The nerve-vesicles are scattered irregularly through the gray sub
stance.
   The <U+FB01>bres of the gray substance are of the tubular kind, and of'
small average diameter.      There are two classes with regard to di
rection, transverse and longitudinal.    Of the transverse, there are
two orders, the antero-posterior and latero-transverse.
   The antero-posterior are continuous with the posterior roots of the
PROCEEDINGS        OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.                     VOL.   VI. No.77.       1

                                    2
nerves, and probably with the anterior roots.       The latero-transverse
stretch between the‘opposite sides of the gray substance, forming its
transverse commissure.
    Longitudinal Fibres.-Those of the gelatinous substance, have the
characters of minute tubular <U+FB01>bres, presenting dark outlines and
frequent varicosities.    Their average diameter is the mix—nth of an
inch. They have no nuclei as generally stated, and have no resem
blance to the sympathetic <U+FB01>bres or caudate processes.         These <U+FB01>bres
are found through the rest of the gray substance, but in smaller
numbers; immediately below the gelatinous substance, however,
they form a remarkably dense band.
     Changes in the form of the gray substance are observed on ex
 amining the cord from below upwards.         The posterior mass is gra
 dually divided into two, and the gelatinous substance is interrupted
in the middle line.     Two vesicular masses gradually appear at the
 sides of the spinal canal, traversed by <U+FB01>bres from the posterior
 nerves, and from the transverse commissure.          The anterior horns
 also undergo certain changes, become club-shaped in the lumbar
 region, and contain large groups of caudate vesicles. In the middle
 of the dorsal region the posterior horns have again coalesced, and
 the gelatinous substance again crosses the middle line.         The ante
 rior horns are straight and narrow, and their vesicles are scattered
 through them irregularly. In the cervical enlargement the posterior
 gray substance has become again divided to its greatest extent into
 two horns, and the gelatinous substance is again interrupted in the
 middle.    The two vesicular masses from the sides of the spinal canal
 are here, as in the lumbar enlargement, included in the posterior
 horns. Here also, and in the lumbar enlargement, the anterior horns
 are nearly similar in appearance.
     The nucleus of vesicular substance, in which the spinal accessory
 nerve may be seen to arise, has been traced by the.author as low
  down in the cord as the upper part of the lumbar enlargement.
     The grayish structure immediately surrounding the spinal canal,
  consists chie<U+FB02>y of <U+FB01>bro-cellular tissue, and is not to be regarded as
  a commissure, as maintained by Stilling and Foville.          The spinal
  canal, as stated by the former observer, extends through the whole
  length of the cord.
     The vesicles of the cord are found chie<U+FB02>y in the anterior horns,
  as usually stated, but occur also in the dark masses situated in the
  dorsal region at the sides of the spinal canal; and also more spa
  ringly in the posterior horns as far as the gelatinous substance.    The
  author has never been able to make out satisfactorily in mammalia,
  any connection between the nerve-vesicles and the tubular nerves,
  nor between the latter and the caudate processes.
      The blood-vessels of the cord enter through the anterior and pos
  terior median <U+FB01>ssures, through the smaller <U+FB01>ssures in the white
   columns, and at the roots of the nerves. They form a beautiful net
   work of' loops along the whole periphery of the gray substance.
      Of the WhiteColumns of the Cord—The anterior columns have
   no proper transverse commissural <U+FB01>bres, but are crossed horizontally

                                     3
but chie<U+FB02>y obliquely, by tubular nerve-<U+FB01>bres and blood-vessels,
which proceed from the gray substance on each side and decussate
in front of the spinal canal: nor are the posterior white columns
connected by any commissural <U+FB01>bres, the posterior <U+FB01>ssure reaching
down to the gray substance.
    Origin of the Spinal Nerves.-—The posterior roots are attached
exclusively to the posterior columns.       Their <U+FB01>brils generally are
<U+FB01>ner than those of the anterior roots.      The anterior roots are at
tached to the anterior parts of the antero-lateral columns, which they
traverse horizontally in straight bundles, till they reach the anterior
horns, in which they break up and form a complicated network.
The author has not yet been able to determine whether any of the
<U+FB01>bres of the spinal nerves ascend with the longitudinal white columns.

Esq., F.R.S.    Received November 18, 1850.
    This paper is a continuation of a series of investigations intended
to elucidate the nature of vegetables by means of chemical reagents.
 A preceding paper contained an account of the effects produced
by the action of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids on the matiére
incrustante of several plants belonging to different great classes of
vegetables.    The effects of nitric acid upon a variety of vegetable
groups are now described; the researches having been undertaken
in the hope that by means of this powerful reagent some light might
perhaps be thrown on peculiarities in their respective

 exhausted with boiling water. The dark-coloured bitter-tasted liquid
 which it yielded was evaporated to the state of an extract, which
was digested for nearly twenty-four hours with dilute nitric acid.
 This strongly acid solution was evaporated to dryness on the water
 bath, the dried residue was dissolved in a considerable quantity of
 hot water, and the solution after cooling was carefully <U+FB01>ltered.    The
 clear liquid, after concentration to a very moderate bulk, was exactly
 saturated with carbonate of potash.       A yellow crystalline sediment
 quickly appeared.      It consisted of nitropicrate of potash, and the
potash salt of a new acid, to which the author has given the name of
nitropopulic acid. The mixed potash salts were then collected on a.
<U+FB01>lter, dried by pressure, and were treated with a cold solution of
dilute carbonate of potash, which readily dissolved out the nitro
populate of potash, while it left the nitropicrate of that base unacted
on.    The two salts were then separated by <U+FB01>ltration, the nitropi
 crate remaining on the <U+FB01>lter, while the nitropopulate was dissolved
 in the alkaline liquid.   The solution was next slightly supersaturated
with hydrochloric acid, when the nitropopulate of potash precipi
tated as a compact crystalline powder, which was puri<U+FB01>ed by re
peated crystallizations out of hot water.        When pure, the potash
salt, which crystallizes in small lemon-yellow prisms, is boiled with
a. considerable   excess of hydrochloric acid, and, on the cooling of
the solution, the nitropopulic acid is deposited in silky needles,
forming concentric groups of a. pale yellow colour. By digestion
with animal charcoal, the nitropopulic acid is rendered perfectly
colourless.    It is very soluble in water, and still more so in weak
and strong spirits of wine.        By digestion with strong nitric acid,
it is rapidly converted into nitropicric acid. In several of its cha
racters nitropopulic acid bears a considerable resemblance to indi
gotic acid. When subjected to analysis, the formula of nitropopulic
acid dried in the air, was found to be C], H, NQ O,3+HO+2Aqu;
that of the acid dried at 212° F., CH H, N2 O,3+HO.
    The potash, silver, soda and baryta salts were also analysed.
    The Populus nigm, when treated with nitric acid, was also found
to yield nitropopulic acid, which appears therefore to be character
istic of the poplar tribe.
    An extract was also prepared from Salix russelliana, or the Bed
ford-willow, which, when it was digested with dilute nitric acid,
yielded a great deal of oxalic and nitropicric, but no nitropopulic
acid. Extracts of the Cytisus labumum, or the laburnum-tree; of
the Swetenia mahogam', or the mahogany-tree; of the Pyms malus,
or the apple-tree; of the Cratcegus ozyacantka, or the hawthorn;
of the Ribes m'grum, or the black currant bush ; of the Betula alnus,
or the alder; of the Ulea: europteus, or the furze; of the Calluna
vulgaris, or common heather; of the root of the Curcuma longa, or
turmeric; of the seeds of the Biwa orellana, or annotto; of the
Sambucus m'gra, or the elder; of the Cytz'sus scoparius, the Spar

                                        5
tium. scoparium       of Linn., or common broom, when treated with
dilute nitric acid, also yielded oxalic and nitropicric acids. The ex
tracts of Quercus robur, or common oak, and of Bemla alba, the
birch-tree, when digested with nitric acid, only yielded oxalic acid,
 but no nitropicric or any analogous nitrogenated acid.
     The results of these experiments seem to indicate therefore that
 a far greater number of plants are capable of yielding nitropicric
 acid than has generally been supposed, those which fail to do so
 constituting a. very small minority.
     As the extract of broom, Spartium scoparium, besides yielding
 nitropicric acid, exhibited some interesting peculiarities, it was sub
jected to a more minute examination.            When an aqueous decoc
 tion of broom was concentrated to about a tenth of its bulk, and
 set aside in a. cool situation for twelve hours, it gelatinized into a
 greenish-brown coherent mass, which was thrown upon a <U+FB01>lter and
 washed with a little cold water.         It consisted chie<U+FB02>y of a yellow
 crystallizable    colouring matter (scoparine, the diuretic principle
 of broom), which was at <U+FB01>rst contaminated with a considerable
 amount of chlorophyl.         It also contained a small quantity of a.
 volatile organic base (sparteine, the narcotic principle of broom),
 the greater portion of which however remained in the mother
 liquors.
     The coparine. when puri<U+FB01>ed by repeated crystallizations          out of
hot water and spirits of wine, formed pale yellow prisms of a feeble
 acid character.       Its formula was found to be C,l H11 010.         Sco
 parine acts as a powerful diuretic.
     The mother-liquor from the crude scoparine, after having been
 concentrated to a very moderate bulk, was distilled along with a.
 considerable excess of soda, when a colourless .basic oil slowly col
 lected at the bottom of the receiver.       This oil was the volatile base
 sparteine.     It has a strongly alkaline reaction, completely neutral
 izing the most powerful acids. It is but slightly soluble in acids,
 but readily dissolves both in alcohol and in arther. It boils at about
 550° F.      The taste of its salts is very bitter.   The formula of this
 base is C15 Hl3 N. The nitrate, sulphate and hydrochlorate of spar
teine are exceedingly soluble, and crystallize with great dif<U+FB01>culty.
 The nitropicrate of sparteine forms long, slender brittle needles, un
 distinguishable from nitropicrate of potash. Its formula is C15 1-1,, N,
 HO, C“ H, N, 0,3.
     The double chloride of platinum and sparteine crystallizes in rect
 angular prisms.       This salt contains two equivalents of water, which
 it loses at 266° F. Its formula, when dried at 212° F., is C,5 H13 N,
  HCl+ Pt Cl,+2HO.
     The double mercurial salt crystallizes in large, right rhombic
 prisms, exhibiting the diamond lustrer Its formula is CH H,3 N,
 HCl, Hg Cl.
     Sparteine    appears to be a strong    narcotic poison, though much
inferior in this respect to either nicotine or coneine.
     It is plain, therefore, that in employing a decoction of broom-tops

                                     6
in dropsical affections, as has hitherto been the practice, the patient
is subjected to the narcotic in<U+FB02>uence of the sparteine, as well as to
the diuretic effects of the scoparine, a result which in general is not
likely to be desirable.     The author does not, however, think it is at
all necessary to employ chemically pure scoparine for medical pur.
poses.      If a decoction of broom be evaporated to dryness on the
water-bath, then treated with a little dilute hydrochloric acid, the
 mixture thrown upon a <U+FB01>lter and washed with a small quantity of
 cold water, almost the whole of the sparteine will be removed, and
 the dark green gelatinous mass remaining on the <U+FB01>lter will be found
 to possess the diuretic without the narcotic properties of the plant.

  SIR BENJAMIN C. BRODIE, Bart, Vice-President, in the Chair.
     Captain Lefroy, R.A., was admitted into the Society.
     The following communication received from Professor Hermann
  Schlagintweit was read :—
     “ Results of Observations on the Distribution of Temperature in
 the Alps.”
     1. The greatest irregularities and the most considerable local in
 <U+FB02>exions of isothermals are observed at the lower heights.
     2. Generally speaking, the depression of temperature is also very
  sensible at stations in the Alps when proceeding from south to north;
  and the eastern parts are colder than the western.       One degree of
  latitude produces in the plain of Lombardy a difference of tem
  perature amounting to 0°'7 C. In the interior parts of the Alps the
  difference is O°'5 to 0°‘6 C.
     3. If we consider the isothermal lines on a longitudinal pro<U+FB01>le of
  the Alps, we <U+FB01>nd that their forms show some connexion with the
  mean elevation of the different parts of the Alps.      The isothermals
  rise where the mean elevation is greater; they sink at the borders
  and on smaller groups. This convexity of the isothermal lines in the
  centre of the Alps is still more considerable if we represent by them
  the temperature of the earth, since the latter is still more intimately
  connected with the mass of the mountains, with the insulation and
  radiation of the rocky substance; whilst for the temperature of the
  air, differences of that kind are more eliminated by its mobility.
     4-. The vertical distances of two isothermals are the greatest near
  the base of the Alps, attain afterwards a minimum, and become in
  the higher parts again a little greater. The position of the minimum
  takes place in the Northern Alps and the group of the St. Gothard
  at nearly 6000 French feet; in the central parts at nearly 7000; for
  the group of Mont Blanc it seems to be at a still greater elevation.
     5. The height corresponding to a depression of temperature of

                                      7
 1° C. is in the mean 540 F. feet=90 toises= 166 metres, if we
 compare the lowest stations of continued observation with the
 highest stations; but if we consider the temperature of the highest
 summits, the height becomes rather less (510 feet for the Central
 Alps   .
    6. )The  mean temperature     of the air seems to be, for the highest
 summits, from —13° to —15° C.
    7.  At the greater elevations the temperature of single months is
 generally altered  in this manner:—The temperatures of February
 and January, of August and July, differ less from each other than
 they do at lower stations.
    8. The in<U+FB02>uence of the general form of the surface on the tem
 perature is particularly evident when we consider the mean tempera
 ture of the months.     The valleys during the winter are in general
 colder than the mountains, the cold air sinking down and being ac
 cumulated in them; during the summer they are comparatively
 warmer, the heat being re<U+FB02>ected and radiated by the insulated masses
 near them, and circulation produced, especially in the horizontal
 direction: their climate is therefore subject to greater extremes,
 though in the annual mean it scarcely differs from the Alps in general.
 The declivities during the winter are comparatively warmer, since the
 air near the surface, after sinking down in the valleys, is replaced
readily by less cold strata.       During the summer, particularly in
southern exposures, and if the relative height above the bottom of
the valley is not great, they are also a little warmer, since then
they can partially be reached by the ascending current of air. But
this increase of temperature being smaller than that of winter, these
situations have a more constant climate than the valleys. The mean
temperature of the year on declivities, particularly with southern
exposures, is therefore a little higher than the mean of the Alps in
general.
    9. Summits and declivities, with an exposure to north and to north
east, show also the character of a constant climate; but the tem
perature of summer is much lower, and consequently the annual
mean is also sensibly depressed.
    10. The depression of temperature with elevation is greater in
summer than in winter, amounting for example to 1° C. for 440 feet
in July, and for 710 feet in January.        The cause of this is, that in
the lower parts of the mountains the differences between single
                                                    \
months are greater than in the higher parts.
    11. The elevation   of the point,  near  which    on a vertical line the
depression   of temperature   is the greatest,  is a  di<U+FB02>'erent one in every
month. It is the highest, when the Alps are covered with snow, in
December and January; from March to September this point is
generally found near the limit of snow;    ‘
                                               in October and November
it lies below the snow-line.
    12. The height of the snow-line in the months does not coincide
always with the same isothermal.         In January the snow-line and
the isothermal of 0° are both nearly on the base of the Alps; but
from this time to July and. August, the isothermal of zero moves

                                          8
quicker upwards than the snow-line, and from August to January
quicker downwards.      The snow-line therefore in the <U+FB01>rst period
coincides with isothermals warmer than 0° C.; in July it is even
at +5° C.    The snow-line, in the usual sense, that is to say its
highest limits in summer,      at the mean temperature of the year,
                               is,
—4° C.
   13. Over large masses of snow and glaciers there          remarked,  is
particularly on <U+FB01>ne days,    descending current of air (glacier-wind),
                             a
which has great in<U+FB02>uence on the general depression of temperature
             a
near the limits of snow.
   14. The absolute extremes of' cold on single days are at the lower
stations sometimes so great, that they are comparatively but little
surpassed     by
               those on the higher points.      But the di<U+FB02>'erences be
tween the higher and lower part are much greater           we consider
                                                                   if
the maxima of heat.      The absolute maxima seem scarcely ever to
exceed 5° or 6° C. on the highest summits ol' the Alps. On all days
the decrease of temperature       greater at the time of the maximum
                                     is
than at the minimum.
   '15. Compared   therefore to the'temperature of high latitudes, the
summits of the Alps correspond nearly to 70° N. Lat.        But the cli
mate of the highest elevations on the Alps       much less severe than
                                                           is
that of Northern Asia, and         more constant than that of Polar
                                     is
America. Their minima of winter are much surpassed by nearly all
stations in northern latitudes; but the maxima of summer are
colder than those of nearly all points on [high latitudes at little ele
vation above the sea.

    The principal aim of the present communication was to point out
the proportion of the vertebrate animals in which the metapophysis,
anapophysis and hypapophysis were present, their principal modi<U+FB01>ca
tions, and their title to the distinct appellations bestowed upon them.
    The metapophysis is noticed by Monro, in 1726, as a small rising
between the roots of the superior oblique and transverse processes;
and both this and the anapophysis appear to be de<U+FB01>ned in similar
terms, as sometimes characterising                    the lumbar vertebrae, by Soem
mering. The author of the present paper commences his compara
tive anatomy of both processes by'describing them in the European,
 Polynesian and Australian varieties of the human race. He then
passes to the Quadrumana, and traces their modi<U+FB01>cations and pro
gressive development in the Chimpanzee, Orang-utan and Gibbon,
 in the Cercopitkecus Tuber, Semnopithecus entellus, Macacus rhesus,
Macacus m'yer, Illacacus nemestrinus, Papio mormon, Ateles pam's
ous, Ateles Beelzebuth, Cebus capucinus, Callithriz- sciureus, Lemur
nignfrons, Lemur Catta, Lichanotus Indri, and Stenops gracilis.
    In the order Carnivora, the same processes are described in the
 Lion, Hyaena, Wolf, Fox, Civet, Genette, Otter, Sable, Kinkajou,
 Mydaus, Badger, Bear and Seal. The presence of anterior articular
 pi‘oeesses (pre-zygapophyses) is demonstrated in all these Carnivora,
 in the anterior dorsal vertebra; and their apparently greater produc
 tion in the succeeding vertebrae is shown to be due to the gradual
transference of their articular surfaces upon the metapophyses, which
 are processes      distinctly superadded.
    In the Rodent Order,            the modi<U+FB01>cations of the metapophyses and
anapophyses are described in the common and Malabar Squirrels,
the Marmot, the Hydromys, the Rat, the Cape Jerboa, in which the
anapophyses attain their maximum of relative size; in the Beaver,

                                    10
  the Porcupine, the Coypu, the Paca, the Capybara, and in the Hare.
  The distinction between the metapophyses and the pre-zygapophyses
  is particularly strongly marked in the Capybara.
      In the Insectivora, the Hedgehog is an instance in which metapo
  physes are developed but not anapophyses.       The modi<U+FB01>cations of
  both processes are traced, in the Marsupial Order, in the Thylacine.
 the Dasyure, the Wombat, the Perameles, and in two species of
  Kangaroo.     The diapophyses being developed from the last as well
 as the antecedent dorsals in these marsupials, renders the homology
 of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae unmistakeable:
 but the diapophyses of those vertebra; are lengthened out by anchy
 losed pleurapophyses, of which those of the <U+FB01>rst lumbar vertebra in
 the Wombat, compared by the author, had not completely coalesced.
 In the Ornithorhynckus paradowus the metapophyses are double in
 some of the anterior dorsal vertebrae, but become single in the sixth
 dorsal, and gradually increase to the twelfth. The anapophyses are
rudimental.
     In the Ruminant Order, the accessory processes are described in
 the Elk, the Giraffe, the Gnu, the Equine Antilope, the Ox, the
 Aurochs, the Camel, the Vicugna, the Memmina, and the Musk-deer.
 The anapophyses are rarely, and then only very feebly developed;
 the metapophyses are constant; they appear as tubercles above the
 diapophyses in the anterior and middle dorsals, and pass upon the
 zygapophyses in the penultimate or last dorsal.    The author records
a peculiarity in the skeleton of a musk-deer (Moschus mosclii<U+FB01>rus).
In the pair of ribs attached to the thirteenth dorsal vertebra the
tubercle is wanting, and the diapophysis is obsolete, as in the last
dorsal vertebra of other illuschidm; but in the following vertebra,
answering to the <U+FB01>rst lumbar in other Mosckidm, the rib is developed
with a head and a distinct tubercle, articulated to an equally distinct
diapophysis.     This plainly demonstrates the homology of the diapo
physis in the next vertebra, answering to the second lumbar in
other Moschidw.
    There are no anapophyses in the Hog-tribe and Hippopotamus:
the metapophyses resemble those of the ruminant artiodactyles.
The perissodactyle Ungulates manifest some peculiarities. In the
Sumatran Tapir, e. g. the metapophysis is a very distinct process in
the third dorsal, subsides in the four next dorsals, and reappears as
a prominent process in those that follow, but does not attain the
position upon the zygapophysis except. in the last lumbar vertebrae.
In the Horse and Rhinoceros, as well as the Tapir, although there
are no proper anapophyses, the diapophysis of the last lumbar de
velopes an articular surface on its back part which articulates with
a corresponding      surface on the sacrum.   1n the vertebra; of the
Elephant a peculiarity is pointed out which is not adverted to by
Cuvier or De Blainville, and appears to have escaped notice, viz. an
accessory pair of joints between the metapophysis and anapophysis,
commencing between the seventeenth and eighteenth dorsals, and
continued to between the <U+FB01>rst and second lumbar vertebrae. The
metapophyses have been undescribed, also, in the Cetacea, although

                                     11

they are     represented inv the plates of the
stinctly from the anterior zygapophyses, and exist in many vertebrae
 after these processes with their articular surfaces have wholly dis
 appeared: the modi<U+FB01>cations of the metapophyses, and their mode
 and place of superseding the prezygapophyses, are described in the
 Delphinus      Tursio and D. Delphis: their modi<U+FB01>cations are also
 pointed out in the Dugong.       But the most remarkable development
 and complexity of the accessory exogenous processes is presented
 by certain members of the Order Bruta or Edenlata of Cuvier.
 The author commences with a description of them in the Sloths,
 and gives his reasons for considering the length of the neck in the
 three-toed species to be due to the superaddition of two cervicals
 between the dentata and eighth vertebra, which, from certain cha
 racters of its complex transverse process, he regards as homologous
 with the sixth cervical vertebra of the two-toed species.
     In the Cape Ant-eater (Orycteropus capensis), both metapophyses
 and anapophyses      are present on the eighth dorsal vertebra; the
 former are continued to near the end of the tail, the latter subside
 in the last lumbar. In the armadillos the metapophyses commence
 abruptly about the middle of the back, and progressively increase
 until they equal the long neural spines in height: they develope two
 articular surfaces, one on the inner side of their base, another on
 the outer side : the latter articulates with the anapophysis, which is
 remarkable for its thickness, and developes a-second inferior articular
 surface for the parapophysis, which, together with the diapophysis,
 is developed from all the lumbar vertebra.        These complex jomts
 are illustrated by drawings taken from two species of Armadillo.
     The exogenous processes present still greater complexity in the
 true Ant-eaters.      The metapophyses commence in the cervical
 region, change their place from the zygapophyses to the diapophyses
  in the anterior dorsals, and back again to the zygapophyses in the
 posterior dorsal and lumbar vertebrae, where they supersede those
 processes; and develope accessory articular surfaces for the anapo
 physes.     These not only present an upper articular surface for the
  metapopbysis, and a lower one for the parapophysis,           but de
  velope a. third outer one for a new articular surface upon the
 diapophysis; so that, were not the ordinary articular processes,
  or zygapophyses, obliterated in the posterior dorsal and lumbar
 vertebrae, there would be not fewer than eighteen synovial joints,
 in addition to the intervertebral joints, in the posterior lumbar
  vertebrae of the Great Ant-eater.      These processes and articula
  tions are illustrated by <U+FB01>gures taken from the Great Ant-eater;
  and the necessity of the substantive names for the processes, and of
  adjectives to signify their added articular surfaces, was exempli<U+FB01>ed
  in the explanation of those <U+FB01>gures.    The peculiar complexity of the
  vertebrae of the Edentata having been, previously to the investiga
  tions of the author, illustrated by a comparison with those of the
  Serpent tribe, he next enters upon the question of the precise nature
  and extent of this analogy, and showa that, although the complex
 joints in both are comparable to the tenon-and-mortice joints in

                                      12
 carpentry, they are produced by different processes in the Mammal
 and the Reptile.       The zygapophyses exist in both; to these, in the
 Mammal, are superadded the joints developed on metapophyses and
 anapophyses, which are below the zygapophyses ; but in the Serpents,
 the superadded joints are on parts which the author terms the ‘ zygo
                 ‘
 sphene’ and       zygantrum,’ and are above the zygapophyses.      Some
 characteristic differences are next pointed out in the Ophidian ge
 nera Coluber, Hydrus, Naja, Crotalus, Python, and the extinct
 genus of large serpents from British eocene strata called Palwophis.
 The author also points out that the tenon~-and-mortice joints are not,
 as was supposed, peculiar to the Ophidian reptiles, but exist in the
 Iguana, where they are likewise due to the superaddition of zygo
 sphenal and zygantral articulations.
    The author <U+FB01>nally enters upon the comparative anatomy of the
 ‘                    that name being applied to the process, commonly
   hypapophysis,’
 exogenous, from the under or ventral surface of the centrum, rarely
 autogenous from the same aspect of the capsule of the notochord.
 The modi<U+FB01>cations of the hypapophysis are exempli<U+FB01>ed in the Hare
and Rabbit, the Cape Jerboa, the Hydromys, the Phoca gmznlandica
and Leptong/x serrzdens, in the IIippopotamus, the Megaceros, the
Musk-deer, the Camel, the Giraffe, and other Ruminants. In the
  Ornithorhynchus the atlas is remarkable for a pair of hypapophyses,
like the <U+FB01>rst vertebra in the Sudis or Ampaz'ma gigas: but the most
remarkable instances of the development and modi<U+FB01>cation of the
hypapophysis are to be met with in the class of Birds.        It is there
well-marked in the anterior cervical vertebrae, especially in the den
tata, and reappears in the lower cervicals as a pair of processes, which
defend and sometimes encompass the carotid arteries, forming a
quasi-haemal arch, as in the Pelican.       The still more extraordinary
developments of the hypapophysis in the Aptenodytes and Sphwnis
cus are specially described and illustrated by <U+FB01>gures.      The modi<U+FB01>
cations of the same process are pointed out in some extinct Reptilia,
as e. g. the Crocodilus bast'<U+FB01>ssus, the Mososaurus, the Iguanodon and
the Ichthyosaurus: in the latter the hypapophysis is exogenous in
the neck, as in some Lizards, and forms the so-called ‘ wedge-bones :’
the part usually called ‘body of the atlas’ is serially homologous
with these; the true centrum of that vertebra being the so-called
odontoid process.         The memoir concludes with a demonstration of
the serial homology of the haemal arches of the tail, sometimes called
chevron-bones, and the essential distinction of the hypapophyses from
the hmmapophyses, and at the same time from the parapophyses, with
which the hypapophyses co-exist in the cervical and anterior thoracic
regions of the Crocodile.

  of Stars favourably situated for the investigation of Parallax con
  tained in Part      III.  of the Phil. Trans. for 1826, and in Part I. for
   1827."     By Lord Wrottesley, F.R.S. &c. Received November 14,
   1850.
      In Sir John Herschel’s papers above referred to, he shows that if
   a double star occupy a certain position with respect to the ecliptic,
  and one of the components be supposed to be very much nearer to
   the earth than the others, a considerable periodical and parallactic
  change will take place in their angle of position, and that the maxi
  mum _variations from the mean position will occur at two opposite
  seasons of the year, which indicate the best times of observation of
  the parallax of the star.          Sir John gives a list of stars thus favour
  ably   situated,   with   the coe<U+FB02>icients   of the maximum parallactic varia
- tion of the angles of position, and the times of their occurrence
  subjoined.
      Lord Wrottesley having erected at his seat in Sta<U+FB01>‘ordshire an
  observatory provided with a good equatorial, determined to devote
  the instrument to a good trial of the method, and the present paper
   contains the results of his observations and researches.
      The equatorial employed was that formerly belonging to Mr.
   Beaumont. Its telescope is of 10 feet 9 inches focal length, and the
   object-glass is of 7% inches clear aperture, and a good glass of its
   size.    The instrument is mounted according to the usual English
   method for a <U+FB01>xed observatory, viz. with a long polar axis resting
   in Y5 at each end.         This polar axis is 14 feet 3 inches long, and
   10 inches square in the middle, having pivots at the ends of hard
  bell-metal.       The Y!1 above and below are attached to massive stone
   piers, supported by a very <U+FB01>rm and large foundation of brick-work.
   The steadiness of the instrument is not satisfactory, compared with
  that' of some recently-established         equatorials. The observations were.
  made with a parallel-wire micrometer, containing one <U+FB01>xed and two

                                     14
 moveahle wires, and the value of its scale was well determined both
 by Mr. Beaumont and Lord Wrottesley.           The power usually em
ployed was 450.
     In the progress of the observations it was found that they were
 attended with considerable dif<U+FB01>culties, chie<U+FB02>y arising from the im
 practicability of obtaining a suf<U+FB01>cient number of observations at both
 the proper periods of the year, and also from the circumstance that
 many stars require to be observed at an inconvenient hour in the
 early morning, when the observer, fatigued by night observing, is
 unequal to the task. The fact of the dif<U+FB01>culty of the observations is
 evidenced by the paucity of the trustworthy results, after more than
six years’ uninterrupted observing, viz. from February of 1843 to
 October of 18419. Of sixty-nine stars proposed for observation only
forty-eight have been observed, and of them nineteen only have been
 Observed at both periods of the year.       The results of the obser
vations of these nineteen stars are given in the paper.
    Four tables are given, the <U+FB01>rst of which contains the separate
results for each day’s observations of every star, both for distance
and angle of position, with the probable error and weight of each,
computed according to the ordinary formula of the calculus of pro
babilities, and also with the assigned arbitrary weight of each, esti
mated according to the judgment of the observers.            It contains
also estimations of the magnitudes and colours of the stars for each
ni ht.
   gThe second table gives the similar results combined         for each
period of observation, with the computed weights and probable errors.
    The third table gives the combined results of all the observations
for the main epoch of observation, together with the approximate
R.A. and N.P.D., and the whole number of observations.
    The fourth table gives the results for the separate epochs for those
stars only which a<U+FB01>'ord reasonable hope of the detection of parallax,
four stars being omitted as evidently binary systems, and some others
whose components were equal in magnitude, and the observations of
which did not give any indication of parallax, being also omitted.
The differences of the angles of position, as indicating parallax, are
distinctly exhibited, <U+FB01>rst as resulting from such observations as were
made at consecutive and opposite seasons, and secondly as resulting
from the comparison of all the observations made at one period of
the different years with all made at the other period.
    In discussing the <U+FB01>nal results, the author remarks that only three
stars, viz. 118 Tauri, 100 Hercules, and Herschel 95, were observed
satisfactorily at the opposite and consecutive seasons, and these
exhibit such discordances in the partial di<U+FB01>'erences, that it seems
necessary in all cases to depend only upon the average difference
of position obtained by comparing all the observations at one
period of the different years, with all at the other period.    He <U+FB01>nds
that there are then only <U+FB01>ve stars in the list, viz. 32 Eridani, 41
Aurigaa, 3 Geminorum, an anonymous star in Cancer,and Herschel 95,
which show differences in the-proper direction, and so much greater
than the probable errors as to deserve much attention, as exhibiting
parallaxes measurable by this method, and, of these, 3 Geminorum

                                    15
is subject to great doubt, from the smallness of the number of the
observations at the late period of the year.
    The results however are entitled to rather more consideration in
this respect, that, with regard to the greater numbers of the stars
that are physically unexceptionable (that is, omitting binary stars,
and those whose components are of equal magnitude), the directions
of apparent change of position are favourable to the supposition of a
measurable parallax.      This is particularly the case with respect to
32 Eridani and Herschel 95, which the author in conclusion recom
 mends to the notice of astronomers provided with adequate instru
ments for observing them.
    2. “Magnetic Survey‘of the Eastern Archipelago.”            By Cap
tain C.   M. Elliot of the Madras Engineers. Communicated by
Lieut.-Col. Sabine, V.P. Treas. R.S. &c. Received Jan. 15, 1851.
    In the year 184-5,the Committee of Physics of the Royal Society
 having expressed a wish that 9. Magnetic Survey should be made
 of the East Indian Archipelago, Captain Elliot was ordered by the
 Court of Directors of the East India Company to undertake that
 duty, after the close of the Singapore Magnetic Observatory. The
 observations at that observatory were discontinued at the end of the
 year 1846, but the instruments were still allowed to remain, that
 the portable instruments might be occasionally compared with them
 during the Survey.
    The object which the author proposed to himself was the deter
 mination of certain magnetic lines within the limits of the Survey:
 the lines of no dip, and of the maximum horizontal component of
 the earth's force ; the minimum intensity of the total magnetic force;
 and <U+FB01>nally, the line of no declination.     He was also desirous of ob
 serving  the variations  of the magnetic  elements, and of ascertaining
 whether the changes of the declination, of magnetic intensity, and
 of the barometer, were uniformly similar over so large an area.
 The <U+FB01>xed stations for this latter purpose were sixteen in number,
 and the time employed at each station varied from a few days to
 several months.      They were spread over an area of 28° of latitude,
 and more than 40° in longitude, viz. from 16° latitude north to 12°
south, and from 80° to 125° longitude east. This part of the globe
 coincides very nearly with the position of minimum total force.      Of
 the sixteen stations, nine were to the south of this line, three to the
 north, and four in its immediate vicinity. Four stations were in the
 island adjacent to Singapore; one in Borneo; one in the island of
Java; two in Sumatra; one in the island of Mindanao; one in Ce
lebes; one at the Cocos or Keeling Islands, which was the most
southern station to which Capt. Elliot could venture ; one at Penang,
and one in its immediate vicinity; one at Nicobar, an island in the
 Bay of Bengal; one at Moulmein, which was the most northerly,
 and one at Madras, which was the extreme westerly, station.        The
 total number of days employed in observing at the <U+FB01>xed stations
 amounted to 4-96. The instruments employed at the <U+FB01>xed stations
 were, for the changes of declination, sometimes three, but never less

                                     16
 than two; and for the changes of the horizontal force, a hi<U+FB01>lar mag
 netometer with a thermometer for registering the temperature of the
  enclosed magnet; a barometer, either Newman’s standard or a por
 table, with their attached thermometers;      a dry and wet bulb ther
 mometer for ascertaining the humidity of the atmosphere; and a
 standard thermometer.      The observations were usually made under
 canvas, and close to the sea-shore.      There being usually but one
 assistant, it was impossible to observe during the whole twenty-four
 hours ; the hours of observation selected were therefore from 3 AM.
 to 9 P.M. inclusive.   In Borneo, and during the <U+FB01>rst four months in
 Java, there were three assistants, and observations ~were taken hourly.
    As these observations were made at the di<U+FB02>'erent stations in dif~
 ferent seasons, it was necessary to have the observations of some
 station for upwards of a year, for the purpose of instituting a com
 parison between the changes of one station with another.      This was
 more especially the case with the declination changes, as the times
 of extreme westerly variation are continually altering. The curves
 of changes of declination at Singapore were therefore projected
 for each month of the three years 1843, 1844 and 1845, during
 which time the observations had been made hourly; and like
 wise for each of the four seasons; by comparing with these the
 observations made during the Survey, the author was able to di
 stinguish the changes due to geographical position from those due
 to the season of the year.
    At Singapore, the extreme westerly variation occurs in December
 at 19 heurs, or 7 A.M.; in January at 20“; in February at 21"; in
 March, or the month in which the sun passes the equator, there is a
slivht retrogression; in April the extreme westerly variation is at
21%; in July and August at 23h ; in September at 221‘ ; in October
at 211‘, and in November at 20 hours.         In the winter the extreme
 westerly variation is at 20 hours; in spring at 21 hours; in summer
 at 23 hours, and in autumn at 21 hours; agreeing in this respect
 with the spring curves, but differing very materially as regards the
progression of the needle eastward in the afternoon.      The oscillation
has much the greatest range during the winter months; autumn
comes next, and preserves an almost perfect parallelism with the
winter.     The spring and summer curves preserve their parallelism
during the afternoon.
    The mean curves of each of the three years have an almost perfect
resemblance.      There are two most decided maxima at 18b and at 3
or 4 hours, and one minimum at 211‘. There are besides two other
minima at 10h and 17", and another maximum at 14 hours, making
in all three maxima and three minima.       If  we turn to the seasons,
we <U+FB01>nd in the winter only one strongly de<U+FB01>ned maximum and mini
mum. In spring two maxima, one minimum; in summer and autumn
two maxima and two minima.        ‘The amount of oscillation is greater
in winter than in summer.      The sun is a longer time to the south
of the line of minimum force than to the north of it. Singapore is
in north latitude 1° 18', and the lines of no dip and minimum force
cross the meridian of Singapore in latitude 8° north nearly, and

                                   17
therefore the sun is to the south of these lines about 220 days of
the year.   If we compare the oscillations of the declination at the dif
ferent stations with the Singapore curves, we see that of the sixteen
stations two do not agree, one is doubtful, and the other thirteen do
agree with the march of the needle at Singapore. Of the three not
in accordance, the one that is doubtful is in the vicinity of the lines
of no dip and minimum force, whilst the two which do not agree,
viz. Madras and Moulmein, are both to the north of the line of no
dip, and of the line of minimum force.        The Moulmein observa
tions were made in the month of April; the hours of morning maxi
mum and minimum are 21 and noon, whereas at Singapore the hour
of morning minimum is 21, which is that of the maximum at
Moulmein.      Again, the Madras observations were taken in the
autumn, the morning maximum and minimum being at 20 hours
and at noon; there is no well-de<U+FB01>ned morning maximum at the
same period at Singapore, but the morning minimum occurs at 21
hours. We see, therefore, that the stations south of the line of no
dip and of minimum force, with the exception of Keemah in the
Celebes, all are in perfect accordance with the march of the needle
at Singapore.    Sambooanga, in the island of Mindanao, is nearly
on the line of no dip, and agrees generally with the Singapore
curve; but it is to be observed, that as we proceed northerly and
approach the lines of no dip and of minimum force, the similarity
to the Singapore curve becomes much more faint, although agreeing
tolerably well.    This may be seen on inspection of the Plates,
where the curves of Sumatra, Java and the Cocos, which are ex
treme southerly stations, agree exceedingly well with those at Sin—
gapore.
    The next observations referred to are those of the horizontal
force at different seasons.    As the observations at the different
stations were made at different times of the year, it appeared ne
cessary, as in the case of the declination, to ascertain what changes
might take place in the different seasons at a station where an un
interrupted series had been observed for a considerable time.        Ac
cordingly, Singapore, where observations were made hourly during
three years, was chosen as the point to which all the stations of the
 Survey were referred. Unlike the declination, which changes its time
of extreme western position, not only in every season, but in nearly
every month of the year, the maximum horizontal force at Singa
pore occurs with great regularity either at 22 or 23 hours, whilst
the minimum at 9 or 10 hours is but very faintly de<U+FB01>ned.               In
 other respects also the curves preserve a perfect parallelism, if we
 except only the greater range during the spring.
    In the curves representing the changes of the horizontal force
at the different stations of the Survey a general similarity is per
 ceptible; a very decided maximum at noon, with a minimum very
 faintly marked. The irregularity, where observable, appears to be
principally attributable to the short time during which the observa
tions were taken.    At Moulmein, the large Oscillation appears to be
principally due to the very great change of temperature.     The coef<U+FB01>

  cient of temperature of the magnet was determined at Moulmein,
  and yielding the same results at other stations, is considered satis
  l'actory as regards accuracy.        The range of the thermometer at
  Moulmein was upwards of 35°; and in the middle of the day, In
  the tent, the heat was almost insupportable, being upwards of 105°.
   The oscillation of the horizontal force is much greater at Moulmein
  than at any other station.      The minimum oscillation is at Singapore,
  and increases both rwrthward and southward. During the Survey the
  portable bi<U+FB01>lar was compared with the large Observatory bi<U+FB01>lar, and
  the results are given.       The angle of torsion employed was always
   the   same,  equal to  60°; and the threads by which the hollow cylin
'
   drical magnet was suspended were the same during nearly the whole
   of the Survey, having been in use for upwards of three years.
       The barometer was observed at every station.       At the principal
   stations the standard was in use, and at the others the portable, from
   the greater trouble and risk attending the landing the large baro
   meter.    The curve of the barometer, corrected to 32°, is exceedingly
   regular, the time of maximum and minimum being identical for
   every station on the Survey, viz. 21 or 22 hours for the maximum,
   and 3 or 4 hours for the minimum; the oscillation at every station
   amounting to about one-tenth of an inch. The curve of the ten~
   sion of vapour, as determined by the dry and wet bulb, is irre
   gular, which is communicated to the barometric curve when ap
   plied to it; but this irregularity may be owing to the very short
   time the instruments were observed at some of the stations; and for
   the purpose of ascertaining whether this really was the case,     I pro
  jected. the curves of the barometer, corrected to 32° of temperature,
   at some of those stations where observations had been carried on for
   more than a month, and likewise, in addition, corrected for tension
   of vapour, thus giving the oscillation of the column of dry air.
   There is certainly not the same regularity perceptible as in the oscil
   lation of' the barometer, yet there is considerable uniformity in the
   oscillation of the pressure of the column of dry air, the maximum
   generally occurring at 19 or 20 hours, and the minimum at 2, 3 0r4'
   hours.    The range is likewise considerably greater.
       The tension of vapour was generally a minimum at 18 hours,
   when itamounted to 0'8 of an inch. It then increased to 2 hours,
    when it might amount to 0'9 of an inch, and then gradually dimi
    nished, having but one maximum and one minimum in the 24‘
    hours.    In the islands of the Archipelago the air is nearly saturated
    with moisture, and at Singapore the maximum difference between
    the dry and wet bulb at 1 or 2 P.M. amounted to not more than 7°,
    and then gradually and uniformly diminished till sunrise, when the
    difference was rarely more than a degree.        There appears to be
    one maximum and one minimum of the dry and wet bulb thermo
    meter, the former at noon or 1 P.M., the latter at 18 or 19 hours;
    the greatest and least differences between the two thermometers 00¢
    curring, as has been observed, likewise at these hours.
        In addition to the above, a standard thermometer by Newman
    was observed ; one maximum and one minimum occur in the twenty

                                    19
four hours, viz. at 2 and at 18 hours. The oscillation varies consider
ably; the smallest oscillation being observable at Singapore, where the
standard thermometer was placed inside the Observatory, and ex
posed to a current of air passing through the building.         The range
was greatest at Moulmein and in Sumatra; but at these observa
tories, the instruments being under canvas, the direct in<U+FB02>uence of
the sun’s rays was very great.      In addition to these thermometrical
observations, there was likewise in use a Solar Radiation Thermo
meter, the bulb of' which was tinged of a dark purple colour, not
absolutely black; this instrument was placed on a table outside the
observing tent, and the bulb beyond the edge of the table exposed
to the sun.     This thermometer was read off from 19 hours to 4 or
5 hours P.M., and the maximum of the day, with the time at which
it was observed, recorded.      The minimum thermometer (self-regi
stering) was placed at night, and in a similar manner, on the table
outside the tent, and the minimum read off in the morning. These
observations have been recorded in the Tables, but have not been
deemed of suf<U+FB01>cient importance to lay them down in curves.             This
completes   that  portion  of the  Survey   which  relates to  the   hourly
changes   of the  magnetical and meteorological instruments.
   The author    next proceeds to the consideration of the absolute
determinations, which formed the principal object of the Survey,
viz. Latitude, Longitude, Dip, Horizontal Force and Declination.
The method adopted in making these observations was as follows.
On arrival at a station, the tent was pitched, and the instruments
prepared.     These were a six-inch dip circle, a portable decli
nometer, an altitude and azimuth instrument by Robinson, and a
chronometer which had been long in use, and was scarcely trust
worthy for a <U+FB01>xed rate. Commencing the following morning, the
<U+FB01>rst instrument set up was the declinometer, and as the suspen
sion-thread was thicker than necessary, to obviate the necessity of
frequent renewal, the brass weight for removing the torsion was
allowed to swing for a couple of hours.        During this interval the
observations for dip were completed, and by 9 A.M. the collimator
magnet was in the box, the altitude and azimuth instrument in rear
of it, and in adjustment with it. Sights were then taken with the
sextant and arti<U+FB01>cial horizon for time, and with the altitude and
azimuth instrument in connection with the collimator magnet for
declination.    From 10 A.M. to 11 AM. observations of de<U+FB02>ection at
four different distances, and of vibration, were made with the port
able declinometer, and the telescope of the altitude and azimuth instru
ment, for the absolute value of the horizontal force. At noon circum
meridional altitudes were observed for latitude, and in the afternoon
equal altitudes were taken to con<U+FB01>rm the observations of the morning.
The instruments were then packed up and sent o<U+FB01>' to the next sta
tion. This was the system adopted whilst travelling ; but at the <U+FB01>xed
stations a great number of additional observations were made of hori
zontal f'orce, dip and declination.
   The method of grouping the results at the different stations for
the purpose of drawing the isoclinal, isodynamic and                  lines,
                                                           isggkonic

                                      20
is then described.     For the isoclinal lines, four groups were formed:
the <U+FB01>rst consisting       of forty stations in Singapore,    Borneo and
Java; the second of thirty stations in Sumatra; the third of thirty
stations at sea; and the fourth of thirty of the principal stations in
the Archipelago.
    The <U+FB01>rst gave for the latitude of its central station 6° 17' south;
longitude 108° 55' east; and 27°Ol"5 south dip. These thirty sta
tions form so many equations of condition, and were combined by
the method of least squares, as practised by Colonel Sabine in his
 Magnetic Survey of the British Isles: from the <U+FB01>nal equations it was
 found that the dip increased 1"94-‘0 for each geographical mile per
pendicular to the isoclinal lines, and that the direction of the latter
 is from north 86° 06' east to south 86° 06' west.
    In the Sumatran group the latitude ofthe central station was.0° 08'   ~
 south; longitude 100° 31' east; dip 16° 36"6 south; the rate of in
 crease of dip being 2"021 for each geographical mile perpendicular
 to the isoclinal line, the direction of which is from north 83° 28' west
 to south 83° 28' east.       -
    In the third, or sea group, the latitude of the central station is
2° 38'; longitude 110° 05' east; dip 9° 11"7 south; the resulting
equations give the isoclinal line running from north 87° 26' west to
 south 87° 26' east; and the dip in the line at right angles to it in
 creases at the rate of 1"993 for each geographical mile.
    The last or general group of thirty of the principal stations
 in the Magnetic Survey give the resulting equations at a mean
latitude of 0°I09° north, mean longitude 104:o 44' east, and mean
dip 14<° 4-0"4~ south; the isoclinal line running from north 86° 39'
west to south 86° 39' cast; and the dip in the line at right angles to it
increasing at the rate of 1"953 for each geographical mile.
    Nearly the same method has been pursued in laying down the
lines of equal horizontal force.        In one group this line forms an
angle of north 67° 48' west to south 67° 48' east with the meri
dian, and the line perpendicular to it proceeds at the rate of
'0008249 for each geographical mile, the central station being in
latitude 0° 38"5 north, and longitude 102° 26' east.          In another
group at the central station 3° 40' south, and 106° 83' east, the
line of equal horizontal force forms an angle of 60° 57' with the
 meridian, and increases at the rate of "0005855 for each geographi
 cal milc on the perpendicular line.
    The lines of declination have been laid down with reference to
the declination at each station individually, the particular form of
the lines rendering the method of grouping inapplicable.
    Total force.-—T he total force was not determined directly, but by
the formula f=h.sec 5, where his the horizontal intensity, 8 the
dip, and    f  the total force; and as the dip changes rapidly, but
regularly, whilst the horizontal intensity changes slowly, but irregu
larly, it is evident the lines of total force will follow in some de
gree the regularity of the intervals between the lines of dip.
    The total force for each station was determined by the above
formula, and equations of condition, combined by the method of

                                    21
least squares, determined the direction of the isodynamic line, in
the mean latitude of 3° 05' south, longitude 106° 47'; where the
mean total force was 8'745.       The angle which the isodynamic line
forms with the meridian is from north 85° 56' west to south 85° 36'
east, and increases southerly at the rate of '001073 for each geogra
phical mile. The line of least intensity, in the space over which
the Survey was carried, appears to agree almost exactly with the line
of no dip.
     To recapitulate brie<U+FB02>y respecting the position of the principal
lines.     The line of no dip cuts the meridian at an angle approach
 ing a right angle, and near the parallel of latitude of 8° north in the
 longitude of Singapore; the rate of progression being almost exactly
 two miles of dip to one mile of latitude. The line of least total
 force varies but little from the line of no dip, forming indeed a
 somewhat larger angle with the meridian.         The direction of the
 maximum horizontal force forms an angle of nearly 65° with the
 meridian from north-west to south-east, but neither the maximum
 horizontal nor the minimum total intensity appear to be, strictly
 speaking, lines.    In taking two stations having the same value, the
 one to the north and the other to the south of the position of
 greatest horizontal intensity, and dividing the distance between
 them, it might be supposed that this would be the position of the line
 of greatest horizontal intensity; but the maximum horizontal intensity
 appears not to be a line, but a space or belt extending for a consi
 derable distance on either side of this line; the value in this space
 being 8'20.     The minimum total force was 8'149; the station being
  Madras, in latitude 13° 04' north, longitude 80° 16' cast, dip
 7° 34" north, horizontal intensity 8078, and declination 0° 56' 09”
 east.
     In addition to the above, observations  were made at sea, consist
 ing of temperatures of the air and sea;      the dry and wet bulb, the
 standard thermometer, and, whenever practicable, of the dip with a
  Fox’s Dip Circle. The author remarks that it is impossible to over
 estimate the practical value of this instrument at sea in low lati
 tudes.     The clip changes two minutes for every mile of latitude.
 The seas are generally smooth. When astronomical observations
  cannot be taken, the dip circle becomes a truly valuable latitude in
  strument, and in a few minutes, by day or by night, the latitude of
 the ship can be correctly ascertained.
     The author concludes by remarking that he has found Colonel
  Sabine’s many works on magnetism of considerable use, more espe
  cially

   The following papers were read :—
   1. “On the Oxidation of Ammonia in the Human Body, with
some remarks on Nitri<U+FB01>cation."        By Henry Bence Jones, M.D.,
F.R.S. 810. Received December 18, 1850.
   The author having shown, in a paper lately communicated to the
Royal Society, that the e<U+FB01>ect of tartrate of ammonia on the acidity
of the urine was totally ditferent from that of tartrate of potash, and
that carbonate of ammonia, taken in very large quantities, did not
produce any alkaline reaction of the urine, but that, on the con
trary, the acidity was rather increased than diminished by such
doses, repeated the experiments with carbonate of ammonia, hoping
to obtain more decided results. Although, from these experiments,
it was again apparent that no diminution of the acid reaction re
sulted from taking carbonate of ammonia, yet the fact of any great
increase in the acidity of the urine could not be determined.     In his
former paper, the author suggested that an inquiry into the occur
rence of nitric acid in the urine would probably give the solution of
this unexpected effect of carbonate of ammonia; and he was led to
undertake the experiments described in the present paper with the
view of detecting the presence of that acid under particular circum
stances.
    The indigo test for nitric acid being more delicate than the pro
tosulphate of iron test, it was chie<U+FB02>y employed; but a mixture of
starch with a drop or two of hydriodate of potash and hydrochloric
 acid was found to be a far more delicate test than either.      Begin.
 ning with 10 grs. of nitrate of potash added to 10 oz. of urine, it
 was found at last that as little as 1 gr. of nitre to 10 oz. of urine
 could be detected with the greatest certainty and clesrness when the
 starch test was used; but this quantity could not be detected as
 surely by the indigo test.
    Experiments are described in which carbonate of ammonia was
 given, in doses varying from 40 grs. to 7 grs., to a healthy man in
 whose urine no nitric acid could previously be detected; and the
 urine was tested at intervals of several hours after each dose. From
 these it appears that 10 grs. was the smallest quantity that gave de
 cided evidence of nitric acid by both tests.                       -
    Having satis<U+FB01>ed himself that when carbonate of ammonia was
 taken small quantities of nitric acid passed off in the urine, the
 author made similar experiments with tartrate of ammonia, admi
 nistered in doses of 60 and 40 grs.; and in each case the starch test
 gave evidence of the presence of nitric acid in the urine some hours
 after.   Similar experiments with the muriate of ammonia are next
 described; and in these the presence of nitric acid in the urine was
 readily detected three hours after the administration of the dose,
 even when it was so small as 10 grs.
    From an experiment described in the paper,\it was shown, that by

                                             23
a   imple combustion of ammonia out of the body, as well as in the
body, nitric acid was produced. From other experiments it appears
that urea, also, by oxidation, whether in the body or out of the body,
gives rise to nitric acid.
   Having found that nitric acid was produced more readily and fre
quently than had been supposed to be the case, the author was led
to try whether combustions       in the atmosphere without ammonia
could not give nitric acid.    The presence of this acid was, in con
sequence, detected in the products of the combustion of alcohol, of
coal, of a wax candle, and of hydrogen.
   As this led to the supposition that nitric acid might exist in rain
water at all times, experiments were made on the rain-water col
lected on wet days in London, and the presence of nitric acid was
discovered by the starch and also by the indigo test.
   The conclusions the author comes to from his'experiments are :—
   1. That the action of oxygen takes place in the body, not only on
hydrogen, carbon, sulphur and phosphorus, but also on nitrogen.
   2. That in all cases of combustion,    out of the body and in the
body,    11'
         ammonia be present,       will be converted partly into nitric
                                       it
acid.
   3.   That   the nitrogen   of   the air  not indifferent in ordinary cases
                                             is
of combustion, but that       it   gives rise to minute quantities of nitric
acid.
  He further remarks, that the production of nitric acid from am
monia in the body adds another to the many instances of the action
of oxygen in man; and that the detection of nitric acid in the urine
may lead to the conclusion, that the blood          is   being freed from am
monia, or from substances closely related to         it,   as urea, or possibly
ca<U+FB01>'ein and other alkaloids.
   2. “Description   of a Muscle of the striped variety, situated at
the posterior part of the choroid coat of the Eye in Mammals, with
an explanation of its mode of action in adapting the Eye to distinct
vision at different distances."  By George Rainey, Esq., M.R.C.S.
Communicated by Joseph H. Green, Esq., F.R.S.          Received De
cember 24, 1850.
   Respecting this muscle, the author observes that occupies about

vorticosa; that these <U+FB01>bres passin different directions, some going
from before to behind, and others intersecting these at various an
gles: altogether they receive the pigment membrane, the retina and
the vitreous humour as into     cup.
                                   a
   From the connection of these <U+FB01>bres with the choroid coat, the
author calls them the choroid muscle. He has not been able to trace
them nearer to the ciliary ligament than about two-thirds of the di
stance from the centre of the choroid to the border of the cornea,
in which situation the fasciculi become broken up, and gradually
degenerate into <U+FB01>lamentous tissue.      No striped <U+FB01>bres can be de
tected in the so-called ciliary muscle or ligament. These the author

                                                                  i
considers to be merely for the purpose of connecting the sclerotic
and choroid anteriorly, as these tunics are also connected by cellu
lar tissue posteriorly, but very loosely in their middle.
    The author next describes the manner in which these <U+FB01>bres may
be most easily displayed, and, as the sheep’s eye answers best for
this purpose, his description is given in reference to it.        The poste
rior two-thirds of the eye of the sheep being turned inside out, and
all the retina washed away, a very thin portion of the tapetum is
raised and <U+FB02>oated upon a glass slide, and a thin glass cover is then
placed upon        without making the least pressure, which would, by
                  it,
crushing the very soft primary fasciculi, render the transverse striae
irregular and confused.                If

and being covered by the membrana pigmenti, and some of the iri

distinguishable; but         if
                              asmall portion of acetic acid, or some aque
ous solution of chlorine, be brought in contact with                      it,
                                                               the membrana
pigmenti, and especially the iridescent <U+FB01>bres, will instantly brink,
and, becoming transparent, disappear, and the fasciculi of                cho        t   e
roid muscle will come into view.           Should the acetic acid have been
too strong, the transverse marking will be very faint and scarcely
discernible; but        the acid be washed away with water, or, what
                        if                                                                   is

potassium or sodium, iodide of potassium, &c., the transverse mark

colour of the iridescent <U+FB01>bres will be reproduced.             In the eye of
those animals whose tapetum               scaly, as in the Cat, or where the

                                  is

with much greater dif<U+FB01>culty; the author, however, states that he
has succeeded in displaying this muscle in the choroid of the Horse,
the Cat, and in that of the human eye                  *.
    The author next considers the action of the choroid muscle. This,
 from the manner in which the muscle embraces the vitreous humour,
 is, in his opinion, to compress this humour and carry the lens for
 wards.     But this, he observes, considering how the capsule of the
 lens and the ciliary processes <U+FB01>ll up the posterior chamber of the
 aqueous humour, cannot be effected without displacing some of the
 <U+FB02>uid in that chamber; and he concludes that the aqueous humour
 in the posterior chamber being pressed by the capsule of the lens
 (forced forwards by the action of the choroid muscle) against the
 ciliary processes, forces the blood out of their vessels into the cho
 roid veins, and thus enlarges this chamber at its circumference,
 whilst it   diminishes      from behind forwards, or, in other words,
                             it
 moves the lens forwards.           The author then observes, that, as the
 effect of the action of the choroid muscle           to separate the choroid
                                                             is

these processes.       He hence infers that the of<U+FB01>ce of these processes
is to allow of the displacement of <U+FB02>uid when the lens is carried for
wards; and when the choroid muscle ceases to act, by the re-disten
sion of their capillaries, to carry the lens back into its place.      The
 author then enters into a mathematical examination of the data fur
 nished by these facts, to show how exactly they ful<U+FB01>ll the conditions
 necessary for adapting the eye, viewed as an optical instrument, to
 distinct vision at different distances.       The author considers that
 there is no analogy either in structure or function between those
 <U+FB01>bres in mammals occupying a situation similar to that occupied by
 a true muscle in Birds (the ciliary muscle), but that the true ana
 logue of the ciliary muscle in birds is the choroid muscle in mam
 mals, the chief difference between them being in situation.         In the
 Pigeon, he <U+FB01>nds that the ciliary muscle is inserted into the choroid
 coat, along which it can be traced as far back as about gth of an
 inch behind the iris, so that its action would be to draw the choroid
  tense upon the vitreous humour, and thus to compress it similarly to
  the choroid muscle in the mammal.           Besides, in the Bird he <U+FB01>nds
  no muscular <U+FB01>bres at the posterior part of the choroid. The ciliary
  muscle is more distinct, and appears to be stronger than the choroid,
  but this the author attributes to the <U+FB01>bres of the one being much
  more collected, and therefore limited to a much smaller space than
  those of the other.

      A   paper was    read, entitled “ On the Supply of Water from the
   Chalk Stratum        in the neighbourhood of London."           By John
   Dickinson, Esq.,     F.R.S. Received January 6, 1851.
      The object of    this paper is to explain and illustrate the supply of
   subterranean water which is always found at certain depths in the
   chalk strata; the circumstances that in<U+FB02>uence its natural out<U+FB02>ow
   by springs and rivers; the practicability of draining off that water
   by an arti<U+FB01>cial mode of exhaustion; and the changes that would
   be produced by carrying such an operation into effect on a large
   scale.
       It is stated, that numerous perennial streams issue from the ele
   vated ridges of the chalk strata, those in Kent and Surrey <U+FB02>owing
   from south to north, and those in Buckinghamshire, Herts and
    Essex, <U+FB02>owing from north to south; and that in each case the dip of
   the strata corresponds with the fall of the country and the direction
   of the streams. These rivers are considered to be the natural out
   <U+FB02>ow of the rain-water imbibed by the chalk, the accumulation of
    which, as explained by Dr. Buckland, is in a subterranean reservoir;
    and according to the periodical <U+FB01>lling and exhaustion of this, the
    springs and streams alternately decrease and are augmented.         The
    circumstances regulating this change, which have been observed and

                                        26
experimented upon by the author during the last forty years, are
explained in the paper.     In the year 1835, he adopted a method of
ascertaining the supply of subterranean water, by the use of a very
simple but effective instrument, contrived and used by the late
Dr. Dalton for that purpose; and he has supplied a series of
monthly observations, extending over fourteen years, both of the
rain falling on the surface, and of that which is found to percolate
through to a lower level for the supply of springs and rivers.
   From his observations—
                                                                            inches.
The annual average of rain in the north-western part of
  Herts is   ........ .........................
                     .                                . . . . . .           2592
The average fall of rain in the <U+FB01>rst six months of the year is              11-12
The average from July to December inclusive  ..........                     1480
The average in six months, from April to September inclusive                12'l7
The average percolation through the Dalton gauge, from
  April to September                                            .....
                          inclusive, is . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          0‘62
And from October to      the following March inclusive         ......          9'61
Total average annual amount of percolation . .            ......      . . . . 10-23
The rivers and springs supplied from the chalk are generally found
to be in fullest <U+FB02>ow about June, and to be most reduced in Decem
ber; and the cause of this variation is considered to be the time
that the descending rain requires to percolate through the crevices
and <U+FB01>ssures of the lofty chalk hills, and to spread laterally in the
reservoirs till it reaches the outlet springs.
   The variation in the quantity of rain is found to range from 2l'10
inches to 3210 inches.      The variation in the amount of percolation
is found to be far greater, viz. from 3'l0 inches to 1928 inches.
Consequently there is a variation in the springs, and in the <U+FB02>ow of
the rivers, much greater than in proportion to the fall of rain. The
author shows that the season ofthe rain falling is the main incident in
the supply of these perennial springs; and that their out<U+FB02>ow is pro
portional to the percolation which takes place during winter into
the lower beds, the summer rains being evaporated or taken up by
vegetation.
   He gives it as his opinion, that it is possible to drain off, by arti
<U+FB01>cial means, great part of any river <U+FB02>owing out of the chalk; such
rivers being truly the natural drain and outlet of the subterranean
reservoir therein.    He shows, by precise measurements and care
fully recorded observations, that the subterranean water has a move
ment, with a declivity of 13 feet 6 inches to the mile, in the direc
tion of the dip of the strata and of the fall of the streams; and he
states that the crevices or water-channels in the chalk are larger in
the neighbourhood of a stream.        He therefore assumes that if a.
large and deep well were sunk in any such locality, and the water
in it,by being pumped off by steam-power, were brought down to
and kept at    a lower level, a deep-seated arti<U+FB01>cial vent being thus
formed, the water would be so drained off from the reservoir that
the springs would be dried up, and the river be partially or entirely
deprived of its <U+FB02>ow of water.

       SIR BENJAMIN         C.  BRODIE, Bart, V.P., in      the Chair.
     A paper was read, entitled, “On Rubian and its Products of
Decomposition.”        By Edward Schunck, Esq., F.R.S. Received
January 9, 1851.
     After adverting to the obscurity in which the inquiry concerning
the state in which the colouring matter of Madder originally exists
in this root is involved, the author refers to the change which takes
 place in the root, especially if in a state of powder, during the lapse
 of time, and to the little light which has been thrown by chemical
 investigations on the nature of the process by which the change is
 effected.    He states that it has been suspected by several chemists
 that there exists originally some substance in madder, which, by
 the action of fermentation, or oxidation, is decomposed, and gives
 rise by its decomposition     to the various substances endowed either
 with a red or yellow colour, which have been discovered during the
 chemical investigations of this root. In his papers on the colouring
 matter of madder, he has described four substances derived from
 madder, only one of which is a true colouring matter, but all of
 them capable under certain circumstances, as for instance in com
 bination with alkalies, of developing red or purple colours of various
 intensity.     After referring to the opinions of M. Persoz and the in
 vestigations of Mr. Higgin relative to xanthine and alizarine, the
  author observes that, by adding a variety of substances to an extract
  of madder with cold water, he was enabled to ascertain under what
  circumstances and by what means the tinctorial power of the liquid
  is destroyed, and consequently what is the general character of the
  substance or substances to which it is due. He found that by adding
  sulphuric, or muriatic acid to the extract, and heating, the liquid,
  after neutralization of the acid, was no longer capable of dyeing.
   The tinctorial power was also destroyed by the addition of hydrate
  of alumina, magnesia, protoxide of tin, and various metallic oxides,
  but not by carbonate of lime, or carbonate of lead.       In all cases in
   which the property of dyeing in the extract was destroyed, he inva
  riably found that its bitter taste and bright yellow colour were de
   stroyed.   Having shown, in his former papers on this subject, that
   the intensely bitter taste of madder and its extracts is due to a pe
   culiar substance to which he has given the name of rubian; and as
   it appeared from these preliminary experiments that this substance,
   though itself no colouringmatter, is in some way concerned in the
   changes whereby a formation of colouring matter is induced in
   aqueous extracts of madder, he proposed to himself to examine its
   properties and products of decomposition more in detail than he had
   hitherto done.
      After  numerous    experiments, undertaken with the view of ob
   taining pure   rubian  in quantities suf<U+FB01>ciently large for the purposes
   of examination, he discovered a property of that substance, by which
   he was enabled to obtain it in a state of purity, namely the remark

                                        28
   able attraction   manifested by it towards all substances of a porous
   or <U+FB01>nely-divided nature, which is perhaps more characteristic of it
   than any other.       The method he <U+FB01>nally adopted, and which, he
   states, surpasses all others in facility and certainty of execution, is
   fully detailed.
      Rubian, when prepared according to this method, is a hard, dry,
   brittle, shining, perfectly uncrystalline substance, similar to gum or
   dried varnish.     It is not in the least deliquescent, as xanthine is
   described to be.     In thin layers it is perfectly transparent, and of a
   beautiful dark yellow colour; in large masses it appears dark brown.
   It is very soluble in water and in alcohol, more so in the former
   than in the latter; but insoluble in aether, which precipitates it in
  brown drops from its alcoholic solution. Its solutions have an in
  tensely bitter taste.     When it is pure, its solution in water gives no
  precipitates   with  the mineral  or organic acids, nor with salts of the
  alkalies or alkaline earths.     Basic acetate of lead, however, gives a
  copious light red precipitate in a solution of pure rubian, the solu
  tion becoming colourless; but this is the only de<U+FB01>nite compound of          .
  rubian with which the author is acquainted.          He states that rubian
  cannot be considered as a colouring matter in the ordinary sense of
  the word.     It is decomposed by acids, alkalies, chlorine, heat and
  ferments.     The formula for rubian appears to be C56 H“ 03°.
      The action of sulphuric and of muriatic acid on rubian is stated
  to be precisely the same.       The products of the decomposition by
  those acids are,—l st, Alizarine; 2nd, the substance which the author
  formerly termed Beta-resin, but which he now calls Vera-mine; 3rd,
 the substance which the author in former papers has called Alpha
 resin, but to which he now prefers giving the name of Rubiretine;
 4th, a body which has not hitherto been observed, and which he
 denominates Rubianine; and 5th, a sugar obtained from the acid
 liquid after the complete decomposition of the rubian.
     1. The alizarine obtained from the decomposition          of rubian ex
 hibits all the usual properties of this well-known substance.            Its
 colour is dark yellow, without any tinge of brown or red.              The
 crystals possess a lustre which the author has 'never seen equalled in
 this substance. The analysis gave the formula C“ H5 0‘. Thus by
 simply losing 14 equivs. of water, 1 equiv. of rubian is converted
 into 4 equivs. 0f alizarine.
     2. Verantine, in most of its properties, coincides with the substance
to which the author formerly gave the name of Beta- resin ofmadder.
When prepared according to the method described in the paper, it
is obtained in the form of a reddish-brown powder.            \Vhen heated
on platinum foil, it melts, and then burns away without leaving any
residue.     It dissolves in concentrated sulphuric acid, with a brown
colour, and is reprecipitated by water in brown <U+FB02>ocks. On heating
the solution in concentrated sulphuric acid, it becomes black, sul
phurous acid is disengaged, and the substance is decomposed. Con
centrated nitric acid dissolves it on boiling, with a disengagement of
nitrous acid, forming a yellow liquid, from which nothing separates
on cooling.       It is almost insoluble in boiling water, but readily

                                    29
soluble   in boiling alcohol, and is again deposited, on the alcohol
cooling, as a brown powder, which is its most characteristic property.
   From an experiment described in the paper, the author is inclined
to conclude that alizarine and verautine are capable of forming a
double compound with alumina soluble in boiling water, and that a
mixture of' the two in the proportion in which they exist in this
compound constitutes what has been called purpurine.
   Although the difficulty of obtaining pure verantine in suf<U+FB01>cient
quantity for the purposes of analysis prevented the author from de
termining its composition with the requisite accuracy, he obtained
approximations sufficiently near to remove almost all doubts on the
question. The formula deduced from four experiments is C“ H5 O5 ;
so that it appears that verantine differs from alizarine by containing
1  equiv. more of oxygen.
   3. Rubiretine is identical with the substance which the author
formerly called Alpha-resin of madder._ He endeavoured in vain to
determine the atomic weight of this substance ; but states that there
is only one formula which is in accordance with his analyses, and at
the same time satisfactorily explains its formation.     This formula is
C“ H6 0*; so that 2 equivs. ofverantine and 2 equivs. of rubiretine
with 12 equivs. of' water give 1 equiv.'of' rubian.
   4-. Rubianine greatly resembles rubiacine in its appearance       and
many of' its properties.   It may however easily be distinguished by
several characteristics, and above all by its composition.     It is ob
tained from a solution in boiling alcohol in the form of bright lemon
yellow silky needles, which when dry form an interwoven mass. It
is less soluble in alcohol, but more so in boiling water, than any of
the preceding substances.     ()n the solution in boiling water cooling,
it crystallizes out again in yellow silky needles. Its colour is lighter
than that of' rubiacine. When heated on platinum foil, it melts to a.
brown liquid ; then burns, leaving a carbonaceous residue, which on
further heating disappears entirely. It is soluble in concentrated
sulphuric acid, with a yellow colour; the solution on boiling be
comes black, and gives off sulphurous acid. It is not affected either
by dilute or concentrated nitric acid even on boiling; it merely dis
solves in them, and, on the acid cooling, crystallizes out again as
from boiling water.
   There are three formulas, all of which give for 100 parts of this
substance numbers not widely differing from those deduced from the
analyses, viz. C28 H17 O",
                             C”ng     015, C“ H9i 0‘1“, but the last is
that with which they best agree.
    5. The sugar is always obtained in the form of a transparent
yellow syrup, which neither crystallizes, however long its solution
may be left to stand, nor becomes dry unless heated to_ 100° C.
 There are two formulae, C“ HMO" and Clg H19 019, both of' which
 agree with the analyses of this substance, and explain its formation.
The author states the views to which each of these formulae gives
rise, and the reasons for adopting the latter.
   Although <U+FB01>ve substances are produced by the action of acids on
rubian, the author does not consider that these substances are all

                                     30
formed     together, or in other words, that one atom of rubian, by its
decomposition, gives rise to all <U+FB01>ve at the same time; but that, from
the composition of these substances as compared with that of rubian,
it follows, that the decomposition a<U+FB02>'ects three separate atoms of ru
bian. One ofthese atoms loses 14- atoms of water,and is converted into
alizarine.     The second loses 12 atoms of water, and then splits up
into verantine and rubiretine. The third takes up the elements of
water, and then splits up into rubianine and sugar.            Whether it
would be possible to con<U+FB01>ne the decomposition of rubian entirely
to one of these processes, or whether all three are essential, he con~
siders is a question of the highest importance,          not so much in a
theoretical as in a practical point of view; and that should any che
mist succeed in changing rubian entirely into alizarine, he would
be the means of giving a great stimulus to many branches of manu
facture and adding largely to the national wealth.

        LIEUT.-COL. SABINE, V.P.            and Treas., in the Chair.
    The Chairman stated, that Mr. John Scott Russell, who ceased
at the last Anniversary to be a Fellow of the Society in consequence
of the non-payment of his subscription, had applied to the Council
to be reinstated, alleging that his numerous avocations and absence
from England caused him to overlook the fact of his subscription
not having been paid.        The Chairman therefore gave notice, that,
in accordance with the statutes, the question of the readmission of
Mr. Russell into the Society would be put to the vote at the en
suing meeting.
    A paper was in part read, entitled “On Periodical Laws dis

      SIR    FREDERICK POLLOCK, Lord Chief Baron,                V.P.,
                                in the Chair.
    The question of Mr.     J. S. Russell's re-admission into the Society
was put to the vote and carried.
    Lieut.-Colonel Sabine’s paper, entitled “ On Periodical Laws dis
coverable in the mean effects of the larger Magnetic Disturbances,"
was concluded.
 ‘
    In a discussion of the two-710tu observations of the magnetic
declination, made in 1841 and 184-2 at the observatories of Toronto
and Hobarton, published in 18%} and 184'5, the author expressed an
opinion that the magneticdisturbances, of largeamountand apparently       '
irregular occurrence, commonly called magnetic storms or shocks,

                                       81
would be found, when studied in their mean effects on the magnetic
direction and ferce extending over a suf<U+FB01>cient period of time, to be
subject to periodical laws, connecting them with the seasons of the
year and the hours of the day at the particular stations.
    In preparing for the press the hourly observations of the declina
tion in the years 1843, 1844 and 1845, at the same two stations, the
author found his previous opinions strongly con<U+FB01>rmed; and be
lieving that the evidence thus obtained of periodical laws is far too
systematic, and rests on a series of too long duration to make it pro
bable that it will be otherwise than con<U+FB01>rmed by the continuation of
the observations in subsequent years, he has been induced to make it
the subject of a. communication to the Royal Society; although it is
 probable that the exact periods, and the mean numerical values of
the effects produced, or their proportions to each other in the dif
ferent seasons and at the different hours, may hereafter receive
modi<U+FB01>cations.
     The disturbances which are the subject of this investigation
 have two leading characteristics,—lst, the irregularity of their
 occurrence,    many days together frequently passing without any
 trace of them being discoverable; and 2nd, the large amount of
 deviation from a mean or normal position, to which the needle is
 subject during their continuance.         It is this last feature which has
 led to their general recognition, and to the establishment of the fact,
 that when they take place their in<U+FB02>uence usually extends simul
 taneously, or nearly so, over all parts of the globe at which observa
 tions have been made. The same feature still affords their best and
 most convenient distinguishing mark.
     Availing himself of this characteristic, the author separated from
 the whole mass of hourly observations in the three years at both
 stations a suf<U+FB01>cient portion of disturbed observations to form an
 adequate basis for investigation.        The portion thus separated con
 sisted at Toronto of the 1650 largest deviations of the declination
 magnet from its mean position ; the whole number of hourly observa
 tions in the same period being 22,376, and the proportion therefore
 being 1 in 13-6; and at Hobarton of the 1479 largest deviations,
 the whole number being 21,436, and the proportion l in 14'5.             Of
 the 1650 disturbed observations at Toronto, 472 were in 1843, 612
 in 1844, and 566 in 1845.        Of the 1479 disturbed observations at
  Hobarton, 4-15 were in 1843, 562 in 1844, and 502 in 1845. Whence
  it appears, that at both stations, situated as they are in opposite
  hemispheres and nearly at opposite points of the globe, 1843 was
  the least disturbed year of the three, and 1844 the most so. Taking
  the number in 1845 as unity, the numerical proportions at each
 station are as follows  :-
                                     Toronto.        Hobarton.
                    1843.  . .. .. . . 0'84             0'83
                    1844  ........      1'08            1‘12
                    1 845 ........      1'00            1 '00
  This accordance, and the fact that the separated disturbed observa
 tions in these years occurred for the most part on the same days at

                                     3‘2
 the two stations, are noticed   as   corroborating the conclusions, de
 rived from former investigations,    of the character of these disturb
ances as affecting contemporaneously       the most distant parts  of the
globe.
    Several tables are given containing the distribution of the sepa
rated observations,——-lst, into the several months, and 2nd, into the
several hours, of their occurrence, the hours being those of local
time.    This is done, <U+FB01>rst, in regard to the number of disturbed ob
servations in the several months and hours; a separate account being
taken of those which are easterly, and of those which are westerly
de<U+FB02>ections; and second, in regard to the mean numerical values of
the de<U+FB02>ections at the different hours, distinguishing easterly and
westerly, and taken on a daily average throughout the year.          The
results of this analysis are carefully stated; and are conclusive, in
the author’s opinion, in manifesting the existence of periodical laws
in the times of Occurrence and in the effects of the larger disturb
ances; these laws having points of remarkable analogy at both
stations, and showing a causal connexion to subsist between the
disturbances on the one hand, and the seasons of the year and hours
of the day on the other.      5
    The author remarks on the practical bearing which the establish
ment of such laws must have on the researches, which have been
recently brought before the Royal Society by one of its most distin
guished members, into the physical causes of the periodical varia
tions of terrestrial magnetism, particularly of the diurnal magnetic
variation.    The .present investigation shows that the latter pheno
menon must now be‘regarded as consisting of two periodical varia
tions, superimposed upon each other, having extremely dissimilar
laws, and probably therefore different immediate causes.           These
constituent parts of the variation will bear di<U+FB02>‘erent proportions to
each other in different parts of the globe, and in many parts of the
globe it will be necessary, in the author’s opinion, to separate the
whole diurnal variation into its constituents in order to study their
respective physical causes.     At Toronto and Hobarton the diurnal
variation occasioned by the disturbances forms a clearly recognizable
part of the whole diurnal variation; the greater part, if not the
whole of that remarkable phenomenon, which Mr., Faraday has
termed the “nocturnal episode,” appearing to be attributable to this
cause.
    The author concludes by remarking, that the investigation which
forms the subject of this paper cannot be regarded as complete, until
the in<U+FB02>uence of the larger disturbances       on the phenomena of the
magnetic   inclination  and force   have   undergone a similar examina
tion. This he hopes to have a future opportunity of‘submitting to

   l. “ On the Explanation of the so-called ‘ Mysterious Circles.’-”
By the Rev. Robert H. Atherton.        Communicated by the Earl of
Rosse, P.R.S. &c.     Received November 28, 1850.
   The author refers to explanations which have been given of the
phenomenon,     of which he proposes to give a new one, and points
out various courses which the propelled air may be supposed to
to take with reference to the cards.      He then offers what he con
siders to be the true explanation of the phenomenon.            He con
sidersthat no sooner has the air struck upon the loose card, than it
is re<U+FB02>ected, spreading partly, if not entirely, over its surface, and
then ascends, carrying with it the interposing atmosphere, and ex
cluding the surrounding air. This, he submits, is analogous to ordi
nary suction, and by this means the loose card is at once drawn
up and <U+FB01>xed.     He considers that the re<U+FB02>ected air, thus rising and   ~
driven out by the descending current, will have additional power
when the <U+FB01>xed card is considerably larger than the other.

 Greenwich, from 184-0 November to 184-7 December." By G. B.
  Airy, Esq., F.R.S. &c., Astronomer Royal. Received January 9,
  1851.
     The author states, that in a voyage to Shetland, in the year 184-9,
  he heard allusions to the belief entertained generally by Norwegian
 seamen, that-a northerly wind may always be expected about the
 time of new moon.      The expression of this belief was so positive,
 and the implication of the interests of the persons entertaining it
 was so distinct, that it appeared to him extremely probable that
 there was some physical foundation for it.      At the first convenient
 opportunity he therefore took measures for discussing, with refer
  ence to this question, the directions of the wind at the Royal Ob
 servatory, during a period of rather more than seven years, as ascer
 tained from the records of Osler’s self-registering anemometer.
  He extended the research so far as to enable any one to judge
 whether there is any probable relation between any direction of
 wind and any age of the moon.
     The collection and summation of the numbers was effected under
 the immediate superintendence       of Mr. Glaisher; and great pains
 were taken to establish such checks on the operation that error is
 considered to be almost impossible.
     The general result is contained in a table subjoined to the paper.
 This exhibits the number of hours during which the wind blew in
 each of sixteen equal divisions of the azimuthal circle, and also the
 number of hours of sensible calm, in the period extending (with
 very small interruptions) from 184-0 November to 184-7 December,
arranged in reference to the days of the moon's age.         The author
 remarks, that while this table shows that there is great uncertainty
in the veri<U+FB01>cation of an empirical law, even from nearly ninety luna
tions, it seems very distinctly to negative the asserted law which
gave rise to the inquiry.

of experiments on the fall of Rain at various heights up to 3166 feet
above the sea-level.      Fourth paper.     For the year 1850."       By
John Fletcher Miller, Esq., F.R.S., F.R.A.S. &c.               Received
February 21, 1851.
    The observations detailed in this paper are similar to those de—
scribed by the author in his former papers, and the results deduced
from them agree generally with those previously obtained.
    In the introductory remarks, the author states that he determined
the heights of the different rain-gauges above the level of the sea by

                          ‘
                                       35
means   of an excellent Aneroid barometer (previously compared with
a standard), and a standard barometer read simultaneously, or nearly
so, at the sea-level; and he gives the heights of the several stations
as thus estimated.
   The most important fact connected with these observations is
stated to be the discovery of a mountain station which promises to
yield nearly one-third more rain than the hamlet of Seathwaite in
Borrowdale, hitherto, with good reason, considered to be the wettest
spot in the three kingdoms.     This, the new station, “the Stye,” on
Sprinkling Fell, is about a mile and a half distant from Seathwaite,
in a south-westerly direction, and 580 feet above         it,
                                                       at the extreme
southern terminatibn of the valley.      The actual quantity of water
measured in eleven months of 1850 was 174'33 inches; but as the
receiver was found running over on four different occasions, the loss
is calculated at  5   or  inches at least; and 5'67
                          6                            added, making
                                                          is
the quantity in eleven months 180-00 inches.      Adding to this 9'49
inches, the depth for January computed from that for January at
Seathwaite,  it appears that the whole depth of rain fallen at
                                                                  “ the

Stye" in 1850 was 189'49 inches.       The author further remarks,
that the wettest year since the commencement of the observations
was 1848, when 160'89 inches fell at Seathwaite; and computing
the fall at the new station for that year, we have 211-62 inches for
the depth of rain at “the Stye" in 1848.

   The time occupied by        heterogeneous
                               a                 cylinder in oscillating
upon a. horizontal plane through     small arc has been investigated
                                       a
by Euler; and he has determined the pressure of the cylinder upon
the plane when oscillating through any are, applying the formula he
has arrived at to <U+FB01>nd the pressure upon the plane at the highest and
lowest points of oscillation; It    the object of the present paper to
                                      is
endeavour to extend this investigation to the continuous rolling of
the cylinder, under which more general form its oscillation           ob    is
viously  included as  aparticular case.  In  the <U+FB01>rst  part of the paper,
the time of rolling through any angle, and therefore of completing
any given number of revolutions,      investigated; and in the second,
                                        is
the conditions of the pressure upon the plane at any period ofa
revolution.    The complete determination     of the time of rolling in

to the particular case of the oscillation of the cylinder, gives an ex
pression for the time of oscillation, through any arc, of pendulum   a

in<U+FB01>nitely small, the case becomes that of      pendulum oscillating on

    In the second part of the paper, general expressions are arrived
at for the vertical and horizontal pressure of the cylinder upon the
 plane on which     rolls, at any period of a revolution; and these are
                     it
 applied to determine the conditions under which        willjump, or slip

 the vertical pressure assumes       negative value; and whether such
                                          a                                                      a
jump will or will not take place in any revolution        determined by     is
 ascertaining whether the minimum value of the pressure in respect

 friction on the plane fall short of the horizontal resistance X, de
 termined as the necessary condition of its rolling.      As the friction
is   measured by the product of the coef<U+FB01>cient of friction by the
 vertical pressure V,        follows, that slipping will take place
                              it                                                                 if

than the coefficient of friction.    All these circumstances are investi
gated on the supposition that the centre of gravity of the cylinder                              is
situated at any given distance from its axis, and that          projected in
                                                                            it

any position with      given angular velocity, which angular velocity
                          a
must be assumed =0, to get the case of an oscillatory cylinder.
The investigation determines in this case the circumstances under
which pendulum oscillating by cylindrical axis, or by knife-edges
          a                                        a
on horizontal planes, willjump or slip upon its bearings unless other,
wise retained.       If <U+FB01>nite value be assumed for the angular velocity
                          a
suf<U+FB01>cient to cause complete revolutions to be made, and              the dia         if
meter of' the axis be assumed =0, the case will be arrived at of the
pressure upon its bearings of        falsely-balanced
                                           a            wheel, or any un
symmetrical body     revolving   about      <U+FB01>xed   horizontal
                                                        a      axis, friction
being neglected.

from the fact that the driving wheels of locomotive engines are all,
by reason of their cranked axles, falsely balanced unless counter

                                    37
 weights be applied.     The danger which might arise from this fact
 does not appear to have been at one time duly estimated; and when
 smaller engines were used than at present, and the axles were dif
 ferently cranked, the author thinks there is reason to believe that the
 accidents which not unl'requently occurred with these engines (some
 of them attended by fatal results) were due to this cause. The fact
 seems <U+FB01>rst to have been brought prominently under the notice of
 engineers by the experiments of Mr. George Heaton of Birmingham,
 who caused a falsely-balanced wheel to roll round the periphery
 of a circular table, by means of an axis <U+FB01>xed to a pivot in its centre,
 and thereby exhibited the tendency to jump created by even a small
 displacement of the centre of gravity.
  ~
    The analytical investigation in this paper shows how carefully the
 crank should be counterbalanced to provide the requisite security
 against the jumping of the wheel.      It appears, that, assuming the
 weight of an engine to be from 20 to 25 tons, and of a pair of six
 feet driving wheels from 2% to 3 tons, a displacement of the centre
 of gravity of the wheel of about 3 inches from its centre would be
 sufficient to cause it to jump at any instant when it attained a speed
 of sixty miles an hour.
    A  table is given in the paper of the displacements of the centre
 of gravity  necessary to produce jumps at different speeds.       These
 vary inversely as the squares of the speeds.
    Before ajump can take place, there must be a slip of the wheel,
                                                                          ‘
 or at least the wheel must cease to bite upon the rail; and to this
 cause, as well as to the reciprocating action of the two pistons, the
author considers may be due some portion of that <U+FB01>sh-tail motion
which is familiar to railway travellers.     The calculations show the
danger to be increased as the diameter of the driving wheel is di
minished, and they are unfavourable to the use of light engines.

and without <U+FB01>gures, they cannot alfect any value that may attach
to his own independent researches.
     The forms of Salpa examined were the S. democratica and S.
mucronata.
     The author <U+FB01>rst describes their outward form, and shows that
they are so different in appearance and in some points of organiza
tion, as to fully warrant the assumption (if they belonged to any
 other family) that they are different species.      He then proceeds to
 describe the various organs in detail; <U+FB01>rst, however, discussing the
 proper nomenclature of the sides and ends of these animals, a sub
ject on which much confusion has prevailed.            Particular attention
'is  called to the existence of an organ hitherto undescribed—a cylin
 drical, elongated body, like an internal shell,—here termed the “ en
 dostyle,” which lies in the dorsal sinus, and has hitherto been con
 founded with the “ dorsal folds" of Savigny.         A peculiar system of
 delicate transparent     vessels, taking its origin in the stomach and
 ramified over the-intestine, is    described and its nature inquired into.
     The organs of reproduction are next inquired into.          The young
 in the Salpa democratica constitute a “ Salpa-chain," and are shown
 to arise by gemmation from     a    tubular diverticulum of the vascular
 system of the parent.      In the course of their development they take
 the form of the S. mucronata.
     The young in the Sat/pa mucronata again      is  shown to be solitary,
 and attached to one point of the respiratory chamber of the parent
 by an organ which exactly represents in its structure       a  rudimentary
 mammiferous      placenta, except that in the Satpaz the “villus”       is
 formed by the maternal system, the “ placental cell” by the foetal
 system.     But the foetus here    is  not produced   by gemmation, as in
 the preceding case, but by   a    true process of sexual generation.
     Every Salpa mucronata contains at one period of its existence        a.
 solitary ovum, and   a    testis, which is  a rami<U+FB01>ed gland surrounding
 the intestine, and hitherto confounded with the liver. The solitary
  ovum becomes fertilized, pushed out into the respiratory cavity of
 the parent, and remains connected with the latter until         it  has as
 sumed the form of the Salpa democratica, when              it becomes de
                                          '
 tached.
      Chamisso’s formula therefore, “that the parent Salpa produces
  an offspring different from itself, which again produces an offspring
  different from itset<U+FB01> but similar to its parent,”    is perfectly correct,
 only the word “ produce” has two meanings—in the one case signi
  fying a process qucmmation, in the other of true sexual generation.
      The author next proceeds to describe the anatomy of Pyrosoma,
 and to point out its general harmony with that of Salpa. He shows

                                       39
    the existence    of an endostyle—a system of rami<U+FB01>ed intestinal tu
    bules—and of other organs precisely resembling those described in
    the latter    enus.   The “hepatic organ” of Savigny is the testis,
     while the emale generative organ consists of solitary pedicillate
     ova.   The arrangement of their parts is essentially the same as in
     Salpa, only that the fetus does not appear to be developed in pla
    cental connexion with the parent.
        The Pyrosomata increase by gemmation also, but the gemmae are
    solitary and do not form chains, becoming developed like those of
    the ordinary compound Ascidians between the pre-existing forms.
        In the next section, the zoological relations of the               and
    Pyrosomata, with the other Ascidians, are inquired into.Salge       he an
    thor endeavours to show that there is no essential difference of or
    ganization between the ordinary Ascidians and the Salpze; that the
    two forms grade insensibly one into the other; and that there is,
    therefore, no ground for breaking up the great ascidian family into
    the two subdivisions of Monochitonida and Dichitouida.
        With regard to the theory of the “alternation of generations)”
    the author submits that it is by no means a proper expression for
    the phaenomena presented by the Salpce. According to the author's
    view, the two forms of Salpa are not two generations of distinct in
    dividuals, but are, properly speaking, organs, and only when taken
    together, equivalent to an individual, in the sense in which that
    term is used among the higher animals.
       For these pseudo-individuals, in this and all analogous cases, the
    author proposes the name of “zob'ids,” simply for the purpose of
    avoiding the apparent paradox of' calling these highly-organized in
    dependent forms “organs,” though such, in the author’s opinion,
    they really are.

                                   “ Observations upon Appendicularia
and Doliolum.”        By Thomas H. Huxley, Esq. Communicated by
E. Forbes, Esq., F.R.S. Received Feb. 26, 1851.
    This is a description of two Ascidian genera which possess very
considerable interest: Doliolum, as forming a link between the
Pyrosomata and Salpaz; and Appendicularia, as representing in a
permanent form the larval state of the Ascidians, long ago described
 by M. Milne-Edwards.
    Appendicularia, which has been also imperfectly described under
the names of Oikopleura and Venillaria, is in fact an ascidian pro
 vided with a long vibratile <U+FB01>n or tail, by the aid of which it swims
 freely about.                                                             ,
     That it is an adult form is shown by the existence of a well
 devcloped testis, but the author leaves undecided the nature of the
 female organs.
     On the other hand it seems doubtful whether Doliolum is truly an
                                                                         ”

       The reading of Dr. Hofmann's paper- “ On the Molecular'Consti
   tution of the Organic Bases,” was resumed and concluded.
       In a former paper‘ the author advanced a general theory regard

   in all these substances the original structure of ammonia may be
   traced without dif<U+FB01>culty, and that they must be viewed as ammonia
   in which either one, two, or the three equivalents of hydrogen are
  replaced by a corresponding number of compound molecules; he
  accordingly distinguished the volatile bases as amidogen, imidogen,
  and nitrile bases.

      In  his present memoir he goes a step further, and communicates
  the discovery of a new group of alkaloids, closely connected by
  their origin and composition with the former class, but differing
  from it altogether by their properties.           These new alkaloids are no
  longer volatile without decomposition, and form in this manner the
  connecting link between the arti<U+FB01>cial bases, nearly all of which are
 volatile, and the natural alkaloids, the majority of which are of a
 <U+FB01>xed nature.
      The alkaloids of the new class, to which for the sake of conveni
 ence the author assigns the term of ammonium bases, arise from
 the nitrile bases by the assimilation of the additional equivalent of
 one of the replacing molecules in conjunction with oxygen and water.

 In    his memoir the author establishes the conditions under which
 this transformation     takes place, viz. the action of the alcohol iodides
on nitrile bases, and he developes the generality of his observations
by the description of about a dozen of new alkaloids prepared ac
cording to his method; he points out moreover that the number
which may be actually produced is nearly unlimited.
     The new substances which are formed under the above conditions,
are endowed with very remarkable properties.                   The alkaloid which
is formed by the union of four ethyl equivalents                      with nitrogen,
oxygen and water, the substance in which V=X=Y=Z=C+ H5, i, e.

     It is of a powerfully alkaline reaction, which manifests itself, not
 only in its deportmcnt with vegetable colours, but also in its com
,bining their pungent taste with the bitterness of quinine. The so
 lution, when concentrated, not only burns the tongue, but it acts
 strongly upon the epidermis, which it destroys, like caustic potassa
 or soda; on rubbing a solution of the oxide between the <U+FB01>ngers, we
  feel the well-known sensation produced by the <U+FB01>xed alkalies under
 the same circumstances, and we perceive moreover the same peculiar
 odour.      Oxide of tetraethylammonium, as the author calls this sub
  stance, saponi<U+FB01>es the fats as readily as potassa.       The experiment
  was made with cocoa-nut oil, which, after half an hour’s ebullition
  with the new alkali, was converted into a beautiful soft soap, having
  the appearance of an ordinary potassa soap.
      The author has traced the analogy of the new compound with
  potassa in many other directions, and especially in its deportment
  with the metallic oxides : his alkaloid, in fact, produces with the salts
  of the metals exactly the same reactions as potassa.
      The other substances belonging to this group have similar pro
  perties, modi<U+FB01>ed only by the character of the replacing molecules.
  Among them are several which are remarkable for the complex
  nature of their constitution, which, nevertheless, is perfectly intelli
  g ible.                                        .
      In conclusion, the author draws attention to the assistance which
  the solution of the grand problem of preparing arti<U+FB01>cially the natural
   alkaloids, especially those of the cinchona bark, may receive from a
  further extension of these researches.      He showsahat even now the
  analogy in the general deportment of his ammonium bases, and the
  alkaloids of nature, is very great, although they differ materially in
   many properties.
      A paper   was read, entitled “ Description and purpose of the glass
   plate which bears the inscription ‘Interlerenz-spectrum.         Longi
   tudo et celeritas undularum lucis relativa cum in ae're tum in vitro.”’
   By T. A. Nobert.          Communicated by Michael Faraday, Esq.,
   F.R.S. &c. Received April 10, 1851.
       A rectangular plate of polished glass, 18 lines (Paris) in length,
   9 lines in breadth, and 1'5 line in depth, has one of its longer narrow
   faces ground so as to form an angle of 72° with its upper surface.
   This narrow face is polished, the other three being ground at right
   angles to the upper and under surfaces.       On the upper surface, at
   about the distance of 2 lines from the acute dihedral angle, twelve
   systems of extremely <U+FB01>ne parallel lines are cut, so that in each
   system the lines are at perfectly equal distances, and the systems lie
   separate from one another.        Over these lines lies a thin covering
   plate  of glass, but  at the place where the ruling is, a stratum of air
   is contained between the plates.       In these twelve systems, named
   A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L and M, the respective distances
   of the lines measured with great accuracy in Paris lines, are as
  follow :—

    In order to use the plate, it is to be placed on the table of a com
pound microscope having a magnifying power of 40 to 50 times, the
table of the microscope being previously covered with black cloth
to prevent the intrusion of all foreign light.         The small covering
plate being placed upwards, the polished face forming an acute
angle with the upper side, is to be turned towards the window sup
plying light. The illumination must take place in a plane at right
angles to the length of the plate, and at an angle of 18° inclination
to the plane of the plate.       The light of strongly illumined clouds, or
ofa point of the heavens near to the sun, is to be employed: direct
sunlight is not recommended.           A greater angle of incidence is of no
consequence when making a preliminary observation ; but it is neces
sary,-in order to obtain strongly luminous colours, to turn the plate
a little in azimuth while examining thelines, thereby producing the
brightest illumination.       If these preliminary precautions be taken,
there will appear in the ruled space,—
                       for A,   deep red;
                            B,  orange;
                            C,  yellow;
                            D,  green;
                            E, light blue;
                            F, indigo ;
                           G,  violet.
    If  the foregoing numerical values for the systems A, B, C, I), E,
F   and G, be multiplied by cos 18°, the length of the undulations of
light in ‘air for those colours which .are seen in the rulings will be
obtained.      This method is considered to admit of great exactness
with this small angle of incidence, because its cosine varies but
little.
    As in   the following <U+FB01>ve systems, H, I, K, I, and M, no colour is
perceived, the distances between the lines being there smaller than
the lengths of the violet light-waves in air, the prediction of the un
dulatory theory is con<U+FB01>rmed.
    The plate is next to be turned so that the small covering plate,
and, therefore, also the side of the glass upon which the lines are
drawn, is downwards, and the polished narrow face towards the light,

                                         45
which, as before, is incident at an angle of 18° on the plate. In this
position, the light falling perpendicularly on the narrow face, passes
through it unbroken, and being within the glass re<U+FB02>ected from the
rulings, the coloured pictures of all the twelve systems are now ex
hibited in the microscope.        If the colours which these systems now
show, and which have been formed in the glass, be compared with
the former colours in the air, the system F, which is deep red, har
monizes with the system A in the air spectrum, and the systems G,
H, I, K, L and M in the glass spectrum, according to their order
and colour, correspond to the systems B, C, D, E, F and G in the
air spectrum; and the author considers that the comparison of the
foregoing values in the systems—
              A    and F,                               E  and  K,
              B    and G,
                           ‘
                                                       F  and  L,
             C and H,                                  G  and   M
              D and I,
shows that the lengths of undulation for the same colour in the air
and in the glass are in the ratio 1'53 to l, which is exactly the index
of refraction of this glass. He further remarks, that, as the same
period of undulation belongs to the same colour, the velocities of
 propagation in air and in the glass must be in the ratio of the mean
 value of the distances of the lines in the <U+FB01>rst seven systems, A, B, C,
 D, E, F, G, to the mean value of the distances of the lines in the
last seven systems, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, or as 1'53 to l ; and that
both results agree perfectly with the deductions from the wave
theory of light.      In conclusion, the author points out the extraordi
nary degree of accuracy required in drawing these lines. It is stated
that if inequalities amounting only to “000002 line occur in the sy
stems F, G, H, I, K, L, M, stripes of another colour will appear in
them; and if the distance of the lines in M be diminished by that
                                       '
quantity, all colour disappears.

    From the     active  zeal with which you pursue the phenomena of
terrestrial magnetism, and collect all the facts which can conduce to
the elucidation of this di<U+FB01>icult subject, I think that some researches
with which    I   have occupied myself will not be wholly uninteresting
to you ; and I therefore address you the following lines, which have       I
also permitted myself to write in my own language.
    Some years ago       I  employed myself in endeavouring            to correct
the   constants    which   Gauss    has    given for  the   earth's   magnetism.
The process I adopted was by considering the horizontal and verti
cal components separately; but when I learned that Erman had the

                                               4-6
same Work in hand, I left mine un<U+FB01>nished.                       I did not then possess
 the Reports of the British Association, as it was not until this last
summer (1850) that they were obtained here, and when I had seen
 Erman's results, I at once decided on taking up my work afresh.                          I
have made use of all the data              I could procure, and have thus been
able to determine the component Z at above 1400 places, including
                                           I
a series of observations which had myself made from 1847 to 184-9
in Lie<U+FB02>and, Esthonia, Finland, Norway, and on the route from Arch
angel to Petersburg.             I haVe as far as possible reduced all determi
nations to the epoch of 1830.                A calculation of the several observa
tions by the method of least squares would have required an entire
       I
life; therefore preferred following the same path as Gauss; in doing
this, however,       I   soon discovered that the 5th order could not be
neglected;     and     I  then obtained the following values :

    A comparison will show you that these quantities agree much
better with Gauss's than Erman’s do; and this is also true in respect
to the agreement with the observations, especially in the high south
latitudes.    Thus there was found—

 require a small correction. I do not however mean to examine
this at present, but propose <U+FB01>rst to consider the horizontal compo
nent, in order to satisfy myself previously whether both components
depend upon the same constants or not.                      The probable error of a
single determination is nearly 19; and to show the degree of agree
ment, I subjoin the following table.                 As in forming it I merely took
from my large table every 10th observation in the order of succes
sion, you will not be surprised at <U+FB01>nding unimportant places, whilst
others of greater note in their vicinity are omitted: it may suf<U+FB01>ce
however for the present purpose.                   The quantities given are the dif
ferences between the observed and calculated vertical intensity.

        In theabove table, the horizontal force was obtained by vibrations,
     and reduced to 0° Reaumur.        Before and after my journey in 1847,
     the force was determined at Dorpat by Gauss's method, and the
     needle employed compared therewith and reduced to the intensity in
     London=l372. Subsequently          I  preferred for trying the needles,
     Poisson’s method, at least for traveling purposes; but some alterations
     require to be introduced in Poisson's formula, as he has overlooked
     some things.    With the same needle which              I
                                                       employed in both my
    journeys,    I have made more than 60 determinations         of absolute
     force at Dorpat, partly in. a room and partly in the open air, and in
     temperatures varying from —13° R. to + 25° R., and have found a
     very good accordance.        I
                                  also made several such determinations in
     the journeys of 1848 and 1849.
        As I do not possess an observatory, and cannot employ a Bi<U+FB01>lar
     in my dwelling-house, it has not been possible for me to compare
     the variations of the force with my determinations;               I
                                                               have however
     made use of the following method:--                If
                                                  X be the magnetism of the
     earth and m that of the needle,        Iseek not X but m; this latter
     quantity depends   on  the temperature t and the time T, as the needle
                             I
     is not constant; but if combine all the values of m by an equation
     of the form
                            m=A+B e_aT+e.t
     and calculate the constants, the error is about mlwm. Besides this,
     several simultaneous observations with Gauss's apparatus have shown
     that the value of m was itself correct.
        The Inclinations have in part been determined by two needles
    which agreed very well with each other; they are so balanced that
    I  can always take the mean of the eight arcs.          On the other hand
     they are subject to the error of the axle, which I cannot exactly cor
     rect, but which does not however exceed 5’.          It was only last sum
     mer, when I examined the subject more closely, that               I
                                                                  became aware
    you had likewise the idea of loading the needle, and observing in
    di<U+FB01>‘erent azimuths.     In our latitudes the best loading is such as will
     cause the north pole to be. in one set about 10° above, and in a
     second set 10° below the horizontal line.                             I
                                                     Three series which made
     with one needle were calculated by my friend Claussen, who in
    doing so was led to a method of entirely eliminating'the form of the
    axle.   Take a well-balanced needle,‘the axles of which are not cy
    lindrical; different degrees of magnetic force can be given to it with
    out reversing the poles.     Taking the strongest force as unity, it is
    not practically advantageous to go to lower ratios than % or                -§-.
    Though vibration experiments with dipping-needles are not gene
    rally advantageous, yet they suf<U+FB01>ce         this case, as an approximately

the two determinations are 70° 42"1, 70° 4~2"3,    we add to each                  if
the   half
         difference.
    In thismethod, in which no reversal is,needed, the differences of
the partial determinations will appear somewhat large, but you must
not forget that instead of the ordinary eight observations only two
have been taken.
I    permit myself one additional remark. In observations on dif
ferent azimuths,        usual to take simpl)r cot I=cot
                               it   is                         cos a; in                       I1
latitudes where the dips are so high as here and in England, this
equation may be employed without much error, as the force in
azimuths perpendicular to the meridian          little less than in the is
meridian but  ;      quite otherwise in small dips.
                          it   is                     With the decrease
of force the possibility of error increases, and hence when the ob
servations made in different azimuths are combined as by Kup<U+FB01>‘er,
they have not the same weight.        In more exact determinations                                          I

 an Orville, or its remains, was discovered after death in the Fallopian

 Curling, Esq" F.R,S. Received Feb. 20, 1851.
     ,At the commencement of the paper the author refers to the opi
 nions of Drs. Power, Lee, Paterson, Barry, Girdwood, and Wharton
 JWS Of this country, and also to those of MM. Valentin, Negrier,
 Ponchet, Genilrin, Raciborski, and Bischo<U+FB01>' on the continent, re
 specting the supposed nature of the physiological-phenomena manie
 fested during the peirod of menstruation; and he mentions the law
 of Bisoth', namely, that “ the ova formed in the ovaries of the
 females of all mammiferons animals, including the human female,
             a; periodical maturation and exclusion quite independently
    m

occurs, the ovum isnevertheless evolved from the ovary, and enters
the Fallopian tube where        it  perishes."    He states, however, that the
 arguments ubiehhave-bsen advanced               in  support of this Opinion
in respaptlvgfjbg human-female, are entirely of an analogical cha

    In the <U+FB01>rst   of  the cases recorded, the woman died during              men
                                                                               a
sfl'<U+FB02><U+FB02>l Period.      She had been an inmate of the London Hospital For
twenty-flour days h<U+FB02>f<U+FB02>ne her death, where she was closely watched
day and night in name.           in  consequence of her hsvmg attempted

                                     56
self-destruction by cutting her throat      twenty-nine days before her
death.
   An examination of the body showed that the pelvic viscera were
much congested; that the uterus was considerably enlarged; that
the vagina contained a sero-sanguineous <U+FB02>uid; and that the hymen
was unruptured.       The ovaries were covered with stellate <U+FB01>ssures,
or cicatrices; and at one part of the left organ there was a purple
spot having a ragged hole in its centre.       By means of an incision
into the gland through this spot, it was found that the opening led
into a small cavity which was surrounded at its lower part by a
dense tissue, in<U+FB01>ltrated with dark coagulated blood (reference was
here made to the preparation which shows the cavity and its coa
guluni).    After macerating in spirit for a short time, it was noticed  .
that the clot consisted of four parts, which the author described.
   In other parts of the ovary several false cmpora lutea, in different
stages of decline, were found.      The Fallopian tubes were highly con
gested,  and the  cavities of the tubes  were <U+FB01>lled with a bloody mucus.
 The left one contained at about one inch from its <U+FB01>mbriated end, a
small vesicular body, which was, in the author’s opinion, an ovule;
for it consisted of nucleated cells and oil-globules.          The <U+FB02>uid
matters of the uterus and Fallopian tubes were made up of blood
discs, cylindrical epithelium, granular corpuscles, and a few spindle
shaped bodies.
   The second case was that of a girl who had died at St. Luke’s
Hospital, where the supervision of the patient was quite as strict as
that in the last case. In this instance the anatomical features were
precisely like the preceding.      The right Fallopian tube contained a
globular body similar to that fOUnd in the left on the former occa
sion.   This globular body, on being crushed between two pieces of
glass and examined under the microscope, was found to consist ex
ternally of a mass of nucleated cells, the remains of the tunica gra
nulosa, and of a transparent ring, enclosing an opake granular
mass, and a highly pellucid spot.       The author considered that this
body was the liberated ovule, and the in<U+FB02>uence of chemical reagents
served to support his opinion.
   An examination of the corpora lutea found in both cases, showed
that they consisted of large granular corpuscles and oil-globules.
   The conclusions arrived at by the author were as follows :—
   1. That ovules escape from the ovaries of women during-the
period of menstruation; and that their escape is a spontaneous act,
taking place quite independently of sexual intercourse.
   2. That immediately       before, or else consentaneous with, the
escape of an ovule, the whole substance of the Graa<U+FB01>an follicle
becomes charged with etfused blood; and that a sort of fatty dege
neration of the e<U+FB02>'used matter soon afterwards takes place.
   3. That the mere presence of a yellow body containing a clot in
the ovary, is not by any means a certain sign of recent impregnation.
   4-- That a sanguineous <U+FB02>uid is poured out over the whole mucous’
tract of the generative system during the catamenial period.
   5. That the results of the observation tend to con<U+FB01>rm the opinions

                                   57
entertained by Wagner, Bischo<U+FB01>‘, Barry, and Wharton Jones, con
cerning the membranous nature of that portion of the ovule known
as the zona pellucida.
   6. That the oil-globules of the yelk are either enclosed in a di
stinct membrane, or else that a structureless solid material pervades
the entire substance of the vitelline body, and so binds the several
component elements of it together.
    7. That the- recognition of the germinal vesicle removes some
doubts concerning its appearance and position in the germ-mass.

          The  EARL OF ROSSE,          President, in the Chair.
   Professor Owen delivered the Croonian Lecture, being the sub
stance of his paper “On the Megatherium.”—-Part II.            Received
May 6, 1851.
   In his lecture the author premised a brief sketch of the successive
steps which had led to the knowledge of the Megatherium acquired
at the date of his researches, and of the different hypotheses which
had been broached of its af<U+FB01>nities,habits and food. He then recounted
the mode of the acquisition of thecomplete skeleton, and of its articula
tion, at the British Museum, and commenced its description by the
vertebrae of the trunk. These consist of 7 cervical, 16 dorsal, 3 lum
bar, 5 sacral, and 18 caudal vertebrae.     The <U+FB01>rst to the <U+FB01>fth dorsal
vertebrae are characterized by having the ordinary number of arti
cular processes (2 gapophyses), two before and two behind; and by
having three articular surfaces for the ribs on each side, one on the
centrum,. one on the neurapophysis, and one on the diapophysis.
The sixth dorsal vertebra has an accessory zygapophysis between
the posterior pair; the thirteenth dorsal has one between the anterior
pair; the seventh to the twelfth inclusive have the accessory median
zygapophysis between both the anterior and posterior pairs of the
ordinary zygapophyses.       The fourteenth and succeeding dorsals
have no costal surface on the diapophysis 0r centrum.            The <U+FB01>f
teenth has both metapophysis and anapophysis—the latter with an
articular surface: the sixteenth superadds the parapophysis with an
articular facet.
    The lumbar vertebrae lose the costal surface on the centrum, and
retain the metapophyses, anapophyses and parapophyses.               The
nature of these accessory processes was explained by reference to
the descriptions and <U+FB01>gures of the exogenous processes of vertebrae
in Part I. of the present Memoir.
    The characteristics of the cervical vertebrae were next detailed.
    Of the <U+FB01>ve anchylosed sacral vertebrae, three are con<U+FB02>uent with
 the iliac bones, and two with the ischia.
    The fourteen anterior caudals are characterized by articular sur
 faces for haemapophyses.     These elements are separate from each
other in the <U+FB01>rst caudal, and con<U+FB02>uent as usual at their distal ends,
            ‘
forming a chevron-bone’ in the others. The posterior zygapophy
ses lose their articular surfaces in the eleventh caudal; the anterior

                                          58
ones disappear in the tWeli'th; the metapnpbysr-<U+FB02>            h"? WWW    is
the <U+FB01>fteenth.    The neural canal is unclosed above in the sisteenth;
and the vertebra is reduced to its central element in the last two
caudals.
    The skull is remarkable for its small proportional size. for its long
and slender cranial portion. its large and complex zygomatip arches,
its broad truncate facial part, with the slender produced premag,
illaries, and For the great depth of the middle of the lower jaw.
    The mastoid element develoess a large tuberous process and a
deep semicircular articular cavity for the stylohyal.        The malar
bone sends down a long process Outside the lower jaw.         The num
ber of teeth       is   433:18,   the <U+FB01>fth in the upperjaw being the smallest,
They are alike in structure, and di<U+FB02>‘er but little in shape: thpgrinding
surface in most is cr0ssed by two transverse ridges, the summits of
which are formed by hard dcntine; the rest of the tooth being
composed of a central body of vaso-dentine and a peripheral mass
of vascular cement.       The microscopic characters of these several
constituents of the teeth were then described.      Each tooth is deeply
implanted     in the jaw,  where  it terminates   without   dividing into
fangs, by a widely open pulp-cavity for a persistent matrix, ensuring
perpetual growth.      The stylohyal bone has the form of a hammer,
with a long, slightly bent handle; one part of the head being thickl
ened and rounded for articulation with the cavity in the mastoid.
   The scapiila presents almost the form of a trapezium, with the
int'erioran'gle bent outwards, increasing the depth of the subspiual
fossa: there is a rudiment of a second spine, below the normal one:
the aoromion is expanded, produced and continent with the col-amid ;
and the supraspin'al fossa is perforated by n. circulxr aperture.    The
clavicle has a well-marked sigmoid <U+FB02>exure, equally-developed obtuse
extremities, without any articular surface.     The humerus is remark.
able for the enormous development of ridges for the attachment of
the muscles, especially at its distal end: the inner eondyle is not
perforated as in the Megalonym; it is devoid of a umdullary cavity.
    The ulna and radios are next described. The corpus consists of
seven bones, three of which are proper to the <U+FB01>rst row, three to the
second, and one is eomgnon to both; the latter answers to the ‘scas
phoides’ anydrtrapeeium’in the human wrist, and articulates with
     radius above, and the rudiment of the metacarpal of the pollex

   Only four digits are developed,   the <U+FB01>rst or tpollex

 progressively   increase in length from the <U+FB01>rst to the <U+FB01>fth.     The
 fourth digit or‘annularis' has three phalanges, the last being-un
 gaieulate' and longer than that of the ‘madius.’      The <U+FB01>fth digit
 has only two very short rounded phalanges, which were doubtless

    than in the digitus medius of the fore-foot, and differs in the greater
    breadth of' the upper part of the claw-sheath, and in the straighter
    cone, or bony core, which supported the claw.        The metatarsals of
    the fourth and <U+FB01>fth toes are much larger than that of the third; but
   they support mere rudiments of digits reduced in each to two stunted
  phalanges, which were doubtles buried like those of the outer digit
  in the fore-foot in   a kind of callous hoot'. -
       Having completed the description of the skeleton, which is illus
  trated by an extensive series of accurate and highly <U+FB01>nished
   drawings, the author proceeds to the comparison of the modi<U+FB01>ca
   tions of the osseous structure of the gigantic extinct animal with that
   in other known existing and extinct species of the class Mammalia.
       The teeth agree in number, kind, mode of implantation and
   growth, with those of the Sloth, and their structure is a modi<U+FB01>cation
   of that peculiar to the Sloth-tribe. All the modifications of the
   skull relating to the act of mastication, especially the large and
   complex malar bone, repeat the peculiarities presented by the ex
   isting Sloths.    There are the same hemispheric depressions for the
   hyoid   bone  in the Megatherium as in the Sloth. In the number of
   cervical vertebrae the Megatherium, like the two-toad Sloth, agrees
   with the Mammalia generally. In the accessory articular surfaces
   a<U+FB01>‘orded by the anapophyses and parapophyses of the hinder dorsal
   and lumbar vertebrae, the Megatherium resembles the Ant-eaters
  (Myrmecophagaa):      but it does not resemble the Armadillos (Dasypus)
  in having long metapophyses, the peculiar development of which in
  those loricated Bruta has a direct relation to the support of their
  bony dermal armour.          In the mesozygapophyses ot' the middle
  dorsal vertebrae the Megatherium is peculiar.        In the small extent
   of the produced and pointed symphysis pubis it resembles the Sloths;
   and in the junction of both ilium and ischium with the sacrum, it
  manifests a character common to the Edentate order; but in the
  expanse and massiveness of the iliac bones, it can only be compared
. with other extinct members of its own peculiar family of Phyllo
  phagous Edentata.       Its habits necessitating a strong and powerful
  tail, we <U+FB01>nd this resembling in its bony structure that of other
  Edentata with a similar appendage, especially in the independency
  of the two haemapophyses of the <U+FB01>rst caudal, a character which ob
  tains in the Great Ant-eater and in some Armadillos; but this is
  no evidence of direct af<U+FB01>nity to either of these families; the habits
  of' the small arboreal Sloths render their eminently prehensile limbs
  sufficient for their required movements, and the tail is wanting.
  Had that appendage been proportionally as large as in the Mega
  therium, we cannot suppose that the caudal vertebrae would have
  materially differed from those of other Edentata.
      In the coalescence of the anterior vertebral ribs with the bony
  sternal ribs, the Megatherium resembles the Sloths.        This essential
  af<U+FB01>nity is still more marked in the peculiarities of the scapula and

                                   61
of the carpus. In the Myrmeoophagajubata, the        scaphoid is distinct:
in the Mum's it coalesces with the lunare: in        the Dasypus gigas
the trapezoides is anchylosed to the second metacarpal : in the Bus.
sexcinctus it has coalesced with the trapezium.        Not any of these
characteristics are manifested by the Megatherium : its carpus re
peats the peculiarities of that in the Sloths, viz. the reduction of the
number of carpal bones to seven by the coalescence of the scaphoid
with the trapezium. The <U+FB01>rst digit (pollex), which is retained in
the Anteaters and Armadillos, is obsolete in the Megatherium as
in the Sloths and Orycteropus: three digits are fully developed and
armed with claws, as in the Bradypus tridactylus; and the <U+FB01>fth,
though incomplete in the Megatherium, is better developed, because
it was required in the ponderous terrestrial Sloth for its progression
on level ground.     In no existing ground-dwelling Edentate is the
<U+FB01>fth digit deprived of its ungual phalanx, as in the Megatherium.
The bones of the fore-foot of that extinct animal are thus seen to be
modi<U+FB01>ed mainly after the type of the Bradypodidw.
    The long bones of all the limbs are devoid of medullary cavities, as
in the Sloths. The femur lacks the ligamentum teres as in the Sloths.
The <U+FB01>bula is anchylosed to the tibia at both ends in Megatherium,
as in Dasypus; but this is not the case in the closely-allied      extinct
Megatherioids called Mylodon, Megaltmyx and Scelidothzm'um, a
 fact which diminishes the force of the argument which Cuvier de
duced from the coalesced condition of the bones in the Megatherium
in favour of its af<U+FB01>nities to the Armadillos.    The semi-inverted but
<U+FB01>rm interlocking articulation of the hind-foot to the leg shows the
peculiarities of that joint in the Sloths exaggerated, and departs
further from its characteristics in other Edentata. In all the existing
Edentata, save the Sloths, the hind-foot is pentadactyle, and four of
the toes have a long claw, even in the little arboreal Myrmecoplzaga
didactyla: the departure by degradation from the pentadactyle type
is a peculiar characteristic of the Sloth-tribe in the order.        It is
carried further in the same direction in the great extinct terrestrial
Sloths. , In these the mutilation of the foot has commenced on the
outer side .by the removal of the nngual phalanx from‘the <U+FB01>fth and
fourth toes; but this-accompanied by modi<U+FB01>cations which adapt these
toes to' the important of<U+FB01>ce of support and progression of the body on
level ground. > In the scansorial Sloths, the three middle digits being
equally developed for prehension, one toe on the outer and one on
the inner side of the foot, are reduced to their metatarsal basis. In
the Megatherium the. mutilation of the foot on the inner side is
carried to a greater extent; the innermost toe or hallux, with its
entocuneit'orm    bone, is wholly removed: the second toe is repre
sented, like the <U+FB01>rst in the Sloths, by its cuneiform bone and a
 coalesced rudiment of the metatarse: and it is only the third toe or
 medius that repeats the condition of the claw-bearing toes in the
 climbing Sloths.
    Finally, the author enters upon the question of the habits andfood
 of the Megatherium.       Guided by, the general rule that animals
 having the same kind of dentition have the same kind of food, he

lsngth,and from the increased strength and the inequality ofthe cldws,
 especially the disproportionately large size of that weapon of the
 middle digit, that the fore-foot of the Megatherium was occasionally
 applied by the short and strOng t‘oreelimbin the act of digging; but
 its analogy totbstt of the Ant-eaters teaches that the fossorial actions
 were limited to the removal of the surfaceasoil, in order to expose
 something there concealed, and not for the purpose of burrowing;
 Such an instrument would be equally effective in the disturbance of
 roots and outs; it   is,however, still better adapted for grasping than
for delving. But to whatever task the partially unguiculate hand of
the Megatheriurn might have been applied, the bones of the wrist,
fore-arm; arm and shoulder, attest the prodigious force which would
be brotight to bear upon its execution.      The general organization of
the anterior extremity of the Megatherium          incompatible with its
                                                  is
being   a. strictly scansorial or exclusively fossorial animal, and its
teeth and jaws decidedly negative the idea of its having fed upon
insects; the two extremes in regard to the length of the jaws are
presented by the phyllophagous and myrmeoophagous            members of
the Edentate order, and the Megatherium in the shortness of its
face agrees with the Sloths.
    Proceeding then to other arts of the skeleton for the solution of
the question as to how the       egatherium obtained its leafy feed, the
author remarks that the pelvis and hind limbs of the strictly bur:
rowing animals, 2. y. the Mole, are remarkably slender and feeble,
and that they offer no notable development in the Rabbit, the‘ Orch
terope, or other less powerful exoavatcrs.      In the climbing animals,
as 2.9.- the Sloth and Orang, the hinddlegs are much shorter than
the fore-legs, and even in those Quadrumana          in whichv the pro:
henslle tail    superadded to the sacrum, the pelvis
                 is                                       not remarkable
                                                         is
for its Bile or the e'xpansioii of the illae bones.   But in the Mega
thorium the extraordinary size and massive proportions of the pelvis
and hind limbs arrest the attention of the least curious beholder, and
become eminently                   to “the physiologist of the peculiar

 from the soil.    The fore-limbs being? Well adapted for grasping thd
trunk of     tree,
             a      the forces concentrated upon them from the broad
    terlor basis  of  the body may have cooperated with them in the
  abour, to which they are so Amply adorned, of uprooting and pro"
starting the tree. To giVe the resistance and stability to the pelvis;
the bones of the hind=legs are as extraordinarily developed, and the
strong and potveri'nl tail must have concurred with the two hiud~legs
in forming      tripod as
                 a          a  firm foundation for the massive pelvis, and
a<U+FB02>brding adequate        resistance  to- the forces acting from and “pub
that great  osseous    centre.    The   large processes and capacious spinal
canal indicate the strength of the muscles which surrounded the tall;

                                    6+
 and the vast mass of nervous <U+FB01>bre from which those muscles derived
 their energy.     The natural co-adaptation of the articular surfaces
 shows that the ordinary in<U+FB02>ection of the end of the tail was back
 wards as in a caudafulciens, not forwards as in a cauda prehensilis.
 Dr. Lund’s hypothesis, therefore, that the Megatherium was a
 climber and had a prehensile tail, is destroyed by the now known
 structure of that part.                                               _
    But viewing, as the author conceives, the pelvis of the Mega
 therium as being the <U+FB01>xed centre towards which the fore-legs and
 fore-part of the body were drawn in the gigantic leaf-eater’s efforts
 to uprend the tree that bore its sustenance, the colossal proportions of
 its hind extremities and tail lose all their anomaly, and appear in
just harmony with the robust claviculate and unguiculate fore-limbs
 with which they combined their forces in the Herculean labour.
    The author then referred to the Mylodon robustus, a smaller ex
tinct species of the same natural family of phyllophagous Bruta, and
 to the additional arguments derivable from the skeleton of that
 animal in favour of the essential af<U+FB01>nity of the Megatherium to the
 Sloths ; and the light which the remarkable healed fractures of the
 skull of a specimen in the Museum of the College of Surgeons
 threw upon the habits and mode of life of the species.
    Finally, with reference to the hypothesis of the German authors
 and artists of the degeneration of the ancient Megatherioids of South
 America into the modern Sloths, the author remarked that the
 general results of the labours of the anatomist in the restoration of
 extinct species, viewed in relation to their existing representatives
 of the different continents and islands, commonly suggested the idea
 that the races of animals had deteriorated in point of size. Thus
the palmated Megaceros is contrasted with'the Fallow-deer, and the
 great Cave-bear with the actual Brown Bear of Europe.         The huge
 Diprotodon and Nototherium afford a similar contrast with. the
 Kangaroos of Australia, and the towering Dinornis and Palapteryx
 with the small Apteryx of New Zealand.         But the comparatively
 diminutive aboriginal animals of South America, Australia and New
Zealand, which are the nearest allies of the gigantic extinct species
respectively characteristic of such tracts of dry land, are speci<U+FB01>cally
distinct, and usually by characters so well marked as to require a
subgeneric division, and such as no known or conceivable outward
in<U+FB02>uences could have progressively transmuted.~ Moreover, as in
 England, for example, our Moles, Water-voles, Weasels, Foxes and
Badgers, are of the same species as those that co-existed with the
Mammoth, Ti'chorrine Rhinoceros, Cave Hyaana, Bear, &c. ; so like
wise the remains of small Sloths and Armadillos are found associated
with the Megatherium and Glyptodon in South America; the fossil
remains of ordinary Kangaroos and Wombats occur together with
those of gigantic herbivorous marsupials; and there is similar evidence
that the Apteryx existed with the Dinornis: and the author offered
the following suggestions as more applicable to or explanatory of the
phenomena than the theory of transmutation and degradation.          He
observed, that in proportion to the bulk of an animal is the dif<U+FB01>culty

                                      65
 of the contest which, as a living being, it has to maintain'against
 the surrounding in<U+FB02>uences which are ever tending'to dissolve the
 vital bond and subjugate the organised matter to the ordinary che
 mical and physical forces.     Any changes, therefore, in the. external
 circumstances in which a species may have been created to exist,
will militate against that existence in probably a geometrical ratio
to the bulk of such species.     If a dry season be gradually prolonged,
the large mammal will suffer from the drought sooner than the
small one; if such alteration        of climate affect the quantity of
vegetable food, the bulky Herbivore will <U+FB01>rst feel the effects of the
stinted nourishment; if new enemies are introduced, the large and
conspicuous quadruped or bird will fall a prey, whilst. the smaller
species might conceal themselves and escape.          Smaller quadrupeds
are usually, also, more proli<U+FB01>c than larger ones. The actual presence
therefore of small species of animals in countries where the larger
species of the same natural families formerly existed, is not to be
ascribed to any gradual diminution of the size of such larger animals,
but is the result of circumstances which may be illustrated by the
fable of ‘ the oak and the reed'; the small animals have bent and
accommodated themselves to changes under which the larger species
have succumbed.

    1. “ Note relating to M. Foucault’s new mechanical proof of the
 Rotation of the Earth."      By C. Wheatstone, Esq., F.R.S., Corre
sponding Member of the Academies of Science of Paris, Berlin,
 Brussels, Turin, Rome, Dublin, &c.        Received May 15, 1851.
    The experiment which led M. Foucault to his ingenious and in
 teresting researches relating to the rotation of the earth, is stated
by him thus :—“ Having <U+FB01>xed on the arbor.of a lathe and in the
direction of the axis, a round and <U+FB02>exible steel rod, it was put
in vibration by de<U+FB02>ecting it from its position of equilibrium and
leaving it to itself. A plane of oscillation is thus determined, which,
 from the persistence of the visual impressions, is clearly delineated
 in space; now it was remarked that, on turning by the hand the arbor
 which serves as a support to this vibrating rod, the plane of oscil
 lation is not carried with it."
    This persistence of the plane of oscillation of a vibrating rod,
 notwithstanding the rotation of the point to which its end is <U+FB01>xed,
 does not appear to have hitherto been made the subject of philoso
phical observation.      Ordinary notions even seem to have been
 opposed   to this   now recognised fact.      Chladni in his treatise on
 Acoustics, in the chapter “On the co-existence of vibrations with
other kinds of motion," states as follows :—
    “
      Vibratory motions may co-exist with all other kinds of motions
Paocaanmos or THE ROYAL Socra'rv.               VOL.  VI. No.  80.    5

                                       66
    in an in<U+FB01>nity of different manners, as has been demonstrated by
    Dan. Bernoulli and L. Euler in vols. xv. and xix. of the Nov.
     Comment. Acad. Petrop., and con<U+FB01>rmed by experiment. These co
    existences of different motions occur in all sonorous bodies without
    exception: we may, for example, produce the sound of a string
    stretched on a board, or that of a plate, a tuning-fork, a bell, &c-.;
    and while the vibrations still last, impress on this sonorous body a
    motion of rotation round its axis, and at the same time a progress
    ive motion: thus all these motions may be performed in the same
    time, without one being hindered by the other; but the absolute
    motion of each point will be very complicated.”
       Now this is true only when the vibrating body is constrained to
    vibrate in one direction. When the rod or string is equally <U+FB02>exible
    in every direction, the plane of vibration given to it from any origi
    nal impulse is constantly maintained whateVer may be the velocity
    of rotation communicated to its point of support, provided the axis
    of vibration remains in the same position, or moves only parallel to
    itself.
       This observed independence ofthe plane 'of oscillation on the point
    of attachment led M. Foucault to assume, that were a <U+FB02>exible pen
    dulum suspended from a <U+FB01>xed point in the prolongation of the axis
    of the earth, that is above one of the poles, and maintained con
    stantly in vibration, the plane of oscillation maintaining an inva
    riable position in space would appear to a spectator on the earth's
    surface and moving with it to make an entire revolution in twenty
     four hours, but in the 'op'pOsite direction to that of the rotation of
    the earth.
       What takes place at other points of the earth’s surface is more dif
    <U+FB01>cult to determine; but M. Foucault, from mechanical and geome
    trical considerations, was led to the conclusion that the angular dis
    placement of the plane of oscillation is equal but opposite to (the
    angular motion of the earth multiplied. by the sine ‘of the latitude.
    According to the theory of rotation, <U+FB01>rst established try Frisi and
    more fully developed by Euler and Poinsot, the velocity ofirot<U+FB01>tidn
    of the earth may be considered as the resultant of 'two angular velo
    cities, one round the Vertical of the point where the observer is
    placed, and the other round the meridian or horizontal lilie'iyi<U+FB01>giN.
'
     and S. The component of the angular velocity estimated island
     the vertical axis is in sin 'y, and the plane of oscillation ,ndt partici

of the       that the plane of oscillation of a vibrating line remains
           earth,-
at rest with relation to the Vertical component of the real axis of
rotation, may not be unacceptable.      With this view I have devised
the apparatirs       I
                 am about to describe.               1
   A semicircular  arch from one to two feet radius is <U+FB01>xed vertically
 on a horizontal wheel, and may thus be moved with any degree of
rapidity from any one azimuth to another.        A rider slides along the
inner edge of the arch, which is graduated, and may be <U+FB01>xed at any
degree marked thereon.      A spiral spring wire, by means of which a
slow vibration is obtained with a comparatively short length, is ati
tached at the lower end to a pin fixed in the axis of the semicircle, so
that the point of attachment may be in the axis of rotation, and at
the upper end it is <U+FB01>xed to a similar pin in a parallel position <U+FB01>xed to
the rider.   The vertical semicircle is not placed in a diameter of the
horizontal wheel, but parallel to             it,
                                       at such distance as not to inter
cept, from the eye of the observer, the'vertical plane passing through
the diameter, and in which plane the wire in all its positions
remains.
                                                                                                   '
   When the upper end of the wire         placed at 90°, that
                                                    is            when            is          it
coincides with the axis of rotation, if the wire be caused to vibrate
in any'given plane, say from N. to 8.,       will continue to do so what

ever rotation may be communicated        to the wheel; so that with res
spect to the moving wheel, or- the axis of the wire, the plane of vibra
tion will move with the same velocity and in the opposite direction.
When the rider     <U+FB01>xed at 30°, and the wire makes therefore an angle
                         is
of 60° with the axis of rotation so as to describe in its motion thd

      2. “ Report of further Observations made upon the Tidal Streams
  of the English Channel and German Ocean, under the authority
  of the Admiralty, in 184-9 and 1850."     By Captain F. W. Beechey,
  R.N. Communicated by G. B. Airy, Esq., RES. 820., Astronomer
  Royal.     Received March 27, 1851.
      This is the continuation of a report which the author made upon
  the tidal phenomena of the Irish Sea and English Channel in 1848.
  After detailing the manner in which the investigation had been con
  ducted, and the great care which had been bestowed upon the ob
 servations, which are numerous, the author enters into an explana
 tion of the whole system of tidal streams in the English Channel and
 North Sea, as deduced from these observations, and also as to what
 he considers to be the cause of the peculiar movement of the streams
 in these channels.     He supposes, in conformity with Dr. Whewell’s
 theory, a tide-wave to pass along the western shores of Europe, and
 to enter the English Channel and North Sea by opposite routes, and
 to arrive off the Texel and Lynn at the same tidal hour as the, tide
 wave in the English Channel arrives off the Start and Jersey.
 From these points there are thrown off branch or derivative waves,
 whichdi<U+FB01>'er materially both in dimensions and rate of travelling from
 the parent wave.      These waves roll on towards the strait of Dover
                                                                   '
 and there merge into each other and form a combined wave.
     The effect of this wave upon the tidal establishments of the Chan
 nel had long been known ; but its in<U+FB02>uence upon the streams of the
 Channel had never before been considered, nor had any observations
upon them been systematically undertaken.
     In arranging the plan of observation the author considered that,
as the combined wave was common to both the English Channel
and North Sea, the tidal streams of both these channels would be
found to correspond in every important particular, and that the
movement of the streams throughout the strait would be materially
in<U+FB02>uenced, if not wholly governed, by the motion of the combined
wave; that the time of this wave attaining its greatest altitude would
thus afford a standard to which the turn of the streams throughout
the Channel might be advantageously referred ; and that there would
be found in this Channel, as in the Irish Sea, which is equally under
the in<U+FB02>uence of a combined wave, a stream which would turn nearly

                                        69
   simultaneously throughout the strait with the times of high and low
   water on the shore at the point of combination or virtual head of
  the tide.
      Accordingly    the observations were Conducted upon this plan, and
  all the movements of the stream were referred to the time of high
  water at Dover, which had been determined upon as the standard
  from its being situated nearly at the point where the combined wave
  is formed.     It appeared from the intervals which this mode of com
  parison a<U+FB02>'orded, that whilst the water was rising at Dover, the
  stream of the channels on both sides ran towards that place; and on
  the contrary, in the opposite direction whilst the water wasfallz'ng
  there; and that these streams pursued a steady course throughout the
  tide, and extended from a line joining the Texel and Lynn, in the
  North Sea, to a line joining the Start and Jersey in the English
  Channel.     Beyond these limits the streams of the Channel were
 found to encounter those of the of<U+FB01>ng or parent wave, and to occa
 sion the tides in those localities to partake of a rotatory character,
 revolving for the most part with the sun, and having scarcely any
 interval of slack water.                                                 .
     The line of meeting of these streams was found not to be a sta
 tionary line, neither in those parts where the Channel-stream en“
 counters the of<U+FB01>ng stream, nor where the streams meet in the strait
 of Dover, but was found to shift from west to east as the tide rises
 and falls at Dover, beginning at Beachy Head and ending at the
 North Foreland; so that the space occupied by the Channel-stream
always preserves the same dimensions, notwithstanding its limits ex
 tend over a distance of 360 miles.        The strait of Dover was found
 never to have slack water throughout its whole extent at any time,
 as was the case in the other ports of the Channel, from which it dif
 fers in this respect; and the streams in this locality have in conse
quence been designated as those of the “Intermediate tide.”
     As the simultaneous turn of the stream throughout the Channel is
a point of considerable       interest and entirely new, the author takes
considerable pains to point out the methods by which this important
 fact was ascertained, and refers to the observations kept on board
the    light vessels along the coast, and to others made at various   im
portant stations; and whenever any contradictory evidence appears,
the cause of the discrepancy is inquired into and explained.       It was
found, for instance, that in a port of the North Sea, near the node
referred to by Dr. Whewell, there was a retardation of an hour
in the turn of the stream; and, upon an investigation as to the
cause of this delay, it is seen to be owing to the stream running
round the Texel and entering the North Sea at a time when the
Channel-stream had ceased; but as soon as the Channel-stream ac-v
quired suf<U+FB01>cient strength, it speedily drove the Texel stream back
and con<U+FB01>ned it to its proper limits.        In the English Channel also a
similar discrepancy is observable near the coast of France; but_ this
also the author considers to be fully accounted for by causes inci
dental to that part of the Channel, and not to be of suf<U+FB01>cient con

                                   70
sequence   to derogate from the character ascribed to the general
motion of the water throughout the strait. .
   A reference is made to the erroneous opinions which have
hitherto been entertained with respect to the motion of the streams
of our channels; and the author concludes his paper by explaining
his views as to the manner in which the turn of the stream is renq
dered simultaneous     by the rapid rise of the combined wave in th<U+FB01>
centre of the strait, and expresses a hope that he has satisfactorily
shown from the observations, that throughout the English Channel
and North Sea the movement of the stream may safely be referred to
a common standard.      This, it is considered, will be of great import
ance to navigation; as thus the seaman’s progress through these
moving waters will be freed from the numerous and perplexing re
ferences he was before obliged to make, and which too often—and,
it is to be feared, in many instances too fatally—caused the tides to
be wholly disregarded.     All uncertainty as to the effect of the stream
 will henceforward, it is expected,
                                  '
                                      be obviated by a simple reference
to a tide table.
   The paper, which is accompanied by numerous plans and charts,
forms a practical illustration of the tidal streams of straits, under
the in<U+FB02>uence of a combined wave.

    The diffusion of acetate of soda presents a general parallelism to
that of acetate of potash for the times chosen, the temperatures of
the two series bf experiments differing only 07 degree.
    The salts of potash and soda of the same base appear thereIOre
to give approximately equal amounts of di<U+FB01>‘usate, when ditfused for
the two di<U+FB02>’erent times chosen, with the remarkable exception of the
hydrates of these two bases.- The relation is most observable in the
small proportions of salt,vor'weak solutions, such as the l and 2 per
 cent. solutions.        The soda salts; as a general rule, fall 'o<U+FB02>" in diffusi
 bility in the higher proportions as compared with potash salts.

            “  0n   the Animal variation of   the Magnetic Declination, at

    and Treas.‘R.S. 816,      ReceivedApril'<U+FB01>O,   1851.
       In this communication      the-author has arranged and presented
    together     the Annual variations which the magnetic        declination
    undergoes at every hem of the' day at the four Colonial Observatories
    established    by the British government, (at Toronto, Hobarton, the
    Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena.              This has been done by
   means of a graphical representation; in which the annual variations
   at every hour are shown by vertical lines varying in length
                                                                     accord
   ing to the amount of the range of the annual variation at each
   hour; each line having also small cross lines marking the mean
   positions of the several months in the annual range.‘       The mean de
   clination in the year at the respective hours is marked by a hori
   zontal line which crosses all the verticals      at each station;    The
   hours are those      of mean solar time at each station,   the day com
   mencing at noon.        The annual variations represented in the plate
   were obtained at Toronto from three years of observation, viz. 1845,
   46, 4'7 ;   at Hobarton from <U+FB01>ve years, viz. July 2nd, 1848 to July l,
   1848;     at the Cape of Good Hope from <U+FB01>ve years, viz. 'July 9nd,
   1841 to July 1st, 1846; and at St. Helena from three years, viz;
  July 2nd, 1844- to July 1st, 1847.

      The author observes that it is perceived at'the <U+FB01>rst glance at the
  plate, that the range of variational; all the four stations is consider
  ably greater during the hours of the day than during those of the
  night; and that there is a great similarity, though not a perfect
  identity, at all the stations in the relative amount of the- range at
  different hours.       Further, that the amount does not progressively
 enlarge to a maximum at or about noun, when the sun’s altitude is
 greatest; or atr‘the early hours of the afternoon, when the tempera
 ture is greatest; but that 'at all the stations the increase of the range
 is most rapid in the <U+FB01>rst‘or' second
                                          hour after sunrise ; and that its
 extent at the hours from 7 to 9 amnis not exceeded at any subse
    uent hour at Hobarton, the Cape and St. Helena, whilst at Toronto
                                            even earlier, the hours of 6,
 t e great enlargement takes place
 T and}; A.M. being exceeded by none, though they are equalled by a
 second increase at noon and the two following hours.           This second
 enlargement is perceptible at the same haurs at Hobarton and St.
 Helena.                                           "
     With inference to the relative positions of the several months in
each ofthe vertical lines, or at the di<U+FB01>'erent hours, it is observed that
certain months, which are found congregated          at the one extremity
of the range during the early hours of the morning, undergo a
transfer towards the opposite extremity at asubsequ-ent period of the
day; thus the months June, July, August usually occupy one
extremity of the range, and November, December, January the
other extremity, in the morning hours, and until from 8" to 10'
min, when each of the‘tvro groups is respectively transferred
towards the opposite extremity to that which it previmlsly oo
copied.       The period at when this transfer takes place is somewhat

                                    74
earlier at Toronto and St. Helena than at the Cape of Good Hope
and Hobarton.      The comportment of the two equinoctial months,
March and September, at the Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena is
pointed out as presenting a remarkable contrast to that of the two'
solstitial groups which have been described, and at the same time a
still more remarkable contrast to each other, March being at almost
all the hours on the West, and September on the East, of the mean
line.
   In conclusion the author points out one or two practical conside
rations suggested by the facts under notice :—                          _
    1. That as, in the Annual Variation represented in the plate, the.
same months occupy positions on opposite sides of the mean line at
di<U+FB02>'erent parts of the twenty-four hours, the mean annual variation,
or that which is shown by the mean values in each month taken from
all'the observation hours, must be merely a residual and not an abso
lute quantity; and that consequently natural features must be more
orless masked in deductions in which only mean values are brought
into vview.- In fact,as has been shown in the published volumes of
the observations at St. Helena and Hobarton, the mean annual van
riation at those stations is so small as to be scarcely sensible. But
when we resolve these mean results into their respective constituents,
viz. the annual variation at each of the observation hours, there is
then at once disclosed to us an order of natural phenomena, very
far from inconsiderable in amount, systematic in general aspect, aml
apparently well deserving the attention of those who are occupied
in the delightful and highly intellectual pursuit of tracing the agen
cies of nature.               -   ,
    2. We perceive in the variations of the position of the several
monthsin the annual range, the necessity of paying regard to the
period of the year, as well as to the period of the day at which ob-_
servations have been made which do not include long intervals, and
from which, nevertheless, inferences are drawn in respect to secular
change.     Such observations, when not those of a <U+FB01>xed observatory,
are usually made at some hour in the day-time, when it needs only
a glance at the. plate to perceive that annual as well as diurnal
variation-corrections are required, unless the month as well as the
hour are the same in the earlier and later observations.    A table of
corrections for every hour of the day to the mean value in each
month-corrections derived, as in the instances now before the So
ciety, from a series of strictly comparable observations continued for
several years-should be considered, not merely as a desirable, but
as an almost indipensable provision, in countries where magnetic
surveys are conducted with the degree of perfection of which they
are now susceptible.

   Dans les fluctuations que subissent les pressions atmosphériques,
on sait qu'un même minimum se présente en général sur une série
de points qui sont liés par la loi de continuité, et qui forment ainsi,
à la surface du globe, une ligne plus ou moins étendue. Cette ligne
de pression minimum est mobile et se déplace avec des vitesses et des
directions que je me suis principalement proposé d'étudier. On peut,
par analogie avec ce qui se passe sur les mers, nommer onde atmo
sphérique, l'intervalle qui sépare deux lignes de pression minimum ;
et créte de l'onde la ligne de pression maximum.
   Sir John Herschel a été le premier à appeler sérieusement l'at
tention des physiciens sur la nature des ondes atmosphériques ; et il
est parvenu à plusieurs résultats intéressants. M. Birt s'est princi
palement attaché à signaler les propriétés  -   de ce qu'il
                                                        -    nomme la
grande onde de Novembre.
   En mettant à profit toutes les observations régulières que j'ai pu
réunir pour le nord de l'Europe et de l'Asie, j'ai essayé d'embrasser
la solution du problème dans toute sa généralité. On pourra voir,
 dans la mémoire que j'ai eu l'honneur d'offrir à la Société Royale,
les ondes atmosphériques représentées sur une série de cartes figura
tives pour trois mois consécutifs. Ces cartes montrent surtout que
   1. L'atmosphère est généralement traversée par plusieurs sy
stèmes d'ondes différents ; mais, au milieu de tous les mouvements
particuliers,  il se prononce un système d'ondes prédominant qui
semble rester à peu près constant pour un même climat.
   2. Les ondes atmosphériques, tant en Europe qu'en Asie, se pro
pagent du nord au sud, sans avoir toutefois la même vitesse; elles
marchent plus rapidement dans le système Asiatique et dans le sy
stême de l'Europe centrale, qu'en Russie ou dans les montagnes de
l'Oural.
   3. Les ondes atmosphériques semblent se propager avec moins
d'obstacles à la surface des mers qu'à l'intérieur des terres. En gé
néral, les aspérités du globe, et particulièrement les chaînes de mon
tagnes, diminuent leur vitesse et modifient aussi leur intensité,
   4. La vitesse avec laquelle les ondes atmosphériques se propa
gent est très variable; elle peut être estimée moyennement de 6 à
10 lieues de France à l'heure : elle est un peu plus grande dans
l'Europe centrale, et moindre en Russie.
   5. Les directions des vents n'ont pas de rapports apparents avec
les directions des ondes barométriques ; il parait en être de ces ondes
comme des ondes sonores qui se transmettent dans toutes les direc
tions, malgré l'obstacle des vents, lesquels pourraient à la vérité, en
modifiér l'intensité et la vitesse.
    Ces premiers résultats, soumis à de nouveaux examens, et controlés
par des systèmes d'observations plus complets, conduiront certaine
ment à des conclusions très importantes pour la météorologie et

 l'étendue de l’Asie.

     1. “ Researches in Symbolical Physics.      On the Translation of a.
Directed Magnitude as Sylnbolised by a Product.           The Principles
of Statics established symbolically.” By the Rev. M. O'Brien, M.A.,
late Fellow of Caius College, Cambridge, and Professor of Natural
Philosophy and Astronomy in King's College, London. Communi
cated by W. A. Miller, M.D., F.R.S. &c. Received April 10, 1851.
    In this communication the author (starting from the well~known

                                      77
 theorem, that two sides of a triangle are equivalent to the third, when
 direction, as well as magnitude, is taken into account) proposes an
 elementary step in symbolization which consists in representing the
  Translation of a Directed Magnitude by a Product. Any magnitude
 which is drawn or points in a particular direction, such as a force, a
 velocity, a displacement, or any of those geometrical or physical
 quantities which we exhibit on paper by arrows, he calls a directed
 magnitude.      By the translation of such a magnitude he means the
 removal of it from one position in space to another without change
 of direction.
   , U representing any directed     magnitude and u any distance, the
 translation of U to any parallel position in space, in such wise that
 every point or element of U is caused to describe the distance u, is
 termed the translation of U aking n.
     This translation consists generally of two distinct changes, one the
 lateral shifting of the line of direction of U, and the other the motion
 of U along its line of direction. The former is called the trans
verse re<U+FB02>ect, the latter the longitudinal {<U+FB02>eet of the translation of U
alon u.
     Bgth these effects are shown to be products of U and u; the
transverse effect is represented by uU, and the longitudinal by u.U,
inserting a dot between the factors in the latter for the sake of
distinction.
     The author then goes on to apply the principles established to the
proof of the Parallelogram qf Forces, and the determination of the
 effect of any set of forces on a rigid body.     In doing this a remark
able symbolization of the point of application, as well as the direc
tion and magnitude of a force, is obtained, namely, that the expres
sion (1 +u)U represents a. force U acting at a distance u from the
                                                               '
origin.
     The principles of statics are deduced with remarkable facility
from the symbolical representation of the translation of a force along
a given distance.
     2. “ On an Air-Engine."       By James Prescott Joule, F.R.S.    810.
Received May 13, 1851.
                                          -
     The air-engine described in this paper consists of a pump by
which air is compressed into a heated receiver; and a cylinder,
through which the air passes again into the atmosphere.           The ditl
ference between the work evolved by the cylinder and that absorbed
by the pump, constitutes       the work evolved by the engine on the
Whole.     Two tables are given; the <U+FB01>rst of which contains the pres
sure, temperature and work absorbed, for various stages of the
compression of a given volume of air.         The second table gives the
theoretical duty of the air-engine described, worked at various pres
sures and temperatures.         The temperature recommended         to be
adopted in practice is as little below the red heat as possible, which
Would involve the consumption of only about one-third the amount
of fuel consumed by the best steam-engines at present constructed.

  3. “ Eitperiments made at York (Lat. 53° 58’ N.) on the Deviation
of the Plane of Vibration of a Pendulum from the meridional and
other vertical planes.”     By John Phillips,   Esq., F.R.S. Received
June   8, 1851.
   The following is the author’s account of these experiments.
    The experiments, of which the following is a notice, Were made
partly in the north-western Tower of the Minster, and partly in a room
of my residence.      The latter attempts haVe only within a fewde
acquired    suf<U+FB01>cient  method and consistency to deserve reporting;
nor have the trials in the Minster been uniformly successful.
   Mr. Thomas Cooke, an able optician'of York, began the ekperi
ments in the Minster.      On the 30th of April, Mr. Gray and myself
observed the vibration of his pendulum, and found it so accurate as
to justify the belief that it mi ht not only indicate the direction, but
measure the angular value 0 the deviation of the pendulum plane
from the meridian. Computing this value for an hour to be         lf-P,
we watched the result and found the are passed over to be 13°. When
this observation was recorded, the pendulum Was supposed to have
commenced its vibrations on a north and south line; but that was
an error; it was really swung from east to west.           -     -
   In repeating this experiment, I have been more anxious to vary
the conditions, in a few arranged obserVations, than to accumulate
many similar results.     We have observed in four azimuthal planes;
one of our balls Weighed eight pounds, the other twenty pounds:
one was an oblate, the other a prolate- spheroid; suspension was
effected at <U+FB01>rst by thoroughly softened catgut, afterwards by on:
twisted silk: we have compared small and large arcs, counted the
periodical times of vibration in three planes, noted the direction of
motion in the elliptic path of the pendulum, and - estimated the
length of its minor axis.     We have recorded results when no ellip
ticity was remarked, and others in which its injurious effect Was
manifest.                                                             '3
    The pendulum performs one complete vibration in- 8" 2 From
which its length is deduced =52'+ feet. The chord of the arc of
vibration was usually taken at M feet, but was on some trials re:
duced to 7 feet.     The graduated circle was 12 feet' in diameter:
Great care was used in starting the ball, which did not rotate, but
presented the same face to the same quarter of the room, in what-"
ever direction it was swung.      The apartment was subject“‘ air
currents; the <U+FB02>oor'from which the suspension was e<U+FB01>ected though
strong was large; and there was no method of securirrg'exalct'ver<U+FB01>i‘i
                                                                     ‘”
cality in the-iron tube which carried the flexible catgut or silk.
    From one or all of these causes it happened that ellipticity in the
Path was noticed in almost every‘ experiment, and it might existhr
all, and be unobserved     the minor axis did not exceed aneél'onrtlr
                          it“
of an inch. After abandoning several trials in which the minor axis“
was observed to increase rapidly,    itwas thought desirable‘to deter:
mine by experiment the effect of this elliptical swing on the angtllai‘
movement of the pendulum plane (see exp. 5).

     Neglecting the ellipticity in these experiments,                                              the results are—

   For obvious reasons—the force maintaining the pendulum plane
being greatest in the beginning of the sweep (when the versed sine'
of the are     greatest), and the action of the elliptical swing then
                       is
least—the    deviations in the <U+FB01>rst portions of the hour appear likely
to be more correct than the average of the whole hour.
   The suspension was now changed from softened catgut to un
twisted silk. From some disarrangement connected with this change
it happened that ellipticities were generated in every experiment,
and nearly all were abandoned as useless on account of the great
dimensions of the ellipse, which, growing as the arc of vibration
lessened, sometimes acquired       minor axis of aboVe three inches.
                                                                a.
 Whatever the direction of the movement in the ellipse, its e<U+FB02>ect was
to rotate the pendulum plane in the same direction; thus augment

ing the deviation when the motion in the ellipse was to the right,
and diminishing it when it was to the left.      In most azimuths the
elliptical motion was to the left. In the following example its effect
was followed for an hour to the right.

to 20 inches.    The experiments were seldom continued beyond half
an hour.    By that time the chord of vibration was reduced to about

     “
        Having recently met with a photographic process of great sensi
 bility, I was desirous of trying whether it were possible to obtain a
 truly instantaneous representation of an object in motion.       The ex
 periment was conducted in the following manner.          A printed paper
 Was fixed upon a circular disc, which was then made to revolve on
 its axis as rapidly as possible.     When it had attained its greatest
 velocity,   an electric battery, kindly placed at my disposal by Mr.
 Faraday, was discharged in front of the disc, lighting it up with a
 momentary <U+FB02>ash.        A camera containing a very sensitive plate of
 glass had been placed in a suitable position, and on opening this
after the discharge, an image was found of a portion of the words
printed on the paper. They were perfectly well-de<U+FB01>ned and wholly
unaffected by the motion of the disc."

(Second Series), and on the Nature of the Impregnating In<U+FB02>uence.”
By George Newport, Esq., F.R.S.,F.L.S.&c. Received June 19,1851.
     The author commences his paper by stating that, having given
direct proof, in his former paper, that the spermatozoon is the im
pregnating agent, and also that the liquor semim's does not effect
impregnation,     he now proposes to detail some new experiments
which bear on the views he then advanced; and                         with
respect to the nature of the impregnating in<U+FB02>uence
    He <U+FB01>rst-detaila-sonle additional experiments with solution of car
mz'ne, with the object to show, that the resultof one experiment men
tioned in his former paper, in which he detectedasmall granule of
carmine within the vitellary membrane, was attributable to the cause
he then assigned—accidental       injury to the egg; and “he state‘sthat
the results of his present investigations con<U+FB01>rm him in the view then
held,--that no natural perforation or <U+FB01>ssure exists in the envelopes
of the egg, either of the Frog or of the Newt-before, mat the
                                                                  -II

                                   88
time  of impregnation; and that the spermatozoon does not pene
trate into, but only lies in contact with the envelopes.
   He next giVes the results of some experiments with solution of
potass, in con<U+FB01>rmation of his former observations;    and further shows,
the effect produced on the egg by immersion in solutions of potass
and soda, with different proportions of the salts; and afterwards details
the results of'other experiments made to test some of the more re
markable ones by Spallanzani with regard to the effect of very minute
quantities of the impregnating <U+FB02>uid.      In these trials the author has
proceeded      the mode of direct application of the <U+FB02>uid, and not by
immersion byo the eggs in large quantities of water, with small propor
tions of seminal <U+FB02>uid, the mode followed by Spallanzani.       The result
of the direct application through contact, once only with each egg,
with the point of a pin wetted with the <U+FB02>uid, was, that this was
sometimes suf<U+FB01>cient to effect the commencement of segmentation,
and consequent partial impregnation; while, if the <U+FB02>uid was allowed
to drain off the pin, by continuing the contact for a few seconds,
then complete segmentation, and full impregnation followed, and,
other circumstances being favourable, an embryo was produced ; and
when the head of a pin was employed to apply the <U+FB02>uid, then the
usual result was full impregnation; so that these results con<U+FB01>rm
those by Spallanzani. The authorfurther states that it appeared to
be of no consequence as to which surface of the egg was touched,
the dark surface, light surface, or the side,-the result was the
same.
   He next proceeds to show, that when the egg is immersed in pure
seminal <U+FB02>uid as directly opposite result ensues.     Segmentation     then
seldom Occurs, and the embryo is but rarely produced; and further,
that the effect then produced on the egg is very similar in appear
ance to that of the chemical action' of solution of caustic potass; the
yelk becomes shiivelled and decays.        These results‘he thinks are
not explained by the views at present entertained respecting the
nature of impregnation. The author then refers to the observations
made by himself, and also by M. Quatrefages, which tend to show
that no impregnation is effected, even by the contact of the sperma
tozoon with the egg, when all motion in the spermatozoon has entirely
ceased; and he conceives that this fact, when considered with'the
results now obtained, leads to a new view of the subject.                ‘
                                                                           ,
    Reference is then made to the views of Faraday, Mr. Grove, Mat-l
teucci, and others, respectingfthe correlations of the physical forces'
and the author mentions that the relations of the vital to the physical
forces were referred to by himself in 1845, and also in the same year
by M. Mayer, and that his object now isitd apply these viewsto the
 investigation of the function of impregnation.      He. thinlts that im-v
pregnation is commenceddf not entirely completed, by what may
possibly prove to be a new condition ot'fi‘orce, in, and peculiar to‘,
the impregnating agent, the spermatozoon, which he designates
Wmfm'ee, and distinguishes from the Iforce‘oi' growth and develop-I
ment in cells, through which the spermatozoon is produced.‘ He
further distinguishes it from the force Of'mWCleaT                      and
                                                        conlrgclilily,‘
                                                                *

                                       84‘
 from that of the nervous system, and states that he regards the whole
 only as modi<U+FB01>cations of one common force, and as having correla
 tions with the physical forces.       In support of this view the author
 enters into details, and refers to some late analyses by Dr. Frerichs,
 to show that the spermatozoa, like muscle and nerve, not only have
 a de<U+FB01>nite   structure,   but   also a de<U+FB01>nite  chemical  composition, and
 that this composition appears to be the same in different classes of
 animals.     He thinks that the spermatozoa may thence be regarded
 as organs of a special modi<U+FB01>cation of force, and that motion is the
 visible exponent of this form of force, since the spermatozoa are
 quite inef<U+FB01>cient to impregnate when their motion has entirely ceased.
 The author further thinks that it is only by the adoption of views of
 this kind that the apparently contradictory results obtained are likely
 to be explained.
     In the course of his observations the author states a remarkable
 fact, which he has repeatedly veri<U+FB01>ed, and which he thinks is of im
 portance, namely, that the <U+FB01>rst cleavage or division of the yelk, in
 the egg of the Frog and Toad, corresponds in its line ofdirection to the
 longitudinal axis of the body of the embryo of those animals; and this
 he proposes to show more particularly hereafter.
     6. “ The Human      Iris; its Structure and Physiology." By Bernard
 E. Brodhurst, M.E.CS.             Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq.,
 Sec.R.S. &c. Received May 22, 1851.
     The author commences by stating that the iris is an active <U+FB01>bro
 cellular tissue, or that it may be considered to be a transition tissue
 from the ordinary <U+FB01>bro-cellular to the organic muscular: that it is a
 tissue differing from every other in the body; being possessed of
 a motor power exceeding that of any other tissue, yet differing in
 construction and appearance of <U+FB01>bre from those other tissues, the
types of motion.                                                     _ .
                                                                         7
     He remarks that the microscope shows that the <U+FB01>bres of the iris
 difi'er essentially from muscular <U+FB01>bre, whether striped, or of organic
life: they are pale, easily separable and readily torn; , but they
 resemble in no essential particular muscular <U+FB01>bre ; indeed, the
 effect of galvanism on the iris is totally'opposed to that produced
 on muscular <U+FB01>bre.
     He observes that the nerves that pass to the iris are derived from
both motor, sensitive and vegetative nerves ; but voluntary motion is
not supplied, neither sensation.        The motions of the iris are wholly
independent of the powers usually deemed motor; they are in<U+FB02>u
enced primarily by the sympathetic system of nerves, through which
motion is accorded without sensation, motion without design.              _
    In death, the author observes, the iris assumes a median state, the
pupil being neither dilated nor contracted. In health, it is contracted.
During sleepit is contracted. During the presence of disease, thepupil
is dilated,and so much dilated beyond its usual state, as the tonicity of
thevegetative system is removed,as the presenceof disease operateson
the nutritive system to diminish not only the power of nutrition, but,
in a like degree, tension of the visceral system; nutrition and tension

                                         85
   being as cause and effect    of the healthy operation  of this basic system
   of the animal (economy. And as it is not essential to the motions of
   the iris, either to their performance or that they be understood, that
                                                                               '
   they partake of any of those peculiarities,       the distinguishing fea-
   tures of muscular tissue, and as we <U+FB01>nd that this membrane is
   obedient to those laws which are applicable to each organ under
  immediate     sympathetic   in<U+FB02>uence,   and opposed   to those phenomena
  which result from spinal and cerebral in<U+FB02>uence, it may be asserted
  that the contractility of the iris is, prime loco, the motor power of
  the sympathetic.       For the iris is an irritable membrane with power
  alone of involuntary motion and tension, its active condition agreeing
  in these respects with vegetative life in general.          And as animal
  death may be said to ensue when deep sleep takes possession of the
 senses, when those systems under spinal and cerebral in<U+FB02>uence are
 rendered inactive, to be <U+FB01>tted for renewed exertion on waking, it
  follows, that those organs which still remain active cannot be go
 verned on the same principle, but must necessarily be subject to the
 sole remaining power, through which is accorded involuntary mo
 tion, motion which never tires, and tension its active condition.
      The <U+FB01>mbriated edge of the ciliary body <U+FB02>oats loosely in the poste
 rior chamber around the lens, to produce, through the to and fro
  motion of each process (their aggregate number representing a
 circle), a current forwards or towards the iris. The force of this
 current is in a ratio to the pupillary opening, being increased as this
 is contracted, to produce, in proportion to its contraction, convexity
 of the iris. On the escape of the aqueous humour from the cham
bers, these processes fall down to form a serrated border upon the lens.

         “ On the Automatic Temperature-compensation of the Force
 Magnetometers.” By C. Brooke, M.B., F.R.S. Received May8, 1851.
      After explaining the necessity of automatic temperature-compen
sation in these instruments in order to give the highest degree of
accuracy to results deduced from the ordinates of the magnetic
curves, the author infers from a reference to the formula expressing
the conditions of equilibrium of the bi<U+FB01>lar magnet, that the interval
between the lower extremity of the suspension lines will be most
advantageously submitted to some mechanical agency governed by
change     of temperature.
     The object in    view has been attained by attaching the lower ends
of the suspension skein to the adjacent ends of two zinc tubes that
are clamped to a glass rod which is attached at its middle point to
the middle of the bar-magnet.            When the temperature rises, the
ends of the skein will evidently be approximated to each other by a.
quantity that is equal to the difference of expansion of the lengths
of zinc and glass intervening between the clamps. The interval
between the clamps is to be approximately determined by calcula
tion, and corrected by experiment, so that the ratio of the expansion
to the distance between the threads may be equal to the <U+FB01>rst term
of the temperature       coef<U+FB01>cient.
     In the balanced      magnetometer     the compensation    is effected  by

                                        86
  means of    a. small thermometer attached to the magnet, the stem of
  which is parallel to the axis of the bar. In this thermometer, the
  size of the bulb, its distance from the freezing-point and length of
'
  the scale, ma be so proportioned to each other, that the second as
  well as the rst term of the temperature coef<U+FB01>cient will be repre
  sented in the correction.
      8.“ On the Reproduction of the Ascaris Mystax." By Henry
  Nelson, M.D. Communicated by Allen Thomson, M.D., F.R.S.
  Received May 22, 1851.
      The author commences with a brief anatomical description of the
  Ascaris Mystam, found in the intestinal canal of the Domestic Cat;
  with more especial reference to the organs of generation in the two
  sexes.     He traces the gradual formation of the semen; originally
  thrown off as seminal particles by the caecal extremity of the tubular
  testicle, the exterior of each solid particle enlarges to constitute a
   cell, while the interior retains its consistency and forms a nucleus.
   The cell then acquires, a granular protecting envelope, and in this
   state is introduced into the female.        The solution of the protective
   envelope and the great enlargement of the seminal cell follow, and
   its nucleus is now seen to present a granular structure.        The exter
   nal granules of the nucleus coalesce to form a membrane, at <U+FB01>rst
   exactly resembling a watch-glass in shape, but by the contraction of
   its margin ultimately forming a curved cascal tube.            This is the
   true spermatic particle or spermatozoon, and is set free by the
   rupture of the seminal cell.
       The generative apparatus of the female, commencing also in casual
    extremities, is next treated of, and the author draws particular atten
   tion to a transparent, narrow contractile portion, the oviduct, inter
    vening between the ovary and uterus, as the part in which the ovule
    encounters the spermatic particles, and is by them feeundated.
    The caecal end of the ovary likewise throws off a solidpartinlc,
    which enlarging forms a germinal vesicle and spot.            As the ger
    minal vesicle travels slowly down the tubular ovary, it acquires a
    thick granular investment or yolk, secreted by the ovarian walls.
    The ovules now present a <U+FB02>attened triangular shape, are placed side
    by side, and form one solid mass. At the commencement of the
    oviduct however they become detached, separated from each other,
    and propelled singly along its interior. 'Here the gelatinous ovule
    meets the tubular spermatic pnrticles, and is surrounded on all sides
    by them.      They are at <U+FB01>rst seen to be merely applied against the
    ovule, but by degrees the margin of the latter presents a rupture,
    some of the vitelline granules are displaced, and the spermatic par
    ticles become imbedded in the substance of the yolk itself.
        While the penetration of the spermatio particles is going on, a
    chorion, secreted by the oviduct, surrounds the ovule, forming a
    spherical envelope, within which the germinal vesicle, the granular
    yolk, and the imbedded spermatozoa, are enclomd. The spermatic
    particles after penetration   are seen to swell, become transparent, and
    ultimately   to, dissolve.  T be vitelline  granules likewise either disap

                                       87
    pear altogether, or are transformed into others of a different colour;
    and, lastly, the germinal vesicle is destroyed,
        By tracing the changes of the ovule in unfecundated females of
    the same species, the author <U+FB01>nds the disappearance of the vitelline
    granules to be dependent upon, while the formation of the chorion'
    is wholly independent of, the in<U+FB02>uence exerted by the spermatic'
                                                                        '     '
    particles on the ovule.                                  .
        As soon as the vitelline granules and germinal vesicle have v(lis
    appeared, the whole interior of the chorion is <U+FB01>lled with a clear <U+FB02>uid,_
    in which a few granules and the germinal spot are seen to remain.
    By swelling up this constitutes the embryonic vesicle and spot, A‘
    membrane separates from the interior of the chorion, and contracting
    on the granules forms a spherical yolk, in the centre of which is the
    embryonic vesicle.    This is the perfect ovum.    The subsequent di
    visions of the embryonic spot, vesicle and yolk are described; the
    author particularly pointing out the gyrations of the embryonic ve
    sicle immediately after division.    As soon as the whole interior of
    the egg has been <U+FB01>lled by the subdivisions of the yolk, the external
    granules coalesce and form a continuous membrane internal to the
    chorion, which by gradual depression on one Of its sides forms <U+FB01>rst
    a <U+FB02>eshy cup,.and then, as the membrane of its concavity touches that
    of its convex surface, acquires the form of a ring. The ring divides
    at some point of its circumference, the extremities become pointed,
    and thus the young Ascaris receives its characteristic shape.       The
    author has frequently repeated his observations with a view to their
    veri<U+FB01>cation, and has employed the camera lucida to render the illus
    trative <U+FB01>gures as accurate as possible.                           ,     .
       9. “ On Induced and other Magnetic Forces.”' By Sir W. Snow
    Harris, F.R_.S. &c. Received April 29, 1851.
       The question as to identity in the source of those several and
   mysterious powers of nature by which masses or particles are moved
   either toward, or from each other, being a question of deep physical
   interest, the author .of this paper has been led to some further in
  vmtigation of the nature and laws of magnetic force, in the course
  of which several new facts have presented themselves which he
  thinks notaltogeth‘er unworthy of attention.
      Magnetic attraction as commonly observed being found to depend
  on certain impressions made on the attracting bodies usually deé
  ligaated by the general term induction, it appears essential to the
  progress of any inquiry into the laws of those forces operating ex
 ternally to a magnet through space, #0 commence with a rigid 9X21.
 mination of the natureaml mode of action of those inductive forces
 upon which the reciprocal fofce of attraction between the bodies
 immediately depends. These {Oprzes of induction may be considered
 as a series of successive or revern‘erating     in<U+FB02>uences, operating be—
tween the near and opposed surfaces of themagnetic bodies. When,
for example. a magnet is opposed to a mass of soft no“. a direct
impression is <U+FB01>rst made on the iron by which the iron 1s rendeer
temporarily magnetic; this induced force PP<U+FB01>Eai<U+FB01>s .1." AB .tum by a

                                       88
species of reverberation or rc<U+FB02>exion upon the near pole of the mag
net, and calls into play a portion of the magnetic force in the direc
tion of the iron, which was previously operating toward the centre
of the magnet; this action being once set up, may continue for a
series of waves reverberating between the opposed surfaces, until.
the action sinks away as it were into rest.          The author examines
experimentally,    by means    of instruments,  the principles of which he
has already detailed in the Transactions of the Royal Society, this
peculiar kind of action, and arrives at the following deductions re
lative to the laws of magnetic induction.
   A limit exists in respect of induced magnetic force, different for
di<U+FB02>'erent'magnets,      and varying with the magnetic conditions of the
experiment,    toward    which the. increments in the force continually
approach,   as  if the   opposed bodies were only susceptible of a given
amount of induction under the existing circumstances.
    Taking the force toward the limit of action, the amount of induc
tion is in some inverse ratio greater than that of the simple distance ;
it was not however in any case found to exceed the inverse sesqui
plieate ratio or % power of the distance ; as the distance is diminished!
the induction is as the distance inversely, but may in the mean time
be as the g or % powers of the distances inversely, or near those
powers.    On further diminishing the distance, the induction was
found in certain cases to be as the % and % powers of the distances,
thus causing a series of changes in the law of magnetic attraction as
commonly observed, which have hitherto greatly embarrassed the
views of philosophers in their inquiries into this species of force.
When the convergence is slow the induced force may not for a longv
series of terms appear to change, but when from any circumstance
the convergence        is accelerated, then the changes become more
marked and successive.          As a general result, however, the author
is led to conclude, that magnetic induction is as the magnetic in
tensity directly, and from the s to the 3} power of the distance
inversely.
    In the course of these inquiries, it was found that the induc
tive action depended, not on the mass, but on the surface of the
magnetic substance, and that magnetism, like electricity, exhibits a
decrease of intensity when the surface of the iron upon which it is
disposed is extended.       A hollow cylinder of soft iron was carefully
prepared in a lathe, and <U+FB01>tted with a solid interior core capable of
being drawn out from within the cylinder; this compound body was
exposed to the inductive action of apowerfnl magnetic bar, and the
induced force estimated by the reciprocal force of attraction ex
erted between the mass and a cylinder of soft iron suspended from
the author‘s magnetic balance, or from one arm of a light beam, set
up in the way of a common balance.             The degree of force being
observed, the solid core was drawn out so as to extend the surface
of the mass under induction. The intensity immediately declined,
and again increased on replacing the solid within the hollow cylin
der, being a result of exactly the same character as that produced
by the extension of an electri<U+FB01>ed surface.        When the interior solid

                                     89
 core was removed altogether, then the induced force remained un
 changed, it being precisely the same whether the body were taken
hollow or solid. In accordance with this result, hollow cylindri
cal magnets were found as susceptible of magnetic power as solid
masses of the same temperament and dimensions; an unmagnetized
solid and tempered steel cylinder, placed within a hollow tempered
steel cylinder, does not become magnetic on touching the external
cylinder in the usual way.       The magnetism, however, of a hollow
cylindrical magnet is partially destroyed by placing within it a cy
linder of soft iron, or the reverse poles of another magnet; nor can a
hollow cylinder of tempered steel having a solid core of soft iron
be rendered magnetic by the usual methods of touch.            These re
sults, it is considered, supply the experiments thought by Mr. Barlow
so desirable to con<U+FB01>rm his deductions      relative to the action of iron
shells and balls on the compass needle, which he found to be as the
33-power of the surface, whatever the weight and thickness of the
iron.
   The author now proceeds to notice the investigations of Hawks
bee, Brook Taylor, Muschenbroek and others, and thinks the inqui
ries of these philosophers have not been suf<U+FB01>ciently considered or
appreciated; that instead of the results exhibiting anomalies and
discrepancies, they are really necessary consequences of the more
 elementary laws of induction, and perfectly explicable upon the fun
damental principles of magnetism.       He endeavours to show, that by
the changes in the law of the induction, as already stated, laws of
force will arise perfectly coincident with the results arrived at by
Hawksbee, Brook Taylor and others; that          isto say, the law of force
may appear to be as the    %  power of the distance inversely, as found
by Brook Taylor; or as the      %  power inversely, as found by Martin;
or in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distance, as observed by
Lambert  ;   or as the simple distance inversely, as determined by Mus
chenbroek in several cases; or      it may be as the cubes of the di
stances inversely, as stated by Newton.          Examples are given in
which these several laws were found to obtain.
   In examining the laws of magnetic repulsion, similar results are
arrived at.    The inductive forces here, however, are subversive of
the existing polar arrangements; hence the apparent repulsion: so
long as the existing magnetic polarities remain unchanged, the law
of force will be generally as the second power of the distance in
versely; when the distances are small,      it  will be inversely as the
simple distance; when the inductive actions subvert the existing
polarities, then the law of force appears irregular and subject to no
regular variation, as observed in all. the early experiments    '
                                                                   with re
pellent poles.
   The author   is  led to conclude, that the apparent law of attractive
force will be found to depend in certain cases on the distances at
which the force operates, as referred to the total distance or limit of
action.    Taken between §~ths and §ths of the limit of action, the
force may be inversely as the third powers or cubes of the distances;
taken between %ths and %ths of the limit of action,     it   may be in the

                                       90
inverse sesquiduplioate ratio, or      .-<U+FB01>-  power of the distances; between
%rd   and  Ag-ths  as the  squares   of   the distances inversely.       From the
%th   to   % of   the  limit  of action it    may   be  as   thei—  pcwcr   of the
distance inversely; within less than lth,         it    will be generally as the
simple distance inversely.
    On further review of these laWs of magnetism,
       a                                                        it    evident that
                                                                     is
the immediate effect of an increase or decrease of distance,              is an in.
crease or decrease of the etl'ective magnetism on which the total or
reciprocal force depends, Thus taking the cases just quoted,                   will
                                                                               it
be seen that the total force     is    always as the square of the induction,
whatever he the resulting law of the attraction. Hence the force
may as well be taken as the square of the quantity of eifnctive
magnetism directly, as some power of the distance inversely.
    The author admits the dif<U+FB01>culty in the way of the employment of
such terms as quantity of magnetism, magnetic charge, and the like,
and therefore only employs them according to the common acceptor
tion of such terms, and not as referring to any particular hypothesi<U+FB02>:
he thinks there must necessarily be in such inquiries an element fairly
 enough expressed by the general term quantity as expressive ofthB 1e
lutlvs or absolute magnitude of the cause,wl1atevcrit be, upon which
the observed effects depend, and thinks         it     so far essential to obtain
 enact quantitative measures,            In electricity we may estimate the
 charge, conveyed into battery
                          a            by   means of the unit measure, and we
 can at pleasure operate with one-half, one-third, the the quantity of
 electricity numerically expressed; but We have as yet no such men,
 suro in  magnetism, and we are quite uncertain as to the quantity of
 otteetlve magnetism     in    operation,     The author hence endeavours to
verily the law of magnetic charge just mentioned by                  adirect qusnr
titetlve experimental process.           A cylindrical rod of soft iron being
surrounded by three successive coils of covered copper wire, was
placed under the trial cylinder of the magnetometer and exposed to
the operation of one or more precisely equal and similar batteries;
 one coil being appropriated          to each battery.     It   is inferred that    if
 one battery and one coil produced one measure of magnetism, two
 batteries and two coils would develops two measures, and so on; so
 that we Should have only to determine the attractive force under
 this condition; now the attractive forces were found to be as the
square of the number of batteries in action upon this cylinder, that
is  to say, as the square of the magnetism induced in the iron; hence
the quantity of magnetism         is    as the square roots of the reciprocal
 {orcss-   If   therefore    the reciprocal    force between    a   magnet    Aand
a  cylinder of soft iron taken at constant distance were represented
                                       a
by an equivalent of grains, whilst the similar t'orce with magnet
                        4                                                 a
B   at the same distance were represented by           9   grains, then the effect
ive_quant_itics of magnetism and operation in each case would be as
M4: 4/9,thatisas2:3.
   Availing himself of this law, the author endeavours to deduce ex
perimentally the magnetic development in di<U+FB01>'erent points of a regu
larly tempered and magnetized bar, taken between the magnetic
centre and extremities; and he <U+FB01>nds by very careful manipulation,
                                                a

                                              91
that the magnetism   in these points is directly as the distance from
the   magnetic centre; the reciprocal force on a. small trial cylinder
being as the squares of the distances from the centre.
   Some striking analogies in the state of a magnetized steel bar and
the common      Leyden jar are noticed in this communication, from
which it would appear that the conditions of electrical and magnetic
force are precisely the same. and from which the author concludes
that magnetic attraction is reducible, as in electricity, to an action
between opposed surfaces; he thinks that a predisposition to identify
these forces with that of gravity and other central forces has led
many profound mathematicians and philosophers to question unduly
the accuracy of every result not in accordance with such a deduction.
He observes that Sir Isaac Newton considered “that the virtue of the
magnet is contracted to the interposition of an iron plate, and is almost
terminated by          it,
                   for bodies further o<U+FB02>' are not attracted by the magnet
so much as by the iron plate*;" as also that this power         essentially  is
different from gravity, “and in receding From the magnet decreases
not in the duplicate, but almost in the triplicate proportion of the
distance",”     result which has been shown to be perfectly consistent
                   a
with experiments.      Newton however has been supposed to have had
“very inaccurate ideas of magnetic phenomena’r               would be very
                                                                     ;"it
dif<U+FB01>cult however to show from the little which this great author has
advanced upon this subject in his grand work, the Principia,                                 in
what his views of magnetic action were defective; they appear on
the contrary to be in most perfect accordance with experimental
facts.    In associating magnetic action with          law of the “centri
                                                                a
fuged forces of particles terminating        particles next them,” Newton
                                                   in
never pretended to offer any theory of magnetism, but says with
his usual dif<U+FB01>dence, “whether elastic <U+FB02>uids do really consist of par.
tioles so repelling each other         physical question,” and “ which he
                                         is   a

amount, of experimental research by Hawksbee, Brook Taylor,
Whiston, Muschenbroek, and other eminent men, has been sup
posed by Dr. Robison as unworthy of con<U+FB01>dence, and ill adapted to

phenomena for declaring the precise law of variation,”           Yet was                     it
 by  these same attractions and rcpulsions that Lambert, and more
especially Coulomb, deduced what this accomplished             author con,
slders as being the true law of      force.   The author of this commu.
nication     led to believe, that all the results of these inquiries, in!
              is
 eluding the deduction of Newton, are not only consistent with, but
 necessary consequences of, the law of induced magnetic forces, as
 he has endeavoured to prove, and that the action of magnetism as
 commonly     observed            is
                              something   different from What has been
 usually imagined.     That 'future inquiries may lead to the identity

 source of gravity, and other central forces; and it is not impossible
 but that the relations of this medium to the particles of common
 matter may admit of considerable modi<U+FB01>cation or change, and which
 may be the source of that peculiar power we <U+FB01>nd displayed in those
 bodies we consider as being magnetic and call magnets.    It has been
 occasionally supposed that in the reciprocal force between magnets
and iron there is a peculiar agency in operation, the law of which is
disturbed by the new forces of induction liable to ensue in changing
the distances.   The author however is of opinion that such a notion
is inconsistent with the course of nature; it is induction which con
stitutes magnetic action, there is no other form of action; when in
duction is not present there is in fact no action; we must hence
look to these very changes for an explanation of variable magnetic
force.
   10. “ Researches    into the Identity of the Existences or Forces,
Light, Heat, Electricity   and Magnetism." By John Goodman, M.D.
Communicated by       Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S. &c.      Received
March 7, 1851.
  In this communication the author describes         the effects that were
  produced    on  a moderately  sensitive  galvanometer    by exposure to
  the sun’s rays, and which were observed by him during a period of
  four months, commencing on the 14th of November, 1850.              The
  instrument is described as consisting of forty-six turns of covered
  copper wire, 213th of an inch in diameter. The helix is blackened with
  ink at its southern extremity, and has a single magnetized sewing
 needle suspended by about sixteen inches of silken <U+FB01>bre in its centre.
 The dial, which is of card-board, and divided into the usual number
 of degrees, rests upon the upper surface of the helix, and shades it
 from the ordinary light or sun’s rays, except at its extremities, and
 occasionally some portions of the lower bundle of wires; and when
 the sun is very low the rays may be seen also to illumine to some
 extent the surface of the upper bundle. The indicator is formed of
 a slender <U+FB01>lament of light wood in the usual manner, and the whole
 is enclosed in a glass shade.       This instrument was placed for ex
 periment in a window having a southern aspect; and whilst the sun
was strongly shining upon    it,   itwas frequently observed that there
 could not be obtained, either on account of vibrations or the erro
neous condition of the instrument, any true indications. On shading
 the instrument from the sun’s rays by      screen, the vibrations ceased,
                                             a
and the needle again adjusted itself north and south.
    On removing the screen the needle began again to vibrate, and
was soon discovered to become stationary at some distance from
zero, indicating the transmission of     a current in the helix. This de
<U+FB02>ection of the needle was soon found to be always, under the same
circumstances, in the same direction, and to give indications of       a
current corresponding to the brightness of the sun.
    This action appeared to depend upon the incidence of the sun's
rays upon the south extremity, and some of the lower or upper
bundle of wires only of the helix; for when they began to illumine

                                   93
the opposite extremity, either very slight indications, or a neutral
result, constant vibrations, or the movement of the needle some de
grees in the opposite direction, were always observed.         The maxi
mum de<U+FB02>ection, at any time attainable by the galvanometer, when
the sun was quite unclouded, was about 12°, generally only 10°. It
may be observed that in all these experiments the power of the rays
was probably somewhat diminished, by passing though the glass pane
of the window, and through the glass shade of the instrument itself.
   In order to show that the effect was not thermo-electric action,
the extremities of 'the helix were removed from their mercury cups
and wrapped in paper, so as to exclude the mercurialized portion of
the copper from the action of the sun’s rays; but no alteration oc
curred in the ordinary results of the experiments.        There is, more
over, the author considers, no evidence on record of any thermo
electric action ensuing from the application of heat to copper wire
alone, nor without the formation of          acomplete electrical circuit.
But in these experiments hitherto the completion of the circuit
had not been attempted.        During the course of the experiments
the circuit was established by means of         connecting wire between
                                                 a
the mercury cups, and the circuit was again and again completed,
and as frequently broken, without any deviation occurring in any
of the results, either during the progression, stationary condition, or
decline of the needle.
   That these phenomena were the result of the action of the sun's
rays upon the helix itself, was further shown, from the circumstance
that when the sun remained clouded for days together, there was no
de<U+FB02>ection of the needle; that when the helix was partly shaded by a
pillar, or the window-frame, the instrument indicated an amountof cur
rent corresponding to the number of coils of wire illumined; and that
the illumination of the whole bundle    ofwires at the southern extremity
of the helix was necessary to produce the usual results, for when a
burning lens of higif power was employed to condense the rays and
throw them in    a  focus upon one or two wires only, no de<U+FB02>ection of
the needle was observed.      It was also further shown that the action
of the rays upon the helix was attributable to that portion situate
chie<U+FB02>y at the southern extremity, for the whole instrument was in         a
variety of ways and at different periods shaded from the solar rays;
but its results were unaffected, unless the south end was obscured,
when the needle immediately declined; or the north end was illu
mined when the de<U+FB02>ections were lessened, or the motion of the
needle took place    in the opposite direction.
   A pile of red-hot burning embers held in the vicinity of one ex
tremity of the helix caused   a   slight de<U+FB02>ection of %°, and when held
at the opposite extremity, caused       a de<U+FB02>ection in the opposite di
rection.
  The author states remarkable circumstance, viz. that vibrations
                      a
and neutral action were observed during bright sunshine about the
11th of December, and again on the 23rd of January; that previous
to the former period the de<U+FB02>ections of the needle were to the left
hand; between these two periods they were to the right-hand and       ;

                                     94
after the latter period always to the left, after a. given hour of day
During the early sun, however, they were to the right-hand, and as
the sun approached a given altitude, they were invariably to the
left-hand.    De<U+FB02>ections observed during the summer season were
also to the left-hand ; but those of the early sun were not submitted
to the test.
    On testing the instrument with a voltaic pair, it was shown that
the current passed from south to north above the needle with the early
sun, or when the indicator de<U+FB02>ected to the right-hand, and beneath
the needle with the rays which proceeded from a considerable elevad
                                                                                          ‘
tion, or when the needle de<U+FB02>ected to the left-hand.
    In conclusion, the author states that the results of these experi
ments evince to his mind more than ever the unity qffoa-ce; and
that experimental     evidence appears to justify the conclusion at
which he has longsince arrived, that there is om, only, universal force
in nature, which is modg‘<U+FB01>ed by the accidental and varied conditions
to which it zs subjected, but that its essential nature and characterin
are at all times unchangeably the same.                                               -1

    From this table it appears that the coldest month in the year has
occurred in January 22 times; in February 10 times; in March once;
                                                  '
and in December 8 times.
    The hottest month in the year has occurred in June 5 times; in
July 26 times; in August 12 times; and in September once.
    The coldest month in the whole period occurred in January 1814‘,
the mean temperature being 26°‘8.
    The hottest month during the whole period occurred in July 1847,
the mean temperature being 68°‘8.
    The means of all the differences between the hottest and coldest
month in every year is 2702 : the least di<U+FB01>'erence occurred in 1828,
viz. 21°13; the greatest difference in 1814, viz. 85°'0.
    3. The excess of the monthly mean temperature in every year,
above the temperature of the month from all the years.
    The means of the numbers in each column of this table, taken
without regard to sign, gives the variability of the temperature in
spring 2°‘1 ; in summer 1°“7; in autumn 20'0; in winter 300.
    The greatest difference in the monthly means in spring is 11°"9;
in summer 12°25; in autumn 13°‘9; in winter 18°‘8.
    The coldest year in this series was 18%, when the mean annual
temperature was only 45°‘O: the hottest year was 1846, the mean
annual temperature being 51°'4.

10 years, and for the whole year.
    5. The mean temperature in quarterly periods in successive groups
of 10 years.
    From this it is stated that the mean temperature of the 1st quarter
is 390'5 ; of the 2nd, 580‘8; of the 3rd, 59°15; of the 4th, 44:00.
    6. The mean temperature in spring, summer, autumn and winter,
in successive groups of 10 years._

   12. “ On Depressions of the Wet-bulb Thermometer during the
Hot Season at Ahmednuggur, in the Deccan." By Colonel Sykes,
F.R.S. &c. Received June 17,1851.
   The author states that he is indebted to Major William Coghlan
for the tables of hourly depressions of the wet-bulb thermometer
during the months of March and April of the present year, which
form the subject of this communication, and which are a necessary
supplement    to his paper recently published in the Philosophical
 Transactions. The observations       at Ahmednuggur, lat. 19° 05'
 49” N., long. 74° 48’ 10”, elevation above the sea 1911 feet, which
 were undertaken by Dr. Forbes Watson, commenced on the 18th
of March, and were continued to the 14th of April inclusive.
They were made hourly from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M., giving 16 hourly re
cords daily; but on the 24th and 29th of March, and on the 4th,
8th and 10th of April, they were continued throughout the twenty
four hours.    The instruments employed were a dry- and a wet-bulb
thermometer, by Adie, perfectly alike and giving precisely the same
indications when both were dry, and a self-registering thermometer.
They were suspended on a platform attached to a window under the
verandah of the house, with a N.W. exposure, and were protected
from radiation and re<U+FB02>exion of heat from the ground. As, from
some preliminary observations, it appeared that the depression of the
wet-bulb varied in every case with the intensity and duration of the
draught of air upon    it,in each observation ‘a slight current of air
was produced by   a  fan near the mouth of  afunnel, the small end of
which abutted on the wet-bulb, and the operation was continued
until no further depression of the thermometer could thus be pro
duced;    astronger current of air was then forced on the bulb by
means of a large double bellows; and the result of each operation
was recorded.                                                    .   .L.
   To obviate the anomalies which might arise from single observa~
tions, and to <U+FB01>x  a  mean state, for each hour, of the temperature of
the air, the temperature of evaporation, and the mean depression of
the wet-bulb, the means of these elements have been taken and are
presented in  a table.  In this table are also given the dew-points as
determined by means of Mr. Glaisher's factors and by Dr. Apjohn’s

                                                  97
        formula, with the differences by the two methods.        The author re
        marks that the <U+FB01>rst feature which presents itself, in running the eye
        over this table,    the enormous amount of the depression of the wet
                              is
        bulb compared with our European experience.        In March, the mean
        depression at no hour was less than l4~°~8 at       A.M., increasing to
                                                                   7
        29°“6 at    rum; in April, the mean depression was never less than
                    7 8
        17°‘3 at   A-M., increasing to 290'9 at P-M.; and many observations
                                                       3
       necessarily much exceeded the maxima means. The next feature                        is
       the increase of the mean depression with that of the mean tempera
       ture, from     A.M. until P.M., and then
                          6            3            decline with the decline of
                                                           a
       temperature until       P.M.; but not in the same ratio as the increase
                                   9
       in the morning. With reference to the practical application of these
       observations with view to determine the amount of moisture in the
                                 a
       atmosphere, or to <U+FB01>x the dew-point, the author remarks that           will   it
       be seen from this table that Mr. Glaisher's factors give      higher dew
                                                                          a
       point than Dr.Apjohn’s formula, varying in March from 601 at A.M.           9 8
       to ll°'9 at    P.M., and in April from 5°-6 at
                      6                                 A.M. to 10°'4~ at
                                                               7            P.M.;
       and these varying discrepancies do not appear to have gradations of
       increment or decrement dependent upon increase or diminution of
       mean temperature, or increase or decrease of the depression of the
       wet-bulb.     These remarks apply to the means of the observations;
       but   with    reference     to isolated observations,   the discrepancies    by the
       two methods become much greater.          On the 9th of April, at P.M.,     8
       the temperature of the air being 97°, the wet-bulb with        moderatea
       draught 60°'5, and with     strong draught 60°, the depressions were
                                           a
       respectively 36°‘5 and 37°, and the dew-point for the latter depres
       sion determined by Mr. Glaisher’s factors would be 41-5, and 12'6
       by Dr. Apjohn’s formula.     1n illustration of this part of the subject
       the author gives an extract of        letter from General Cullen, from
                                                 a
       which   itappears that at Cochin on the Malabar coast, the tempera
       ture of the air being 96°, the wet-bulb 61°, the dew-point by Jones’s
       hygrometer 88°, the dew-point by Mr. Glaisher’s factors would be
       43°'5, and by Dr. Apjohn’s formula 220-1.

                          a                                              By
   J.    J. Waterston,  Esq. Communicated by Lieut.Colonel Sabine, R.A.,
       VP. and Treas. R.S. &c. Received June 19,1851.
          The author of this paper commences by stating that the relation
       between the pressure and temperature of vapours in contact with
       their generating liquids has been expressed by a variety of empirical
       formula-z, which, although convenient for practical purposes, do not
       claim to represent any general law; and that some years ago, while
       examining a mathematical theory of gases, he endeavoured to <U+FB01>nd
       out, from the experiments of the French Academy, whether the den
       sity of steam in contact with water followed any distinct law with
       reference to the temperature measured from the zero of gaseous ten
       sion (situated at —461° Fahr. by Rudberg’s experiments, con<U+FB01>rmed
       by Magnus and Regnault).      To avoid circumlocution, he calls tem
       peratures measured from this zero G temperatures, and observes
       Paocennmes or THE ROYAL Socm'rv. VOL. VI. No. 82.                               7

that     if
        t represents the G temperature, A the density of a gas or
vapour, and}; its elastic force, the equation
                                                 tA=p
represents the well-known laws of Marriotte and of Dalton and Gay
Lussac.    He then states that, as the function which expresses a
general relation betweenp and t, in vapours, must include a more
simple function expressing a general relation between A and t, the
proper course seemed to be to tabulate                        the quotients       J;—   from the
experiments of the Academy, and to project them in              curve.   For  a
reasons connected with the vale 'vi'va theory of gases, which repre
sents the     Gtemperature as        square quantity, be projected these
                                         a
quotients   or densities  as ordinates,   to the square root of the G tem
peratures   as abscissae;  and   found    that  the curve traced out was of
the parabolic kind, but of          high order.
                                         a          Considering the density
as a cubic quantity, the cube roots of the densities were set off as
ordinates to the same abscissae, and the author was grati<U+FB01>ed to <U+FB01>nd
that the resulting curve was the Conic Parabola.                To ascertain
whether this was accurately the case, the square roots of these ordi
 nates, corresponding to the sixth roots of the densities, were set off
to the same abscissaa, that       the square roots of the
                                        is                               G
                                                               temperatures.
The result    is shown in a chart, in which, as the author observes, the
 points determined from the observations range with great precision
 in straight line, any slight divergence being sometimes to the right
     a
 and sometimes to the left; precisely as might be expected from
 small errors of observation.       Other series of experiments on steam
 were projected in      similar manner, and
                           a                       was found that, although
                                                              it
 no two exactly agreed with each other, each set ranged in           straight           a
 line nearly. The vapours of ether, alcohol and sulphuret of carbon,
 were found to conform to the same law, as were likewise M. Avo
 gadro’s observations on the vapour of mercury, and Faraday's ex
 periments on liqui<U+FB01>ed gases (Phil. Trans. 184-5).             Of these last
 ole<U+FB01>ant gas      remarkably in accordance with the law, as are nitrous
                  is
  oxide, ammonia, cyanogen, sulphurous acid, and carbonic acid at
 the upper part of its range; but muriatic acid, sulphuretted and
 arseninretted hydrogen, do not show the same regularity.
     The co-ordinates of the points being the square root of the                               G
 temperatures and the sixth root of the densities, the equation to the
 straight line which passes through the points expresses the sixth root
 of the density in terms of the                  G
                                        temperature.    The constants to be
 determined     in this equation are the inclination of the straight line
 to the axis of m or that on which A/t           measured, and the distance
                                                         is

The several equations, with the numerical values of the constants
gand       for the series of observations previously referred to and
           h,
represented on the chart, are then given, the          G
                                                    temperatures being
in  degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale, and the values of being calculated
                                                             It
so as to give the pressure in inches of" mercury.
    The author remarks that the observations on the vapour of water
 below 80° show    a small excess of density above what     required by
                                                                   is
 the line corresponding to those at higher temperatures;      and that       it
is
a     curious circumstance that the law of expansibility of water also
 becomes disturbed at about the same temperature.      In proof of this,
 the observations of M. Despretz (Ann. de Chim. vol. lxx.) being pro
jected, by making the volume the ordinate to the square root of the
G    temperature as abscissa, these observations      above 25° C. or
 77° F. give in the most exact manner        conic parabola; but below
                                             a
 77° they no longer give that curve.
    The equation to the parabola for temperatures above 77°F.                is
 a(u—0)=( Mt—p)“, in which v          the volume at
                                      is                     tle
                                                            temperature
t,  in terms of its volume unity at 89°“2 F. or 4° C. (its point of
 maximum      density), a=352'38,     0='99872, and q>=21'977 or
¢’=4-83°.
   The law of the increase of density and temperature in saturated
vapours having a certain analogy with the law of increase of density
and temperature in air while suddenly compressed or dilated, the
author next discusses the latter subject in   manner similar to that
                                                   a
in which he had discussed the former.       From this discussion he
draws the following conclusions :—
      When air
      1.           compressed or dilated, the G temperature varies
                   is
as the cube root of the density; and the tension as the 4th power
of the,G temperature, or the cube root of the 4th power of the
density.
  2. The mechanical force exerted by a given quantity of air while
expanding from one density to another,      proportional to the differ
                                              is
ence of the cube roots of these densities, or to the difference of their
G temperatures    hence the fall of temperature
                   :                                proportional to the
                                                        is
force expended.
   3. The mechanical force exerted upon           given quantity of air,
                                                   a
while compressing       from one density to another,
                        it                               proportional to
                                                              is
the difference of the cube roots of these densities, or to the differ
ence of their G temperatures:      hence the rise of temperature    pro is
                                                          -
portional  to the force  exerted.
   4-. The total mechanical     force exerted by     volume of air of a
                                                        a
given tension, while expanding inde<U+FB01>nitely,        equal to that tension
                                                   is
acting through three times the volume.

                                    100
   5. The total mechanical force exerted by a volume of air while
expanding inde<U+FB01>nitely is proportional to its G temperature.
   6. A given quantity of air while expanding,          under a constant
pressure, from one temperature to another, exerts a mechanical force
equivalent to one-third the di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature ; and the quan
tity of heat required to change the temperature of air under a con
stant pressure, is four-thirds of that required to effect the same change
                                                          '
of temperature with a constant volume.
   The author concludes by observing that it is singular that these
simple and, he considers, important deductions from M M.Gay-Lussac
and Welter's experiments, have been overlooked by the eminent ma
thematicians who have elaborately discussed this subject.        The arti
<U+FB01>cial position of the zero-point on the ordinary scales of temperature
may perhaps account for this by its tendency to con<U+FB01>ne our ideas.
Dalton’s and Gay-Lussac's law of expansion seems imperatively to
have required that, in all computations having reference to gases and
vapours, the temperature should have been reckoned from the zero
of gaseous tension; yet it has not been so; and it is impossible to
avoid the conclusion, that if it had been otherwise, if no other tem
perature but what we have had so often to refer to as the G tempe
rature had been indicated in their analyses, we should have pro<U+FB01>ted
more by their labours, and been further advanced in the science of
heat and elastic <U+FB02>uids.

   GENTLEMEN,
Tun   year that is passed, though not remarkable for any very start
ling discovery, has contributed a full average to the advance of
human knowledge: in all directions there has been steady progress,
new facts springing up in rapid succession, the fruits of inquiries
carried on with perhaps more energy. with more system, and upon
a greater scale than at any previous epoéh in the history of science.
Our continental neighbours, happily exempt from internal troubles,
have been free to pursue their scienti<U+FB01>c labours; and our brethren
in America, with that energy which is daily winning for them such
signal triumphs in the arts of peace and civilization, though later in
the <U+FB01>eld, yet fresh and full of hope, have taken a distinguished place.
   I need hardly remind you that at home the indications of active
progress'are _no less striking.   Here we have had an unusual number
of papers,~‘and the size of the last volume of the Transactions is evi
dence that a large proportion were of sterling worth.          Many also
have expressed their readiness to undertake new researches on re

                                         103
    ceiving a certain amount of assistance from the Government Grant;
    and although no one has proposed any very extensive series of ex
    periments, still many facts no doubt will be obtained in various de
    partments of science,——a valuable addition to human knowledge; but,
    scattered over science at large, they will not of course make that
    brilliant display which they would do if concentrated, as in M. Re
    gnault’s inquiry, on one speci<U+FB01>c object.
       I may also add, that many distinguished men haVe recently come
    forward here as candidates, and I am happy to say that so far the
    new Statute appears to be working very well, and as yet I do not
    see any probability that men of unquestioned       merit will have too
    long to wait for admission.
       Your Council having awarded the Copley Medal to Professor Owen,
    it becomes my duty'to give some account of his discoveries.        They
    cannot be described by a mere reference to one or two great .works:
    they have appeared successively in a variety of publications, and: arp
    so numerous, that to notice each, however slightly, will almost take
    up more time than I can venture to ask for.        Any further general
    observations would therefore be inadmissible ; and thanking you
    the Council for the kind assistance I have received during the past
    year, and indeed on all occasions,I will at once proceedi  to stateY the    J
    grounds of the award of the Copley Medal.             .
       The Contributions to Comparative         Anatomy and. Physiology,
    made by Professor Owen in published works, began to appear about
    the time of the decease of Cuvier in [832, and have been continued
'
    with brief interruptions since that period to the present time: the
    mantle of that great man seems to have descended, at his death,
    upon the shoulders of our distinguished countryman; and it is not
    a little interesting to remark how this circumstance'has produced,
    as it were, an uninterrupted succession of important discoveries in
    these and the collateral sciences, during a period, already passed, of
    sixty years, by two men of different countries indeed, but the cha~
    racter of‘whose minds, andjthe originality and importance of whose
    discoveries and generalisation/5,; have" placed them on an' eminence,
    not reached by any other philosophers :of modern times, in the same
                                         '     i       "   '
                                    '
    branches of knowledge. .                                                     .
       Professor Owen’s earlier vworksare principally devoted to making
    known the labours of John Hunter, and facilitating, by the construc
    tion of an elaborate catalogue, the study of his unrivalled collection
    of anatomical preparations in the Museum of the Royal College of
    Surgeons.                                                                ,
       It is unnecessary for me to do more than allude to the masterl
    manner in which this arduous task was performed.              In 1840,‘ the
    ten years’ labour was completed by       the  publication  of  the <U+FB01>fth and
    last volume   of  a catalogue,  which,  for  laborious  research,   'for new
    and important views in anatomical and physiological science, is un
    rivalled in any age or country ; and the Council of the College,            i'p
    the advertisement to the last volume of the Physiological Catalogue,
    express
              “ their great grati<U+FB01>cation in' acknowledging the unremlttin’g
    labour bestowed on the work by Professor Owen;             to            pub
                                                                    whOng<U+FB01>ltS

                                    104
lication has been exclusively con<U+FB01>ded.”       From the date of the pub
lication of this catalogue, including as it does not only the description
of 3790 Hunterian dissections, but also seventy-eight engravings of
minute and elaborate drawings, together with the general observa
tions left by Hunter, the true position of this great man in natural
science became manifest, and a more just and ample recognition of
his merits was produced, particularly on the continent.
    These however were not the only labours of Professor Owen in
 connexion with his of<U+FB01>cial duties.     In addition to some minor cata
logues   and  other  works,  I must  not  omit to mention the two well
 known monographs, the ‘ Memoir of the Pearly Nautilus,’ pub
 lished under the auspices of the College in 1832; and that on the
 skeleton of a gigantic extinct Sloth (Mylodon robustus), published
                                                   '
 ten years afterwards.
    The merits of these publications are fully recognised, and have
 received the highest praise from continental anatomists; and it is
 remarkable that the doubts which were expressed and long enter
 tained, as to thevaccuracy of Professor Owen's restoration of the
 animal of the Pearly Nautilus to its shell, were completely dissipated
 by the <U+FB01>rst complete example obtained by the eminent Professor of
 the Garden of Plants, M. Valenciennes.
     Our time will only allow me to take a slight glance at the learned
 and elaborate modi<U+FB01>cation of the classi<U+FB01>cation of the Cephalopoda,
 the reference of the spirula and the curious fossil Belemnite to the
 higher or dibranchiate order of this class of animals.      For his me
 moir on certain of this family, with their soft parts fossilized, which
 was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1844, the Royal
 Medal was awarded.        This class of animals has been still further
 elucidated in Professor Owen’s papers in the Zoological Society’s
 Transactions, and in an elaborate article in the <U+FB01>rst volume of the
 Cyclopsedia of Anatomy and Physiology.
    The <U+FB01>rst communication received by the Royal Society from Pro
 fessor Owen was on the Mammary Glands of the Ornitharhynckus
paradoz'us in 1832.      These organs had been originally described by
 Sir Everard Home as masses of fat; they were afterwards recognised
 by Meckel as mammary glands in 1824 : but their true nature was
 again disputedvby     Geotfroy St. Hilaire, who considered them as
 scent glands.
    Professor Owen determined the question by observing the phases
 of change relatively between the ovaries and the glands in question,
 and established their true mammary nature, by the dissection in 1831
 of no less than <U+FB01>ve female Ornithorhynchi and one Echidna ; a
 doctrine, which was afterwards con<U+FB01>rmed by observations made in
 Australia on the secretion itself of the gland.      _
    In 1834 there appeared in the Philosophical Transactions Professor
 Owen’s paper,>describing impregnated specimens of Ornithorliyn
 chus.    In this paper he shows, by the structure of the cvisac, of
 the corpus luteum, and of the uterine ovum, that the latter must be
 developed in utero, and the young be born alive.        He infers, from
 the structure of the chorion, that no placenta will be developed. The

                                     105
  problem still remained, how a quadruped, with a beak like a duck,
  could suck, or in any way obtain milk from a mammary organ with
 out a nipple. In 1834 Professor Owen received specimens of young,
 and apparently newly-born, Ornithorhync/zi, from Mr. George Bennett
 and Dr. Weatherhead: their form and anatomy are minutely de
 scribed in a. paper in the Transactions of the Zoological Society.
 The oral ori<U+FB01>ce was there shown to be exactly adapted to be applied
 to the areola of the breast on which the lactiferous ducts terminate,
 and to receive the milk that is injected into the mouth by a muscle
 that surrounds the large mammary gland“.           The remains of foetal
 peculiarities in these young specimens con<U+FB01>rmed the inference from
 the structure of the ovum that the Ornithorhynchus was viviparous,
but implacental.
   - Professor Owen’s .next
                              step was to settle the questions undecided
 on the generation of marsupial animals-the period of uterine gesta
 tion, the exact condition of the new-born young, the mode of its
 passage to the external pouch, and the term of its suspension to the
 pendulous nipple.      On all these points science was, as yet, unin
 formed.    The Kangaroo (Macropus major) had bred in captivity, in
both France and England.         Professor Owen took advantage of the
 opportunities which the menagerie of the Zoological Society afforded
to obtain exact data on the chief points which most needed eluci
 dation.    You will <U+FB01>nd the account of his experiments in the paper
 ‘
   On the Generation of the Marsupial Animals,’ in the Transactions
of the Royal Society for 1834.        The period of uterine gestation of
the Great Kangaroo is shown to be thirty-eight days; the new-born
animal is but one inch in length, naked, blind, with hind-legs and
tail shorter than the fore-legs.       He ascertained that the mother
transferred her minute and delicate progeny from the vulva, to the
nipple concealed in the pouch, by means of her lips; that the em
bryo instinctively adheres to the nipple, and is suspended to it for
a  period of six months.
     In the Philosophical Transactions for 1837 appeared a memoir
from Professor Owen’s pen, describing certain peculiarities in the brain
of the Marsupialia, especially the absence of the corpus callosum.
The same condition he subsequently discovered in the Ornithorhyn
ehus and Echidna.        This and other peculiarities of structure in the
sanguiferous, osseous and dental systems, led Professor Owen to sug
gest a modi<U+FB01>cation of the classi<U+FB01>cation         of the Mammalia, which
Cuvier had adopted in his last edition of the ‘ Regne Animal.’ Deem
ing modi<U+FB01>cations of brain of more importance than those of the
ungual phalanges, and connecting the higher development of the
commissural system of the brain with the longer sojourn of the foetus
in the womb and its more intimate union therewith, Professor Owen,
in his paper ‘ On the Classi<U+FB01>cation of the Marsupialia,’ in the Trans
actions of the Zoological Society for 1839, groups together all the
Mammalia which have a placenta under any form, and which have
    * An analogous arrangement had been previously shown to exist in the Kan
                                                        '
garoo, by the late Mr. John Morgan.

                                    106
the corpus callosum, in a primary subclass, under the name of ‘Pla
                                       ‘
centaliu’; the rest form the subclass Implacentalia,’ and this includes
the    orders Marsupialia  and Monotrema.      For a further development
of these views, and of the organization of the Implacentalia, I may
                                                 ‘
refer to Professor Owen’s admirable memoir         On the Osteology of the
Marsupialia’ in the Transactions of the Zoological Society, and to the
           ‘                   ‘             ’
articles Monotremata’ and Marsupialia in the Cycloptedia of Ana
 tomy and Physiology.
     Professor Owen further displayed modi<U+FB01>cations of the Cuvierian
 system on anatomical grounds, in his paper on the Dugong in the
 Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1838, in which he sepa
 rated the Herbivorous from the true or Carnivorous Cetacea.
     The anatomical and palaeontological evidence for the association
 of the Ruminantia with other hoofed quadrupeds having the toes in
 equal number, in one natural order, called Artiodactyla, and for the
 grouping together of other hoofed animals with the toes in unequal
 number, in a second order called Perissodactyla,         is given in the
  Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for November 1847.~
     In regard to that family of Quadrumanous Mammalia which ap
 proach most nearly to Man, much obscurity prevailed at the close of
 Cuvier’s labours.     That great naturalist places the Orang-utan at
 the head of the order, from being acquainted with only the immature
  condition of the Chimpanzee.      The knowledge of the osteological
  and dental characters of the adults of both forms, of their true facial
 angle and cerebral capacity, were <U+FB01>rst made known in ProfessorOwen's
  memoirs printed in the Zoological Society’s Transactions; and here
  most of those characters which were supposed to approximate these
  animals most nearly to Man, are shown to be transitory, and peculiar
 to the young state of the animal with deciduous teeth.
     In a second memoir in the second volume of the Zoological Trans
 actions, Professor Owen gives the requisite details of the change of
  dentition, and describes a second species of Orang from Borneo
  ( Pithecus morio). In a third memoir the cranial and dental characters
  of a second species of Chimpanzee (Troglodytes gorilla), of formidable
  strength and stature, discovered by Dr. Savage, are detailed in the
  third volume of the Zoological Transactions, to which Professor Owen
  has since added two memoirs descriptive of the entire skeleton of the
 vTroglodytes gorilla, and the relative capacities of the cranium of the
  Orangs, Chimpanzees, and the di<U+FB01>'erent varieties of the human race.
     With regard to the class of Birds, 1 may refer to Professor Owen’s
  monograph on the Anatomy of the Toucan in Mr. Gould’s works on
  the Rhamphastidae;     to his memoirs on the Anatomy of the Horn
  bill in the <U+FB01>rst volume of the Transactions of the Zoological Society ;
  and to two elaborate monographs on the Anatomy of the Apterym
                                                             '
  Australis, in the same Transactions.
     The comparison of the organization of the latter remarkable species
  with that of the larger struthious birds, and, above all, the accessions
  to the same Wingless order which we owe to ProfessorOwen’s memoirs
  on the fossil remains of the Dinornis and Palapteryw obtained from
  the Islands of New Zealand, supplied him with the requisite grounds

                                       107
   for  separating from the Grallae of the Cuvierian system, the species
   that  therein form the family ‘ Brem'pennes,’ and in raising them to the
   rank of an order.      This and other modi<U+FB01>cations of the Cuvierian
   classi<U+FB01>cation of birds, and an inquiry into the grounds for a binary
   division of the. class according to the condition of the newly-hatched
  young, e. g. into Aves altrices and Aves precoces, will be found in
  Professor Owen’s article Aves in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and
  Physiology. Perhaps none of Professor Owen’s researches on Fossil
  Remains have excited more general interest than those to which we
  are indebted for a knowledge of the gigantic Struthious Birds of New
  Zealand, the <U+FB01>rst paper on which is to be found in the third volume
  of the Transactions of the Zoological Society. I cannot avoid quoting
  on this subject the words of a distinguished geologist, a Fellow of
  the Society, in the 4th volume of the Quarterly Journal of the Geo
  logical Society.
      " The <U+FB01>rst relic of this kind was made known to European natural
  ists by Professor Owen, in 1839.      It consisted of the shaft of a femur
  or thigh-bone, but a few inches long, and with both its extremities
  wanting; and this fragment so much resembled in its general ap
 pearance the marrow-bone of an ox, as actually to have been regarded
 as such by more than one eminent            naturalist of this metropolis.
 And if I were required to select from the numerous and important
 inductions of palmontology, the one which of all others presents the
 most striking and triumphant instance of the sagacious application
 of the principles of the correlation of organic structure enunciated
 by the illustrious Cuvier,—the one that may be regarded as the es
 perimentum crucis of the Cuvierian philosophy,-—I would unhesi
 tatingly adduce the interpretation of this fragment of bone.        I know
 not among all the marvels which palaeontology has revealed to us,
 a more brilliant example of successful philosophical induction—the
 felicitous prediction of genius enlightened by profound scienti<U+FB01>c
 knowledge.
     " The specimen was put into Professor Owen’s hands for exami
 nation, and from this mere fragment, the Hunterian Professor arrived
 at the conclusion, ‘that there existed, and perhaps still exists in
 those distant islands, a race of struthious birds of larger and more
 colossal stature than the Ostrich or any other known species.’         This
 inference was based on the peculiar character of the cancellated
 structure of the bone, which differs from that of mammalia, and most
 Closely resembles that of the Ostrich.        And so con<U+FB01>dent was Pro
 fessor Owen of the soundness of his inductions, that he boldly added,
 'so far as my skill in interpreting an osseous fragment may be
 credited, I am willing to risk the reputation for it on this statement ;
                                                                            ’
                               ‘
 and he further remarks,         The discovery of a relic of a large stru
 thious bird in New Zealand is one of peculiar interest, on account
 of the remarkable character of the existing fauna of those islands,
which still includes one of the most extraordinary and anomalous
genera of the struthious order, the Apteryz'; and because of the
close analogy which the event indicated by the present relic offers
to the extinction of the Dodo of the island of the Mauritius.             So

                                     108
far as   n judgement can be formed of a single fragment, it seemspro
bable'that the colossal bird of New Zealand, if it prove to be ex
tinct, presented proportions more nearly resembling those of the
Dodo, than of any of the existing Struthioaidai.’       In 1843 the cor
 rectness of these views was con<U+FB01>rmed in every essential particular
 by a large collection of bones obtained by the Rev. W. Williams
 and transmitted. to the Dean of Westminster; and still further cor
 roborated by another interesting series brought to England in 1846
 by Percy Earl, Esq.”
     It would be too long a trespass on your time to cite even the titles
 of the numerous Papers, Reports and Works in which the results
 of Professor Owen’s researches in the <U+FB01>eld of Palaeontology are
 recorded; and I am forced to pass with only an allusion, the nume
 rous cases in which a fragment of a tooth has enabled him to decide
 the af<U+FB01>nities of the animal to which it belonged, and to render the
 fragmentary remains of bones the means of determining the forms
 and relations of their former possessors.     I may just enumerate as
 examples in illustration of the successful extent to which this prin
 ciple of investigation was carried, its application to the Toxodon,
 the Mylodon, the Schidothen'on, the Glyptodon, and many others.
     This application of Comparative Anatomy to the right interpreta
 tion of the fragmentary remains of lost forms of animal life, is the
last and perhaps the highest power which the cultivator of that
science gains as such.      It began now to be applied in a systematic
manner by Professor Owen to the elucidation of the ancient zoology
of this island.     His <U+FB01>rst Report ' On British Fossil Reptiles,’ was
communicated to the British Association in 1839, the second and
concluding Report on the same subject in 1842.
     Subsequent researches on the extinct animals of the same class
have been communicated in the Memoirs printed in the Transac
tions of the Geological Society, amongst which we may notice that
on the Dicynodont Reptiles of South Africa; a Memoir on the
Rhynchosaurus in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society; and in Monographs contributed to the publications of the
Palaeontological Society.      The matter of these Monographs and of

    In 1842 Professor     Owen communicated his <U+FB01>rst Report ‘ On

British Fossil Mammalia to the British Association; and, in l848,

drawn up at the instance of the British Association for the Advance}

    In the illustrated ' History of British Fossil Mammalia and Birds,’
published in 1846, Professor Owen developes his generalization as to‘
conformity of Geographical Distribution in the extinct and existing

                                       109
forms of Mammalia, which he had progressively worked out in pre
vious palaeontological writings.
     As examples of Anatomical Monographs, 1 may refer to the me
moir on the Lepidosiren anneclens, in the Linnaean Transactions for
          ‘
1839 ;      On the Anatomy of the Rhinoceros,’ in the Zoological
Transactions, and to the Papers ‘ On the Eustachian Canals in the
Crocodile,’ ‘ On the Carapace and Plastrum of the Chelonia,’ ' On
the Dentition of the Phacochosrus or Wart-Hog,’ and ‘ On the Ex

ogenous Processes of Vertebrae in the Philosophical Transactions.
     The value of microscopical research in comparative anatomy has
been already alluded to, and a fresh instance of its importance is
given in the elaborate researches on the subject of the Teeth, the <U+FB01>rst
results of which were communicated in a report to the British Asso
ciation at the Meeting at Newcastle in 1838, and they were ulti
                                                   ‘
mately embodied in the great work entitled Odontography,’ com
prising one volume of text and an atlas of 168 plates, in which the
diversi<U+FB01>ed modi<U+FB01>cations of the dental tissues in all classes possessing
teeth are fully illustrated.
     The minute structure of scales and other dermal appendages of
Fishes has been studied microscopically by Professor Owen, who was
led by the phenomena he observed to oppose the views of the develop
 ment of scales byexcretion, which M. Agassiz had contended for; and
he demonstrates the close analogy which exists between the dermal
 bony tubercles and spines of the cartilaginous <U+FB01>shes and their teeth.
     Professor Owen’s views have been con<U+FB01>rmed, the analogy extended,
 and a variety of beautiful modi<U+FB01>cations       of tooth-like structure de
 monstrated by Dr. Williamson in his papers recently published in
 onr Transactions.
     Of the application of the microscope by Professor Owen to the
 solution of some of the mysterious problems of generation, examples
 will be found in his ‘ Lectures on the Comparative Anatomy and Phy
 siology of the Invertebrate Animals,’ published in 1843; in those
 ‘On the Generation and Development of Animals,’ published in
 1849—50; and in his work ‘ On Parthenogenesis,          or the successive
 production of Procreating Individuals from a single Ovum,’ also pub
 lished in 1849.     In the latter work Professor Owen shows the intent
          ‘
 of the     cleavage process,’ as it has been called. to he that by which
 the spermatic principle is distributed throughout the germ-mass:
 and be there points out the consequent relation of such inherited
 subdivision of the spermatic principle to future developments of em
 bryos in virgin parents.     As propounded in this work, the theory be
 came capable of application to many other cases besides that to which
 it was <U+FB01>rst applied.
     The progress of Natural History has added many analogous in
 stances of virgin-generation to that of the Aphides.          In all these
 Professor Owen calls attention to the proposition of the primary
 cell-structure of the impregnated germ, which is retained in the pro.
 creative larva».    Dr. Steenstrup has very ably and very ingeniously
 generalized the phenomena in question in his well-known essay on
  '                                                               -

    The progress of all sciences is a perpetual struggle after gene
ralizations of a higher and higher order.       Anatomy and physiology,
so actively cultivated in the time of Cuvier, had afforded at the
latter end of his career, glimpses of generalizations, which, under
the vague terms of
                        “ unity of organization,” became subjects of
sharp controversy.      The  idea, so expressed, had tWO applications,—
one, to the analogies which exist between the permanent         organiza
tion of the lower animals, and certain transitory states of the higher
species;    the other, to the correspondences traceable between the
parts composing the organization of different species.          \
    With reference to the <U+FB01>rst of these applications, I cannot do
better than quote the author’s own account of his conclusions, as
given in the last lecture of his course on the Invertebrate Animals,
published in 1843.
    “The extent to which the resemblance, expressed by the term
‘
  Unity of Organization,’ may be traced between the higher and
lower organized animals, bears an inverse ratio to their approxima
tion to maturity. All animals resemble each other at the earliest
period of their development, which commences with the manifesta
tion of the assimilative and <U+FB01>ssiparous properties of the polygastric
animalcule : the potential germ of the mammal can be compared, in
form‘and vital actions, with the Monad alone, and, at this period,
unity of organization may be predicated of the two extremes of the
Animal Kingdom. The germ of the Polype pushes the resemblance
farther, and acquires the locomotive organs of the Monad—the
 super<U+FB01>cial vibratile cilia—before it takes on its special radiated
 type.   The Acalephe passes through both the Infusorial and Polype
stages, and propagates by gemmation, as well as spontaneous <U+FB01>ssion,
before it acquires its mature form and sexual organs.         The fulness
of the unity of organization which prevails through the Polypes and
larval Acalephes, is diminished as the latter acquire maturity and
assume their special form.
    "There is only one animal form which is either permanently or
transitorin represented throughout the Animal Kingdom,-it is that
of the infusorial Monad.
    “ Other forms are represented less
                                          exclusively in the development
of the Animal Kingdom, and may be regarded as secondary forms.
These are, the Polype, the Worm, the Tunicary, and the Lamprey ;
they are secondary in relation to the Animal Kingdom at large, but
are primary in respect of the primary divisions or sub-kingdoms.
   “ Thus the Radiata, after
                                having passed through the Monad stage,
enter that of the Polype: many there <U+FB01>nd their <U+FB01>nal development;
others proceed to be metamorphosed            into the Acalephe or the
Echinoderm.
    “ All the Articulata, at an early stage of their development, assume
the form or condition of the apodal and acephalous worm; some
<U+FB01>nd their mature development at that stage, as the Entozoa; others
proceed to acquire annulations; a head; rudimental feet; jointed
feet, and <U+FB01>nally, wings: radiating in various directions and degrees
from the. primary or fundamental form of their sub-kingdom.

                                     lll
    “ The Mollusca pass from the condition of the ciliated Monad to
that of the shell-less Acephalan, and in like manner either remain
to work out the perfections of that stage, or diverge to achieve the
development of shells, of a head, of a ventral foot, or of cephalic
                                   -                              -
arms.
    “ The vertebrated ovum
                              having     manifested  its monadiform rela
tions by the spontaneous <U+FB01>ssion, growth, and multiplication of . the
primordial nucleated cells, next assumes, by their metamorphosis
and primary arrangement,        the form and condition of the <U+FB01>nless
cartilaginous <U+FB01>sh, from which fundamental form development ra
diates in as many and diversi<U+FB01>ed directions and extents, and attains
more extraordinary heights of complication and-perfection than any
of the lower secondary types appear to be susceptible of.”
   To the second application of the principle, I must more particularly
refer, as the subject on which perhaps Professor Owen’s investiga
tions have been more fully and elaborately and systematically carried
out, and have exercised a more important and universal in<U+FB02>uence on
these sciences than any cther,-—I mean the doctrine of Homologies,
or the correspondency of parts and of plan in the construction of
animals.     This had been the subject of close and sharp discussions
in the Academy of Sciences between Cuvier and Geoffroy St.
Hilaire, which are summed up by the latter in the ‘Principes de
Philosophie Zoologique,’ published in 1830 ; and it can be no matter
of surprise, that with an antagonist so strong in his'well-founded
reputation, as a great master in science, and so skilful in applying
the weapons of a severe and sarcastic logic, Geo<U+FB01>'roy St. Hilaire
should have failed to impress the physiological world with those
views which Cuvier objected to, as being based upon a priori specu
lation.                                                                  '
    The effect of these discussions may be traced in most of the ablest
works on Anatomy and Physiology which subsequently appeared,
as, e. g. those by Prof. John Miiller, Prof. Wagner, Milne-Edwards,
                                       ‘                                 ’
Siebold and Stannius ; and in the Outline of the Animal Kingdom
                                                ’
and    ‘
         Manual of Comparative Anatomy             by Professor Jones of
King’s College, London. By all these authors, the principle of
 Unity of Organization, as it has been attempted to be illustrated
and applied by Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and by the German Anatomists
 of the Trancendental School of Schelling, is tacitly or avowedly
 abandoned.      By M. Agassiz it was directly opposed.
    Nevertheless, the question whether the principle of a common
                                                                    ‘
 pattern, or the principle of <U+FB01>nal causes, or, as Cuvier called it, con
 ditions of   existence,’—I  say, which of these two principles, or in
what degree both have governed the development of organization of
 animals—the greatest question which can occupy the philosophical
 anatomist—was still far from having been satisfactorily decided.
    It enforced itself upon the most serious consideration of Professor
 Owen, when he was called upon to prepare the Catalogue of the
 Osteological Collections in the Museum of the Royal College of
 Surgeons: and the results of this consideration were promulgated

                                     112
 in his Lectures on Comparative       Osteology, given in the Theatre of
 the College.
    What those results are, may now be studied in his ‘Report on
 the Homological Relations of the Skeleton,’ submitted to the British
 Association at Southampton in 1846, in his ‘ Lectures on the
 Vertebrate Animals,’ 1846, and in his works entitled ‘ On the
 Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton,’ 1848, and
 ‘
   On the Nature of Limbs,’ in 1849.
    It does not become me, if even time permitted, to enter upon an
analysis of these works. I believe them to be well known to all my
 anatomical and physiological hearers, and that the doctrines they
contain, new rather than revived—new at least, in the best sense, as
 being the results of strict induction,—have been generally received.
    In the comprehensive ‘ Principles of Physiology, General and
 Comparative,’   by Dr. Carpenter, the <U+FB01>rst systematic work on the
 subject which has appeared in our language since the promulgation
 of Professor Owen’s views, that author adopts the philosophy of the
 skeleton therein set forth, borrows the illustrations of the Vertebrate
 Archetype, and characterizes the works from which he quotes as
 “
   examples of that rare combination of logical appreciation of facts,
 with originality in the conception of ideas, which distinguishes the
 true philosopher from the rash speculator 0n the one hand, and from
 the mere plodding observer on the other."
                                                             '
    Sir Charles Lyell, in his last ' Anniversary Address to the Geolo
 gical Society, speaks of the same works as being
                                                         " distinguished by
 grand and comprehensive views in regard to the relations of different
 parts of the vertebrate creation to each other.”
    Dr. Carus, in the attempt to follow out the homologies of the
 muscles on the principles laid down by Professor Owen, in his ‘ Lec
                                      '
 tures on the Vertebrate Animals        for the application of his philo
 sophy to that system, acknowledges it as “indicating the only true
 way to the comprehension of a scienti<U+FB01>c myology.”
    The great aim of Professor Owen’s works on Homological Anatomy,
 appears to be to put an end to the old controversy so long main
tained, on the assumption that a special adaptation of parts was
incompatible with a common type of construction. Having, after
long pains-taking researches, arrived at a clear conception of the
archetypal plan of the vertebrate structures, he associates that idea
with as clear a recognition of the teleological signi<U+FB01>cation of the
great principle as our <U+FB01>nite capacities are able to attain to.
                                                                     “ For it
is certain,” writes Professor Owen,     “ that in instances where the ana
logy of a machine fails to explain the structure of an organ, such
structure does not exist in vain, if its true comprehension lead
rational and responsible beings to a better conception of their own
origin and Creator.” Thus, far from giving support to Transmuta
tional or Pantheistic notions, the conclusions of the Homologist
being based on a rigorous deduction from carefully observed facts,
furnish new arguments in support of the highest truths.

into many of the subjects which have been elucidated by the re
searches of Professor Owen. But I think the sketch which I have been
able to lay before you, presents such an amount of labour, guided
by genius, and rewarded by important results, as is scarcely ex
ampled in the history of natural science, and shows how justly the
Council have decided in awarding the highest honour the Royal
 Society can bestow, on Professor Owen.
   The Royal Medal in         the department of Astronomy having been
awarded     to the President,    Colonel Sabine addressed his Lordship as
follows   :——-         »
       Loan Rossn,
   It falls to me to present to your Lordship the Royal Medal in the
department of Astronomy, merited by researches not more remarkable
from the universal interest which they inspire, or the brilliant and
unexpected results which crown them, than from the rare combination
of industry, patience, inventive genius, and scienti<U+FB01>c power to which
they owe their success.         You have reopened a <U+FB01>eld of investigation
which seemed almost exhausted by two of the most illustrious ob
servers of this or any age ; and have added another proof of the great
truth, that wide as is the range of human intellect, the wonders of
Divine Wisdom lengthen out without limit beyond that range on
                                                           ’
every side.      Even in your <U+FB01>rst memoir ‘ On Nebulae (Philosophical
Transactions, 1844), it was evident that the resolution of a large pro;
portion of those mysterious forms into clusters might be expected,
 and that even with the optical power of a three-feet re<U+FB02>ector their
con<U+FB01>gurations would assume new aspects :—and these anticipatious
 have been fully realized by the gigantic instrument whose <U+FB01>rst
fruits you have presented to the Royal Society.         Without attempt
ing toanalyse your second memoir, which must be familiar to all
 who think in this department of Astronomy, I would notice as most
preminent :—
    l.'The resolution of a great number of Nebulae not previously
 resolved; and the discovery, that in most of these the stars are
 neither uniform in magnitude nor distribution.       In the most remark
 able, the great Nebula- of Orion, its components are very minute,
 but crowded in knots, giving it a mottled appearance; while in
 others (the Dumb bell for example), such small stars envelope an
 assemblage of others of greater magnitude.          Thus, the tokens of
 resolvability, which the sagacity of Sir John Herschel had discerned,
 are veri<U+FB01>ed, and their application warranted to such Nebulae as resist
 even the six-foot re<U+FB02>ector. There is no line of demarcation between
 Clusters and Nebulae.
    2. Nor have the symmetric forms and exact circular or elliptic
 outlines which many of the Nebulae were supposed to possess, when
 seen with instruments too weak to bring out many of their details,
 any existence: the hypothesis which infers from such appearances
their gradual consolidation under the in<U+FB02>uence of rotation and gravity

                                       114
                 \
has therefore no foundation, and their actual arrangement rather
indicates the operation of causes presenting a marked difference from
those which act in our planetary system.
    3. Your Lordship’s researches have disclosed an arrangement
even more astonishing and more suggestive than any which had
been previously ascribed to Nebulae ;-—that spiral conformation which
prevails in so many instances, occasionally displayed with all the
graceful precision of a. geometric curve, but most frequently seen
obliquely, and causing the appearance of curved luminous or dark
bands.    It is found connected with single or multiple centres, clusters
or stars'; with rings probably of stars, and even may be traced in
ordinary clusters. What are the conditions of which it is the result?
If the Astronomer <U+FB01>nds it hard to conceive the laws which can
maintain the permanence of a uniform globular cluster, how much
enhanced is the dif<U+FB01>culty, when to the perturbing forces which exist
in that simplest case are added others, such as the vortex-like cha
racter of these marvellous forms!
    All this would be much had it been achieved by one who sought
the means of fathoming the depths of the sky in the workshops of
Munich, Paris, or London ; but it is much more when he not merely
uses, but has himself created that transcendent            explorer, whose
possible existence would a few years since have been regarded with
 incredulity.      You, my Lord, have not only overcome the difficulties
 which had deterred professional opticians, by a course of costly ex
 periments continued with consummate skill and science for many
 years, but have made it a special object to communicate the know
 ledge so laboriously obtained for the public use.         The Council has
 awarded to your Lordship the Medal which Her Majesty, our
 Patroness, has graciously placed at the disposal of the Royal Society,
 as the highest testimonial which, as your Lordship is one of the
 Council, it is in their power to offer; but we are sure that you
 would deem it even a higher one, should we be able to establish in
 another region an observer, who would imitate the course of disco
 very on which you have so gloriously entered; and which it is the
 earnest desire of every friend of science that you may long be per
 mitted to pursue.
    The President then addressed Mr. Newport.
       .MR. NEWPORT,
    I am most happy that the important services you have rendered
 to Physiological Science have been again rewarded, and that the

     The President then called upon Mr. Christie to read thebiogra
 phical notices_
                  of some of the deceased Members, which he handed
 to him.                                                     -
     By the death of HENRY CHRISTIAN Scnnmscnna, on the 28th of
 last December,     at the age of 70 years, the Society has lost a valuable
 and amiable associate;       one who became the personal friend of all
 the scienti<U+FB01>c men with whom he had anything to do.            He was born
 in Holstein in 1780, of highly respectable parents; but losing his
 father early, he was placed under the care of the Pastor Dorfer, until
 his mother removed to Altona for the sake of educating her two
 sons.     The Gymnasium to which he was now sent was fortunately
presided over by Jacob Struve, father of the zealous Pulkova astro
nomer, who earnestly instructed his promising pupil both in classics
and mathematics; but being of a delicate constitution, young Schu
macber sought sedentary amusements, and was indulged in his par
tiality for mechanics, which he specially applied himself to in order
to satisfy his mind on the action of various instruments         connected
with astronomy.         Having gained the highest honours of the Gym
nasium, he now thought of studying the law, for which purpose he
repaired to Kiel; but in 1804, being recommended as tutor to a
noble family residing near Dorpat, his passion for mathematics
returned under the encouragement of Professor Pfafl', of the Uni
versity of that city, Whom he assisted during the short duration
of a work called the ‘ Astronomische Beytr'elge.’        In 1807, he took
his Doctor’s Degree, and returned to Altona, two years after which
he obtained the Danish Government’s           permission to complete his
studies at Go'ttingen under the celebrated Gaiiss, whose friendship
he enjoyed to his death.         But the year following he was appointed
Professor of Astronomy at Copenhagen; and in 1813, he had the
satisfaction of having an Observatory placed under his direction at
Mannheim.        In a couple of years more, however, he was promoted. to
that of Copenhagen, to <U+FB01>ll the vacancy occasioned by the death 0f
Professor Bugge.
    Schumacher’s active intelligence now led him to look around, in
order to ascertain what was transacting in Other countries ;—and he
accordingly obtained permission to visit France and England in 1819,
with his intimate friend Repsold of Hamburg, the eminent mecha.
nician ; and bene<U+FB01>ting by our great trigonometrical survey, even to
obtaining the loan of Ramsden’s Zenithssector. from the, English
Government, he commenced measuring thev Danish are, of the meri,
diau,'from L'auenbu'rg in Holstein northwards.         This service requi

                                   “6
ring his frequent absence from Copenhagen, he was allowed to
establish himself at Altona, and there build an Observatory           and
Museum of astronomical and geodesical instruments of all countries.
Although immersed in these duties, as well as in making various
chrouometric journeys for the express purpose of differentiating and
<U+FB01>xing longitudes, he steadily kept an eye on the scienti<U+FB01>c operations
of the rest of Europe ; and he visited at successive times his corre
spondents at Paris, Munich, Berlin, Vienna and Pulkova; besides a
frequent trip to Bremen to consult the truly philosophical Dr. Olbers,
and an annual journey to Copenhagen to report progress to his warm
patron Frederick Vl., and the equally friendly Christian VIII.
    At the age of 32, Schumacher married with judgement a lady of
good family, Christine Madelaine Schoon, who survives him; and
their family consists of three daughters and two sons, one of whom,
Richard, has already distinguished himself in astronomy.        "H '
    Professor Schumacher was polished in his manners, clieer<U+FB01>il‘ih
conversation, and could speak in German, Danish, Russian, Trench,
English and Italian. He was fond of drawing, a great adept in the game
of chess, remarkably punctual in all his occupations, unwearied‘ in 'his
application  to business,  neat in his computations,   and orderly'iavith
his instruments and books; while a re<U+FB01>ned mind pervaded'alf'fbi's
actions.    The bene<U+FB01>ts consequent on these habits spread wonderfully
 over his long succession of assistants, to whom his time and advice
were never denied, and of whom no fewer than sixteen now hold
 ostensible scienti<U+FB01>c posts.    During the late political struggle, the
principal scienti<U+FB01>c societies of Europe entreated the Danish Govern
ment to continue the Altona Observatory, as an establishment of pa
ramount value to the World; and so it appears to have been viewed
by the contending parties, for they both offered him their support.
 He died, however, before that very lamentable war had ceased; and
is succeeded by his worthy pupil Dr. Petersen.        But it will be dif
<U+FB01>cult to replace such a fulcrum of scienti<U+FB01>c intercourse as Schuma
cher proved to be; especially in establishing and continuing through
twenty-seven years, that cosmopolitan bond of intellectual union the
‘ Astronomische Nachrichten,’ of which, from his practical and theo
retical knowledge, and his philological attainments, he was perhaps
the most effective editor which Europe could have produced.           Be
sides this he published ‘ Géometrie der Stelling von Carnot,’ ‘ Samm
liing von Hiilfstafeln,’ ‘ Astronomische Hiilfstafeln,’ ' Astronomische
Abhaudlungen,’ and other works.
    Schumacher had been elected into most of the Scienti<U+FB01>c Societies
of the world, being thus honoured in America, Denmark, France, Ger
many, Great Britain, Italy, Russia, and Sweden ; and his date of elec
tion as a Foreign Member of this Society is 1821.       He also received
decorations of knighthood from Prussia, Russia, Sweden, France and
Belgium ; on which last order being conferred on him, that of Leopold,
for his connexion with the documents furnished by the Danish Go
vernment, he wrote to explain that the only participation he had
with Major Olsen’s surveys, was their resting on his triangulation.
But his scrupulous delicacy was overcome when he was'informed, in

                                         117
 reply, that it was rather the opportunity of honouring him that had
 been seized, for that the order had also been conferred on the Major.
 The latest favour he received from his own Sovereign, Christian the
 VllIth, was the Grand Cross of the Order of Dannebrog, and Danne
 brog’s Man; which distinction was accompanied with a very com
 plimentary letter, in which the monarch declared his esteem for
 literary and scienti<U+FB01>c merit.
     When Lord Northampton’s decease was             announced in a literary
journal (the Athenaeum*), it was remarked,           that “ though it sounds
like a truism to say that the union of science and station and ex
alted character in the same individual seldom fails to command
esteem,"--this truism was precisely the tribute which suggested
itself in this case. And it was no doubt true that esteem, produced
by the kindness, courtesy, truthfulness, fairness, and good sense of
his character, which qualities were made conspicuous by his rank,
and his frequent appearance in public, was the universal sentiment
entertained towards him; yet no one who knew him well could fail
also to admire his <U+FB01>ne intellect, richly cultured mind, and varied
knowledge, both of literature, science and art.           It was this union of
qualities, rarely found in the same person, which especially recom
mended him to your choice for ten successive years as President,
and endeared him to this Society, and to his extended circle of
friends and acquaintances.                                      .
     SPENCER Josnua ALWYNE COMPTON, Marquis and Earl of the
County of Northampton, was born on the 2nd of January 1790.                  He
was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and manifested a love for
literature and the classics, which be cultivated with an assiduity not
always found in men of his rank. He there not only laid the founda
tion of the accomplishments          and information which distinguished
him in after-life, but formed many friendships with eminent men,
now ornaments of this Society; and these friendships were not only
continued, but increased and strengthened during the remainder of
his life.
     On quitting the University, Lord Compton was returned to Par
liament as Member for the town of Northampton. Spencer Percival,
the Prime Minister of the day, was his near relative, and thus a
political career of eminence was within his grasp.            But a sense of
duty led him to join the opposition ranks; and being defeated at the
next Parliamentary election, he retired from the political <U+FB01>eld of the
House of Commons. Ldrd Compton associated himself at this period
with Wilberforce, and the noble and excellent men who devoted
themselves to the cause of Africa.           The same associations connected
him with Sir James Mackintosh as a criminal law reformer.
     In 1815 he married Miss M‘Cleod Clephane, daughter and heiress
of General Clephane, a lady whose native and original genius had
been matured by the most careful cultivation.            She was at an early
age a favourite of Walter Scott, who was delighted with her genius
    * The biographical notice in the Athenae‘um which was thus prefaced has been
freely used on the present occasion.

                                     118
   and her love of poetry.    Among many and consummate accomplish
   ments, her poetical talent was perhaps her most remarkable gift.
  Lord and Lady Compton travelled in Italy, and the houses which
  they successively occupied in that beautiful land were the centres
  of attraction for re<U+FB01>ned and intelligent travellers.      Lord Compton
  also interfered actively and effectively on behalf of some of the un
 fortunate Italians who fell under the severe measures of authority
 both in Lombardy and at Naples.         For years Italy was the favourite
 residence of this, excellent English family, and for years they might
 be pointed out to foreigners with pride as representatives of the British
 Aristocracy.      But the greatest of all domestic calamities was im
 pending.      In 1830 Lord and Lady Northampton, who had succeeded
 to the honours of the family in 1828, were residing at Rome, when
 by a most sudden and overwhelming calamity he found himself a
 widower.       Lord Northampton removed his family to England at
 once, and at his noble seat of Castle Ashby he devoted himself to the
 education of his children, and the cultivation of literature and
 science.
     In 1830 he joined this Society, and his connexion with it is un.
 doubtedly one of the most remarkable features of his life.     When the
Duke of Sussex resigned the Presidency, the feeling was general
 that he was a. <U+FB01>t person to succeed his Royal Hi hness.          Though
 his scienti<U+FB01>c attainments might not be profound,         e was an ardent
 lover of science, and testi<U+FB01>ed his love by gathering around him all
 those who had distinguished themselves in its various departments.
 He was elected President in November 1838, and annually re-elected
 until November 1848. During his term of of<U+FB01>ce, with few excep
 tions, he was always in his place at the Meetings of the Council, and
his attention to the business that came on, fairness, and good humour,
were worthy of all praise.
     The Soirées which he gave in his capacity of President were at
 tended by all the rank and science in the country; and their in
<U+FB02>uence upon the world generally was of the happiest nature. Perhaps
 we may regard the labours of men of science respecting magnetism,
and especially the establishment of a connected system of magnetic
observations over the greater part of the earth’s surface, as one Of
the principal subjects which employed the Royal Society during his
Presidentship; and the applications of Lord Northampton to the
government on this subject were assiduously made and were always
favourably received.
     Lord Northampton had paid especial attention to geology and
mineralogy. He was the discoverer of a new mineral in the lava of
Vesuvius, which was after him named Comptonite. He commu
nicated to the Geological Society a description of the Basaltic Rooks
of'the Isle of
                   Mull, with which place, so remarkable both by its
scenery and its geology, he was especially connected: and at a later
period (in 1838) he made to the Geological Society another com
munication on Spirolites in Chalk and Chalk <U+FB01>ints, the objects so
distinguished
 '                being extremely minute organic fossils.
     The British Association for the Advancement of Science was one

                                   119
of the <U+FB01>elds in which Lord Northampton’s scienti<U+FB01>c zeal and know
ledge, and the admirable qualities which enabled him to conciliate
opposing views while he maintained the authority of rule and disci
pline, were seen to eminent advantage.      He showed himself ready,
upon multiplied occasions, and on the most sudden and unexpected
emergencies, to give to that Association the bene<U+FB01>t of his time, his
talents, and his energy.    This is not the occasion to enumerate his
great services to that body, but the cause of the promotion of science
which we have in common with that body, and the general sympathy
prevailing between this Society and the Association, as shown by the
number of our members who take a leading part in the Meetings of
the Association, have made it allowable to say so much on a subject
which Lord Northampton had very much at heart, and to which on
several occasions he referred in his addresses.
   Archaeology was another of Lord Northampton’s studies, to which
hedevoted much time.       He was in the habit of travelling, both in
England and in foreign countries, with the purpose of seeing, draw~
ing, and annotating the most remarkable specimens of ancient, and
especially of Gothic architecture.   He accumulated in this way very
considerable stores of drawings and notes, some of the results of
which be circulated among his friends in various forms.          These
pursuits led him to take a lively interest in the Archaeological
Association, which was established on a plan similar to the British
Association, and which afterwards separated into two bodies, to one
of which, the Archaeological Institute, he continued to render great
services at its annual meetings.
   Lord Northampton’s acquaintance with literature was various and
extensive, and some poems of his printed in a publication called the
'
  Tribute,’ under circumstances which marked his considerate bene
volence, are graceful evidences of his poetical feeling.   His literary
merits were recognised by his election to succeed Mr. Hallam as
President of the Royal Society of Literature, which of<U+FB01>ce he held
at the time of his death.    Lord Northampton was also a Trustee of
the British Museum.
   Besides the Writings and publications which we have already
noticed, he published at the time of the discussions respecting the
Reform Bill, a pamphlet written in a tone of philosophical moderation
and political wisdom, as probably even those would allow who did
not agree with his views.     The work was a letter addressed to Mr.
 Spring Rice, now Lord Monteagle, one of his oldest and nearest
friends ; and recommended a change in the law so that seats in the
House of Commons should not be vacated by acceptance of of<U+FB01>ce.
The measure was however rejected by Parliament.
   Lord Northampton’s health was habitually delicate. For many
years he had been afflicted bya spitting of blood ; and on more than
 one occasion he had been obliged to retire from active life arid
 England to repose in southern climates.     His last tour abroad was
 made in company-with his son-in-law, the late Viscount Alford, who
 was recommended to spend a winter in the cast for the bene<U+FB01>t of
                                                          9*

                                      120
his health.      The change did not produce the hoped result. Lord
Alford gradually sank; and his death proved too great a shock to
the naturally sensitive temperament of Lord Northampton.               He
expired only a few days after the decease of his son-in-law, at his
seat of Castle Ashby, on the 16th of January, surrounded by all the
members of his family except a son, who was with his regiment in
India.
    It is difficult to abstain from dwelling longer on Lord Northamp
ton’s admirable gifts and accomplishments,         and still more, on his
virtues. He was full of kindness and benevolence for all who came
under his notice, and seemed to be absolutely incapable of injustice
or unfairness; and though a most clear-sighted judge of intellectual,
scienti<U+FB01>c and artistical excellence, was with dif<U+FB01>culty, if at all, moved
to harshness towards shallow and petulant pretensions.            He was
zealous for the promotion of art as well as science in his native
country; and even in the last days of his life his thoughts and his
pen were engaged on a plan connected with that object.
    Tnomas GALLOWAY, Esq., late a Member of the Council of this
 Society, died of disease of the heart on the 1st of November, at his
residence in 'l‘orrington Square, and was buried at Kensal Green.
    Mr. Galloway was born in the Upper Ward of Lanarkshire, on
 the 26th of February, 1796. his father being a farmer, and his
 grandfather a mechanical engineer.         He was educated at the parish
 school of his neighbourhood, at the Academy of New Lanark, and
 the University of Edinburgh; at which last he entered in November
  1812, and continued there eight sessions.       At <U+FB01>rst he was mostly
 devoted to classical     studies, but turned to mathematics  as a special
 pursuit by the encouragement and teaching of the late Professor
 Wallace.
     His <U+FB01>rst publication, probably, was the article on Pendulums in
 Brewster’s Cyclopaadia, about 1821 ; and he afterwards wrote
 various scientific articles in Leybourn’s Repository and the Ency
 clopzedia Britannica, and he moreover published a special work on
 'Probabilities.’     In the year 1823, he was elected Teacher in the
 Royal Military College at Sandhurst, where his accuracy of know
 ledge and business-like habits rendered him both ef<U+FB01>cient and
 popular.
     In 1831, he married a daughter of his friend Professor Wallace;
 and in November 1832, he was selected for further consideration out
 of all the Candidates for the Chair of Natural Philosophy in the
 University of Edinburgh, by the Town Council, with Sir David
 Brewster and Professor Forbes ; when the latter was elected.         But
in the year following he was called to undertake the important of<U+FB01>ce
 of Register, that is, in modern language, Actuary of the Amicable
 Life Assurance Of<U+FB01>ce, the oldest Institution of the kind; the duties
 of which he ably conducted to the day of his regretted death.
    The gentlemen present will remember that Mr. Galloway was
 the author of an excellent paper on the ‘Proper Motion of the

                                         121
  Solar System,’ which was published in the Philosophical Transactions
  for 1847;     and for which the Royal Medal was awarded to him.
 This interesting discussion was occasioned by Professor Argelander's
 having published an opinion on the probable situation in space
 towards which the sun is at present advancing.          The inference thus
 drawn, was from an investigation of the proper motions of stars in
 the northern hemisphere ; and Mr. Galloway was induced to inquire
 into the same question by a direct comparison of the positions of
 stars determined by Lacaille, with the recent Catalogues of Messrs.
 Johnson and Henderson, in the Southern hemisphere ;—a consider
 able number of which appear to have very appreciable proper
 motions.      This argument he entered into thoroughly, and with a
 neat and expressive mathematical computation; but he concluded,
 that the data were not yet suf<U+FB01>ciently numerous to warrant any
 speculation with respect to the nature of the path which the sun
 describes in space.
    Mr. Galloway was also the author of two valuable papers which
'were communicated to the Royal Astronomical Society, of which
 he was for some years a distinguished Secretary.         The <U+FB01>rst of these,
 on the Application of the Method of Least Squares to the determi
 nation of the most probable errors of observation in a portion of the
 Ordnance Survey of England, was published in the Astronomical
 Memoirs for 1846: the second was on the present state of our
 knowledge relative to Shooting Stars, and on the determinations of
 differences of longitude from observations of those meteors,-a
subject which he treated with his usual research and accuracy.
    On the motion of Sir R. H. Inglis, Bart., seconded by Sir R. I.
Murchison, the best thanks of the Society were tendered to the
President for his excellent Address, and his Lordship was requested
to permit the same to be printed and circulated among the Society.
    The Statutes relating to the election of Of<U+FB01>cers and Council
having been read, and Mr. G. R. Porter and Mr. S. P. Pratt having,
with the consent of the Society, been nominated Scrutators, the
votes of the Fellows present were collected.

         COLONEL SABINE, R.A., V.P.           & Treas., in the Chair.
      The Chairman announced that the President had appointed the
   following gentlemen Vice-Presidents: Col. Sabine, R.A., the Rev.
   Prof. Challis, Charles Giles Bridle Daubeny, M.D., the Very Rev.
   the Dean of Ely, Sir John Fred. Wm. Herschel, Bart, and William
   Spence, Esq.
      The reading of Dr. Faraday’s paper, entitled “ Experimental Re
   searches in Electricity.    Twenty-eighth Series.   On Lines of Mag
   netic Force; their de<U+FB01>nite character; and their distribution within
   a Magnet and through Space,” which was commenced on the 27th
   November,    was resumed and concluded.
      The author de<U+FB01>nes    a line of magnetic force to be that described
   by a very small magnetic needle, when it is so moved, in either
   direction correspondent to its length, as to remain constantly a
   tangent to the line of motion; or as that along which if a transverse
   wire be moved in either direction, there is no tendency to the forma
  tion of an electric current in the wire, whilst if moved in any other
  direction there'is such a tendency.        Such lines are indicated by
  iron <U+FB01>lings sprinkled about a magnet.        These lines have a deter
   minate direction; they have opposite qualities in and about this di
  rection, and the forces in any part of them are determinate for a given
   magnet.    They may, as the author thinks, be employed with great
   advantage to represent the magnetic force as to its nature, condi
  tion, direction, and comparative amount; and that in many cases
  when other representations of the force, as centres of action, will
  not apply.
      The term line of force, as de<U+FB01>ned above, is restricted to mean no
  more than the condition of the force in a given place, as to strength
  and direction; and not to include any idea of the nature of the
  physical cause of the phenomena: at the same time if reason should
  arise to think that the physical condition of the force partakes ge
  nerally of the nature of a current or of a ray, a view which the
  author inclines to, he sees no objection in the term, any more than
  to the terms current and ray, as they are used in considerations
  regarding electricity and light, because it may accord with such a
  view.
      The lines of magnetic force, as de<U+FB01>ned above, may be recognized
  either by a magnetic needle or by a moving wire; but the two
  methods are founded on very different conditions and actions of the
  magnetic force, and the moving wire appears to have the largest
  application. Its principle can be applied in places which are inac
  cessible to the needle, and it can sum up the forces in a given plane
'
  or surface at any distance from the central magnet.       It has no re
  ference to results of attraction or repulsion, and in some cases is
  opposed to them; but the author thinks it gives a true view of the
  disposition of the magnetic powers, and leads, and will lead to a
  more correct understanding      of the nature of the force.   For these
  reasons he advocates its adoption, not to the exclusion of the needle,

                                    129
but in conjunction with it; and proceeds to develope the experi
mental methods and their results, and <U+FB01>rst in the case of a bar
magnet.
    Two bar magnets, each 12 inches long, 1 inch in width, and 0'4
of an inch in thickness, were <U+FB01>xed, side by side, a little apart, with
like ends in the same direction, on and parallel to an axis, so that
they might act as one bar magnet and be revolved at pleasure about
the common axial line.         A wire, which entering at one pole was
carried along the axis of the magnetic arrangement, was at the
centre turned outwards at the equatorial "part, and then made to
return at a distance outside the magnet to the place from whence it
commenced.        At times this wire was in three parts; the axial part
being one; a radial part extending from the centre to the surface at
the equator and there connected with a copper ring surrounding the
magnet, being another ; and the part from this ring on the outside of
the magnet, back to the place of commencement, being the third;
and each of these could revolve either separately or in conjunction
with the other parts, the electric contact being complete in all the
cases, whilst the wire was insulated from the magnet by the cover
ing of silk.     The ends of this loop, as it may be called, were con
nected with a galvanometer, and thus the presence or absence of
electric currents ascertained, and their amount measured.          Two
galvanometers were used; one by Ruhmkor<U+FB01>“, containing <U+FB01>ne wire,
and very delicate in its action ; the other, constructed by the author,
of copper wire 02 of an inch thick, passing only once round each
needle; this, for abundant currents of low intensity, such as those
generated in the moving wire, was found many-fold more delicate
in its indications than the former.
    The general relations of a moving wire to the magnetic lines of
force are then speci<U+FB01>ed, and a reference is made to their discovery and
description by the author in the First Series of these Experimental
Researches; and the law of the evolution of the induced electrical
current is given.      Referring to an easy natural standard, it may be
said, that if a person in these latitudes, where the lines of force dip
 69 degrees,    as shown by the dipping-needle, move forward with
arms extended, then the direction of an electric current which would
tend to be produced in a wire represented by the arms, would be
from the right hand through the arms and body to the left.
    It will be seen, upon a little consideration, that a wire which
touches a regular bar magnet at one end, and is then continued
through the air until it touches it again at the equator, if moved
ouce round the magnet, slipping at the equator contact so as to
resume its <U+FB01>rst position at the end of the revolution, will have in
tersected, once, all the lines of force external to the magnet, and
neither more nor less, whatever its course through the air, or
 distance in parts from the magnet, may be. Now when the external
part of the loop above described is moved in this manner a certain
 number of degrees round the axis of the magnet, the latter being
 still, a current of electricity in a given direction is shown by the
 galvauometer; and the proper precautions (which are described)

                                    130
being taken, the current is of the same amount for the same number
of degrees of revolution, whether the motion be quicker or slower,
or whether the wire be at a greater or a less distance in its course
from the magnet.
    If the external part of the loop be retained <U+FB01>xed, as also the axial
part, and the magnet with the short radial part of the wire be
revolved, an electric current is again produced, of a strength exactly
equal to the former for the same number of degrees of revolution;
but its direction is the reverse of the <U+FB01>rst current, when the direction
of revolution is the same. In either case, reversing the direction of
the revolution reverses the current produced by it.        The moving
radial part of the wire is in this case insulated from the magnet.
and many other experiments, as with discs at the ends of the magnet,
show, that the motion of the magnet itself is indi<U+FB02>‘ereut;       and that
whether it revolve or is still, provided the wire move, the result ii
the same.      When the radial wire or part of the loop, and the ex
 ternal part move together, then their effects exactly neutralize each
other, as they ought to do, being in contrary directions, for the
 same revolution; and not the slightest trace of a current under the
 extremest conditions of motion, or of the experiment, can be per
 ceived.    Such is the case, whatever the course or distance of the
 external part of the loop may be, or even when the loop is altogether
 external to the magnet, but moving at the same angular velocity
 either with or around it.
     When the axial part of the loop is revolved it produces no e<U+FB01>'ect ;
 neither if this part revolve or [be still does it produce the least
 in<U+FB02>uence on any of the results already described; it acts simply as
 a conductor,    and is in other respects perfectly indi<U+FB02>‘erent.     This
 axial wire may be replaced by the magnet itself; for when it exists
 only from the magnetic pole outwards, and when the radial wire
 has contact with the magnets at the centre, so as to complete the
 electric circuit, the results are exactly the same as before; or the
 axial wire may proceed to the centre and then make contact with
 the magnet, and the radial wire be removed; when precisely the
 same results occur 1 or both axial and radial parts may be removed,
 the magnet serving both for conductor and moving radius, and still
 the results are unchanged.
     From such results as these, the author draws the following con.
 clusions, in relation to the lines of magnetic force as de<U+FB01>ned at the
 commencement.        The amount of magnetic force (as shown by the
  electric current evolved) is determinate; and the same for the same
 lines of force, whatever the distance of the point or plane on which
  their power is exerted is from the magnet: or it is the same in any
 two or more sections of the same lines of force.        There is no loss
 or destructibility, or evanescence or latent state of the magnetic
 power.     Convergence or divergence of the lines of force causes no
 difference in the amount of their power.       Obliquity of intersection
 causes nodifference.     In an equal <U+FB01>eld of magnetic force the elect
tricity evolved is proportionate to the time of motion. or to the
velocity of motion, or to the amount of lines of force intersected

                                    131
     The internal state of the magnet is then examined by means of
 the results obtained with the radial wire, or the moving magnet
 when the latter makes part of the circuit; and the conclusion'is
 arrived at, that there are within the magnet lines of magnetic force
 as de<U+FB01>ned as, and exactly equal in amount to, those outside of it;
 that these are continuations of the former; and that every line of
 magnetic force, whatever distance it may extend to from a magnet,
 (and in principle that is in<U+FB01>nite,) is a closed curve, which in some
 part of its course passes through the magnet in conformity with
 what is called its polarity.
    A current being thus induced in a closed wire. when it travels
‘across magnetic lines of force, an inquiry is next made into .the
 effect of altering the mass or diameter of the wire, and another form
 of apparatus is employed, in which loops of wire are made to inter~
 sect a given amount of lines; each loop consisting of a given length
 of wire, but either of wires of different diameter, or of one or more
 wires of the same diameter.      The conclusion arrived at is, that the
 current or amount of electricity evolved is not simply as the space
 occupied by the breadth of the wire correspondent to the direction
 of the line of force, which has relation to the polarity of the power;
 nor by that width or dimension of it which includes the number or
 amount of lines of force intersected, and which, corresponding to
 the direction of the motion, has relation to the equatorial condition
 of the lines; but is jointly as the two, or as the mass of the wire.
    The moving wire was next surrounded by different media, as air, . -
 cohol, water, oil of turpentine, 810., but the result was the same in all.
    Wires of different metals were used, and results in accordance
 with those obtained and described in the Second Series of these
 Researches were obtained : the conclusion is, that the current excited
 appears to be directly as the conducting power of the substance
 employed.     It has no particular reference to the magnetic character
 of the body; for iron comes between tin and platinum, presenting no
 other distinction than that due to conducting power, and di<U+FB01>‘ering
 far less from these metals than they do from metals not magnetic.
    Magnetic polarity then comes under consideration.          The author
 understands    by this phrase, the opposite and antithetical actiono
 which are manifest at the opposite ends, or the opposite sides, of a
.limited portion of a line of force.        He. is of opinion that these
 qualities, or conditions, are not shown with certainty in every case,
 by attractions and repulsions; thus a solution of sulphate of iron
 will be attracted by a magnetic pole if surrounded by a solution
 weaker than itself, as shown in former researches on diamagnetic
 and paramagnetic action; but if surrounded by a solution stronger
 than itself it will be repelled. Yet the direction of the lines of force
 passing through it and the surrounding media cannot be reversed in
 these two cases, and therefore the polarity remains the same.         The
 moving wire however shows, in similar cases, the true polarity or
  direction of the forces; and for an application of its principles, in
 this respect, to the metals, an apparatus is described               discs
 of different metals can be revolved between the poles obir'which
                                                              a horse-shoe

                                       132
magnet and the electric currents evolved in them carried o<U+FB01>’ to the
 galvanometer.      Now, whether the discs be of paramagnetic or die.
 magnetic metals, whether of iron, or bismuth, or copper, or tin, or
lead, the direction of the current produced shows, that the lines of
magnetic force passing through the metals is the same in all the
cases, and hence the polarity within them the same.
    The author then gives a more explicit meaning, in accordance
with the de<U+FB01>nition of line of magnetic force contained in this paper,
to some of the expressions used in the three last series ofrhis
Researches on Magnetic Condition, Atmospheric Magnetism, &c.:
and by referring to former results obtained since the year 1830,,
illustrates how much the idea of lines of force has in<U+FB02>uenced the
course of his investigations,      and the results obtained at different
times, and the extent to which he has been indebted to it; and then,
recommending       for many special reasons the mode of examining
magnetic forces by the aid of a moving conductor, he brings for the
present his subject to a conclusion.

    The following papers were read :—
     “ A Proof (by means of a
                                  series) that every Number is composed
 of 4 Square Numbers, or less, without reference to the properties of
 Prime Numbers.”         By Sir Frederick Pollock, Lord Chief Baron,
 F.R.S.     &c.  Received December       18.
    The paper contains a proof, that if every number of the form
  8n+4 is composed of 4 odd squares, then every number whatever
 must be composed of 4 square numbers or less; also a proof of the
 converse of this, viz. that if every number is composed of 4 square
 numbers or less, then every number of the form 8n+4 must be com
 posed of 4 odd squares.
     It is then proposed to show that every number of the form 811 +4
 is composed of 4 odd squares, by taking a number of the form 8n +4,
 viz. an odd square +3, and showing that 8n+4 in that case is
 divisible into 4 odd squares (other than the odd squareand l, 1, 1);
 thus 16n9i8n+1 is a form that includes every odd square, and
 16n‘~’-_1_-8n+4 is divisible into
                                 4119i 4n + 1,

 8is   then added, and the sum is shown to be still divisible into 4 odd
 squares ; and again 8, and so on, until by successive additions of
 8+8+ 8, &c., the quantity added to 16n‘1i 8n becomes equal to the
original term with which the operation commenced.                 The odd
squares +3 form the series 4, 12, ‘28. 52, 84, &c.; and if the suc

                                    133
 cessive additions reach the third or some higher term, and also if
 the sum added to 16)].“1i87l be equal to the term with which the
 operation commenced, it is contended the following term may be
 attained, and so on, and eVery number of the form 8n+4 will be
 composed of 4 odd squares.      The paper concludes by a suggestion
 that the method is applicable to several other similar problems.
        “ On the Valves of the Heart.”
    2.                                       By W. Savory,4Esq.      Com
 municated by Edward Stanley, Esq., F.R.S.            Received September
 30, 1852.
    The paper contains observations upon the structure and connections
 of the auriculo-ventricular and arterial valves of the human heart, which
the author thinks will assist in explaining their nature and functions.
    The relation of the " four ori<U+FB01>ces ” in the base of the heart is ex
amined, and it is shown that the aortic and left auriculo-ventricular
apertures are not separated as the others are; that no muscular
tissue of the ventricle intervenes between them, but that when the
auricles and great vessels are separated from the ventricles (which
maybe accomplished with facility after prolonged boiling), the aortic
aperture is separated from the left auriculo-ventricular only by the
anterior mitral valve; and when this is removed (or even while it re
mains), it is plainly seen that only one aperture exists whose borders
are formed by the muscular tissue of the ventricle, and in shape
somewhat resembling the <U+FB01>gure 8. This is divided into two por
tions, an anterior (aortic) and posterior (auriculo-ventricular) by the
anterior mitral valve, and above it, by the posterior wall of the aorta,
into which is inserted a large portion of the anterior wall of the left
auricle, but no muscular tissue of the ventricle intervenes.
    When the auricles and vessels are removed, it is seen that the
three ori<U+FB01>ces are bounded by thick and convex borders formed by
the bases of the ventricles.      Those on the left side are broadest;
the di<U+FB01>'erenCe between the two sides corresponding with the differ
ence in thickness between the walls of the ventricles.         The forma
tion of these muscular borders, and the general arrangement and
direction of the muscular <U+FB01>bres at these parts, is examined.           The
<U+FB01>bres forming the walls of the ventricles          converge around these
apertures.     The most super<U+FB01>cial <U+FB01>bres may be traced up from the
walls of the ventricles, curving obliquely over the convex border,
and having their extremities, for the most part, <U+FB01>xed around the
ori<U+FB01>ces.     We may remove these <U+FB01>bres. layer after layer, and still
<U+FB01>nd the same arrangement to obtain, the deeper <U+FB01>bres lying more
transversely and obliquely intersecting those above and below.
    If now the auricles and great vessels which have been detached are
replaced in their natural situation, it is observed that the auricles
 are connected with the inner surface of these convex borders, while
 the walls of the'vessels pass down on to the outer surface.          This
'fact is an important one when viewed in connection with the valves,
and will be presently considered.       In the mean time it may be re
 marked, that the formation of the auriculo-ventricular grooves in
'which the coronary vessels lie, is explained.           These vessels are
 Paocnnnmcs or run ROYAL Socrs'rr.             Von. V1. No. 85.       to

  found in the angle between the border of the ventricles and them!“
 of the auricles.
     The nature of the <U+FB01>brous zones or tendinous circles surrounding
 the ori<U+FB01>ces is examined.      These rings are in especial relation with
 the valves, being closely connected with their attached bases, and
 are not such distinct and independent structures as they have been
 hitherto considered.     After referring to some previous descriptions
 of the arterial tendinous rings, the author attempts to show that
 what has been described as the upper and thickened festooned border,
 is the result of the attachment of the bases of the valves to the arte
 rial coat, and is formed by an intimate union of the <U+FB01>brous tissue
 composing the valves with the elastic coat of the artery.
     (1) [These festooned borders correspond exactly with the attached
 bases of the valves, and hence their shape. (2) They are thickest and
 most strongly marked at the angle formed by the junction of two
 valves, to which point the bands of <U+FB01>brous tissue in the valves eon!
 verge.    (3) The microscope shows these festooned rings to be com
 posed of a mixture of the white <U+FB01>brous with the yellow elastic tissue,
 an arrangement naturally to be expected from an intimate union of
 the tendinous tissue of the valve with the arterial coat.
     The structure, connections and relations of the valves is examined
 chie<U+FB02>y by means of vertical sections carried through their centres
 and adjacent parts.      Such sections of the arterial valves disclose an
 important relation which they have with the upper border of the
 ventricles.    The aorta and pulmonary artery. expanding towards
 their termination, are situated upon the outer edge of the ventricular
 border before described; the consequence of which arrangement                     is,
 that the portion of valve adjacent to the vessel passes over and rests
 upon the muscularsubstance, and        supported upon the innerborder of
                                         is
 the free edge of the ventricles surrounding the arterial ori<U+FB01>ces. This
 arrangement, in consequence of the small size of the parts,            not sois
 obvious at the <U+FB01>rst glance in the human heart, but           more strikingly
                                                                   is
 shown in an examination of the heart of any one of the larger
 animals. This appears of importance when viewed in connection
 with the functions of the valves.      The re<U+FB02>ux of the blood               is
                                                                       said to
 be sustained by the festooned rings at the base of the valves, but in
 fact-they are thinnest at this very part, corresponding to the central

 walls of the right ventricle are considerably thinner than those of the
 left, the muscular <U+FB02>oor of these valves is much narrower than in
 the anterior acrtic valve.      All this is of course seen on a much
larger scale in the hearts ofthe larger animals, as the Horse and
 Ox; and here, where the muscular <U+FB02>oor of the valves (more espe
cially the anterior aortic) is of very considerable breadth, the ten-
dinous tissue of the valve may be traced over the muscular surface
to form the wall of the vessel.
     In the larger Ruminants there are found two considerable por
tions of bone, partly surrounding the ori<U+FB01>ce of the aorta, and smaller
irregular fragments are occasionally observed between the principal
pieces. The larger portions vary much in size and shape in different
hearts even of the same species.          They are usually elongated and
curved.      The chief bone, which exceeds the other considerably in
size, embraces the whole of the right side, and the right half of the
back part of the ori<U+FB01>ce of the aorta; while the little bone, not gene
rally found in the smaller Ruminants, as the Sheep, its place being
occupied by a portion of dense <U+FB01>brous tissue, extends from the middle
of the left side round to the posterior part, where it more or less
nearly joins the extremity of the larger bone.        Thus the lateral and
posterior portions of the aortic ori<U+FB01>ce are surrounded by <U+FB01>rm bony
arches meeting posteriorly in the centre.         From the large bone, a
small process usually passes backwards for some distance into the
muscular substance of the septum between the ventricles, and is
gradually 10st in the dense <U+FB01>brous tissue found in this part, sur
rounding the right border of the left auriculo-ventricular aperture;
and from the convex surface of the smaller portion, a thin process of
dense <U+FB01>brous tissue is continued round the left margins of the auri
culo-ventricular ori<U+FB01>ce.      These heart-bones areintimately connected
above with the middle coat of the aorta, on the inner surface with
the base of the adjacent arterial valves, and posteriorly with the an
terior mitral valve; while at the sides, to their external and inferior
surfaces, the muscular <U+FB01>bres of the ventricle are attached.            They
may be seen and felt in the base of the pouches formed by the two
posterior aortic valves, and no doubt greatly assist. in sustaining the
“
    forcelof the re<U+FB02>ux.” They occupy the position of the two posterior
festoons of the aortic valves.       In the human heart, in the situation

 <U+FB01>bres may be seen, particularly after the addition of acetic acid,
 which of course assists greatly in bringing them into view.
     Muscular <U+FB01>bres have not been found in the arterial valves.
     The structure and connections of the auriculo-ventricular valves
  are next examined by means of vertical sections.         In tracing down
  the muscular wall of the auricle, it is observed to pass on to the
  inner surface of the ventricular border, and if minutely examined is'
  seen to terminate by two attachments.        The external portion, which
  is considerably    the larger, is closely connected with the <U+FB01>brous
  structure forming the “ auriculo-ventricular ring,” while the thinner
  internal portion is continued forwards for a very short distance be
  tween the surfaces of the valve, and terminates more or less abruptly
  by an attachment to its tendinous tissue.         This is generally best
   seen in one of the tricuspid valves, where, in a vertical section, the
  muscular <U+FB01>bres may be observed terminating beneath its upper sur-
  face immediately beyond its attachment to the ring. In the posterior
   mitral valve the muscular <U+FB01>bres seldom penetrate so far forwards,.
  and this appears to result, when a section of the parts is examined,
  from the much greater thickness and density of the lining membrane
  of the left auricle.
     The connections of the anterior mitral valve, being peculiar, re
  quire a. separate consideration.     ,In dissecting down between the
  anterior wall of the left auricle and the posterior surface of the
  aorta, it is seen that the central <U+FB01>bres of the auricular wall are closely
  attached to the adjacent wall of the vessel.      A little further dissec
  tion on either side will show that the muscular substance of the left
  ventricle is de<U+FB01>cient between these parts.      At the sides indeed it is
  found, but is gradually lost at some distance from the mesial line.
  Hence these two ori<U+FB01>ces (the aortic and left auriculo-ventricular)
  are not separated as the others are by the intervention of the muscular
  <U+FB01>bres of the ventricle.    The structure and connections of the ante
  rior mitral valve are examined by means of a vertical section, in
  cluding the posterior wall of the aorta and the anterior wall of the
 left auricle. If the lining,r membrane of the auricle be traced down
 wards, it is found to be directly continued on to the posterior surface
 of the valve, and the membrane on the anterior surface of the valve
 is continued upwards over the tendinous festooned ring of the aorta,
 on to the under surface of its seinilunar valves. The anterior mitral
 valve lies beneath a portion of the two posterior arterial valves
 The muscular wall of the auricle is observed to terminate by two
 distinct insertions. The anterior (the larger) division of <U+FB01>bres is
attached to the posterior surface of the aorta, opposite to, and belbw
the festooned ring, while the posterior portion is continued directly
downwards for a short distance into the valve, and terminates by an
attachment to its <U+FB01>brous tissue.         The posterior wall of the aorta.
descends nearly vertically. Suddenly becoming much thinner oppo
site the upper border of the semilunar valve, it is continued down
to the festooned ring, or in other words, it here becomes blended
with the base of the semilunar valves. Below this a dense layer of'
<U+FB01>brous tissue (which exists below, and <U+FB01>lls up the spaces between;

                                     137
 the attached bases of the semilunar valves) descends for some di
  stance into the anterior mitral valve, immediately behind its anterior
 surface.    It is by a close attachment to the posterior surface of this
 layer that the muscular <U+FB01>bres of the auricular wall which descend
 into the valve, terminate.       This layer of <U+FB01>brous tissue, however,
 may be generally traced downwards into the valve farther than the
 muscular <U+FB01>bres.
     The boundary, then, between the aortic and auricular apertures
is formed above the mitral valve by the posterior wall of the aorta,
terminating at its junction with the bases of the semilunar valves,
and immediately below the posterior surface of which is attached
the greater portion of the muscular <U+FB01>bres forming the anterior wall
vof the left auricle.   The extremities of the two bones which in ru
minants replace a portion of the lateral and posterior divisions of
 the “festooned ring,” nearly meeting in the centre, behind, give
 additional support to the structures entering into the formation of
 the mitral valve.
    In examining the structure and connections of the auriculo-ventri
cular valves, it is noticed that a considerable portion of tendinous
<U+FB01>bres pass from the insertions of the cords, through the valves, to
the zones, and many of the smaller cords pass up directly into the
angle formed between the under surface of the valve and the inner
 surface of the ventricle, and at once enter into the formations of the
 <U+FB01>brous zones. These cords are short, and many of them spring from
 the wall of the ventricle, behind the valve.       Therefore it results,
 that these zones are densest and most strongly marked in those
portions corresponding to the attached borders of the valves, and
 gradually become less distinct towards the intervals between them.
Hence the greater portion of the auriculo-ventricular zones is more
properly to be considered in connection with the valves.
    The <U+FB01>bres of elastic tissue exist in the auriculo-ventricular valves,
but more sparingly than in the arterial valves.
    The many contradictory statements which have been advanced
concerning the existence of muscular <U+FB01>bres in the auriculo-ventri
cular valves, may perhaps be explained by a consideration of the
mode in which the muscular <U+FB01>bres of the auricles terminate, which
has been already described.         The internal <U+FB01>bres which have been
mentioned, descending from the auricular ‘walls into the valves just
beyond their attached margins, may be traced to a greater distance
in some cases than in others.        They generally terminate by a tole
rably well—de<U+FB01>ned margin, but this varies.         They usually descend
for a greater distance between the layers of the anterior mitral valve,
immediately beneath its auricular surface; but even here they are
seldom found stretching far into the valve, not terminating, however,
so   abruptly.
    Therefore, if- a portion of the attached border of a valve imme
diately below its upper surface be examined, muscular <U+FB01>bres in
abundance will generally be detected; whereas if sought for in any
other portion of the valve far from its attached border, according' to
 the foregoing observations, they will not be found.

       COLONEL SABINE, R.A., V.P.            and Treas., in the Chair.
      Charles Wheatstone Esq., F.R.S., delivered the Bakerian Lecture,
  being    the substance of his paper entitled, “Contributions       to the
  Physiology of Vision.—-Part II. On some remarkable, and hitherto
  unobserved, phenomena of Binocular Vision,-—(continued).”             Re
  ceived January 8.
      The <U+FB01>rst part of these researches was communicated to the Royal
  Society in 1838, and published in the Philosophical Transactions for
  that year.
      The second part, now presented, commences with an account of
  some remarkable illusions which occur when the usual relations
  which subsist between the magnitude of the pictures on the retinas
  and the degree of inclination of the optic axes are disturbed.      Under
  the ordinary circumstances of vision, when an object changes its
  distance from the observer, the magnitude of the pictures on the re
  tinae increases at the same time that the inclination of the optic axes
  becomes greater, and vice versd, and the perceived magnitude of the
  object remains the same. The author wished to ascertain what
  would take place by causing the optic axes to assume every degree
  of convergence while the magnitude of the pictures on the retinas
  remained the same; and, on the other hand, the phenomena which
  would be exhibited by maintaining the inclination of the optic axes
  constant while the magnitude of the pictures on the retinae continu
  ally changed.     To e<U+FB01>ect these purposes, he constructed a modi<U+FB01>cation
  of his re<U+FB02>ecting stereoscope ; in this instrument two similar pictures
  are placed, on moveable arms, each opposite its respective mirror;
  these arms move round a common centre in such manner, that, how
  ever they are placed, the re<U+FB02>ected images of each picture in the mir
  rors remains constantly at the same distance from the eye by which
  it is viewed ; the pictures are also capable of sliding along these arms,
   so that they may be simultaneously      brought nearer to, or removed
  further from, the mirrors. When the pictures remain at the same
   distance and the arms are removed round their centre, the re<U+FB02>ected
  images, while their distances from the eyes remain unchanged, are
  displaced, so that a di<U+FB02>’erent inclination of the optic axes is required
  to cause them to coincide.       When the arms remain in the same
  positions and the pictures are brought simultaneously nearer the
  mirrors, the re<U+FB02>ected images are not displaced, and they always co
  incide with the same convergence of the optic axes; but the mag
  nitude of the pictures on the retina: becomes greater as the pictures
  approach.     The experimental results a<U+FB02>'orded by this apparatus, so
  far as regards the perception of magnitude, are the following; the
  pictures being placed at such distances, and the arms moved to such
  positions, that the binocular image appears of its natural magnitude
  and its proper distance, on the arms being moved so as to occasion
\the optic axes to converge less, the image appears larger, and on
  their being moved so as to cause the optic axes to converge more,

                                        139
the image appears less; thus, while the magnitude of the pictures
on the retinas remains constantly the same, the perceived magnitude
of the object varies, through a very considerable range, with every
 degree of the convergence of the optic axes.                The pictures and arms
 being again placed so that the magnitude and distance of the object
 appear the same as usual, and the arms being <U+FB01>xed so that the con
  vergence of the optic axes does not change; while the pictures are
  brought nearer the mirrors the perceived magnitude of the object in
  creases, and it decreases when they are removed further off; thus,
  while the inclination of the optic axes remains constant, the per
  ceived magnitude of the object varies with every change in the mag
  nitude of the pictures on the retinas.              After this the author takes
  into consideration the disturbances produced in our perception of
  distance under the same circumstances, and concludes that the facts
  thus experimentally ascertained regarding the perceptions of magni
  tude and distance, render necessary some modi<U+FB01>cation in the pre
 valent theory regarding them.
      The author ncxt reverts to the stereoscope and its elfects.                He
 recommends the original re<U+FB02>ecting stereoscope as the most e<U+FB02>icient
 instrument, not only for investigating the phenomena of binocular
  vision, but also for exhibiting the greatest variety of stereoscopic
  effects, as it admits of every required adjustment, and pictures of
  any size may be placed in it.             A very portable form of this instru
  ment is then described, and also a retracting stereoscope suited for
  Daguerreotypes and small pictures not much exceeding the width
  between the eyes.          In the latter instrument the pictures are placed
  side by side and viewed through two retracting prisms of small
  angle which displace the pictures laterally, that on the right side
   towards the left, and that on the left side towards the right, so that
   they appear to occupy the same place.              When the <U+FB01>rst part of these
   investigations    was    published     the  photographic     art was unknown,
   and the illustrations of the stereoscope were con<U+FB01>ned to outline
  and shaded perspective drawings; when, however, in the succeeding
  year, Talbot and Daguerre made their processes known, Mr. Wheat
  stone was enabled to obtain binocular'l‘albotypes and Daguerreotypes
  of statues, buildings, and even portraits of living persons, which,
  when presented in the stereoscope, no longer appeared as pictures,
  but as solid models of the objects from which they were taken. This
  application was <U+FB01>rst announced in 1841.
    -
      The two projections of an object, seen by the two eyes, are dif
  ferent according to the distance‘at which it is viewed; they become
  less dissimilar as that distance is greater, and, consequently, as the
  convergence of the optic axes becomes less. To a particular distance
  belongs a speci<U+FB01>c dissimilarity between the two pictures, and it is
  a point of interest to determine what would take place on viewing a
 pair of stereoscopic pictures with a different inclination of the optic
 axes than that for which they were intended.                    The result of this
 inquiry    is, that  if  a pair  of very    dissimilar  pictures is seen when the
optic    axes    are  nearly    parallel,   the  distances            the near and
                                                             between
                     of  the                                     if,
                                                                and    on the other
remote points                 object appear     exaggerated   ;

                                   14!)
hand, a pair of pictures slightly dissimilar is seen when the optic
axes converge very much, the appearance is that of a has-relief.
As no disagreeable or obviously incongruous effect is produced when
two pictures, intended for a nearer convergence of the optic axes,
are seen when the eyes are parallel or nearly so, we are able to avail
ourselves of the means of augmenting the perceived magnitude of
the binocular image mentioned at the commencement of this abstract.
For this purpose the pictures, placed near the eyes, are caused to
coincide when the optic axes are nearly parallel; and the diverging
rays proceeding‘from the near pictures are rendered parallel by
lenses of short focal distance placed before the mirrors or prisms of
the stereoscope.
    Some additional observations are next brought forward respect
ing those stereoscopic phenomena which the author, in his <U+FB01>rst
memoir, called " conversions of relief."     They may be produced in
three different ways z—lst, by transposing the pictures from one eye
to the other; 2ndly, by re<U+FB02>ecting each picture separately, without
transposition; and 3rdly, by inverting the pictures to each eye se
parately.   The converse <U+FB01>gure differs from the normal <U+FB01>gure in this
circumstance, that those points which appear most distant in the
latter, are the nearest in the former, and vice verszi.
    An account is then given of the construction and effects of an
instrument for producing the conversion of the relief of any solid
 object to which it is directed.    As this instrument conveys to the
 mind false perceptions of all external objects, the author calls it a
 Pseudoscope. It consists of two re<U+FB02>ecting prisms, placed in a frame,
 with adjustments, so that, when applied to the eyes, each eye may
 separately see the re<U+FB02>ected image of the projection which usually
falls on that eye. This is not the case when the re<U+FB01>exion of an
 object is seen in a mirror; for then, not only are the projections
 separately re<U+FB02>ected, but they are also transposed from one eye to
 the other, and therefore the conversion of relief does not take place.
 The pseudoscope being directed to an object, and adjusted so that
 the object shall appear of its proper size and at its usual distance,
 the distances of all other objects are inverted; all nearer objects ap
 pear more distant, and all more distant objects nearer.      The con
 version of relief of an object consists in the transposition of the
 distances of the points which compose it.       With the pseudoscopc
 we have a glance, as it were, into another visible world, in which
 external objects and our internal perceptions have no longer their
 habitual relations with each other.    Among the remarkable illusions
 it occasions, the following are mentioned.      The inside of a tea
 cup appears a solid convex body; the effect is more striking if there
 are painted <U+FB01>gures within the cup.      A china vase, ornamented with
 coloured <U+FB02>owers in relief, appears to be a vertical section of the in
terior of the vase, with painted hollow impressions of the <U+FB02>owers.
 A small terrestrial globe appears a concave hemisphere; when the
 globe is turned on its axis, the appearance and disappearance of
 ditferent portions of the map on its concave surface has a very sin
 gular effect.   A bust regarded in front becomes a deep hollow

                                    141
mask; when regarded in pro<U+FB01>le, the appearance is equally striking.
A   framed picture, hung against a wall, appears as if imbedded in a
cavity made in the wall. An object placed before the wall of a room
appears behind the wall, and as if an aperture of the proper dimen
sions had been made to allow it to be seen; if the object be illumi
nated by a candle, its shadow appears as far before the object as it
actually is behind it.
    The communication concludes with a variety of details relating to
the conditions on which these phenomena depend, and with a des
scription of some other methods of producing the pseudoscopic
appearances.

    A paper     was read, entitled, “ On the Development of the Duct
less Glands of the Chick.”       By Henry Gray, Demonstrator of Ana
tomy at St. George's Hospital. Communicated by W. Bowman,Esq.,
F.R.S.      Received November 12, 1851.
    In this paper the author has demonstrated the evolution of the
spleen, supra-renal and thyroid glands, and the tissues of which
each is composed, in order to show the place that may be assigned
to each in a classi<U+FB01>cation of the glands.
    The spleen is shown to arise between the 4th and 5th days, in a
fold of membrane which connects the intestinal canal to the spine
       “ intestinal lamina"), as a small whitish mass 'of blastema,
(the                                                                  per
fectly distinct from both the stomach and pancreas.             This fold
serves to retain it and the pancreas in connection with the intestine.
This separation of the spleen from the pancreas is more distinct at
an early period of its evolution than later, as the increased growth
 of both organs causes them to approximate more closely, but not
 more intimately with one another; hence probably the statement of
 Arnold, that the spleen arises from the pancreas. With the increase
 in the growth of the organ and the surrounding parts, it gradually
 attains the position that it occupies in the full-grown bird, in more
 immediate proximity with the stomach; hence probably the state
 ment of Bischo<U+FB02>", that it arises from the stomach.       Later, when its
 vessels are formed, the membrane in which it was developed is
 almost completely absorbed.
    The author then considers the development of the tissues of the
 spleen, which clearly establishes, not only the glandular nature of the
 organ itself, but the great similarity it bears with the supra-renal
 and thyroid glands.
    The external capsule and the trabecular tissue of the spleen are
 both developed between the 8th and 9th days, the former in the
 form of a thin membrane composed of nucleated <U+FB01>bres, the latter
 consisting of similar <U+FB01>bres, which intersect the organ at'<U+FB01>rst sparingly,
  and afterwards in greater quantity.     The-development of the blood

                                     142
  vessels and the blood are next examined.       The former are shown to
  arise in the organ independent of those which are exterior to it.
  The development of the blood-globules is shown to arise from the
  blastema of the organ at the earliest period of its evolution, and
  continue their formation until its connection with the general vas
  cular system is effected, at which period their development ceases.
  No destruction of the blood-globules could ever be observed. These
  observations disprove the two existing opinions of the use of the
  spleen, as the blood-discs are not formed there (excepting during its
  early development), as stated by Gerlach and Schii<U+FB01>'ner; nor are they
  destroyed there, as stated by Kolliker and Ecker.
       The development of the pulp tissue is next examined.         At an
  early period this closely corresponds with the structure of the supra
  renal and thyroid glands at the earliest stages of their evolution,
  consisting of nuclei, nucleated vesicles, and a <U+FB01>ne granular plasma,
  the former forming a very considerable         portion of its structure.
  When the splenic vessels are formed, many of these nuclei are sur
 rounded by a quantity of <U+FB01>ne dark granules arranged in a circular
 form, and these increase up to the time when the splenic vein is
 formed, when nearly the whole mass is composed of nucleated vesi
  cles, the nuclei of which gradually break up into a mass of granules
 which <U+FB01>ll the cavities of the vesicles.     The Malpighian vesicles are
  developed     in the pulp by  the  aggregation   of nuclei into circular
  mueses, around which a <U+FB01>ne membrane soon appears, in a manner
 precisely similar to those of the suprarenal and thyroid glands, with
 which they bear the closest analogy.
     The author then traces out the development of the supra-renal
 glands, and shows the close analogy that exists between them, the
 spleen, and thyroid, from the similarity which their structure pre
 sents at the earliest period of their evolution with those glands, and
 from the development of the several tissues following the same
 stages in all.
     '
        ‘hey arelshown to arise on the 7th day as two separate masses
 of blastema, situated between the upper end of the Wool<U+FB01>an bodies
 and the sides of the aorta, being totally independent (as concerns
 their development) of those bodies, or of each other. At this period
 their minute structure bears a close resemblance to that of the
 spleen, consisting of the same elements as that gland, excepting in
 the existence of more numerous dark granules, which give to the
 organ at a later period an opake and darkly granular texture.        The
gland tissue of the organ, in the form of large vesicles, makes its
appearance on the 8th day, whereas in the spleen it did not exist
until near to the close of incubation, an interesting fact in con
nection with the function of the former gland, which is<U+FB02>mainly
exercised during foetal life, whilst the spleen exerts its function
mainly in adult life; hence the di<U+FB02>‘erence in the development          the
tissues at different periods.     The manner in which this tiss'e is
developed is similar to that by which the gland tissue of the
spleen was formed, viz. by an aggregation of nuclei into circular
masses, around which a limitary membrane ultimately forms : these

                                      143
  are <U+FB01>rst grouped together in a mass, without any subdivisioninto
  cortical and medullary portions.      On the 14th day the <U+FB01>rst trace of
  this subdivision becomes manifest, by the vesicles being aggregated
 into masses which radiate from the circumference towards the centre
 of the gland, in some cases complete tubes being formed by the
 junction of the vesicles, as indicated by hemispherical bulgings along
 their walls.     At a later period the organs increase in size, they
 attain their usual position, and a more complete subdivision into
 cortical and medullary portions is now observed.
     The author lastly traces out the development of the thyroid
 glands, and shows the great similarity that exists between them, the
 spleen and supra-renal glands, from the similar structure they pre
 sent, and from the development of those structures occurring in a
 similar manner in each.
     These glands are developed between the 6th and 7th days as two
 separate masses of blastema, one at each side of the root of the neck,
close to the separation of the carotid and subclavian vessels, and be—
tween the trachea and the branchial clefts, but quite independent, as
far as regards their development, of either of those parts.            Their
minute structure at an early period closely corresponds with that of
the spleen and supra-renal glands.        Later, when the gland tissue of
which the thyroid gland ultimately consists is formed, it is developed
in a manner precisely similar to the same tissues of the spleen and
supra-renal glands, a fact which shows the analogy they bear to one
another.
    From these observations the author concludes that a close analogy
exists between the glands already described, so that the propriety of
                                                  “ Ductless Glands,”
their classi<U+FB01>cation under one group, as the                              may
be considered clearly proved.         And although the spleen by many
has been excluded from them, the author considers that its classi<U+FB01>ca
tion with them is correct, for the following reasons :—lst. From its
evolution being similar with that of the supra-renal and thyroid
gland; 2nd. from its structure, which at an early period closely
corresponds with them; and 3rdly, from the development of its
tissues following the same law as that upon which the tissues of the
allied glands are formed.

    A paper   was read, entitled :—“ Researches on the Geometrical
Properties   of  Elliptic Integrals."   By the Rev. James Booth, LL.D.,
F.R.S. &c. Received November 17, 1851.
    In this paper the author proposes to investigate the true geome
trical basis of that entire class of algebraical expressions, known to
mathematicians as elliptic functions or integrals.           He sets out by
showing     what    had  already  been   done  in  this  department of the
subject by. preceding geometers.        That  the   elliptic integral of the

                                    144
second order represented an arc of a plane ellipse, was evident from
the beginning.      Hence indeed the name “ elliptic functions,” de~
rived from a part, was given to the whole.        Here then the question
naturally arose: What geometrical types did the <U+FB01>rst and third
orders represent? _ This question long remained without complete
solution; and investigators in this department of analysis were
compelled to take the fundamental         expressions as arbitrary data,
and to forgo the inquiry what the geometrical              theorems were
which these algebraical expressions represented.         Various but un
successful attempts were made by geometers to represent them by
quadratures, or by plane curves, either algebraical or transcendental.
About ten years ago, however, Messrs. Guderman and Catalan
showed that the circular form of the third order represented the
curve of intersection of a cone of the second degree and a concentric
sphere; but they did not extend their researches to the <U+FB01>rst order,
nor to the logarithmic form of the third.
   The main object of the paper is to prove that elliptic integrals
of every kind, the parameter taking any value whatever between
positive and negative in<U+FB01>nity, represent the intersections of surfaces
of the second order.
   These surfaces divide themselves into two classes, of which the
sphere and the paraboloid are the respective types; from the former
arise the circular functions of the third order, from the other the
logarithmic and exponential.       In the course of these investigations
it is shown that the formulae for the comparison of elliptic integrals,
which are given by Legendre, follow simply as geometrical inferences
from the fundamental       properties of those curves.       The ordinary
conic sections are merely particular cases of those more general
curves, to which the author has given the name Hyperconic Sections.
    The author remarks, that it will doubtless appear not a little sin
gular, that the principal properties of these functions, their classi
<U+FB01>cation, their transformations, the comparison of elliptic integrals of
the third order, with conjugate or reciprocal parameters, were all
investigated and developed before geometers had any idea of the true
geometrical origin of those functions.        It is as if the formulae of
common trigonometry had been derived from an algebraical de<U+FB01>ni
tion, before the geometrical conception of the circle had been ad
mitted. As trigonometry may be de<U+FB01>ned, the development of the
properties of circular arcs. whether described on a plane, or on the
surface of a sphere, so this higher trigonometry, or the theory of
elliptic integrals, may be de<U+FB01>ned as the development of the rela
tions which exist between the arcs of hyperconic sections.
    It may be said, we cannot by this method derive any properties
 of elliptic integrals which may not algebraically be deduced from the
fundamental expressions appropriately        assumed.    It cannot, how
 ever, be truly asserted that the properties of curve lines should be
 developed without any reference to their geometrical types.          We
 might, starting from certain algebraical expressions, derive every
 known property of curve lines, without having in any instance a
 conception of the geometrical types which they represent.            The

                                           145
theory of elliptic integrals was developed by a method the inverse
of that pursued in establishing the formulae of common trigonometry.
In the latter case, the geometrical type was given-the circle-~to
determine the algebraical relations of its arcs.                     In the theory of
elliptic integrals,    the   relations    of   the   arcs  of   unknown         curves are
given, to determine the curves themselves;                      this is the principal
object of the present communication.
   The problem resolves itself into twelve distinct cases, depending
on the magnitude of the parameter, and the sign with which it is
affected; out of the discussion of these cases arise many new and
important relations of elliptic integrals. It would excite little in
terest to give the bare enunciations              of those theorems, and a mere
outline of the methods by which they are established would be un
intelligible.     Not the least interesting of those theorems is the pro
position, that it is always possible to express an elliptic integral of
the <U+FB01>rst order as the sum of two elliptic integrals of the third order,
with parameters which are conjugate, reciprocal and imaginary.
   The author hopes, in a future communication to the Royal So
ciety,—the present having grown under his hands beyond the limits
he anticipated—among other points, to extend his researches to the
case of elliptic integrals with imaginary parameters, and to show
the true geometrical meaning of such expressions.                          It will also be
shown, that imaginary expressions may                  be  found     for    a logarithmic

somewhat irregular.       Further details are given of the condition of
the ultimate and penultimate ducts in the several vertebrate classes.
    In the class of Fishes, the minute ducts most commonly appear as
solid cylinders of soft granulous substance, in which scarce anything
but some oily molecules are to be discerned; but not very unfra
quently two other conditions are observed, which seem to illustrate
very well the active character of the function of the duct.             In the.
<U+FB01>rst the granulous matter exists in much smaller quantity, and the
nuclei imbedded in it are consequently seen much more distinctly;
their presence is thus unequivocally determined; it is shownthat
there is no real difference between the ducts of the <U+FB01>sh’s and those
of the mammalian liver, only that the granulous matter is. usually
accumulated in the former more abundantly than in the latter. The
presence of free nuclei in granulous matter indicates an active change
to be proceeding in the part.       In the second condition sometimes
observed the granulous matter lies imbeddod in it, a varying number
of pellucid vesicles of great delicacy, but quite distinct; these testify
that a process of active growth takes place in the minute ducts, and
show, the author thinks conclusively, that the seminute ducts are
not mere eiferent canals.
    Sugar was detected on tWo or three occasions in the livers of
<U+FB01>shes; it seems to be absent when the organ is extremely fatty.
    In the minute hepatic ducts of reptiles, the condition of the epi
thelium is very similar to that in <U+FB01>shes; the nuclei sometimes ap
pearing with great distinctness, sometimes being obscured by much
 granulous matter, sometimes developing themselves into pellucid
vesicles.    The livers of frogs and toads almost constantly contain
 dark yellow masses which were formerly regarded by the authoras
biliary concretions, but are now considered to be only pigmenme
 deposits; they coexist sometimes with much diffused black matter.
    The ultimate ducts have been traced recently very satisfactorily
 in Birds, Mammalia and Man, and the description given of them in
the paper accords with the author’s former account.
    The development of the liver and its apparatus of ducts has been
traced out in <U+FB01>shes and reptiles, and the following results obtained

     In Mammalia the subject of inquiry has been chiefly the follow
 ing, viz. to ascertain how far there was evidence that the secretion
  of bile actually is effected in and by the hepatic cell, or whether its
  presence in them is accidental, and the bile is really and necessarily
 secreted by the ultimate ducts.
     It is remarked that the existence of a portal vein conveying blood
 from the intestinal surface is coeval, not with the formation of a
 bile-secreting structure (for many animals have organs which
 secrete abundance of biliary matter without any portal vein), but
 with the addition of a parenchymatous mass to the biliary organ, to
 which mass exclusively the portal vein is distributed. It is known
 that the parenchyma of the liver during, and for many hours after,
 digestion of food, forms, from the blood supplied to it, abundance of
 sugar, which thus appears to be its proper secretion; and it is not
 proved that the hepatic cells in a healthy state contain biliary matter,
 though they oftende in various morbid conditions. Extracts of the
 hepatic parenchyma tested for bile by Pettenkoffer’s method, give
 only very imperfect and doubtful traces of the presence of billary
 matter, and on the other hand the sugar formed by the parenchyma,
 which is found so abundantly in the blood of the hepatic vein, is
 absent from the bile.          The case of fatty liver, as occurring either
 pathologically or normally, seems also to require an explanation
 consonant with the view to which the above facts point, for other
 wise it seems impossible to understand how perfectly formed dark
 green bile could be contained in the efferent channels of a gland
 whose tissue is a mass of oil.
    The'structural condition of the ultimate biliary ducts is compared
to that of the epithelium of the thyroidal cavities, and the nucleated
 granular tissue surrounding the lacteal in a villus; and it is shown
 to be probable that the terminal portions of the ducts,--so far as they
 possess the peculiar characteristic        structure, exert an active elabos
 rating     energy,    by  means of which  bile is formed or generated out of
 oily, albuminous or saccharine material which snrrounds,--may be
 said to bathe them.

and on the cessation of the contraction, the <U+FB02>ow is checked, with a
tendency to regurgitation, which brings the valves into play.                  But
 this check to the onward <U+FB02>ow of the blood is usually only momen—
 tary; already, even while the vein is in the act of again becoming di
 lated, the onward <U+FB01>ow recommences and goes on, though with com
 parative slowness, until the vein contracts again.       It is the heart’s
 action   which  maintains   the onward  <U+FB02>ow  of blood   during the dilata
 tion of the vein, whilst it is the contraction of the vein, coming in
 aid of the heart’s action, which causes the acceleration.
    The valves are composed sometimes of but a single <U+FB02>ap, somei
 times of two.      In the situation of a valve and centrad of the inser
 tion of its <U+FB02>aps, the veins present the usual dilatations or sinuses.
 The valves are a reduplication of the clear innermost coat of the
 vein, with sometimes an intervening layer of cellular tissue.                     -’
     The veins closely accompany the arteries, the nerve only inter
 vening.
     The contractility of the arteries the author <U+FB01>nds altogether differ
 ent from that of the veins, being tonic, not rythmical.          He has not
 been able to observe unequivocal evidences of tonic contractility of
 the veins, which they have been alleged to possess.
     In <U+FB01>gure 3, of drawing No. 1, illustrating his paper, the author
 represents, in reference to this point, an artery and a vein, as ob
 served immediately after pressure had been applied over them. The
 arteryis seén‘constricted at intervals both above and below the place
 of pressure.    The vein is not so constricted, but at the place where
 the pressure    was   applied there is seen a greyisli granular deposit
of lymph within the vessel, giving rise to an appearance of constric
tion by narrowing the stream of blood.        On watching a vein in this
state, the author has observed portions of the lymphy depoeit car
ried away by the stream of blood, with corresponding enlargement
 of the channel.                                                I

    2. “ Some   Observations on the Ova of the Salmonidae.” By John
Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Loud. and Ed., Inspector-General of Army
Hospitals, &c. Received November 20, 1851.
   The author prefaces his observations by a quotation from the
Work of M. Vogt on the Embryology of the Salmonidae, in which
a remarkable property of the vitellus is described, viz. its coagula
tion by admixture with water.
   This inquirer’s experiments were made chie<U+FB02>y on the ova of the
Palée (Coregonus Palaea, Cuv.); the author’s mostly on the ova. of
the Charr (Salmo umbla).      After giving a description of the mature
eggs of this <U+FB01>sh, he details the trials instituted by him z—lst, on the
action of water, showing its coagulating effect, except when added
in very minute quantity. 2ndly, on the action of heat ; how that a
dry heat, even so high as that of 212° Fahr., occasions the contrac
tion of the vitellus from evaporation, but not its coagulation, an
effect even not produced by steam of the same temperature, but
which is occasioned by boiling in water, owing, it is inferred, to an
admixture of water. 3rdly, on the action of alkalies and salts; how
these, such as potassa, ammonia and their sesquicarbonates in solu
tion, nitre,   acetate of lead, common salt and others, when of
moderate strength, not only do not coagulate the vitellus, but have
the property of dissolving a certain portion of coagulum, and coagu
late it only when very much diluted.       4thly, on the action of acids
and some other agents; how the vegetable acids tried, as the tar
taric, oxalic, acetic, whether strong or dilute, do not coagulate the
vitelline <U+FB02>uid, but dissolve its coagulum; how the strong sulphuric
and muriatic acids inspissate it, theweak coagulating it; and fur
ther, how it is coagulated by the nitric acid, by corrosive sublimate
and by alcohol, but not by iodine.
   The inference from the experiments drawn by the author is, that
the vitellus of the Charr and of the eggs of the other Salmonidae is
distinct in its properties, both from the albumen and yolk of the eggs
of birds.   He conjectures from analogy that the ova of other species
of osseous <U+FB01>shes will be found to be similar; but not so those of the
cartilaginous <U+FB01>shes. According to the observations he has made, the
yolk of the eggs of <U+FB01>shes of this order, whether they possess a white,
as in the instance of the oviparous; or are destitute of a white, as in
that of the viviparous, resembles in its general character that of the
egg of birds: but he doubts that the white of the former will‘be
found analogous to that of the albumen ovi of birds, at least in its
chemical qualities; having in one instance, that of the egg of the
Squalus Catulus, found it to be, whilst transparent and viscid, neither
coagulated by heat nor by nitric acid.
    In conclusion, he suggests that the coagulation of the ova of the
 Paooannmos or run Rona Socrsrr. VOL. VI. No. 86.                  lr

                                     150
 Salmonidae may have its use, inasmuch as the opaque white ova are
more conspicuous than the transparent,—-the dead than the living,—
and in consequence, the one may serve as lures and divert from the
others the many enemies to whom they are attractive food.

    The following communications were read :—
    1. The subjoined Letter from Professor Haidinger to Captain
Smyth, ,R.N., For. Sec. R.S., dated Vienna, January 15, 1852.
Received January 23, 1852.
    Sir,—The great success with which optical researches are treated
of in the publications of the Royal Sooiety, must make me anxious
to lay before the Society, in a few words, a concise and convincing
demonstration     of the theorem that in a ray of polarized light the
vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of polarization, conform~
ably to the views of MM. Fresnel and Cauchy, and not in the plane
of polarization, as some other mathematicians have maintained.
    My demonstration is founded on the nature of dichroitic crystals,
as tourmaline,   sapphire,   idocrase, &c.  Any   perfectly  homogeneous
 crystal of this description presents two di<U+FB01>'erent tints of colours.
 One of them appears in the direction of the axis, as well as in all
 directions perpendicular to it, and it is always polarized in a plane
 passing through the axis ; the other tint appears in every azimuth in
 the directions perpendicular to the axis, and it is polarized in a plane
perpendicular    to the axis.     The latter of these colours does not
 appear at all, if the crystal is examined in the direction of the axis;
if it depend at all on transverse vibrations, all vibrations of this kind,
transverse or perpendicular to the axis, are at once excluded, and the
 only vibrations that can possibly belong to the colour of the extra
 ordinary ray produced in the crystal, are those parallel to the direc
 tion of the axis. But agreeably to observation the plane of polariza
tion is itself perpendicular to the axis, the vibrations therefore take
place in directions perpendicular to the plane of polarization.
    Trichroitic crystals of course will yield a similar demonstration,
as cordierite, andalusite, diaspore, axinite, and others.
    I shall not fail to send a copy of the communication I am to pre~
sent today to the Vienna Academy, as soon as it shall have been
printed.
    The importance of the subject will, I am con<U+FB01>dent, plead as an
apology for my trespassing on your kindness in thus making the
request, that you will lay the present communication            before the
Royal Society.

    2. A Letter to Sir John W. Lubbock, Bart.,         F.R.S. &c., “On
the Stability of the Earth’s Axis of Rotation.”
                                                    By Henry Hennessy,
Esq.,   M.R.I.A. 8w. Communicated by          Sir John Lubbock. Rea
ceived November 20, 1851.
   The author refers to a communication to the Geological Society
by Sir John Lubbock, in which he appeals, in support of the
                                                                    possi
bility of a change in the earth’s axis, to the in<U+FB02>uence of two disturb
ing causes, which appear to have almost entirely escaped the notice
of Laplace and Poisson in their investigations on the
                                                          stability of the
earth’s axis of rotation :-—l . The necessary displacement of the earth’s
interior strata arising from chemical and physical actions during the
process of solidi<U+FB01>cation.      2. The friction of the resisting medium
in which the earth is supposed to move.
   With reference to the <U+FB01>rst of these disturbing causes, the author
states, that in his Researches in Terrestrial Physics (Philosophical
Transactions, 1851, Part 2.), he has been led to conclusions which
may assist in clearing up the question.       From an inquiry into the
process of the earth’s solidi<U+FB01>cation which appears to him most in
accordance with mechanical and physical laws, he has deduced re
sults respecting the earth’s structure which throw some light on
the changes which may take place in the relation between its prin
cipal moments of inertia, which relation is capable of being expressed
by means of a function which depends on the arrangement of the
earth’s  interior  strata.
   He then states that he has found strong con<U+FB01>rmation of his pe-’
culiar views respecting the theory of the earth’s <U+FB01>gure, in the expe
riments of Professor Bischof of Bonn, on the contraction of granite
and other rocks in passing from the <U+FB02>uid to the solid crystalline
state.    From the results of these experiments, he has been led to
assign   a  new form to the function expressing the relation of the
earth’s principal moments of inertia. Referring to his paper for the
mathematical processes by which he arrived at this result, he states
that, from the theory he has ventured to adopt, it follows that, as
solidi<U+FB01>cation advances, the strata of equal pressure in the <U+FB02>uid
spheroidal nucleus of the earth acquire increased ellipticity, and
each stratum of equal density successively added to the inner surface
of the solid crust is more oblate than the solid strata previously
formed.
    From these considerations alone, he remarks, it is evident that
 the difference between the greatest and least moment of} inertia of
 the earth would progressively increase during the process of solidi<U+FB01>
 cation.    It follows, therefore, that if the earth’s axis of rotation
 Were at any time stable, it would continue so for ever.        But from
 the laws of <U+FB02>uid equilibrium the axis must have been stable at the
 epoch of the <U+FB01>rst formation of the earth’s crust; consequently it
 continued undisturbed as the thickness of the crust increased during
 the several geological formations. Thus it appears that the displace
 ment of the earth’s interior strata, instead of having a tendency to
 change its axis of rotation, tends to increase the stability of that
 axis.
                                                              1 1*

                                     152
    With reference to inequalities arising from the friction of a resist
ing medium at the earth’s surface, the author observes that they
could not exist,  if,  as in the manner here shown, the axis of rota
tion coincided from the origin with the axis of <U+FB01>gure.
    In conclusion, he remarks, that we could assume for the planets
                                      if
a  similarity of physical constitution to that of the earth, the theorem
as to the difference of the greatest and least moments of inertia of
the earth would be applicable to all the planets; and thus we should
be as well assured of the stability of our system, with respect to the
motion of rotation of its several members, as we are already respect
ing their motion of translation.               _
    In a postscript, referring to third cause of disturbance in the place
                                a
 of the earth’s axis of rotation, suggested in a letter from Sir John
Lubbock, namely, the effects of local elevation and depressions at
the earth’s surface, the author states;      if,  with Humboldt, we re
 gard  the  numbers   expressing  the  mean heights of the several conti
nents as indicators of the plutonic forces by which they have been
upheaved, we shall readily see that these forces are of an inferior
order to those affecting the general forms and structure of the earth.
If the second class of forces acted so as not to in<U+FB02>uence in any way
the stability of the earth’s axis of rotation, the former class might,
under certain conditions, produce     a  sensible change in the position
of the axis.     But when the tendency of the second class of forces    is
to increase the stability of the earth’s axis,     itwould not be easy to
show the possibility of such conditions as to render the operation of
the other forces, not only effective in counteracting that tendency,
but also capable of producing    a    sensible change in the place of the
axis of rotation.

the F oliation and Cleavage of the Rocks of the North of Scotland.”

          WILLIAM SPENCE,            Esq., V.P., in the Chair.
  The reading of Mr. Sharpe’s paper, “ On the Arrangement of the
Foliation and Cleavage of the Rocks of the North of Scotland," was
                                                               '
resumed and concluded.
   The author applies the term, cleavage or lamination, to the divi
sional planes by which strati<U+FB01>ed rocks are split into parallel sheets,
independently of the strati<U+FB01>cation; foliation, to the division of crystal
line rocks into layers of different mineral substances  ; slate, to strati
<U+FB01>ed rocks intersected by cleavage; and schist, to foliated rocks only
which exhibit no bedding independent of the foliation.                  \
   He considers that no distinct line can be drawn between gneiss
and mica schist, chlorite schist, 810., which pass from one into the

                                        153
 other by insensible gradations; have the same geological relations,
 and foliation subject to the same laws. He states that their boundaries
 have been laid dowu arbitrarily on the published maps of Scotland.
 The quartz rock of Macculloch includes two formations; the one,
 a. quartzose variety of gneiss, included in this paper under that head;
 the other, a strati<U+FB01>ed sandstone altered by plutonic action.
    The author treats the foliation of gneiss and schist as a series of
 simple curves, obtained by observing the general direction, and dis
 regarding the minor and more complicated folds.          The convolutions
 are usually greatest where the dip is slightest, but where the folia
 tion is vertical or nearly so, it usually follows true planes without
 contortion ; thus the most correct observations are those taken where
 the  foliation is vertical.
     When the foliation of     gneiss and schist is traced over extensive
 areas,   and the minor convolutions disregarded, it is usually found
 to form arches cf great length and many miles in diameter, bounded
 by vertical planes, between which the inclination increases with the
 distance from the axis.       Each arch is succeeded by a narrow space
 in which the dip is irregular, and beyond which another' arch com
 mences of a form similar to the <U+FB01>rst.          Portions of two adjoining
 arches seen without the rest form the fan-like structure observed by
 several geologists.     The arrangement of the foliation in arches cor-
 responds with that of the cleavage of the true slates previously de
 scribed by the author, except in the greater convolution of the gneiss
                                             '
 and schist.
     Along the southern border of the Highlands a band of strati<U+FB01>ed
clay slate rests on mica schist: at the junction, the foliation of the
 schist conforms to the cleavage of the slate, and the two together
 form an arch, but there is no connection between the strati<U+FB01>cation
 of the slate and the foliation; moreover, the divisional planes cross
 from one rock to the other, without change of direction, being planes
 of foliation in the mica schist, and of cleavage in the slate: these
 facts con<U+FB01>rm Mr. Darwin’s opinion, that cleavage and foliation are
 due to the same cause.
    The author describes the parallel arches of foliation which cross
 the Highlands, illustrating his description by sections and a map
 on which they are laid down, and tracing in detail the vertical
planes which bound the arches.             Commencing on the south, the
<U+FB01>rst vertical plane runs about four miles within the Highland border,
with a mean direction of about N. 55° E.: it crosses more than
once the junction of the clay slate and mica schist.         South of this
plane    the  cleavage   of  the  slate  forms the  beginning of an arch,
which ends abruptly at the junction of the slate with the Old Red
Sandstone.
    To the north of this vertical plane four arches run across the High
lands : the most southern of these, with a diameter of ten or twelve
miles, is formed partly of the cleavage of the slate, and partly of the
foliation of the mica schist.         The hills on the south side of Loch
Tay coincide with its central axis. The vertical plane which forms
its northern boundary crosses Ben Lawers, and has a mean direction

                                     154
 of N. 50° E.     The next arch northward, consisting priuci lly of
 gneiss, has a diameter varying from twenty-<U+FB01>ve to thirty m' a; it<U+FB02>
 axis runs for some distance along the central ridge of the Grampians.
 The granite of Cruachan and Ben Muich Dhui interfere with the
 regularity of the foliation of this district, and the lines are thrown
 to the north by the granite of Aberdeenshire : the line which bounds
 this arch on the north crosses the Spey near Laggan, and runs
 N. 40° E. through Corbine into the Monagh Leagh mountains. To
 the north of that line, the foliation of the gneiss forms an arch only
 ten miles wide, bounded on the north by a vertical plane running
 N. 35° E. which crosses Coryaraick. This plane forms the southern
 boundary of an arch, varying from <U+FB01>fteen to twenty-<U+FB01>ve miles wide,
  entirely of gneiss, bounded on the north by a band of vertical folia
  tion which runs about N. 30° E. from Glen Finnan through the
  middle of Rosshire and across Ben Nevis.         To the north-west of
  this hand there is half an arch in the foliation, varying from twenty
  to thirty miles wide, which ends abruptly at a line to be drawn from
  Loch Eribol and Loch Maree, on the west of which the gneiss
 is unconformable to that hitherto described, but agrees with that of
 the Island of the Lewis, forming a series of arches which run about
 N.W.
_    From the want of parallelism in the lines of foliation of the High
  lands,  they would all nearly converge between Lough Foyle and
  Lough Swilly among the mica schists of the North of Ireland.
     The most rugged and elevated hills are usually on or near the
  lines of vertical foliation; the axes of the arches are generally found
  in high land, and the principal valleys occur between the central
  axes of the arches and their vertical boundaries.        Thus the min
  physical features of the Highlands are connected with the foliation
  of the gneiss and schists; but the granites and porphyries which
  have broken through those rocks, and disturbed the regularity of the
  foliation, have also greatly modi<U+FB01>ed the surface of the country.
     The contortions of gneiss and schists being unaccompanied by
  fracture, must, the author considers, have been produced when the
  matter of those rocks was semi-<U+FB02>uid: in this state the mineral in
  gredients appear to have separated and re-arranged themselves in
  layers according to their af<U+FB01>nities, while the whole was subjected to
  pressure acting along certain axes of elevation, which raised those
  layers into arches.

     The observations     made in this paper are
                                                  distributed under three

                                     155
heads.      First, the author examines the iris in conjunction with the
organic system of nerves.       Secondly, he exposes the relation of the
several nerves of the orbit in reference to the iris. And, thirdly, by
tracing the membrane through the lower orders of animals, he shows
the in<U+FB02>uence of the ophthalmic ganglion upon the iris, and the ne
cessity of its presence for the accomplishment      of the motions of the
membrane, i, e. contraction and dilatation of the pupil.
     It is shown that the pupil is most contracted during healthy sleep,
 and especially during that of childhood; that in death it assumes a
 median state. neither contracted nor dilated; and that, when disease
 is present, the pupil is always dilated, and dilated in accordance
 with the e<U+FB02>'ect produced upon the trisplanchnic system of nerves.
 Also, it is stated that the pupil is dilated, when through disease the
 action of the voluntary muscles is abnormally increased, but that it
 is contracted when the functions of nutrition are well and actively
 performed; and that, with concussion and compression of the brain,
 the pupil is usually dilated when the power of the voluntary muscles
 yet remains ; that it is <U+FB01>xed and immoveable when total insensibility
 exists; contracted when pressure or counter pressure is made upon
 the corpora quadrigemina‘ of the opposite side, and dilated when, the
 injury is more general, but less severe.
     The author refers the <U+FB01>rst class of motions, or the primary mo
 tions of the iris, directly to the sympathetic       system of nerves ;
 Whilst   the  direct movements,  or those  produced by the sensation of
   '
     ht, are effected through the cerebral nervous arc, as shown by
 v ourens, Marshall
                         Hall, and others: and he thinks that contrac
 tion of the pupil, when a near object is presented to the eye, may
 be explained by the greater stimulus thus a<U+FB02>'orded to the retina and
 the sensorium ; for he <U+FB01>nds that when a near object is presented to
 the eye with a faint light, but a more distant one with a strong
 light, the pupil is most contracted for the more distant object.
 That the in<U+FB02>uence of the retina and the cerebral nervous arc is
 secondary in producing the motion of the iris, and that this mem
 brane is not a mere diaphragm for the admission or exclusion of
 light, but that it yields to mental impressions, as well as to those
 which operate on the vegetative system of nerves, in preference to
 the e<U+FB01>'ect upon the retina, is shown by the result which is produced
 upon the iris by any sudden passion in causing dilatation of the
 pupil, notwithstanding that a strong light be at the same time thrown
  upon the retina.      Hippus, and the motions of the iris which are
  observed, especially in amaurotic children, are alluded to as motions
 independent of the light, and consequently, of the retina and sen
 sorium.
     The author then proceeds to state the e<U+FB02>‘ect of irritation and divi
 sion of the several nerves of the orbit. He <U+FB01>nds, that, on irritating
 the third nerve within the cranial cavity, slight contraction of the
 pupil ensues, to be followed by dilatation. On dividing the third'
 nerve, the pupil becomes dilated beyond its median extent.
     Irritation of the optic nerve within the cranium produces con
 traction of the pupil. Section of the same nerve gives rise to an
 insensible retina, and a, dilated pupil.

                                      156
     Irritation of the <U+FB01>fth nerve excites slight motion in the iris. Divi
 sion of the <U+FB01>fth produces temporary contraction of the pupil.          In
 the space of half an hour this elfect will have ceased, and the pupil
 will have resumed its former diameter.
    If a slight galvanic current be passed along the sympathetic, con
 traction of the pupil will be produced; but let the sympathetic be
 divided, at the superior cervical ganglion for instance, and instantly
 the pupil shall forcibly contract, and again widely dilate.
    If a weak galvanic current be used, and the poles brought into
 contact with the sclerotica at its junction with the cornea, contrac
 tion of the pupil to two-thirds of its actual diameter takes place,
 and this effect continues so long as the current continues to be
 formed; but on breaking connection, the pupil immediately resumes
 its former diameter.      So soon as life is extinct, galvanism ceases to
 affect the iris, whether applied to the membrane itself, through the
 external coats, or though the poles be in contact with the retina;
 but if applied to the sympathetic, movement may be excited in the
 ms.
    The optic nerve being divided, the pupil is dilated: irritation of
 the third nerve then produces merely a slight and momentary effect
 upon the iris; but if the sympathetic be divided, the pupil will con
 tract violently, and again dilate beyond its previous state of dilata
 tion.
    The sympathetic being divided, irritation of the cranial nerves
 does not a<U+FB01>'ect the iris; but though the cerebrum and corpora
 quadrigemina be removed, division of the sympathetic will still ex
 cite the iris to motion.     And, consequently, the author infers that
 the basic or primary motion of the iris is derived from the vis motoria
 of the excito-motor ganglionic system: he shows also, that where
 the ophthalmic ganglion is wanting, as in <U+FB01>shes and reptiles, the iris
 is motionless.     Allusion is, lastly, made to some medicinal agents,
 to show their in<U+FB02>uence upon the nervous centres, and their conse
 quent e<U+FB02>'ect upon the iris : they are classed as follows :—
        I. True depressors and pupil dilators.
      ll. True excitants and pupil dilators.
    III. Stimulants which become depressors, which dilate the pupil.
    IV. Excitors of voluntary nerves and pupil dilators.
      V. Sedatives which terminate as depressors, which <U+FB01>rst contract
              and then dilate the pupil.
    VI. Excitants which become sedatives, which <U+FB01>rst dilate and then
              contract the pupil.
    And from what has gone before, it is concluded, that contraction
of the pupil is the active state of the iris, and that dilatation is its
enervated condition;        that a healthy retina and cerebral nervous
are are necessary to the motions of the iris, and the ophthalmic
ganglion to motion; and that the primary motiorl'of the iris is due
to organic nervous in<U+FB02>uence, but its forced or animal motion to the
re<U+FB02>ected stimulus of light upon the retina.

   A paper    was read, entitled,
                                   “ On the
                                              Anatomy of Doris.”     By
Albany Hancock, Esq., and Dennis Embleton, M.D., Lecturer on
Anatomy and Physiology in the Newcastle-on-Tyne College of Me
dicine, in connection with the University of Durham. Communicated
by Professor E. Forbes, F.R.S.       Received November 27, 1851.
    The authors have proposed to themselves to describe the anatomy
of the three genera typical of the three groups of the Nudibranchiate
Mollusca. An account of the structure of Eolis has already appeared
in the ‘ Annals of Natural History.’
    A detailed description is given of the anatomy of Doris, the fol
 lowing species of which have been examined, and are referred to in
the  paper: D. tuberculata,Auct., D. tuberculala,Verany, D.J0hnstoni,
 D. tomentosa, D. repanda, D. coccinea, D. verrucosa, D. pilosa,
D. bilamellata, D. aspera, and D. depressa; but D. tuberculata of
 English authors has been taken as the type of the genus, and the
 standard of comparison for the rest.
    Digestive System—The mouth in all the species is a powerful
muscular organ, provided with a prehensile tongue beset with siliceous
spines, which when the tongue is fully developed, are arranged in a
median and two lateral series.       Certain species possess, besides, a
prehensile spinous collar on the buccal lip, occasionally associated
with a rudimentary horny jaw. The mode of development of the
lingual spines is shown to be the same as that of the teeth of the
Vertebrata.
    The (esophagus varies in length ; in some it is dilated at the top,

                                      158
   forming a crop; in others it is simply enlarged previously to enter
   ing the liver mass. The stomach is of two forms ; one, as in D. tuber
   culata, is very large, receiving the oesophagus behind, and giving off
   the intestine in front, and lying in advance of the liver; the other is
   received within the mass of the liver, and is very small.     The liver
   in all is bulky, mostly bilobed, and variously coloured, and pours its
   secretion by one or more very wide ducts into the cardiac end of
  the stomach.      A small laminated pouch—a rudimentary pancreas,
  is attached in some species to the cardiac, in others to the pyloric
  end of the stomach.        The intestine is short, of nearly the same
  calibre throughout, rather sinuous in its course, and terminates in a
  nipple-formed anus in the centre of the branchial circle.
      The Reproductive Organs are male, female and hermaphrodite.
  The male organs consist of penis and testis; the latter is connected
  with the former and with the oviduct.        The female organs are, ova.
  rium, oviduct, and mucus-gland. The ovarium is spread over the
  surface of the liver in the form of a branched duct with terminal
  ampullae.     The oviduct terminates in the mucus-gland. The an
  drogynous apparatus is a tube or vagina opening from the exterior
  into the oviduct, having one or two diverticular spermathecaa com
  municating with it in its course.     On the right margin of the body
  near the front is a common opening, to which converge the three
  parts of the reproductive organs.       The spermatozoa are developed
  within large and fusiform spermatophora, and are observed in the
  spermathecae, oviduct and ovary.
      Organs of Circulation and Respiration.-—The circulatory organs
  are, a systemic heart, arteries, lacunae and veins.    The existence of
  true capillaries in the liver-mass seems probable. A second heart»—
 a ventricle, having a portal character, is also described. The systemic
  heart lies immediately beneath the dorsal skin, in front of the respi.
  rntory crown, and comprises an auricle and ventricle enclosed within
 a pericardium.       In the systemic circle the blood is returned to the
 heart without having passed through the special respiratory organ.
  It is that blood only which is returned from the liver-mass that
 circulates through the branchiae.
     The authors conclude from their observations, that in the M01
 lusks there is a triple circulation: <U+FB01>rst, the systemic, in which the
 blood prepelled along the arteries to the viscera and foot is returned,
 with the exception of that from the liver-mass, to the heart through
 the skin; there it becomes partially aémted, the skin being provided
with vibratile cilia, and otherwise adapted as an instrument of re
spiration ; second, the portal, in which venous blood from the system
is driven by a special heart to the renal and hepatic organs, and
probably to the ovarium, where it escapes, doubly venous, with the
rest of the blood which has been supplied to these organs from the
aorta, and which is therefore only singly venous, to the branchiaa;
third, the branchial circulation, in which <U+FB02>ows only the more dete
riorated blood brought by the hepatic vein, but in which also that
blood undergoes the highest degree of puri<U+FB01>cation capable of being
:5ch        in the economy. namely in the'epecial organ of respiration

                                     159
 This triple circulation has not yet, as far as the authors are aware,
 been described as existing in the Molluscan Subkingdom.             From
 the fact of the blood in Doris being returned to the heart in a state
 of partial aeration, it is clear, they say, that this animal is, in this
 respect. on a par with the higher crustaceans;       and from the blood
 arriving at the heart in the same condition, according to the re
 searches of Garner and Milne-Edwards, in Ostrea and Pinna, the
 great Triton of the Mediterranean, Haliotis, Patella and Helix, it can
 scarcely be doubted that this arrangement will be found throughout
 the  Mollusca.
    From a consideration of the facts cited in the paper, it may be
 deduced that the skin or mantle is in the Mollusca the fundamental
 organ of respiration, and that a portion of that envelope becomes
 evolved into a speciality as we trace upwards the development of
 the respiratory powers.
    Upon the dorsal aspect of the liver-mass is a branched cavity,
that of the renal organ, lined with a spongy tissue, and opening
 externally at the small ori<U+FB01>ce near the anus.
    Organs q/‘Innervation.-These       arein two divisions, one corre.
 sponding to the cerebro-spinal division, the other to the sympathetic
 or ganglionic system of the Vertebrata. The existence of the latter,
it is stated, is now for the first time fully established.   The centres
 of the <U+FB01>rst system are seven pairs and a half of ganglia.         Of the
 seven pairs, <U+FB01>ve are supra-ccsophageal,     two, infra-oesophageal:   the
 single ganglion belongs to the right side and has been named visceral.
There are three nervous collars around the oesophagus, one of which
connects the infra- with the supra-(esophageal.        The total number
of pairs of nerves from the (esophageal centres is twenty-one, and
 there are also four single nerves.
    The sympathetic system exists, and is more or less demonstrable,
in the skin, the buccal mass, and on all the internal organs.            It
consists of a vast number of minute distinct ganglia, varying in size
and form, the largest quite visible to the naked eye, of a bright
orange colour, like the ganglia around the oesophagus, and inter
connected by numerous delicate, white nervous <U+FB01>laments, arranged
in more or less open plexuses.        This beautiful system is connected
with both sets of cesophageal ganglia.
    The authors having found the sympathetic nervous system in
several species of Doris, in Eolis papillosa, and in Arion ater, believe
it to exist in all the more highly organized Mollusca.
    The supra-(esophageal      nervous centres in the Mollusca are in
some instances so concentrated as to have led to the idea that they
form only one mass; in others the ganglia are more or less distinct,
and separated from each other.        Doris has been taken as the repre
sentative of one class, Aplysia of the other, and on a comparison of
both the supra- and infra-oesophageal ganglia of these with each other,
there has been found a close correspondence between them, with the
exception of the visceral ganglion. The single one in Doris is re,
prssented in Aplysia by a pair of ganglia, situated in the posterior
PU?!" 9f the body near the root of the branchiae.     The supra-oesopha.

                                     160
geal ganglia in the Lamellibranchiata appear homologous          with those
of Doris.
    Having determined the existence of a true sympathetic or organic
nervous system in Doris, the authors feel themselves more in a
position to trace a parallelism between the (esophageal nervous
centres of these Mollusca and the cerebro-spinal system of the Ver
tebrata, and accordingly they <U+FB01>nd there is a strict analogy between
them, even to the individual pairs of ganglia of which they re
spectively consist, the general result being that the whole of the
ganglia, grouped around the oesophagus in these Mollusca, answers
to the encephalon, and a small portion of the enrachidion,           of the
Vertebrate.
    Organs of the Senses.—The         auditory capsules are microscopic,
composed of two concentric vesicles, the inner enclosing numerous,
oval, nucleated otolithes.      The eyes are minute black dots. beneath
the skin, attached by a pedicle to a‘small ganglion.              They are
made up of a cup of pigment, receiving from behind the nerve, and
lodging in front a lens, having in advance of it a cornea, the whole
enclosed by a <U+FB01>ne capsule.       The authors believe they have shown
the dorsal tentacles to be the olfactory organs.
    The organs of touch are, the general surface of the skin, but
more particularly the oral tentacles or veil.        Taste is most probably
located in the lips and channel of the mouth, the tongue being a
prehensile organ, and ill-adapted as the seat of such a function.
     In conclusion, the authors comment on the high organization of
 the Doridw, and express their belief that the genus, as at present
understood, will require to be broken up into several groups.

     1. " Remarks on certain points in Experiments on the Diffrac
 tion of Light.” By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S. &c.,
 Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford. Re
 ceived Nov. 10, 1851.                            I
     The chief object of this communication was to examine into the
 experimental evidence adduced in a recent paper by Lord Brougham
  (Phil. Trans, 1850, Part 1.), without at all entering on the question
  of the peculiar theory therein proposed, solely with the view of in
  quiring how far the actual new facts adduced, when simply stated
  and divested of the peculiar theoretical language in which they are
  delivered, do or do not militate against the undulatory theory.
      The author had devoted a portion of the summer to a careful
  repetition of all the chief experiments described in the paper referred
  to, in some of which, however, he had been unable to reproduce the
  results described.    After referring to the preliminary experiments

                                    161
 described  in that paper, and the attempt there made to refute the
 theory of interferences, he remarks, that the theory of interferences
 explains perfectly both 'the internal and external fringes of a shadow ;
that the breadth of the fringes has no dependence on the length of
route of the rays, but it has on the angle at which they intersect;
and that interference also perfectly explains the fringes, even when
the action is wholly on one side of the ray or edges.
   Passing from these points of confessedly less importance, the
author proceeds to consider the most material and fundamental ex
periment, in which, when fringes are formed by the edge of an opake
body, if a second edge be placed at a greater distance along the ray,
from the origin, on the same side as the <U+FB01>rst edge, it produces no
change in the fringes; but on the opposite side it does, the fringes
being shifted in position towards the <U+FB01>rst side ; or, in other words,
that the second edge, in the one case, has no power of producing
further diffraction, in the other it has; and which has been viewed
as supporting the theory of a peculiar action exerted by the edge
upon the ray passing near it, by which it is disposed or indisposcd
for further <U+FB02>eeure according to the conditions just expressed.
   With reference to the edges on opposite sides, he observes, that
when they are at the same distance from the origin, and form there
a narrow aperture, they give (as is well known) fringes on each side
extending into the shadow, with a white centre.           As one edge is
removed successively further from the origin along the ray and nearer
to the screen, the fringes on that side dilate, become faint, and at
length disappear; so that beyond a certain distance there remain
only the fringes on the other side, or on that of the edge nearest
the origin; which diverge further into the shadow on that side as
the breadth of the effective aperture is diminished.          In this way,
then, the second edge, if beyond the limits of distance just men‘
tioned, will cause an appearance of fringes on the side towards the
<U+FB01>rst edge, diverging into the shadow.
   When the two edges are at the same distance from the origin,
forming a narrow aperture, the nature of the fringes is perfectly ex
plained and reduced to quantitative results by Fresnel’s theory.
When the second edge is placed at a greater distance along the ray,
this would be equivalent to a wide aperture placed obliquely to the
direction of the ray, so as to be effectively as narrow as before. On
the undulatory theory, this particular case has not been actually re—
duced .to calculation, and it appears that it would certainly involve
most complicated and dif<U+FB01>cult analysis to do so.          It has however
been treated in a general way by Fresnel himself (Mémoire sur la
Diffraction, Mém. de l’Instit., tom. v. note, p. 452), who points out
the general conditions for determining the condition of a fringe, and
shows that the fringes will in this case undergo a modi<U+FB01>cation, and
will not be symmetrical,    but more expanded on one side than on the
other; which exactly agrees with observation.
   After some remarks having the same bearing on other facts and
propositions in the paper referred to, the author concludes by ob.
serving,-l have thus, I trust, with perfect impartiality, gone through

                                   162
all the main experimental points of the investigation ; and, upon the
whole, I can perceive nothing substantiated which is positively irre
concileable with the principle of interference ; while the new modi<U+FB01>
cations of the phzenomena here presented, so far as'general consi
derations can be relied on, seem suf<U+FB01>ciently conformable to the
undulatory theory ; but as to their more ezact quantitative explana
tion, no de<U+FB01>nitive opinion can be pronounced until certain analytical
investigations   of great length and complexity shall have been gone
through; by which alone theory can be brought into exact and
satisfactory comparison with experiment.

tain C. M. Elliot, M.E., F.R.S.       Received Dec. 18, 1851.
    The discussion of the barometric observations at St. Helena by
Colonel Sabine having clearly and decidedly shown the moon’s in
<U+FB02>uence on the atmosphere, the author determined to discuss in a
similar manner the barometric observations at Singapore. The re
sults of this discussion are given in the present communication.
    In order that a comparison might be made between the results at
Singapore and at St. Helena, he copied to a considerable extent the
form of the different lunar tables drawn up by Colonel Sabine in his
paper published in the Philosophical Transactions.
    The observatory at Singapore was in latitude 1° 18’ 32” N. and
 longitude 103°56' 30” E. of Greenwich. The cistern of the baro
 meter, one of Newman’s, having a tube 0'532 inch in diameter, was
 a few feet above high-water mark.        The observations, during the
 whole of 1841 and the early part of 1842 and that of 1843, were
made at every tWQ hours; during the remainder of the time, to the
close of 1845, at every hour.
    The diurnal variation of the barometer having been eliminated, by
 deducting the mean monthly height at each hour, from the height
 given by observation, the residual quantities were arranged in tables;
 and the observation corresponding the nearest in time to the moon’s
 superior culmination for each day being marked as 0 hour of lunar
 time, the whole were again rearranged in tables according to lunar
 hours.    The variation or range of the mean of the sums of the dif
ferences thus arranged is exhibited in a table, in the last column of
which are given the means of all the hours for each period of six
months.      In a second table are given the differences between these
 mean results in the last column of the preceding table and the num
bers corresponding to the several hours in the other columns.
    The means of the complete years of observation, 1841, 1844,
 1845, are shOWn in a third table, in which are also given the means
of the <U+FB01>rst six months of 1842 and 1843, during which two-hourly
observations were made, and the means of the latter halves of these
years, during which the observations were made hourly.
    The means of the twenty-four months of the two-hourly observa
tions, and of the thirty-six months of the hourly observations, are
given in Table IV.       Finally, Table V. exhibits the results of the
 observations of three years, so combined as to show the effect on

                                    163
the barometer, of the moon when similarly situated with reference
both to its superior and inferior passage;     In a column of this table
are given the results of two years’ observations at St. Helena, ex
tracted from Colonel Sabine’s paper. From a comparison, it appears

    A paper   was read, entitled, “ On the Blood-proper      and Chylo
aqueous    Fluid of Invertebrate Animals."       By Thomas Williams,
M.D.      Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S. &c. Re
ceived Dec. 18, 1851.
    In this paper the author has accumulated numerous observations,
founded upon dissection and microscopic inquiry, to prove that there
exist in invertebrate animals two distinct kinds of nutrient <U+FB02>uids;
that in some classes of this sub-kingdom these two <U+FB02>uids coexist in
the same organism, though contained in distinct systems of con
 duits, while in others they become united into one.         The author
proposes to distinguish these two orders of <U+FB02>uids under the denomi
 nations of the blood-proper and Mylo-aqueous <U+FB02>uid. The former is
 always contained in de<U+FB01>nitively organized (walled) blood-vessels,
 and having a determinate circulatory movement; the latter, with equal
 constancy, inchambers and irregularcavities and cells,communicating
 invariably with the peritoneal space, having not a determinate cir
 culation, but a to-and-fro movement, maintained by muscular and
 ciliary agency. He then adduces evidence, derived from dissection,
 in proof of the statement that the system of the blood-proper does
 not exist under any form, the most rudimentary, below the Echino
 dermata; that, in other words, the system of the true blood, or of
 the blood-proper, begins at the Echinodermata.          The author then
  shows that below the Echinodermata, namely in the families of Polypes
  and Acalephaa, the digestive and circulatory systems are identi<U+FB01>ed,
  and that consequently the external medium is admitted directly into
  the nutrient <U+FB02>uids.    He considers that this circumstance constitutes
  a fundamental distinction between the chylo-aqueous         system and
  that of the blood-proper, into which, under no conditions, is the ex
  ternal inorganic element directly introduced.
     He conceives that his observations su<U+FB02>ice to establish the law,
  with reference to the chylo-aqueous <U+FB02>uid, that in every class in
  which it exists, it is charged more or less abundantly with organized
  corpuscles.   This is an invariable fact in the history of this <U+FB02>uid.
  His inquiries show that these corpuscles are marked by distinctive
  microscopic characters, not in di<U+FB02>’erent classes and genera only, but

                                      164
  in  different species, entitling these bodies to great consideration in
                                                                           '
  the establishment of species.
     The paper then proceeds to demonstrate the proposition, that in
  those classes, as in the Echinodermata, Entozoa and Annelida, in
 which, in the adult animal, these two orders of <U+FB02>uids coexist, though
 distinct, in the same individual, there prevails between them, as
 respects their magnitude or development, an inverse proportion ; that
 while, as instanced in the Echinoderms, the chylo-aqueous <U+FB02>uid
 <U+FB01>lling the ciliated space between the stomach and integument is
  considerable in volume, the blood-proper and its system are litlle
  evolved; that while, as in the Entozoa, the chylo-aqueous <U+FB02>uid is
  still the most important <U+FB02>uid element in the organism, the blood
  system is proportionally rudimentary; that in the Annelida, espe
  cially the higher species of that class, the chylo-aqueous <U+FB02>uid almost
  disappears, while the system of the true blood acquires, illustrating
 the law of inverse proportidn, a correspondingly-augmented develop
  ment. The author then states, that the system of the chylo-aqueous
 <U+FB02>uid does not exist in the adult, but only in the larva state of the
 higher members of the articulated series, such as the Myriapoda,
  Insecta and Crustacea.
     In Myriapods and Insects, he has observed that the peritoneal
  space is occupied by a <U+FB02>uid which does not communicate with, and
  is distinct in composition from, the contents of the true blood-vessels.
     This peritoneal <U+FB02>uid, however, in these classes disappears at a.
  subsequent stage of growth.       Thus the author thinks that a con
 tinuous chain, through the medium of the fluids, is established be
 tween the Echinoderms at one extreme and the Crustacea at the
 other.      These classes he proposes to connect together under the
 designation of the double <U+FB02>uid series, corresponding to the radiate
 and articulate series of systematic zoologists.
     Returning to the standard of the Echinoderms, where the system
 of the blood-proper <U+FB01>rst appears in the zoological scale, he shows
 that at this point the Molluscan chain diverges from the radiate and
 articulate chain, and may be indicated, in contradistinction from
 the latter, as the single-<U+FB02>uid series. The author’s observations lead
 him to believe, with Professor Milne-Edwards, that in all Molluscs,
 from the Tunicata to the Cephalopods, the chamber of the perito
 neal is continuous with the channels of the circulation, and that
 consequently the <U+FB02>uids observed in these parts are one and the same
<U+FB02>uid, establishing the singleness of the <U+FB02>uid system of the body; and
 this conclusion is corroborated by additional evidence drawn from
microscopic examinations.
     He then recapitulates the results of his researches, and maintains
that the base of the invertebrated kingdom of animals is formed of
all those inferior series which rank below the Echinoderms; and
that this series is distinguished from the Molluscan, in which also
the <U+FB02>uid system is single, by the important circumstance that in the
former, unlike the Mollusca., the digestive and circulatory system
are identi<U+FB01>ed, or confounded into a single system ; that at the Echino

                                      165
  derms the series divaricates into the double-<U+FB02>uid series and single
  <U+FB01>uid series. the former coinciding with the radiate and articulate
  class, and joining the Vertebrate. through the Crustacea; the latter
  running parallel with the Molluscan order, and connecting itself to
  the Vertebrate. through the Cephalopods.
     The <U+FB02>uids of the zoophytic series are invariably corpusculated,
  but the corpuscles cannot yet be reduced to any de<U+FB01>nite type of
  conformation.     In the Medusan series these bodies become more
  de<U+FB01>nitiver organized. The author then demonstrates, that through
  out the whole, radiate and articulate classes, wherever it is found,
 the cbylo-aqueous <U+FB02>uid is richly corpusculated, or in other words,
 charged with <U+FB02>oating morphotic elements, which, from the constancy
 of their characters in different species, become ,grounds for speci<U+FB01>c
 distinctions.    It is stated, that, throughout the Echinoderms, En
 tozoa and Annelida, in which, even in the adult animal, the blood
 proper and the chylo-aqueous <U+FB02>uid, though separate, coexist, the
 latter <U+FB02>uid only is corpusculated, the true blood being invariably
 limpid and perfectly <U+FB02>uid (incorpuscnlated), and almost always the
 seat of the colour; the latter existing as a substance dissolved in
 the <U+FB02>uid, while in no instance does colour develope itself in the
 chylo-aqueous <U+FB02>uid.
     The paper then shows, that at the point where the chylo~aqueous
 system disappears, namely at the Myriapods, the true blood becomes
the vehicle of the corpuscles.                          ,     ._
    And lastly, the author adduces a great variety of observations in
 con<U+FB01>rmation of the statement, that throughout the whole Molluscan
series without exception, coinciding with his
                                                     “
                                                       singlejluid series,”
the <U+FB02>uids are richly charged with corpuscles.
    The paper is accompanied by numerous illustrations, displaying
the characters of the morphotic elements of the circulating <U+FB02>uids of
the Invertebrata.

    A paper    was in part read, entitled,  “ Experimental Researches in

  described, and points out the precautions wiref'inlvanomemr
- of the coils, the thickness and shortness of the conductors,     <U+FB01>le pen
  fect contacts, effected either by soldering or cups of mercury; and
  marks the value of double observations, i. e. observations afforded
  on both sides of zero.    The nature of the impulse on the needles is
  pointed out; being not that of a constant current for a limited or
  unlimited time, but of a given amount of electricity exerted, either
  regularly or irregularly, within a short period; and it is shown ex—
  perimentally that such impulses produce equal results of de<U+FB02>ection,
  and also that when two or more such impulses are given within a
  limited time, the whole are of swing is nearly proportional to their
  number; so that the amount of de<U+FB02>ection, within certain limits, in
  dicates directly, nearly the proportion of electricity which has passed
  as a current through the instrument.
     If a wire be formed into a square of 12 inches in the side, and
 then <U+FB01>xed on an axis passing across the middle parallel to two of its
 sides, and  if, when that axisis  perpendicular to the line of dip, the
 whole  is  rotated, then two of the sides of the rectangle will, in one
 revolution, twice intersect the lines of force of the earth passing
 across or through one square foot of area.      The currents then tend_
 ing to move in the upper and lower parts of the rectangle, will con
 join to urge one current through the wire; and      if   this wire be cut
 at one place close to the axis, and be there connected with a com
 mutator of simple construction, which    is described in the paper, the
 currents round the rectangle may be conveyed away to the galva~
 nometer, and there measured.       Sucha rectangle, constructed of cop
 per wire one- twentieth of an inch in thickness, gave a certain arc of
 swing for one revolution.     If   <U+FB01>ve or ten revolutions were made,
 within the time of vibrating of the needle, nearly <U+FB01>ve or ten times
 this amount of de<U+FB02>ection was produced: the mean result, in the pre
 sent case, was 2°‘624 per revolution.     When the same length of the
 same wire was arranged in oblong or oblate rectangles, so as to
 diminish the inclosed area in different directions as regarded the axis
 of revolution, still the de<U+FB02>ection was in every case proportional to
             included; showing that the e<U+FB02>'ect produced was propor
the areas
tional to the number of lines of force intersected by the moving Wire-.
The same result was obtained when two squares having-areas             the
proportion of    l to9,  were employed.
    When squares of the same area were formed of copper wire of
 different thicknesses, then the eEects of obstruction in the conducting
 part of the system were brought out and measured.             Thus, with
 wires which were 0'05, 0'1 and 02 of an inch in diametei”, and
 therefore in mass as     1,4, and 16, the de<U+FB02>ections were  1,   2‘78, and
 3'45 a result almost identical with that obtained for the same wires
    ;
 by the use of loops and a local magnet in the former researches.
 When two equal rectangles Were compared, one containing a single
 circuit of feet of wire 0‘1 in thickness,,and theother four circuits
             4
 of 16 feet of wire 0% in thickness, then the <U+FB01>rst was {013114190
                                                                 murmur   L

 evoke the largest quantity of electricity; but the second, electricity
 of the highest tension, by the same amount 'of motion': the accord'
 ance of these results with the principles advanced is pointed out.
 The author then refers to the use of wire rings of one or many; can
 volutions, and indicates cases in which they may sUpply valuable
 means of experimental inquiry.                              '        '
    The relative amount 'and disposition of the forces of a magnet
 when it is alone, or associated with other magnets, forms the next
 point in the present paper; and a distinction is <U+FB01>rst taken between
ordinary magnets, which are in<U+FB02>uenced much by other magnets, so
that the amount of their external force varies greatly, and those
which are very hard, where this in<U+FB02>uence is reduced to little or
 nothing.   The'power of a given magnet was measured according to
the method described in the last series, by a loop once passed over
its pole.   A given hard magnet placed in an invariable position,
being thus estimated, was found to have a force equivalent to 16°'3
of de<U+FB02>ection.    Another magnet, having a power of 25°‘7 4, was then
placed close to the <U+FB01>rst in different positions, with like or unlike
poles near together, so as to tend sometimes to exalt its power and
at other times to depress it; and the results observed.     In the ex
tremest favourable case, namely, when the two Were conjoined as a
horseshoe magnet, the force of the <U+FB01>rst magnet was only raised
2°45, which fell directly the dominant magnet was removed ; in the
corresponding adverse case the depression was only 1°.         A very
hard magnet, made by Dr. Scoresby, of 6°'88 power, when under the
in<U+FB02>uence of another of double its power, was not sensibly affected
either way.    When. under the in<U+FB02>uence of one of six times its force,
it could be affected to the extent of nearly 1°.     Ordinary magnets
can be affected to the extent of one half of their power or more; and
indeed   in   extreme cases can be altogether   overruled and invarted.
  From these results the author concludes, that, with perfect uni
changeable magnets, the lines of force (as before de<U+FB01>ned) of different
magnets in favourable positions, coalesce: that there is no increase
of the total force by this coalescence;          the sections bctWeen the
associated poles giving the same sum of power as the sections of
the lines of either magnet alone: that as the external amount of
force of the magnet is not varied, neither is the internal amountlat
all changed: that the increase of power upon a magnetic needle;
or a piece of soft iron, placed between two opposite favourable poles,
is caused by concentration       of the lines which before were diffused,
and not by     the  addition  of  the power represented by the lines of
force of one pole to that of the lines of force of the other.      There is
no more power represented by all the lines of force than before, and
a line ofv force is not in itself more powerful because it coalesces with
a liner of force of another magnet.       In this and in other respects, the
analogy of the magnet with the voltaic pile is perfect.              .

   The paper concludes with some practical remarks upon      the deh
neat'ion- of the forms of the lines of force by iron <U+FB01>lings, and by a
description of the in<U+FB02>ection of the lines by hemispheres of hot and
cold nickel; which the author considers as the corresponding case
to the action of warm and. cold oxygen in-the atmosphere,      applied

                                      " On the Electro-chemical Polarity
 of Gases.” By W. R.         Grove,  Esq., M.A., F.R.S., &e. Received
 January    7, 1852.
    The author refers to the experiments of Faraday on dielectric
 induction, to those of Gassiot on the increase of electrical effects of
 tension, according as the chemical intensities of a voltaic battery
 are increased, and to other results, which, though supporting the
 view of a physico-polar state of gaseous substances intervening be
 tween oppositely electri<U+FB01>ed surfaces, have not hitherto shown any
 change in the arrangement of the gaseous particles dependent upon
 their chemical characteristics.
    The electric or voltaic disruptive discharge has hitherto presented
 only one phenomenon which offers any analogy to electrolysis, viz.
 that observed by Mr. Gassiot and others, of the positive terminal
 being more intensely heated than the negative, when the Voltaic
 discharge passes between metals.        With the voltaic arc the effects
 of heat and the destruction of the terminals so interfere with any
 effects properly due to the transmission of the electric current, that
 it is next to impossible to eliminate the latter; on the other hand,
 with the electric spark from an ordinary machine, the quantity of
 matter acted on is too minute to give satisfactory evidence of the
 changes taking place.        Mr. Grove sought an intermediate degree
 of electrical action, and by the aid of an apparatus of Ruhmkorf for
 producing a powerful secondary current, the results detailed in this
 paper were mainly obtained.
    A polished silver plate is laid on the pump plate of a good air
pump, and a metallic point is attached to the rod passing through a
 collar of leathers at the top of the receiver, the point being adjusted
 at from one~eighth to one-fourth of an inch distance from the plate.
 Caustic potash is kept suspended in the receiver, and a mixture of
 oxygen and hydrogen, or atmospheric air and hydrogen, allowed to
 enter it, and then attenuated until the barometer stands at half an
inch; the discharges from the secondary coil are now made to pass
between the point and the plate, when if the latter be positive it is
oxidated, if negative the spot of oxide is reduced.
    If there be excess of oxygen and little or no hydrogen, oxidation
takes place, whether the plate be positive or negative, though in
different degrees; and if the gas be wholly or mainly hydrogen,
reduction takes place whether the plate be positive or negative.
    At certain intermediate states of mixture rings or zones of alter
nate oxidation and reduction are shown, quite distinguishable from
the ordinary succession of colours of thin plates, and showing
alternations or periods of interference of electrical action.
    The author then gives the results of experiments with several
other metals, of which bismuth was the only one he found to produce
effects anything like equal to the silver, though other metals showed
them in some degree.
   -He also varied the gas or gases employed, and details the results

                                     169
obtained with several gases; among them carbonic oxide is the
most worthy of note, as with it effects are produced similar to those
with the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, viz. oxidation when the
plate was positive, and reduction when it was negative.
    The author’s theory or mode of explaining the results is as follows.
The discharges are successive, not continuous, and antecedent to
each discharge the intervening gas is thrown into a state of chemical
polarity, similar to that which takes place in an electrolyte anterior
to electrolysis; by this means the positive terminal has in juxta
position with it oxygen or an electro-negative gas; the discharge
takes place, and by the super<U+FB01>cial ignition the layer of oxygen com
bines with the metal in contact with it.
    Conversely, when the oxidated surface is negative and in contact
with an electro-positive gas, the heat of the discharge produces re~
duction. The fact of oxidation only taking place when. air or oxygen
alone are present, and reduction only when hydrogen is present, he
considers irreconcilable with the effects being attributable to the dis
charge itself, or to their being regarded as analogous to electrolysis;
 while these phenomena are corroborative of the view he puts forth.
    The author refers to the experiments of Priestley, Karsten and
others, in which spots or marks have been shown to be produced by
electrical discharge. but which do not otherwise bear upon the ob
jects sought to be elucidated by this paper.

     1. " On the Structure of the Stem of Victoria regia."      By Arthur
 Henfrey, F.L.S. &c.        Communicated     by Professor  Edward Forbes,
 F.R.S. Received February 19, 1852.
     The investigation of the anatomy of Victoria regia acquires its
 interest from the fact of the relations which have been pointed out
 to exist between the Nymphaeaceae and some of the undoubted
 Monocotyledonous families, especially also from the researches of
 M. Trécul on the anatomy of Nuphar lutca, which plant that author
 describes as having a stem of the Monocotyledonous type of struc
 ture. Through the unfortunate death of the plant of Victoria regia,
 which had <U+FB02>owered for some time in the gardens of the Royal
 Botanic Society of London, the author had' an opportunity of ex
 amining the anatomy of its stem.        It is an upright rhizome, with
 undeveloped    internodes,   growing by a single terminal bud, appa
 rently perennially,  and  attaining considerable thickness; on the out
  side it bears the remains of the petioles and <U+FB02>ower-stalks, which
  separate by disarticulation, and their remains are found arranged in

                                       170
spiral lines upon the outside, so as to give the short, thick rhizome
the aspect of a piece of a palm stem.     As in Nupbar, the roots are
produced in bundles at the bases of the petioles, and fall OE suc
cessively upwards as the new ones are deVeloped, leaving very con
spicuous scars.   The internal structure of the stem is quite Mono
cotyledonous in its character, presenting no trace of- the arrange;
ment of the vascular bundles into rings of wood; no true WOOdy
<U+FB01>bres, and no cambium layer.       The vascular bundles, which are
composed exclusively of spiral, annular and reticulated ducts sur
rounded by elongated parenchymatous       cellular tissue, are isolated
and arranged just as in M onocotyledons, such as the Palms; and the
outer part of the stem exhibits a cortical parenchyma, much more
like that of the herbaceous rhizomes of the rush-like plants, than
any other known structure; it bears not the least resemblance to
the bark of Dicotyledons.      The results of the investigation show
that Victoria, like Nuphar, has a stern of essentially Monocotyle
donous structure.    The paper was accompanied by drawings illus
trating the general and microscopic anatomy of the stem.

up to 3166 feet above the Sea-Level :" Fifth paper, for the year 1851.
By John Fletcher Miller, Esq., F.R.S. &c. Received March 1, 1852.
   The author states that the results for the past year do not seem to
 call for any particular remarks, and as it appears desirable, as a
general rule, to defer all attempts at deduction until after the com
pletion of the observations, the Tableser 1851 are presented, with
out many notes or comments, in continuation of the series which
have previously appeared in the Transactions of the Society.      The
table for January, l85l, is given as an example of the daily fall of
rain in the district during an excessively wet month, and also as
showing the form of permanently registering the returns from ‘the
various stations, when sent in at the close of each month.     He re
marks that the quantity of 3886 inches precipitated on “ The Stye"
in January 1851, is, he believes, without a parallel in the temperate
zone.

      2. " Further Experiments on Light.” By Henry Lord Brougham,
  F.ll.S., Member of the Institute of France, and of the Royal Aca
  demy of Sciences of Naples.       Received March 5, 1852.
      The author commences this account of his experiments by remark
  ing, that “ it is probable that some may consider the inference to be
 drawn from the following experiments as unfavourable to the doc
  trines of my former paper—I think I can explain the phenomena
 according to those doctrines —but be they ever so repugnant, we are
  of course in search of truth, and have no right even to wish that the
 balance may incline one way rather than another, far less to conceal
 any facts which may a<U+FB01>'ect its inclination.“
     The leading experiment is this :—A speculum is placed in a beam
 of light and is inclined so that the re<U+FB02>ected rays shall make a small
 angle with the surfaces.        Near the speculum the axis of re<U+FB02>ected
 rays coincides with that of the direct rays, but at a greater distance
 the two discs are separate. The speculum being placed horizontally
 across the pencil, coloured fringes appear both on the upper and lower
 side of the re<U+FB02>ected disc.     These two sets of fringes are alike in their
 colours and in the order of their colours, but the upper fringes are
 narrower than the lower, and they diminish in breadth with their
 distance from the disc, while the lower ones increase in breadth with
 their distance.      If only one edge of the speculum is in the pencil
 there are only fringes on one side of the disc.
      It appears that the breadth of the fringes is in some inverse pro
 portion to the breadth of the speculum.        When the speculum is a
 triangle with a very acute angle, the broadest fringes, and those most
 removed from the disc, answer to the points of the speculum where
it is liarrowest, and they increase regularly towards the point which
answers to the acute angle or apex of the speculum.          Their form is
hyperbolic.
     When the edges of the speculum are parallel, the disc near to it
is <U+FB01>lled with groups of fringes which vary in number, in breadth and
in colour, at all the distances from the speculum.         At one distance
they form only a dark line runniiig through the disc, and this is deep
purple when examined closely. At a greater distance the fringes
have other colours, and become broader again; and at a still greater
distance they emerge into the shadow on both sides of the disc.
     The phenomena of re<U+FB01>exion, it is stated, closely resemble those of
<U+FB01>eXiOII. as to the fringes. their colours, their magnitude, their varia
tion at different distances from the bending edges, and at di<U+FB01>'erent
distances of those edges from each other.

                                    173
    A convenient method of examining the variation of the fringes,
whether of re<U+FB01>exion or of <U+FB02>exion, at various distances, is to incline
the screen upon which they are received, so that it crosses the rays
forming the fringes, which are exhibited upon it, at various distances
from the edges. The line which each fringe describes being the
projection of the line which the rays follow that form the fringe, we
can in this manner observe if the course of these rays after <U+FB02>exion is
rectilinear or curvilinear, the projection being, generally speaking, a
line of the same kind with the original line ; and at least never rec
tilinear if that original line is curvilinear.          .              r
    If y=f (m) be the line which the rays follow after <U+FB01>exion; 93 the
                                      s
angle of the screen’s inclination;                 and .z" the abscissa: of
                                      ég—E'gzm;
the line of projection; then its equation is y=f(4/1+m‘l . .2").          If
the curve of the rays be supposed to be the equilateral conic hyper
bola, the radius of curvature in the curve of projection, it is stated,
must be less than that in the original line; and so the curvature
iS'm'ore easily discerned by the eye.      As under no circumstances of
inclination of the screen, and at no part whatever of the course of the
fringes could the author perceive the least difference of form from all
the other parts, he infers, either that the rays follow a rectilinear
course, or that their deviation from it must be very small.
    Though the phenomenon seem to indicate a crossing of the rays
both in <U+FB02>exion and re<U+FB01>exion, at or near the distance at which the
dark or deep purple line is formed, yet the author has never been
able to observe that an obstacle placed between that point and the
speculum (or the bending edges), made the fringes on the opposite
side of the disc at the screen to disappear, but only the fringes on
the same side with itself.
    Referring to Fresnel’s memoir, the author states that the principle
laid down in it, “ that the dilatation of the fringes depends solely upon
the breadth of the aperture,” will not afford an explanation of the
phenomena described in his former paper respecting fringes formed
by edges acting in succession, for he there showed that their breadth
and their distances from the direct rays are in the inverse proportion
of the distance of the edges; and if the edges are so placed that the
rays pass parallel to each other, and not diverging, and the edges are
moved to different distances in the same line, e. g. horizontally, then
their distance from each other vertically being the same, the aperture
is the same at all distances of the edges from each other horizontally,
and yet the breadth of the fringes is inversely as the horizontal di
stance.    Further, where the edges are not placed in succession, but
directly opposite to each other, the breadths of the fringes do not
 appear to follow the exact inverse proportion of the distances of the
 edges (that is the size of the aperture), the observed breadths corre
sponding more nearly with the curve       y=g+ g, x being
                                                              the distance
of the edges, and y the breadth of the fringes.
    The author considers that the internal fringes,       or those of the

                                     174
 shadows of. small bodies, called fringes of, interference, requim a more
 full examination   than they have received in certain respects. As re,
 gards the central space and the two deep blank fringes or intervals
 on each side of it, the remarks that no examination with a magni<U+FB01>er,
 and no inclination of the screen, at all resolves these colours into
 purple as in the dark line before described.       They appear to follow
 a different law from that of the coloured ones as regal“ their breadths
in proportion to their distances from the pin or other small. object,
at least if they are caused by interference, and if the effect of inter-1
ference is inversely as the di<U+FB02>'erence of the length of the rays; f0!

which nowise agrees with the admeasurements.
    The action of transparent plates on the rays, in bending them, re

    A  paper was read, entitled,
the mean effects of the larger Magnetic Disturbances."—No.               II.
By Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., Treas. and V.P.R.S. &c. Re
 ceived March l8, 1852.
    From the discussion of the magnetic observations made at Toronto
 and Hobarton in the years 1843, 44, 45, the author in a former
 paper adduced evidence of the existence of periodical laws by which
 the principal disturbances of the magnetic declination appeared to
be regulated.      Having since had occasion to examine the disturb
 ances of the Declination at the same two stations in the three suc
 ceeding years 1846, 47, 48, he states that he had the satisfaction of

                                      175
<U+FB01>nding’ that the observations of these years con<U+FB01>rm every deduction
which he had ventured to make from the analysis of the disturbances
of the former period ; whilst new and important features have pre
sented themselves in the comparison of the frequency and amount
of the disturbances in diferent years, apparently indicating the
existence of a. periodical variation, which, either from a real or causal
connection, or by a singular coincidence, corresponds precisely, both
in period and epoch, with the variation in the frequency and magnis
tude of the solar spots, recently announced by M. Schwabe as the
result of his systematic and long-continued observations.
    The method pursued in examining the laws of the Declination~
disturbances in 1846, 47, 48, is the same as that adopted in the three
preceding years.       Every hourly observation which was found to
di<U+FB02>'er a certain amount from the mean value of the Declination in
the same month and at the same hour was, as before, separated from
the rest.   The number of observations thus separated in the period
commencing July 1, 1843, and ending July I, 1848, was at Toronto
3940, and at Hobarton 3469, being respectively 1 in 9'43 at Toronto,
and 1 in 1055 at Hobarton, of the whole number of hourly observa
tions.   The disturbed observations being distributed into the several
hours, mOnths, and years in which they had occurred, their numbers
and aggregate values in each particular hour, month, and year, were
ascertained. They were then divided into easterly and westerly de<U+FB02>ec
tions, and the same process of distributionwas gone through with each
of the divisions.    The mean hourly, monthly and yearly number and
aggregate values in the whole period were then taken as the respec
tive units,and the ratios to these units computed for each of the hours,
months and years;~whereby          the relations, whether of numbers or
of aggregate    values  in different hours, different months, and different
years, were shown.
    The results thus obtained are discussed separately in the follow
ing order  :—
    I. Inequality  or variation in the number and aggregate values of
the disturbed    observations in diferent hours.       This examination is
 made by classing together—1st, easterly disturbances           at Toronto
 and westerly at Hobarton; and 2nd, westerly at Toronto and east
 erly at Hobarton.
    From the <U+FB01>rst classi<U+FB01>cation, it appears that at both stations there
 are fewer disturbances,     and their aggregate values are less in the
 hours of the day than in those of the night; that 9 P.M. is the hour
 of the maximum of frequency and also of value at Toronto, and
 11 EM. at Hobarton;       and that the periods of minima are between
 2 and 3 P.1u. at Toronto, and between 5 and 6 am. at Hobarton.
 It appears further that the average value has a similar law of varia
 tion to that of the number and aggregate value.
    The second classi<U+FB01>cation shows that at Hobarton the contrast both
 in frequency and aggregate value is still between the hours of
 the day and those of the night, the ratios being, however, in this
 case greater than unity during the former hours, and less than unit
 during the latter, contrary to what takes with the easterly disturb

                                    176
ances   : at Toronto the contrast is between the hours from noon to
 midnight, and those from midnight to noon, the ratios being greater
 than unity during the latter hours, and less than unity during the
former.     In both cases the variation in the ratios appears to be de
pendent on the hours of local, not on those of absolute time.
    From a table showing the ratios of easterly aggregate values to
westerly at Toronto, and of westerly to easterly at Hobarton, it ap
pears that, at both stations, the de<U+FB02>ection (due to disturbance) of
the end of the magnet of the same name as the magnetic latitude
is to the west during the hours of the day or from 5 A.M. to
5 P.M.: at a little before 6 P.M. at Toronto, and a little after 6
at Hobarton, the de<U+FB02>ections pass through zero (or the undisturbed
position of the magnet) into easterly de<U+FB02>ections of that end.        The
magnitude of those de<U+FB02>ections rapidly augments to a maximum at
9 P.M. at Toronto, and at 10 EM. at Hobarton; they again pass
through zero between 4 and 5 A.M. ; and attain the westerly maxi—
mum at 7 A.M., the variation in the magnetic direction due to the
disturbances depending, like those of number and value, on   '
                                                                the hour
of local time.
   II. Inequality or variation in the number and aggregate values of
the disturbed observations in di<U+FB02>'erent months.        From the tables
which are given, it is obvious that there is a systematic variation
in the numbers and aggregate values of the disturbances in the dif
ferent months; and at both stations the easterly and westerly ratios,
separately considered, dilier little in the characters which they assign
to the variation, from the ratios of the two combined.         The most
distinctly marked feature is that the disturbances are less frequent
and have a less aggregate value in November to February at T0
ronto, and in May to August at Hobarton, than in the other months
respectively: so that the disturbances are governed by a law de
pending either on the period of the year, or on local season, not on
absolute time.
    III. Variation in the number and aggregate values of the dis
turbed observations in di<U+FB02>'erenl years.       Taking the ratios of the
numbers and aggregate values of the disturbed           observations   at
Toronto and Hobarton in the different years (from 1843 to 1848),
to the average annual number and aggregate value respectively, it
appears that there is a remarkable correspondence in the variation of
 these ratios in different years at the two stations; and that at each,
both ratios increase progressively from 1843 to 1848, with the single
 exception of 1845, in which there is a small diminution in that of
the number and also that of the value.          Taking the mean of the
ratios at Toronto and Hobarton, the ratio of the number increases
from 0'60 in 1843 to 1'43 in 1848, and the ratio of the value from
0'52 in 1843 to 1'51 in 1848, the variation in each having much
more the aspect of a periodical inequality than of an accidental va
riation.    Looking to the theoretical importance of the existence of     r
a periodical inequality of this nature, affecting at the same time, and
in the same manner, parts of the globe most remote from each other,
the author refers to the con<U+FB01>rmation it may obtain from contempora

                                   177
neous observations    at other stations.   Pending such con<U+FB01>rmations
he remarks that this progressive increase in the amount of disturb
ance at Toronto and Hobarton, between the years 1843 and 1848,
derives great additional interest and importance from its apparent
connection with an equally remarkable progressive increase which
took place at the same two stations, in the magnitude of the diurnal
range of the Declination in the same years. From the mean magni
tude of the diurnal variation of the Declination in each month, tables
are deduced showing the mean magnitude or ranges in the four
months constituting the respective seasons, and in the twelve months
constituting the year, in each year from 1843 to 1848, both at T0
ronto and at Hobarton.      From these tables it appears that at each
station, for each of the seasons and for the whole year, the diurnal
range of the Declination had a progressive increase during that
period ; the increase for the whole year being from 8"90 in 1843 to
12"04 in 1848 at Toronto, and from 7"66 to 11"43 at Hobarton.
In support of the opinion that these progressive increases in the
range of the diurnal variation at two stations separated from each
other by nearly half the surface of the globe are independent and
corresponding measures of a general phenomenon, the author ad
duces the results obtained by Dr. Lamont from the observations at
Munich. From these it appears that the mean range of the diurnal
variation in monthly periods at Munich increased progressively from
7‘82 in 1843 to 1115 in 1848.
   The author remarks that the increase so distinctly marked in the
two classes of phenomena between the years 1843 and 1848 tends
to indicate a causal connection subsisting between the disturbances
and the regular diurnal variation.     If we suppose the diurnal varia
tion to be divided into two portions, one of which is nearly uniform
in amount throughout the year (at the same station), whilst the
other has a hemispherical phase, developed in either hemisphere ac
cording as the sun is in the northern or the southern signs,_it is the
former of these two portions which sustains the variation consistent
with and apparently related to the variation in the number and values
of the disturbances.
    That the progressive increase in the mean monthly diurnal range,
from 1843 to 1848, was not con<U+FB01>ned at Toronto and Hobarton to
the Declination only, but took place likewise in the diurnal variations
of the Inclination and Total Force, is shown by the tables which are
g iven.
   In conclusion the author observes, that “ in our present ignorance
of the physical agency by which the periodical magnetic variations
are produced, the possibility of the discovery of some cosmical con
nection which may throw light on a subject as yet so obscure should
not be altogether overlooked.     As the sun must be recognised as at
least the primary source of all magnetic variations which conform to
a law of local hours, it seems not unreasonable that in the case of
other variations also, whether of irregular occurrence or of longer
period, we. should also look in the <U+FB01>rst instance to any periodical
variationby which we may learn that the sun is affected, to see

                                      178
 whether any coincidence of period; orepodh is traceable.           Now the
 facts of the solar spots, as they have been recently made known to
 us by the assiduous and systematic labours of Schwabe, present us
 with phenomena-which appear to indicate the existence of some
 periodical aEection of an outer envelope, or photosphere, of the sun;
 and it is certainly a most striking coincidence that the period, and
 the epochs of maxima and minima, which M. Schwabe has assigned
 to the variation of the solar spots, are absolutely identical with those
which have been here assigned to the magnetic variations.” From
the results of his observations of the solar spots from the years
 1826 to 1850, M. Schwabe has deriVed the conclusion that “the
numbers in the table leave no room to doubt that, at least from the
years 1826 to 1850, the solar spots have shown a. period of about
ten years, with maxima in 1828, 1837, and 1848, and minima in
 1833 and 1843.”        M. Schwabe has not been able to derive from the
indications of the thermometer or barometer any sensible connection
between climatic conditions and the number of spots.             The same
remark would of course hold good in respect to the connection of
climatic conditions with the magnetic inequalities, as their periodical
variation corresponds with that of the solar spots.        But it is quite
conceivable that affections of the gaseous envelope of the sun, or
the causes occasioning those- affections, may give rise to sensible
magnetieal effects at the surface of our planet, without producing
 sensible thermic effects.                                             ,

    The following communications were read :—                               .
    1. “Report of the general process adopted in Graduating and:
Comparing the Standard Meteorological Instruments for the Kerr
Observatory.” By Mr. John Welsh. Communicated by Col. Sabine
on the part of the Committee of Recommendations             of the Govern
ment Grant.         Received May 6, 1852. ‘
    In offering to the Committee a short statement of the progress
made at the Kew Observatory in the construction and veri<U+FB01>cation
of thermometers, I shall <U+FB01>rst describe generally the method pursued
in the graduation of standard instruments.
   The plan of operations hitherto adopted has been that proposed
by M. Regnault, and consists essentially of the following steps           :-
1st. Calibration of the tube: 2nd. Graduation of timescale: and
3rd.     The determination of the scale coef<U+FB01>cients.
    1.. Calibration.-—-A tube having been selected as beingtolerably free?
from all visible defects, 11 short column of mercury, generally less
than. one inch in length, is introduced.         The tube is then. attached
to  the  frame   of  Perreaux’s dividing-engine, and by means of <U+FB02>exible
tubing is put in connection at both ends with indie-rubber bags, the
pressure upon. which can. be regulated by means of screWs.               The.

                                   =179
mercury is then brought to the part of the tube where the gradua
tion is proposed to commence.         The cutting-frame of the engine
carries also a small microscope with cross wires in its focus; on
turning the dividing-screw, the microscope-wire is brought to coins
side with the <U+FB01>rst end of the mercury, and the screw is then turned
forward until the wire reaches the second end; the length of the
column is thus given in revolutions of the screw.      By means of the
indie-rubber bags, the mercury is made to move along the tube until
the <U+FB01>rst eml-ccincidesv again with the microscope-wire; the length
of the column is again measured, and the mercury again moved for
ward; the same process being repeated until the column has been
measured for each length of itself through the whole extent of the
proposed scale.     Permanent marks are made on the glass at the
points of commencement and ending of the calibration.         If the pro
gress of the numbers shows any considerable irregularity in the
tube, and as a veri<U+FB01>cation of the <U+FB01>rst set of measures, it is well to
repeat the calibration, commencing in this case at a point one-half
the length of the column in advance of the original starting-point.
A series of measures interpolated from the two sets may then he
adopted.     Some experience is necessary in order to bring with faci
lity the end of the mercury exactly to the wire of the microscope;
but when care is taken to use very pure mercury and clean tubes,
the operation can generally, after a little trouble, be accomplished
with much accuracy. M. Regnault, I believe, recommends that the
motion of the mercury should be regulated by the breath, a drying
substance being interposed to prevent moisture entering the tube.
This method was employed for some of the <U+FB01>rst instruments made
at Kew, but was abandoned in favour of the elastic bags.
    2. Graduation—The measured lengths of the column of mercury
in its successive steps along the tube correspond to equal volumes.
Assuming that the calibre of the tube does not vary throughout the
small length of the calibrating column, if we divide the spaces oc
 cupied successively by the mercury into an equal number of parts,
it is evident that the divisions will represent the same capacity,
although they may be of very different lengths.      Before making the
tube into a thermometer, the divisions of the scale may be veri<U+FB01>ed
by introducing a longer column of mercury, and examining whether
 the column occupies an equal number of divisions in different parts
 of the scale.   If there should be any irregularity, a table of correc
 tions may readily be formed.      It will generally be found, however,
 that if the operations   have  been  performed with care, and the tube
 isnot vary faulty, no correction will be necessary. The divisions
 are cut with a <U+FB01>ne needle-point upon a coating of engravers’ varnish,
 and afterwards etched with <U+FB02>uoric acid.       The required dimensions
 of the bulb .may be found approximately by weighing a measured
 length of the mercurial column, and from the known expansion of
 mercury and its speci<U+FB01>c gravity computing the capacity of the bulb.
   v 3. Determination of the scale coe<U+FB02>icient.--The thermometer having
 been <U+FB01>lled with mercury, we have an instrument the divisions of
 whose         represent equal increments of the volume of the <U+FB02>uid,

                                     180
   but are entirely of an arbitrary value.     If new we determine the
   points of the scale at'which the mercury stands in freezing and boil
   ing water, We can immediately convert the arbitrary scale-readings
   into degrees of the ordinary scales of temperature. If a be the scale
   reading for the freezing-point, and b that for the boiling-point, the
   temperature    by Fahrenheit’s scale corresponding      to any reading
                           The freezing-point is determined     by placing
   n=(Z___:)l80+32.
  the thermometer in <U+FB01>nely-pounded        ice, from which the water is
  drained off as it melts. The boiringwipoint is ascertained by the form
  of apparatus employed by M. Regnault; the temperature observed
  is that of steam, whose elasticity is the same as that of the atmo
  sphere.    A small siphon water-gauge communicating with the in
  terior of the vessel gives notice to the observer when the ebullition
  is being carried on too rapidly.    The steam is generated from di
  stilled water.    The height of the barometer is observed at the time
  of the experiment, and the correction to a uniform height of 30
  inches (reduced to 32°) is found from Regnault’s table.        In deter—
  mining the <U+FB01>xed points, the stems of the thermometers are kept
  vertical; if the subsequent comparisons with other instruments are
  made in the same position, no error will arise from the expansion of
  the bulb caused by the pressure of the column of mercury. If, how
  ever, the thermometers are intended to be used in any other than a
  vertical position, it becomes necessary to determine the <U+FB01>xed points
  also in a horizontal position.
      In accordance with the plan here sketched, <U+FB01>fteen thermometers
 have been completed with arbitrary scales. About thirty more tubes
 have been calibrated, and the bulbs attached and <U+FB01>lled, but the scales
 not yet divided.     The principal object in graduating the tube with
  an arbitrary scale is the convenience it affords of testing the divi
 sions before it is converted into a thermometer.     It is now proposed
 to divide the scale at once into Fahrenheit degrees after the ther
 mometer has been made, and to test the accuracy of the divisions
 afterwards by detaching a portion of the mercurial column and
 making it move along the tube.        If the scale should not then be
 found correct, a table of its errors can be formed and furnished with
 the instrument, or the thermometer rejected.       The scales of these
thirty thermometers have not yet been proceeded with, as it is
 desirable, before doing so, to allow the freezing-point to have
attained a permanent position.       A few divisions have been cut on
the tubes near the freezing-point, and the reading with reference to
this short arbitrary scale taken from time to time in melting ice.
The period elapsed since the construction of the thermometers has
been too short to afford as yet much information as to the probable
constancy     of the freezing-points. They have, however, already
shown generally a tendency to rise, in some cases to the extent of
nearly 0°'3 Fahr., but in most of them it does not yet exceed 0°‘1
or 0°‘2.     Another peculiarity in connection with the freezing-point
has shown itself in almost all the thermometers yet tried.        After a
thermometer has been exposed for some weeks to the ordinary tem

                                        181
  .perature  of the air, if its freezing-point be ascertained, and it be
 vthen  suddenly exposed for a short time to the temperature of boil
  ing water, and again immediately placed in ice, it-is found that-the
  latter determination of the freezing-point will be .lower than the
  former by a very appreciable amount, generally betWeen 0°‘l' and
  0°‘2 Fahr. The freezing-point'does not recover its previous posi
  tion for some time, probably two or three weeks. This peculiar dis
 ‘placement'of the/freezing-point has been found to take place also in
 the case of a standard by Troughton and Simms belonging tothe
  Royal Society. The freezing-point of this instrument, before being
 raised to the temperature of boiling water, was 3225, afterwards'it
 had fallen to 32'15.         This displacement of the' freezing-pointvhas
 been ,remarked by Mr. Sheepshanks in the course of his experiments
 on standard thermometers*.          From the experiments now in progress,
                                                                                 H
 it is to be hoped that, after a time, some approximation may be
 made to the laws of these perplexing phaenomena.
     The apparatus employed for comparing the indications of differ
 ent thermometers, consists of a cylindrical glass vase 15 inches deep
 and 81} inches in diameter,-a stand for supporting the thermometers
 under comparison, and a means of agitating the water in such a way
 as completely to assimilate the temperature throughout the vessel.
 The stand for the thermometer is a vertical rod, supported by a
 small tripod resting on the bottom of the vase. The thermometers
 are suspended from hooks sliding on this rod, and adjustable to any
 height; they are arranged, with their bulbs at the same height in
 a circle 3 inches diameter round the rod, and kept <U+FB01>xed with suf<U+FB01>
 cient <U+FB01>rmness below by being strapped with elastic bands against a
 projecting six-rayed frame attached to the supporting rod.                  Six
 thermometers of almost any form and length can thus be compared
at once.     The agitator is a <U+FB02>at ring of tinned iron, about 2 inches
broad, <U+FB01>tting easily within the vase, and connected by four light rods
with a similar ring at top, which serves as a handle.             A packing of
india-rubber is placed on the outer ,rim of the plunger to prevent
jarring against the glass. The <U+FB02>at tin ring is out half across at several
places, and the corners bent in various ways, so that when moved
upwards and downwards the water is driven in all directions.                The
dimensions of the agitator are so arranged, that no part of it can
possibly touch the thermometers when in operation.                    The vase,
containing 'water, the stand with thermometers, and the agitator,
are mounted upon a wooden revolving stand.              The depth of water in
the vase is always suf<U+FB01>cient to include the whole of the columniof
mercury, the scales being observed through the Water. ‘ln’taking
the observations, the observer, after agitating the water briskly for
some time, turns the revolving stand till each thermometer is"brought
successively opposite to his eye, reading off the scales as quickly as
possible to an assistant, who writes down the numbers.              Proceeding
in this way, I <U+FB01>nd that six thermometers can be read 03' and recorded
easily in 20 seconds.        It is of course desirable to make more than

        one set-0f readings for each temperature ; and in; order to avoid as
        much as possible the changes which may occur during the reading
        05', it is well to reverse the order of observing the instruments, that
        is, to readthem alternately in the order one to silt,v and six to one.
           The following table contains the results ofcomparisons of- six
        thermometers; and will show the accuracy which may be obtained
        by- themethod of comparison'just described; it will also exhibit the
        accordancein the indications of instruments graduated according to
        Regnault’s process.      Each result is the mean of six comparisons.
        No optical assistance Was used in reading off the scales. The free
        zingppoints of all the instruments were determined on the same day,
        after the vcomparisons _were made.

shall describe them separately.
   I. Mercurial Thermometers.-These were divided into degrees of
Fahrenheit’s scale in the following mannerz—The tube was <U+FB01>rst
calibrated in the way already described in my former report on the
construction of thermometers (dated March 22) ; marks being made
on the tube at each extremity of the calibrated space.    The bulb was
then made and the mercury introduced by the glass-blower, the di
mensions of the bulb and the quantity of <U+FB02>uid being made as nearly
as possible to correspond with the scale proposed to be made.       The
thermometer was then placed in melting ice and the freezing-point
approximately set off with an ink mark; a similar mark being also
made for a temperature of between 95° and 100°.        A short arbitrary
scale of four or <U+FB01>ve divisions was then divided at each of those points.
The thermometer was then again placed in ice and the freezing
point determined accurately with reference to the lower short scale;
and comparisons with two standard thermometers in water deter
mined the value of the upper short scale.      Let OP be the calibrated
portion of the tube, 0 being the point of commencement, F the
         O                     F                                        H   '

distances OF, FH, HP be measured by the screw of the dividing en
gine.   Let RI, R2, R5, 810., Rf, &c., Rb, &c. be the lengths, in revo
lutions of the dividing screw, of the calibrating column of mercury
for each successive step in its progress along the tube during the
process of calibration ; Rf being the length of the step in which the
point F occurs, and R,. that in which H occurs.          The values of
R1, R,, &c. have been registered in the process of calibration ; OF
and OH have been obtained independently; the second measure
ment of OP, when compared with the sum of all the R’s, will show
with what exactness“ the column of mercury has been passed through
its own length in its progress along the tube. Let r, be the number
of revolutions between the <U+FB01>rst end of the step
and similarly    for the step      We have then _

equivalent to one length of the calibrating column,—this being of
course constant for each length along the tube on the supposition of
equalincrements of volume for equal increments of temperature.

capacity, which might take place in   a    length equal to the difference found, this
ditl’erence being in perhaps no case more than “1,1,- or <U+FB02>, inch.

   II. Spirit Thermometers.—In the graduation of mercurial thermo
meters, the practice     to consider the increments of volume to be
                                  is
proportional to increments of temperature.     If this were assumed in
the case of spirit thermometers, very serious errors would be the
result; eVen within moderate ranges of temperature.           Dr. Miller
having considered alcohol, as on the whole, the best <U+FB02>uid for ther
mometers intended to measure very low'temperatures, [was supplied
by him with some which he had himself prepared with great'care, its
speci<U+FB01>c gravity being 0'7 96 at 60°   ahr.    The <U+FB01>rst step to be taken
                                                                   F
was the determination of the law of expansion of the <U+FB02>uid in glass,
as compared with that of mercury.       For this purpose       tube was                              a
calibrated and divided with an arbitrary scale according to Reg
nault’s process: its divisions were found, upon veri<U+FB01>cation, to be of
exactly equal capacity throughout. The tube was then furnished
with a bulb, of the same dimensions as those intended to be sup
plied to the Admiralty, and <U+FB01>lled with the alcohol.        This thermo
meter was marked S.       E. Comparisons were then made between
                                    9
the readings of this instrument and those of         standard mercurial              a
thermometer, through as large a range        temperature as was found  of

   The time at my disposal was scarcely suf<U+FB01>cient to test the ther
mometers supplied to the Arctic Expedition so completely as I should
have wished.     The mercurial thermometers were after their gradua
tion compared incidentally at two or three different temperatures,
and found to agree generally to 0°"l Fahr. They were all placed in
melting ice, when it‘was found that four of them read exactly 32°,
the other three, viz. Nos. 34, 46, 47, were about 0°‘1 too low.   In
a few of these thermometers the column of mercury could be
readily broken: when this column was moved to different portions
of the scale, it was found to occupy precisely the same number of
divisions. This was the case with four of the instruments; the other
three not having been tested in this way.
   The <U+FB01>ve spirit thermometers were compared at four different tem
peratures with a. standard mercurial thermometer.    The comparison
at 0° being taken in ice and salt, is not very trustworthy.    Their

tions. Communicated by direction of the President and Council.
                       7               Somerset House, 10th May 1852.
             have the honour to acknowledge
            Sim—I                                the receipt of your
letter of March the 4th, transmitting, by direction of- the Earl                                             of
Malmesbury, several documents receivedifrom foreign governments
 in reply to a proposal made to them by Her Majesty’s Government,
for their cooperation in establishing a uniform system of recording
meteorological observations, and requestingthe Opinion of the Pre

                                     189
  sident and Council of the Royal Society in- reference to a proposition
  which has been made by the Government of the United States, re
  specting the manner ' in which the proposed cooperation should be
  carried out.
      Having submitted your letter with its enclosures to the Presi
  dent and Council of the Royal Society, I am directed to convey to
  you the following reply.
     With reference to the subject of well-directed and systematically
  conducted meteorological observations generally, and to the encou
  ragement and support to be given to them by the governments ofv
  different countries, the President and Council are of opinion that
 they are highly deserving of much consideration, not only for their
  scienti<U+FB01>c value, but also on account of the important bearing which
 correct climatological knowledge has on the welfare and material
 interests of the people of every country.
     With reference to the proposal for the establishment of a uni
 form plan in respect to instruments and modes of observation, the
 President and Council are not of opinion that any practical advan
 tage is likely to be obtained by pressing such a proposition in the
 present    state of meteorological    science.   Most of the principal
 governments of the European Continent, as Russia, Prussia, Austria,
 Bavaria. and Belgium, have already organized establishments           for
 climatological researches in their respective states, and have placed
 them under the superintendence of men eminently quali<U+FB01>ed by theo
 retical and practical knowledge, and whose previous publications had
 obtained for them a general European reputation. Such men are
 Kup<U+FB01>'er, Dove, Kreil, Lamont and Quételet; under whose direction
 the meteorological observations in the above-’named countries are
 proceeding; the instruments have been constructed under their care,
 and the instructions drawn up and published by them under the
 sanction of their respective governments.       The observations as they
 are made are sent to them, are reduced and coordinated under their
 superintendence,     and are published at the expense of the govern
 ments.     Every year is now producing publications of this nature in
 the countries referred to, and by the rapid intercommunication of
 these; the results of the experience of one country and the modi<U+FB01>cations
 and improvements which experience may suggest, become quickly
 known to all. To call on countries already so advanced in systemati
 cally conducted meteorological       observations to remodel their iri
 structions and instruments, with a view of establishing uniformity
 in these respects, would probably,        if pressed, elicit‘ from other
 governments also the reply which Her Majesty’s 'Governinent'have
 received from Prince Schwarzenberg, conveyed in the Earl of West<
 moreland's letter‘to Viscount Palmerston, viz. the transmission of a
 copy of the instructions which have been given to the Meteorological
  Observatories, forty-<U+FB01>ve in number, in the Austrian dominions, and
 a reference to the results obtained at those observatories, which are
                                                          ‘
 stated to be in regular course of publication.               ‘
_    In an earlier stage, when these establishments Were either form
 ing or were only in contemplation, it was considered that advantage

                                     190
might arise from a discussion of the objects to be..principally kept
in view, and of the instruments and methods by which these might
be most successfully prosecuted.           Forthis purpose, a conference
was held at Cambridge, in England, in 1845, which was attended
by many of the most distinguished Meteorologists in Europe, and
amongst them by all the gentlemen whose names are above stated;
and who were expressly sent by their respective governments.              The
impulse communicated by this assemblage was without doubthigbly
bene<U+FB01>cial, and the in<U+FB02>uence of the discussions which took place-W
perhaps be traced in some of the arrangements under-which the
researches in di<U+FB01>’erent countries are now proceeding]; but linthq!
stage to which they have advanced,v it may be doubted whether any,
measures are likely to be more bene<U+FB01>cial than those which would.
increase the facilities ofa cheap and rapid intercommunication of,                 ~
the results of the researches which are in progress.            _ ,v   ,, _   p,

     With reference               suggestions made by the scienti<U+FB01>c men
of ,the United States,” the proposition of Lieutenant Maury, to give,
a greater extension and a more systematic direction to the meteoro
logical observations to be made at sea, appears to be deserving of
the most serious attention of the Board of Admiralty.           in    order to
 understand    the importance of     this  proposition, it will be  proper   to
 refer to the systemof observations which has been adopted of late
 years in the navy and merchant service of the United-States, and-to
 some few of the results to which-zit has already led.           Instructions

  be collected from other sources, and which indicated much shorter

           The  EARL OF ROSSE,         President, in the Chair.
   The reading of Mr. Huxley's paper, “ Upon the Morphology of
the Cephalous Mollusca, as illustrated by the Anatomy of certain
Heteropoda and Pteropoda,” was resumed and concluded.
    In- the present memoir the author endeavours to determine, upon
anatomical and embryological       grounds, the true homologies of the
different organs of the Cephalous Mollusca, and thence to arrive at
some idea of the archetypal form, as de<U+FB01>nite modi<U+FB01>cations of which
the existing molluscous forms may be considered to have arisen.
   The Pelagic Heteropoda and Pteropoda, from their small size and
extreme transparancy, are peculiarly favourable subjects for the ana
tomical part of this investigation, and it is from a detailed examina
tion of those systems of organs which are of importance for the pur
pose that the author deduces the following conclusions :—
 '
    1. In the Heteropoda the intestine is bent towards the dorsal or
haemal side in consequence of the development behind the anus of
the visceral “ hernia,” which is therefore called a post-abdomen.

                                      193
 .' 2. In the Heterapoda, the “foot,” in its most perfect condition,
 consists of three portions, a propodium, mesopodium and metapodiumj
    3. The Heteropoda are more or less prosobranchiate,     the degree
depending upon the amount of development of the post-abdomen.
    4. In the Pterapoda the intestine is bent towards the ventral or
neural side,‘ in consequence of the development of the visceral “ her
nia” in front of the anus. It is therefore called an abdomen.          ,
    5. In the‘Pteropoda, the foot, besides the parts mentioned above,
possesses an additional appendage, the epipodium, which forms the
expanded wing characteristic of the group.          ,                -
    6. The Pteropoda are opisthobranchiate,    prosobranchiate, or in~
termediate in character, according to the degree of development of                _
the abdomen.
    The Heteropoda and Pteropoda, then, may be considered to repre
sent two opposite phases of the modi<U+FB01>cation of the molluscous
archetype.                        .         , '               .         ,I'

     In the  second part of the paper, the author endeavours, by care
 fully collating the known facts of the development of the Mollusca.
to ascertain (a) the primary form of all cephalous Mollusca, and (b)
the mode in which, in the course of development, this embryonic               -
form becomes metamorphosed into the adult form; in order,         if pos
sible, to account, on the safe basis of ascertained morphological laws,
for the peculiar modi<U+FB01>cations of structure which have been found,
anatomically, to obtain among the Heteropoda and Pteropoda.
    He <U+FB01>nds that it   ispossible not only to deduce the structure of the
Heteropoda and Pteropoda from simple and symmetrical archetype,»
                                  a
by    such morphological laws, but that all the cephalous Mollusca
fall under one or other of the great types of which these have been
taken as exempli<U+FB01>cations.
    After a discussion of the various theories of the homology of the
organs of cephalous Mollusca proposed by Loven, Leuckart, &e., the
following general conclusions are set forth :—
    1. The cephalous Mollusca are all organized after the same fun-‘
damental form or archetype.
    2. The arrangement of the systems of organs within this arche
type is essentially the same as in the Vertebrate. and Annulosa    ;‘that
is to say, supposing the digestive system to form the axis of the body,
the nervous centre lies on one side of that axis; the blood-vascular
centre upon the opposite; and furthermore, the archetype          issym
metrical with regard to longitudinal vertical plane, passing through
                            a
these three.                                                            ,
    3. The molluscous archetype differs from the vertebrate in the
circumstance—l, that the mouth opens upon the neural surface;            2,
that the embryo commences its development upon the haemal side.
    It differs from the articulate archetype in the latter circumstance,
and from both in the fact, that the proper appendicular system (re
presented by the epipodium)     is   almost rudimentary,   and that the
locomotive function    is  mainly performed by a development of the
neural surface.
    4. The process of concentration and fusion of parts by which the

                                              194
    principal modi<U+FB01>cations 'are' produced among the Vertebrate. and Arti
    culata, seems almost absent in the Mollusca; the changes among
    them being produced by an asymmetrical' development of the prima
    rily symmetrical archetype, a process comparatively rate among the
                                                             ‘
    Articulata and Vertebrata.
        5. The part thus asymmetrically developed is invariably a portion
    of the haemal surface, and may be called an abdomen or a post-abdo
    men, according as it is placed before or behind the anus.
        6. The intestine is found to be bent in two directions among the
    Mollusca, haemad or neurad, and these <U+FB02>exures correspond with the
    development of a post-abdomen or abdomen, respectively.
     '
       7‘. The process of development demonstrates    that the Tectibran‘
    chiata, Nudibranchiata and Pectinibranchiata (in part at
                                                               least) belong
    to the former division, and that the Cephalopoda and Pulmonata
                                                                 ' "I       '
    belong 'tothe latter.‘
       8. Anatomical evidence shows that the Heteropoda have a haemal
    <U+FB02>exure'of'the intestine, the Pte'ropoda a neural <U+FB02>exure ;‘ and it is
    almost certain that when their development is traced, the fermer Will
    be found to have a post-abdomen, the latter an abdomen; there will
'
    then be two great divisions of the cephalous mollUsca.

     results of either course of development.

    tion throughout, and‘di<U+FB02>‘e'r only in their arrangement and degrees of
    concentration.           The amount of the latter does not correspond with

 Cembridgef     Received May 11, 1.852.        . ..-            .
    The author was led into the researches detailed in this paper by
 widening a very singular phenomenon which Sir John Herschel
had discovered in the case of aweak solution of sulphate of quinine,
and various other salts of the same alkal'oid-            This <U+FB02>uid appears
colourless   and  transparent, like   water,  whenviewedby        transmitted
light, but exhibits in certain aspects 9. peCuliar blue colour.            Sir
JohD‘I-Ierschel found, that when the <U+FB02>uid was illuminated by a beam
of ordinary daylight, the blue light was produced: only throughout a
very thin stratum of fluid adjacent to the surface by which the light
entered.    It was unpolarized, It passed freely' through many inches
of the <U+FB02>uid. . The incident beam,'after        having passed through the
stratum from which-the blue light came, was not sensibly enfeebled
nor coloured, but yet    it?had lost thepower of producing the usual
blue colour when admitted into      a  solution of sulphate       quinine.
                                                                   of       A
beam of light modi<U+FB01>eddn this mysterious manner was called by‘
Sir John_ Herschel epipolized-.
                                    ‘
                                    .                   I
    Several, years before Sir David Brewster had discovered in the
case of an alcoholic solution, of the green colouring’matter of leaves
a  very. remarkable phenomenon, which he has designated as internal
dispersion.    On admitting into this <U+FB02>uid a beam of sunlight con~
(leased by a lens, he was surprised‘by <U+FB01>nding the path of the rays
within the <U+FB02>uid marked by 8'; brightvlight of             a blood-red colour,
strangely   contrasting  with the  beautiful   green  of  the <U+FB02>uid itself when
seen in moderate; thickness.        Sir David afterwards . observed the
same, phenomenon in various vegetable solutions and essential oils,
and in some. solids.     He conceived    it to be :due to coloured particles
held in suspension,      But there was one circumstance attending the
phenomenon, which seemed very. di<U+FB02>icult of explanation on such
a   supposition, namely, that the whole or great partof-the dispersed
                                               a
beam    was. unpolan'zed, whereas      beam-re<U+FB02>ected. from suspended
                                        a

                                      196
  particles might be expected to be polarized by re<U+FB02>exion.            And
  such was, in fact, the case with those beams which were plainly
  due to nothing but particles held in suspension.     From the general
  identity of the circumstances attending the two phenomena, Sir
  David Brewster was led to conclude that epipolic was merely a par
  ticular case of internal dispersion, peculiar only in this respect, that
  the rays capable of dispersion were dispersed with unusual rapidity.
  But what rays they were which were capable of a<U+FB01>ecting a solution
 of sulphate of quinine, why the active rays were so quickly used up,
 while the dispersed rays which they produced passed freely through
 the <U+FB02>uid, why the transmitted light when subjected to prismatic
 analysis showed no de<U+FB01>ciencies in those regions to which, with
 respect to refrangibility, the dispersed rays chie<U+FB02>y belonged, were
 questions to which the answers appeared to be involved in as much
 mystery as ever.                                                      .
     After having repeated some of the experiments of Sir David
  Brewster and Sir John Herschel, the author could not fail to take a
 most lively interest in the phenomenon.      The <U+FB01>rm conviction which
 he felt that two portions of light were not distinguishable as to their
 nature otherwise than by refrangibility and state of polarization, left
 him but few hypotheses to choose between, respecting the explana
 tion of the phenomenon.        In fact, having regarded it at <U+FB01>rst as an
 axiom that dispersed light of any particular refrangibility could only
 have arisen from light of the same refrangibility contained in the
 incident beam, he was led by necessity to adopt hypotheses of so
 arti<U+FB01>cial a character as to render them wholly improbable.       He was
 thus compelled to adopt the other alternative, namely, to suppose
 that in the process of internal dispersion the refrangibility of light
 had been changed.      Startling as such a supposition might appear at
 <U+FB01>rst sight, the ease with which it accounted for the whole pheno
 menon was such as already to produce a strong probability of its
truth. Accordingly the author determined to put this hypothesis to
 the test of experiment.
     The experiments soon placed the fact of a change of refrangibility
beyond all doubt. It would exceed the limits of an abstract like the
present to describe the various experiments.      It will be suf<U+FB01>cient to
 mention some of the more remarkable results.
     A pure spectrum from sunlight having been formed in air in the
 usual manner, a glass vessel containing a weak solution of sulphate
of quinine was placed in it. The rays belonging to the greater
part of the visible spectrum passed freely through the <U+FB02>uid, just as
if it had been water, bein merely re<U+FB02>ected here and there from
motes.     But from a point a ut half-way between the <U+FB01>xed lines G
and H to far beyond the extreme violet the incident rays gave rise to
light of a sky-blue colour, which emanated in all directions from the
portion of the <U+FB02>uid which was under the in<U+FB02>uence of the incident
rays. The anterior surface of the blue space coincided of course with
the inner surface of the vessel in which the <U+FB02>uid was contained.
The posterior surface marked the distance to which the incident rays

                                           197
        were able  to penetrate before they were absorbed. .This distance
       was at <U+FB01>rst  considerable, greater than the diameter of the vessel, but
       it decreased .with great rapidity as the refrangibility of the incident
      rays increased,   so that from a little beyond the extreme violet to the
      end the blue space was reduced to an excessivelyihiu stratum adja
      cent to the surface by which the incident rays entered.        It appears
      therefore that this <U+FB02>uid, which is so transparent         with respect to
     nearly the whole of the visible rays, is of an inky blackness with
     respect to the invisible rays more refrangible than. the extreme violeti
     The <U+FB01>xed lines belonging to the violet and the invisible region beyond
     were beautifully represented      by dark planes interrupting; the blue
     space.     When the eye was' properly placed, these planes were of
     course projected into lines.      The author has made a sketch of these
    <U+FB01>xed lines, which       accompanies the paper.       They may be readily
    identi<U+FB01>ed    with the <U+FB01>xed lines represented in M. Becquerel.’ s map of
    the    <U+FB01>xed lines of the chemical spectrum.        The last line seen in a
    solution of sulphate of quinine appears to be the line next beyond
    the last represented in M. Becquerel’s map.          Under very favourable
   circumstances two dusky bands were :seen still further on.           Several
   circumstances led the author to conclude-that in all probability <U+FB01>xed
   lines might be readily seen corresponding          to still more refrangible
   rays, were it not for the opacity of glass with respect to those rays
   of very    high refrangibility.             .   -
        It is very easy to prove experimentally that the blue dispersed
  light corresponding to' any particularpart of the incident spectrum
  is not homogeneous         light, having a refrangibility equal to that of the
  incident rays, and rendered visible in consequence of its complete
  isolation; but that it is in fact heterogeneous light, consisting'of
  rays extending over a wide range of refrangibility, and' not passing
  beyond the limits of refrangibility of the spectrum visible under
 ordinary circumstances.           To show this it is sufficient to isolate a
 part of the incident spectrum, and view the narrow beam of dispersed
 light which it produces through a prism held to the'eye.
       In Sir David Brewster's mode of observation,.the beam of light,
 which was of the' same nature as the blue light exhibited bya 801“?
 tion of sulphate of quinine, was necessarily mixed With the beam due
 merely to re<U+FB02>exion from suspended particles; and in the case of
 vegetable solutions, a beam of the latter'kind almost alv'rays exists, to
 a greater or less degl'ee.‘ But in the method of observation employed
 by the author, to which he was led. by the discovery of the change
of refrangibility, the two beams are exhibited quite distinctv from one
another.. The author proposes to call the two kinds of internal
dispersion just mentioned true internal dispersion and faLge internal
dispersion, the latter being nothing mere than the scattering of light
which is produced by suspended particles, and having, as is now
perfectly plain, nothing to do with the remarkable phenomenon of
true      internal dispersion.
      Now that the nature of        the latter phenomenon is better known, it
is of course possible to employ methods of observation by which it
may be detected even when only feebly exhibited.                It proves to be

almost    universal in vegetable solutions, that is, in solutions made
directly from various parts of vegetables. When vegetable products
are obtained in a state of isolation, their solutions sometimes ex
hibit the phenomenon and sometimes do not, or at least exhibit it
so feebly that it is impossible to say whether what they do show
may not be due to some impurity.              Among <U+FB02>uids which exhibit the
phenomenon in a high degree, or according to the author’s expres
sion are highly sensitive, may' be mentioned a weak decoction of the
bark of the horse-chestnut, an alcoholic extract from the seeds of
the Datura stramonium, weak tincture 'of turmeric, and a decoction
of madder in a solution of alum.            In these cases the general cha
racter of the dispersion resembles that exhibited by a solution of
sulphate of quinine, but the tint of the dispersed light, and the part
of the spectrum at which the dispersion begins, are di<U+FB02>'erent in dif
ferent cases.      In the last <U+FB02>uid, for example, the dispersion com
mences somewhere about the <U+FB01>xed line D, and continues from thence
onwards far beyond the extreme violet. The dispersed light is
yellow, or yellowish orange.
    In the case of other <U+FB02>uids, however, some of them sensitive in a
very high degree, the mode in which light is dispersed internally
presents some very remarkable peculiarities.              One of the most sin
gular examples      occurs  in  the    case   of an   alcoholic  solution of the
green   colouring   matter   of  leaves.     This   <U+FB02>uid   disperses  a rich red
light.    The dispersion commences abruptly about the <U+FB01>xed line B,
and continues from thence onwards throughout the visible spectrum
and a little beyond.      The dispersion is subject to <U+FB02>uctuations inti
mately connected with the singular absorption bands exhibited by
this medium.
    In order that a medium should be capable of changing the refran

dium should be a <U+FB02>uid, or a clear solid. \Vashed papers and other

observation must be changed.             The author has-observed the change
of refrangibility in various ways.           lt will be sn<U+FB02>icient to mention
here that which was found most generally useful, vwhich he calls
the method of observing by            a linear spectrum.      The method    is as
follows
    A series of prisms and a lens are arranged in the usual manner
for forming a pure spectrum, but the. slit by which the light enters,
instead of being parallel.       isplaced in     a  direction perpendicular to
the edges of the prisms.         A  linear spectrum      is  thus formed at the
focus of the lens, consisting of an in<U+FB01>nite succession of images                 of
the slit arranged one after the other in the order of refrangibility,
and of course overlapping each- other to             certain extent.
                                                     a                  The sub
stance to be examined       isplaced in the linear spectrum, and the line
of light seen upon    it   viewed through
                           is                    a prism held to the eye.      In
this way  it   isfound that almost all common organic substances, such
 as wood, cork, Paper, calico, bone, ivory, horn, wool, quills, feathers,
 leather, the skin of the hand, the nails, are sensitive in       a    greater or
 less degree.    Organic substances which are dark-coloured are fre

     There    is one law relating, to the change of refrangibility which
 appears to be quite universal, namely, that the refrangibilitylof light
is   always lowered by internal dispersion.            The incident rays being
homogeneous, the dispersed light             isfound tobe more or less com;
posite.      Its colour depends simply on its refrangibility, havingino
relation to the colour of the incident light, onto the circumstance that
the incident rays were visible or invisible. The dispersed light appears
to emanate in all directions, as i<U+FB01>the solid or <U+FB02>uid were self-luminou
while under the in<U+FB02>uence of the incident rays.
     The phenomenon of the change of refrangibility'of light admits of
several important applications. ‘In the, <U+FB01>rst place               it'  enables us to
determine instantaneously the transparency m- opacity of                     a  solid or
<U+FB02>uid with respect to the invisible rays more refrangible than the
                                                                            14*

violet, and that, not only for these rays as a whole, but for the rays
 of each refrangibility in particular. For this purpose it is su<U+FB01>icient
to form a pure spectrum with sun-light as usual, employing instead
 of a screen a vessel containing a decoction of the bark of the horse
 chestnut, or a slab of canary glass, or some other highly sensitive
 medium, and then to interpose the medium to be examined, which,
 if <U+FB02>uid, would have to be contained in a vessel with parallel sides
 of glass.     Glass itself ceases to be transparent about the region
 corresponding to the end of the author’s map, and to carry on these
experiments with respect to invisible rays of still higher refrangibility
would require the substitution of quartz for glass.         The re<U+FB02>ecting
power of a surface with respect to the invisible rays may be examined
in a similar manner.                                                   ‘
     The effect produced on sensitive media leads to interesting informa
tion respecting the nature of various <U+FB02>ames. Thus, for example, it ap
pears that the feeble <U+FB02>ame of alcohol is extremely brilliant with regard
 to invisible rays of very high refrangibility.    The <U+FB02>ame of hydrogen
 appears to abound in invisible rays of still higher refrangibility.       _
     By means of the phenomena relating to the change of refrangibi
lity, the independent existence of one or more sensitive substances
may frequently be observed in a mixture of various compounds. In
 this way the phenomenon seems likely to prove of value in the sepa
ration of organic compounds.        The phenomena sometimes also afford
 curious evidence of chemical combinations; but this subject cannot
here be further dwelt upon.                                              .
     The appearance which the rays from an electric spark produce in
 a solution of sulphate of quinine, shows that the spark is very rich
in invisible rays of excessively high refrangibility, such as would
plainly put them far beyond the limits of the maps which have
hitherto been made of the <U+FB01>xed lines in the chemical part of the
 solar spectrum.      These rays are stopped by glass, but transmitted
 through quartz.       These circumstances. render‘it probable that the
phosphorogenic      rays of an electric spark are nothing .more than rays
 of , the same nature as those of light, but which are invisible, and not
 only so, but of excessively high refrangibility.     If so, they ought to
be stopped by a very small quantity of a substance known to absorb
 those rays with great energy.         Accordingly the author found that
 while the rays from an electric spark, which excite the phosphores
cence of Canton’s phosphorus, pass freely through water and quartz,
they are stopped on adding to the water an excessively small quan
 tity   of sulphate of quinine.
   '
     At the end of the paper the author explains what he conceives
to be the cause of the change of refrangibility, and enters into some
speculations to account for the law according to which the refrangi
bility of light is always lowered in the process of internal dispemionL

           Analytical Researches connected with Steiner’s Extension of
 Malfatti’s Problem."       By Arthur Cayley, M.A., Fellow of Trinity
 College, Cambridge.      Communicated by J. J. Sylvester, Esq., F.R.S.
 Received     April 12, 1852.

    The problem, in a-triangle to describe three circles each of them
touching the two others and also two sides of the triangle, has been
termed after the Italian geometcr, by whom it was proposed and
solved, Malfatti’s Problem.     The problem to which the author refers
as Steiner’s extension of Malfatti’s Problem, is as follows: “ To de
termine three sections of a surface of the second order, each of them
touching the two others, and also two of three given sections of the
surface of the second order,” a problem proposed in Steiner’s me
moir ‘ Einige Geometrische Betrachtungen,’ Crelle, t. i. The geome~
trical construction of the problem in question is readily deduced
from that given in the memoir just mentioned for a somewhat less
general problem, viz. that in which the surface of the second order
is replaced by a sphere ; it is for the sake of the analytical develop—
ments to which the problem gives rise that the author proposes to
resume here the discussion of the problem.         The following is an
analysis of the present memoir :—                            ,          -
    § 1. Contains a lemma which appears to the author to constitute
the foundation of the analytical theory of the sections of a surface of
the second order.                    I   .                              p
    § 2. Contains a statement of the geometrical construction of
Steiner’s extension of Malfatti’s problem.                     ‘
    § 3. Is a veri<U+FB01>cation, founded on a particular choice of co-ordi
nates, of the construction in question.
    § 4. In this section, referring the surface of the second order to
absolutely general co-ordinates, and after an incidental solution of the
problem to determine a section, touching three given sections, the
author obtains the equations for the solution of Steiner’s extension
of Malfatti’s problem.
  . § 5. Contains a separate discussion of a system of equations, in
cluding as a particular case the equations obtained in the preceding
section.
    §§ 6 & 7. Contain the application of the formulae for the general
system to the equations in §4, and the development and completion
of the solution.
    § 8. Is an extension of some preceding       formulas to quadratic
functions of any number of variables.
 ,3. f‘ On the Tides, Bed and Coasts of the North Sea or German
Ocean.” By John Murray, Esq. Communicated by George Rennie,
Esq., F.R.S. Received March 20, 1852.                                 . ,
    The author commences    his paper by remarking  that great   similarity
of outline pervades the western shores of Ireland, Scotland and
Norway, and then observes that the great Atlantic <U+FB02>ood-tide wave,
having traversed the shores of the former countries, strikes with
great fury the Norwegian coast between the Lafoden Isles and Stad
land, one portion proceeding to the north, while the other is de
<U+FB02>ected to the south, which last has scooped out along the coast, as
far as the Sleeve at the mouth of the Baltic, a long channel from
 100 to 200 fathoms in depth, almost close in shore, and varying
 from 50 to 100 miles in width. After describing his method of con

                                     20'2
  touring and colouring the Admiralty chart of the North Sea, he
  traces the course of the tide-wave among the Orkney and Shetland
  Islands along the eastern shores of Scotland and England to the
  Straits of Dover, and along the western shores of Norway, Denmark
  and the Netherlands, to the same point. He then remarks that the
  detritus arising from the continued wasting away of nearly the
  whole line of the eastern coasts of Scotland and England, caused by
  the action of the <U+FB01>ood~tide, is carried by it, and at the present day
  <U+FB01>nds a resting-place in the North Sea; and that this <U+FB01>lling process
  is increased by the sand, shingle, and other matter brought through
  the Straits of Dover by the other branch of the Atlantic <U+FB02>ood-tide.
  Hence, he remarks, the gradual shoaling‘ of this sea, and the forma
  tion of its numerous sand-banks; the silting up the mouths of the
  Rhine, the Meuse, and the Scheldt ; the formation of the numerous
  islands on the coast of Holland, that country itself, and much of
  Belgium ; the deposits at the mouth of the Baltic, the islands in the
  Cattegat, and indeed the whole country of Slesw'rg, Denmark and
               '                                   ‘
  Jutland.
      The author then takes a view of the tides, and their effects upon
  the Baltic and its shores before the course of the tide-wave was
  checked by these (shoals and low lands.'    He' considers that, previous
  to- these great changes, the flood-tide entering the North Sea between
  Norway and Scotland, would make directly towards the German
  coast, and necesSarily heap up the waters in the Baltic considerably
   above their present level, and that a great part of Finland, Russia,
  and Prussia bordering upon that sea, would thus eVery twelve hours
  be under water, in the same way as the waters now rise in the Bay
  of Fundy, at Chepstow, and other places, much above their ordinary
  leVel in the open sea; that the current outward, on the receding
  of 'the tide which these accumulated waters would occasion,‘ com
  bined with the rivers which fall into the Baltic, when checked‘by
I the folloWing <U+FB02>ood-tide, would cause deposits in the form of a bar
  tailing towards Sweden; and that an increase to these deposits
   would form shoals, drifts and islands, and eventually along sand
  bank- in'outline, like the country of Denmark. H e further considers
  that the tide being by these means prevented from entering the
   Baltic, may account for the subsidence of the waters of the Gulf of
                                                                     '
  Bothnia' better than can the'upheaval of' the northern part of Scan
  dinavia.       -‘ J                            ' > -
      The author then remarks that the great shoal of the North Sea is
  the Dogger Bank, and that its peculiar form is produced by the
  meeting'of'the cotidal waves, of which he traces the course. "After
  hearing testimonyto the value of the Admiralty chart of the southern
  portion of the North Sea, made under the direction of the me Cap
  tain Hewitt, he reverts 'to the importance of contouring such maps,
   in=order to obtain something like a-correct action-of the bottom of
   the sea ; and'in conclusion expresses a hope that the Admiralty will
   be induced to continue the survey of the North Sea, so well begun
   by Captain Hewitt.                                -

   The following  papers were read    :—
   1.  “ On the Structure and Development of Bone."                By John
Tomes, F.R.S., Surgeon Dentist to the Middlesex Hospital, and
Campbell De Morgan, Surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital.                   Re
ceived  April 22, 1852.
   In this communication,    the authors, after having brie<U+FB02>y noticed
the intimate structure of perfect bone as commonly recognised, pro
ceed to the description of certain points connected with its structure
and development, which they believe to have been hitherto entirely
overlooked or only partially recognise-d.
   These points have been. arranged under the following heads :—
   1. The Haversian    and other canals of bone.
   2. The laminae of  bone.
   3. The lacunae.
   4. Haversian systems.
   5. Ossi<U+FB01>ed cartilage of joints.

                                    204
    6.  Ossi<U+FB01>ed cells.
    7.  Bone tissue.
    8.  Development of bone in temporary     cartilage.
    9.  Growth of bone.
    1. Haversian and other canals of bone.-—Besides the Haversian
canals, the authors have pointed out that there are found in bone
sections spaces of an entirely different character, irregular in shape,
and with an irregular festooned margin.        Their margins correspond
in outline with those of one or more Haversian systems, and precede
in many instances the formation of those systems.            These spaces
produced by absorption      are callcd  by the authors    Haversian spaces.
Unlike the Haversian canals which are surrounded by their own
laminae, these spaces are bounded by parts of several systems which
have been encroached on by the process of absorption.
    In examining various sections, or different parts of the same
section, these spaces will be found in different states of partial or
entire occupation by Haversian systems.          They are found in the
bone of subjects of all ages.     T he fact of removal of old tissue and
replacement by new, which has been hithertq only assumed, is thus
demonstrated.
    2. Lamina: of bone.—Laminnti0n is shown to be a constant character
of mammalian bone; each lamina, when highly developed, is found
to consist of a dark granular, and of a transparent part.          The ex
ternal margin of the outermost lamina of each Haversian system is
irregularly indented and corresponds with the outline of a pre-exist
ing Haversian space; while its internal margin and all the succeed
ing laminae are regular in outline.
    'l‘he lamina: are found as a general rule to surround their canal,
 which is usually placed in the centre of them.         But sometimes the
canals are eccentric, in which case either the lamina: on one side,
 though still surrounding'the canal, are broader, or there are more
 developed on one side than on the other.         The lamina next to the
 perfected Haversian canal however is always complete, and is often
 composed of a transparent structureless tissue, like that which encir
 cles. the Haversian canals of the stag's antler at the time of shedding.
     The presence of interstitial laminae is readily accounted for; they
‘are in fact the remains of pre-existing Haversian systems, or circum
 ferential laminae, parts of which have been removed by absorption.
     The circumferential laminae are not so constantly present as is
 generally described, and rarely entirely surround the shaft of a long
 bone.     When present, they seem to indicate that the bone is nearly
 stationary in its growth.     They are frequently intersected by nume
 rous Haversian spaces and systems, so as at length to assume the
                                                         '
 characters of interstitial laminae.
    3. Luciano—In young bone the lacunae are more abundant, larger,
 and have more numerous canaliculi ; or they may exist without cana
 liculi, or the canaliculi and great part of the lacunae themselves may
  be <U+FB01>lled up with solid matter, so as to leave only a small space‘in the
  centre of the latter.    The lacuna and canaliculi are shown to have
  distinct walls.

                                    205
    In the circumferential laminae are frequently found elongated tubes
 which the authors    regard as modi<U+FB01>cations of lacuna: ; they run ob
 liquely across the laminae, generally in bundles.      They frequently
 form communications       with the canaliculi. In transverse section
 they are seen to haveproper walls.
    4. Haversian systems.——The    authors have here pointed out that the
anastomosis     of the canaliculi of adjoining systems is rare in newly
developed systems, but-is very common in those of greater age.          It
has been seen too that        it,
                              not unfrequently happens that      series of
                                                                      a
Haversian systems    is  contained within    common series of surround~
                                              a
ing lamina.      Sometimes the Haversian systems are rendered quite
solid by the narrowing of the Haversian canal and ultimate develop
ment of   a   mere lacuna in the centre of the system.     The more re
cently developed Haversian systems which occupy Haversian spaces
are seen to be darker incolour than the older ones, from the greater
abundance     of canaliculi, and the more general granularityof the
tissue.                        .
     5. Ossi<U+FB01>ed articular cartilage—This      structure the authors have
 found in all the joints which they have examined, in the lower jaw,
 amongst others, where .Kiilliker failed to detect it.         Towards the
 bone the tissue becomes in general granular and of    a   brownish colour,
 and usually there   is   distinct line of demarcation between the bone
                          a
 and the ossi<U+FB01>ed cartilage; but sometimes they graduate insensibly
                                                      '        -
 the one into the other.                 .
    Towards the articular surface the margin      is even, and regular; but
 towards the bone  it    deeply indented, from the bone advancing into
                        is
it  by rounded projections.      Hence the articular cartilage varies in
 thickness.    The authors believe that this, so far from being an indi
cation of imperfect development,     is  in reality an evidence of design,
 and intended to give an uniform and unyielding surface for the car
tilage to rest upon.                          /
    6. Ossi<U+FB01>ed cells.--In the bones of aged people     it   isfrequently ob
served that they become light and spongy, and after maceration con
tain  a white powder in the cancellated structure. This powder the
authors have found to be composed mainly of ossi<U+FB01>ed nucleated
cells, either detached or held together in masses. They are spherical,
and contain a dark granular nucleus, which        is surrounded by     thick
                                                                           a
transparent wall.                           I
    If portions of the cancelli be taken, they will be found to have simi
lar cells adherent to their surfaces, or to those of the Haversian
canals, with here and there canaliculi of adjoining lacunae shooting
into them, while the nuclei have themselves assumed the form of
lacunae.     Similar cells may be found imbedded in parts of most sec
tions of bone.     In order to see this condition clearly,       itdesirable
                                                                      is
that the sections and the loose cells should be mounted in Canada
balsam.                                                      I
   7. Bone tissue.——'l‘he views generally entertained with regard to the
ultimate structure of bone tissue are, the older one, that      consists
                                                                      it
of an aggregation of granules in         transparent matrix
                                          a                    and that
                                                                      ;

                                      206
  which has been more recently put forward by Dr. Sharpey, that in
  many cases it is composed of ossi<U+FB01>ed decussating <U+FB01>bres.
     The authors have satis<U+FB01>ed themselves that the ultimate structure
  of bone tissue is‘composed of minute granules or granular bodies
  imbedded in a clear or subgranular matrix,; and that the appearance
  of <U+FB01>bres is due 'in many cases to the mode~of illumination.           By
  transmitted light passing'through them in the-long axis of the mi
 croscope the preparations show a granular or a structureless appear
 ance, or alternations of a granular and structureless part. But under
 an oblique light passing from one side only an appearance of minute
 <U+FB01>at <U+FB01>bres presents itself. _ This takes place even in the isolatedcells
 of old bone, or in developing young bone.        This appearance is most
 marked over the lacunae and canaliculi.         But if a part which thus
 appears <U+FB01>brous be viewed'under a light passing obliquely from all
 sides, asis effected by a Gillett’s achromatic condenser, the <U+FB01>bres
 disappear, and We see only a granular appearance, with some ten
 dency to arrangement in the granules.          The <U+FB01>brous appearance is
 in fact due to the shadows cast from the less transparent'parts when
 the light passes obliquely, just train the navicula the dots are re~
 placed by lines.     In thin sections torn from bone which has been
 macerated in acid, a reticulated appearance, similar to that <U+FB01>gured
 by Dr. Sharpey, may be seen, only however when the object is
 slightly out of focus, or the light oblique and from one side.        By
 careful adjustment of the object-glass and of the illuminating appa
 ratus, this appearance may be shown to depend on the presence of
 the canaliculi.
    8 and 9. Developth and growth of bone.--The early condition of
 cartilage, and the changes which take place in it and in the cartilage
cell before ossi<U+FB01>cation, are particularly described; and also the mode
by which they multiply and arrange themselves by segmentation, so
that a long column or cluster of cells represents an original cell, the
walls of which have coalesced with-the surrounding hyaline tissue.
The cells at the same time enlarge individually as they approach the
point where ossi<U+FB01>cation is going on, encroaching on the hyaline sub
stance so as in many cases only to leave a <U+FB01>ne line of intercolumnar.’
tissue, or to cause it to disappear altogether. The nucleus at the same
time enlarges considerably, while the cell wall becomes thickened
internally, until in the end it reaches the nucleus, which then be
comes imbedded in <U+FB01>rm tissue.           Other changes now take place :
either several cells are thrown into one cavity by the absorption of
their contiguous walls, leaving the nuclei free in the common cavity ;
or the nucleuscontinues to occupy its parent cell, and sends o<U+FB02>‘ small
processes, which extend outwards to the cell wall.          At this stage
the nucleus maybe sometimes detached with the processes entire, but
generally it is adherent, and may be seen to have become a lacuna
with a. central cavity and canaliculi ; in addition to which a nucleus
may be seen to occupy its interior ; it has in fact become a nucleated
                                   “
cell, designated by the authors      granular cell.” The entire cell may
now_be    detached from   the intercolumnar tissue in which it lies.

    In the further process ofvidevelopr'nent the‘cells and intercolumnar
tissue become fused together so'l‘as'rio longer to be recbghised as
distinct parts; and the‘ granular cell appears as'a perfect lacuna with
a large cavity and numerous large‘eanalicnli.             'lfo- bone in this con
 dition the term primarybone has been applied. It speedily however
undergoes a change preparatory to the formation of the morevper
maneut secondary bone.              Here and' there in the line of ossi<U+FB01>cation
portions are removed by absorption, the spaces left being, <U+FB01>lled with
small somewhat granular cellslying in a transparent blastema,through
the agency of which the absorption has been in all probability e<U+FB01>ectedi
 It would appear as though the cells grew at the expense of the sur
rounding tissue.         These spaces correspond entirely to the Havorsian
spaces before described; and in them the'secondary bone is in the
<U+FB01>rst instance formed.          The process of formation of‘selcondary b'o'né
appears to be everywhere essentially the same,,'whether in the ab
sorbed spaces, or on the surfaces, or in the‘membranes of the foetal
cranium, except that in the two
                                           latter cases there 'is a'pre-existing
<U+FB01>brous tissue, which, before ossi<U+FB01>cation begins, undergoes'a change
similar to that which occurs‘in the bone itself'and is converted into
a cellular mass.        So that at the border 'where ossi<U+FB01>cation 'is' 'advan
cing there is only an 'hrrmgement‘of cells} while a little beyond
that point the cells have <U+FB01>brous tissue’ abundantly miXed'up 5With
them; and there is injfaet a resemblance to <U+FB01>brous tissue in antearly‘
state (if-formation. , The fermation of perfect bone'isv e<U+FB01>ected by
means of cells, perhaps identical with those which‘are'fouhd repla-~
cing the previous tissne, butht- all events undistinguishable from
them by any microscopical characters:                To these cells,"vvhich take        _
part in the formation         of‘bon'e,  the authors have given 'the' name of
“ osteal cells." In the case of laminated bone they arrange them
selves sidé by side, and, together with the transparent blastema in

                                      208
which they lie, become impregnated with ossi<U+FB01>c matter, and perma
nently fused with the bone tissue with which they lie” in contact.
By the linear arrangement of these osteal cells lamination is pro
duced.     In the case of new laminated bone the cells are simply os
si<U+FB01>ed without arrangement.         Lying amongst the osteal cells will be
seen some which have accumulated around them aquantity of tissue
which forms a thick investment to them ; they then become granular,
and take on in every respect the characters of a lacunal cell. These
are found deposited at intervals along the line of ossi<U+FB01>cation and be
coming blended with the general mass; the granular cell remaining
as a lacuna, and sending out processes amongst the cells in all di
rections.    ln old bone the cell character is in great part lost by a
general blending of the constituents, but may in many specimens be
still here and there recognised.        Many instances are given in sup
port of the conclusion that absorption of bone and of dental tissue
is effected directly through the in<U+FB02>uence of cells. but ,these are ne
cessarily excluded from this abstract; indeed it is impossible to give
any other than a very imperfect account of the contents of the paper
within the prescribed limits, especially as the numerous illustrations
which accompany the paper cannot be made use of.

    From the author’s experiments it appears that rubian is decom
posed by the <U+FB01>xed alkalies, and by lime and haryta, but not by am
monia.     The products of decomposition formed by the action of the
alkalies and alkaline earths are <U+FB01>ve in number.          They are as fol
lows :--lst, Alizarine; 2nd, Verantine; 3rd, Rubiretine; 4th, Sugar;
and 5th, a new substance, which the author denominates Rubiadine.
The <U+FB01>rst four possess the same properties and composition as when
formed by the action of acids on rubian. The <U+FB01>fth substance, rubia
dine, occupies the place of rubianine, which it closely resembles.      It
crystallizes from an alcoholic solution in small yellow or orange
coloured needles.      It is insoluble in boiling water, and when care
fully heated it may be almost entirely volatilizcd, forming a subli
mate of yellow micaceous scales, endowed with considerable lustre.
By these two properties it may be distinguished from rubianine, which
is soluble in boiling water, and cannot be heated without being de
composed.     Its other properties coincide almost entirely with those of
rubianine. Its composition is expressed by the formula C3, H,2 Os, and
presuming that the formula for rubianine be Cu HWO“, it would
differ from the latter only by the elements of 7 cquivs. of water.
Besides these substances, there is also formed a small quantity of
a dark brown powder, which is soluble in alkalies, but insoluble in
water and alcohol.       This substance has precisely the same compo
sition as the ulmic acid of Mulder, formed by the action of strong
acids on cane-sugar.       Its formation is doubtless due to the further
 action of the alkali on the sugar formed in the <U+FB01>rst instance.
    Action qf Fermean on Rubian.—lt has long been suspected by

                                      209
   chemists, that the colouring matter of maddeno'wes its ’foinia'tion' 'td
  some process    of fermentation, but the exact nature 'of the process
  has hitherto remaine'd unknown.       That sonie'process of decomposi-_

  tion takes place bri‘extra'cting    madder with
  exposing the extract to' a moderate temperature, is proved by the
  fact that the‘extract, if 'conCentrated, becomes ’after some time thick
  and gelatinous;     and that the process of decompOsition takes effect
  chie<U+FB02>y on the rubian is apparent, since the extract, after it has be;
 come gelatinbus,_is found to have lost its bitter taste and‘the greater
                                            '                                '
 part of its yellow colour.
      In order to prepare the peculiar fermentative substance of madder,
 which has the power of e<U+FB01>‘ecting the decomposition of rubian, it is
 merely necessary to add to an extract of madder made with cold or
 tepid water, about anequal volume of- alcohol.             This causes the
 separation    of  a  quantity  of dark  reddish-brown     <U+FB02>ocks,  which are
 collected on a <U+FB01>lter and washed with cold alcohol, until the perco
 lating liquid, which is at <U+FB01>rst'strongly coloured, becomes almost
 colourless.     The substance on'the <U+FB01>lter has the appearance ’of'a
 dark reddish-brown granular mass, which possesses in an eminent
 degree the power ‘of decomposing         rubian. It is a true ferment, to
which the author gives the name of Erythrozym.             If a quantity of it
he added to a solution of rubian, and the mixture he left to stand at
the ordinary temperature, a complete change is found to have taken
place in the course of a few hours.           The liquid is converted into a
trembling jelly of‘a light brown colour, Which is perfectly tasteless,
insoluble in cold water, and so consistent, that if the solution of
rubian was tolerably concentrated; the 'vessel may be turned over.
without its falling out.       During this process none' of the'usual signs
of fermentation are manifested. The liquid remains perfectly neutral,
and no gas of any kind is disengaged.           On treating the gelatinous
mass resulting from the process with cold water, an almost colourless
liquid is obtained, 'which contains the same species of sugar as that
formed by the action of acids or alkalies on rubian.           The mass left
undissolved by the cold water consists partly of the ferment em
ployed and partly of the substances formed by the decomposition of
the rubian.       These substances are six in number, of which three
are bodies’previously described, and three are new.               They are,—
lst, Alizarine; 2nd, Verantine; 3rd, Rubiretine; 4th, a substance
closely resembling rubiacine, which the author calls Rubia<U+FB01>ne_;
5th, a substance very similar to rubianine and rubiadine, on which he
bestows the name of Rubiagine; and 6th, a peculiar fatty substance
which he denominates Rubiadipine.                                            v ’I
     The three latter bodies, which are products peculiar to this. pro;
cess of decomposition, have the following properties :—
     Rubia<U+FB01>ne is obtained by crystallization from alcohol in yellow
glittering plates and needles, which are sometimes arranged in star
shaped or plume~shaped masses.           It cannot be distinguished by any
of its properties from rubiacine; its composition is however different.
Like the latter it is converted by the action of persalts of iron into
rubiacic acid.       The author has again submitted rubiacine and rubi
    I

                                      2l0
 acic acid, together with some of their compounds, to analysis, and
 from a comparison of their composition with that of rubiafine, he
infers that the formula of the latter is C” Hl3 09. that of rubiacine
C32 l-lu 0,0, that of rubiacic acid Ca2 H9      0";   and he inclines to the
belief, that by the action of persalts of iron rubiafine <U+FB01>rst passes into
rubiacine, bef0re being converted into rubiacic acid; while by the
action of reducing agents rubiacic acid is reconverted, <U+FB01>rst into rubi
acine, and then into rubia<U+FB01>ne.                                  .
  ‘ Ruhiagine is never obtained      in well-de<U+FB01>ned crystals.       When its
alcoho1ic solution is evaporated spontaneously, it is left behind in the
shape of small lemon-yellow spherical grains, which ,when crushed
and examined under a lens, are, found to consist of small crystalline
needles grouped round a centre“ When heated it melts, and is def
composed ‘without being volatilized.         It is quite insoluble in boiling
water. It is soluble in boiling nitric acid, with a yellow colour, and
crystallizes out again on the solution cooling in shining needles. Its
alkaline solutions are, blood-red.       The alcoholic solution gives 'on
the addition of acetate of lead at <U+FB01>rst no precipitate, but the colour
of the solution becomes dark yellow, and after some time, provided
the solution be not_too dilute, an orangemolouredgranular precipi
tate subsides, which is the lead compound of rubiagine.             If  no de
posit is formed, thenthe addition of water causes an orange-coloured
<U+FB02>occulent precipitate, which after being. washed with water, in-‘order
to remove the excess of acetate of lead, isfound to be ,very little
soluble in boiling alcohol, but is easily soluble in a. boiling alcoholic
solution of acetate of lead with a dark yellow or orange-colour.
When rubiagine is treated with a boiling solution of perchloride of
iron, it dissolves slightly, but is not converted into rubiacic acid.
Rubiagineis distinguished from rubianine by its insolubility in
water; from rubiadine, forwhich it might most easily be mistaken,
by its being incapable of sublimation ;‘ and from rubia<U+FB01>ne by its not
being convertible into rubiacic acid.       Its behaviour towards acetate
of lead, which is different from that of all the other three substances,
also serves to characterize it.       The most probable formula for ru
biagine is C3, H“ 010, from which it appears that it differs from the
substances just named merely by the elements of water.             lts forma
tion fromlrubian, like that of the substances allied to it, indicates
the simultaneous formation of sugar.v                 ‘       _ ,
    Rubiadi<U+FB01>ne is a body ofa fatty nature; as its name indicates. In
its appearance and general properties it resembles rubiretine.               It
differs fromthe     latter in always  remaining    soft and viscid<U+FB02>and   never
becoming hard and brittle, howeverlongit‘may be heated.v Its colour
is yellowish-brown.        When vheatedin a tube it emits acrid fumes,
similar-to t gas produced, by fatwhenexposed to destructive distil
lation., l,VVhen thrown into boiling water it melts and forms oily
drops<U+FB02>which‘rise to the surface.         Its alcoholic solution gives with
acetate of lead a pale reddish-brown precipitate, soluble in an excess
ofIthe' precipitant.     An analysis of the lead compound conducted to
the formula 0,,o H2, 05+Pb0.           If this formula be accepted as the
true  one,  the  author  confesses  his inability to explain the formation

                                            211
   of rubiadi<U+FB01>ne from rubian.       _ The       great excess of hydrogen contained
  in it shows that some substance must be formed-simultaneously con
  taining a large proportion of oxygen, which has hitherto escaped
  detection.                  I                   a.                   ,.       .
     Having examined generally. the action of erythrozym on rubian,

       There exist no means short of thecomplete destruction of the
        1.

 while in a moist state 'to the temperature of -boiling,water._ Even

             By the
 antiseptic, such as sulphuric acid, arsenious acid, sugar of lead, cor
 rosive sublimate, alcohol, and oil of turpentine, during the process of
 fermentation, the action of the ferment is not destroyed; it is merely
                                                                            '

    3. The more the action'ofthe-ferment on rubian is retarded, the.
 more rubiretine and .verantine, and- the less alizarine are formed; so
 much so, that in some cases the'alizarine disappears entirely from
 among the products‘of decomposition,         which then consist almost
 solely of rubiretine and. verantine.   The formation of rubia<U+FB01>ne and.
 rubiagine is promoted when the-action of the f<U+FB01>nnent ismoderately
retarded, but diminishes=again or entirely ceases. when the retarda
 tion is very great.   Of the two the rubiagineis the <U+FB01>rst to disappear    '
when any retardation takes place.                                            _
    4. By the addition of small quantities of alkalies during the pro
cess of fermentation, the action is, as regards its duration, if not
promoted,,at all events not retarded ;. and vasregards the relative
quantities of the various substances produced, the amount of alizarine
is thereby    decidedly increased; while that of the rubiretine and
                                               -
verantine is diminished.                  _
    Most of the ordinary fennentative       substances,    such as albumen,
caseine, gelatine, and yeast, are incapable of effecting the .decompo-'
sition of rubian, evenqwhen mixtures of_ these various substances
with watery solutions of rubian are allowed to‘ stand until they enter
into a state of putrefaction.     Emulsinje is the only, substance capa
ble of forming an effective substitute for erythrozym.          Its action is
similar to that of- the latter substance ;-      .gives rise however to the
                                                                 it.
formation of av much larger proportional quantity of alizarine.          The
action of the peculiar albuminous substance, discoVered by Braconnot

It in
    exerts only a slight effect on the latter, the only products of de4
                                                                  >
composition formed being rubiretine and verantine.
    The author considers the fact of erythrozym being almost the only

                                   212
ferment which is capable of effecting in any considerable degree the
decomposition      of rubian, as the best proof of its being a pecu
liar and distinct substance.      When prepared by precipitation with
alcohol, erythrozym is obtained as a chocolate-coloured          granular
mass.     When dried it coheres into hard lumps, which are alm0st
black, and with dif<U+FB01>culty reduced to powder.         When the dry sub
stance is heated on platinum foil, it emits a smell somewhere between
that of burning peat and burning horn, and then burns without much
<U+FB02>ame, leaving a considerable quantity of residue, which on being
further heated is soon converted into a white or grey ash.
    After having once been precipitated from its watery solution, even
by alcohol, erythrozym cannot again be dissolved in water.        If it be
 mixed while in a moist state with water, it forms a reddish-brown
turbid liquid, in which it exists however merely in a state of suspen
sion.    Erythrozym is not an uncombined substance, butis a definite
compound of an organic body with lime.         When treated with acids
the lime is removed, and the colour of the substance changes from
reddish-brown to yellowish-brown.        If a mixture of erythrozym and
water he allowed to stand for some time, the former enters into a
state of putrefaction, accompanied by a disengagement of gas. After
it has entered on this stage of decomposition, it loses in great part
the power of decomposing rubian, but acquires that of producing an
acid reaction in a solution of sugar.     Erythrozym contains nitrogen,
but in much smaller proportion than most other fermenmti've sub
 stances.    lts composition, when in a freshly precipitated state, is
expressed by the formula CM HM N., O40+4Ca0.             When allowed to
decompose,      it loses carbonic acid, water,  and   lime.  A quantity
 which had been employed for the purpose of effecting the decompo
 sition of rubian, and then separated again from the products of the
 action, had a composition corresponding to the fermula C ,2 H32 N._. 030'
 + SCuO.
    In conclusion, the author gives the results of some experiments
 undertaken with the view of ascertaining whether madder contains
 more than one colouring matter or not.        He infers from his experi
 ments, that the purpurine of other chemists is nota substance of de
 terminate composition; that it consists sometimes of alizarine alone,
 sometimes of verantine alone, sometimes of a variable mixture of
 both ; that only one colouring matter, viz. alizarine‘, can be obtained
 from madder; that purpurine, madder-purple, and the various similar
 bodies derived from madder, owe their property as colouring matters
 to an admixture of alizarine; and that they are simply the latter

     3. “ Experiments towards the construction of new forms of Instru
 ments for the correction of Compass Errors due to the presence of
 iron in ships ; with investigations on the nature of the attraction of
 Iron on the poles of Magnets."         By Julius Roberts, Esq., Lieut.
 R.M. Artillery. Communicated by Capt. W. H. Smyth,' R.N.,
 For. Sec. R.S. Received March 25, 1852.
     The object of the author’s experiments and investigations is stated

                                     213
   to have been the production of an instrument that would, under all
  variety of circumstances, give a correct (magnetic) meridian direc
  tion, or in some way indicate the amount of its own error; and he
  considers that he has, at least partially, succeeded in the attainment
  of this object in the instrument described in this paper, and of
  which drawings accompany the communication.
     In order to determine the nature of the action of a mass of iron on
  a magnetic needle, the author constructed needles with the magnetic
  bar wholly on one side of the central support, counterpoised by an
  arm carrying a weight on the other. In some of these the magnetic
  bar was straight, in others it was bent in the middle, eitherithc
  upper or lower half bein     horizontal.   He also constructed a com
  pound needle of two sue bent bars, suspended concentrically with
  two of their contrary poles remote, the other two poles being the
 one above and the other below the points of support.          In order to
  give magnetic stability to the compound needle, an arc of soft iron
  was attached to the extremity of the counterpoisiug arm of each
  magnet, so as to be in close proximity, though not actually to touch
 the other.    Attached to the counterpoise arms-were the halves of a
 compass card cut through the east and west points, and so adjusted
 that the edge of one was vertically over that of the other when the
 needles were in the same vertical plane, but crossed each other when
 the needles deviated from the same direction.         The author con
 sidered that a mass of iron attracting each pole of this‘compound
 needle would cause the cards to cross each other, and thus give the
 amount of deviation due to that mass, but found that, instead of the
 cards crossing, the needles deviated in contrary directions so as to
 remain in one straight line, as if they had been rigidly connected.
     To obviate this, for the magnet having its unmarked end pointing
 south was substituted one having its marked end in that direction,
 but of less power than that of which the marked end pointed north ;
 and two magnets rigidly connected in the same straight line, with
 their marked ends remote, were balanced concentric with the other
 two. The author considers that the result of this combination would
 be, that this astatic bar would, by the repulsion between its poles
 and those of the other magnets, take up a position at right angles
to the magnetic meridian, the other magnets pointing due north and
south.     Further, that the north pointing and south pointing ends of
 the compound needle on the half cards being poles of thesa'me name,
that is, both marked, any mass of iron which attracted one end
would also attract the other, and thus the half cards which they,
 carried would be caused to cross each other.         So that the whole
being properly adjusted, the deviations caused by the' iron on{ the
two needles will be equal, and the error of deviation of either one
will be half the angle between the two. A <U+FB01>gure of this complicated
compass accompanies the description.
    In conclusion, the author states that the practicability of rendering
the instrument so simple and accurate as to be generally useful, de
pends on eXperiments and investigations         yet to be made;       and

 Series revised), and on the direct agency of the Spermatozoon.” By
 George Newport, F.R.S., F.L.S. 810.         Received June 17, 1852.
    The author remarks that, having in a former paper shown that the
 spermatozoon alone is the impregnatory agent, he endeavoured in a
 subsequent communication to the Royal Society, a report of which
 is printed in the Proceedings for June 1851, to arrive at some con
 clusion as to the nature of its in<U+FB02>uence; and, from the facts he. was
 then acquainted with, he announced the View that the spermatozoon
 appeared to be the organ of a special form or condition of force in
 the animal body.    At that time he had no evidence that the sperma
 tozoon penetrates into the coverings of the egg, as he had constantly
found it attached only to the surface.        Since then he has detected
 it within the substance of these coverings, and sometimes even par_
tially imbedded in the vitelline membrane beneath them; but he has
no evidence that it enters the vitelline cavity.      While therefore the
fact of penetration into the envelopes necessitates some revision of
the details of the view announced, he still regards the spermatozoon
as the organ of a special condition or form of force in the animal
structure.
    He then proceeds to show the relative duration of vitality in the
spermatozoon and the egg, and points out that that of the former
is shorter than is usually supposed ; that at, the temperature of
55° Fahr. it usually is lost in from three to four hours after removal
from the body into water; but that at a lower temperature it is
retained longer, and that when the spermatic <U+FB02>uid has contained
many undeveloped cells, and has been preserved in a temperature of
51° Fahr., it has fertilized at the end of twenty-four hours.     The egg
loses its <U+FB01>tness to be impregnated very soon after it is passed into
water, usually within the <U+FB01>rst hour, owing chie<U+FB02>y to the endosmosis
and expansion of its envelopes. But when retained within the body of

 the dead frog its vitality is preserved for twenty-four, and sometimes
 even for forty-eight hours, at a low temperature.   He next shows that
 the results produced by the active vibratile spermatozoa on the dead
 egg are similar to those which are at <U+FB01>rst produced on the living one
 by solution of potass, viz. the yelk becomes shrivelled and con
 tracted, and this result also occurs when decomposing spermatic
 <U+FB02>uid is applied to it.     Having repeated the experiments formerly
 mentioned (Proceedings, p. 83), that the frog’s egg may be fecun
 dated by application of exceeding minute quantities of spermatozoa
 by means of the head, and even of the point of a small pin, to
almost any part of its surface, he shows that there are some parts
of the surface more, and some less, susceptible than others; and that,
in a series of careful experiments made with a view to test this fact,
he found that when the egg is placed vertically, with the centre of
the white surface uppermost, and the spermatozoa are applied to
 this part, and not allowed to <U+FB02>ow over the sides of the egg, fecun
dation is then but rarely e<U+FB02>‘ected; but that when the centre of the
dark surface is uppermost, and the spermatozoon is applied to that
part, fecundation of the egg is then almost invariably the result.     A
fact is also mentioned which is of some value in experiments on
arti<U+FB01>cial impregnation. The chamber which is formed above the
yelk in the fecundated egg, as described in the author's former
paper, is commenced at the end of the <U+FB01>rst hour, by the contraction
and depression of the upper or dark surface of the yolk; and thus
ail'ords an early proof as to whether or not the egg has been fecun
dated.     When no chamber is formed, it is certain that the egg has
not been fecundated.       But the chamber may be formed, and the yelk
not undergo segmentation; in which case fecundation has been only
partial and incomplete.       The motion of the spermatozoon in relation
to its function is then examined, and the author states that he re
gards this motion as only the visible exponent of a peculiar power
in the impregnating agent, and as essential toits function, and that
it is associated with the material composition and structure of this
body, the degree of procreative ef<U+FB01>ciency of which, he thinks, is
indicated by the degree, or intensity of its motive power; although
he believes that some portion of the substance of the body of the
spermatozoon is also communicated to the egg in fecundation.
    The author then shows that having adopted a mode of examining
the egg, beneath the microscope, at the time of the spermatozoa
being supplied to it, different from that which he formerly employed,
he has been enabled to detect the fact of penetration by the sperma
tozoon into the envelopes, and its arrival at the vitelline membrane,
with great facility. Availing himself of the fact previously ascer
tained, that impregnation may be effected by the direct application
of the spermatozoon by means of the pin’s head or point, he put the
fact of penetration to a very positive test beneath the microscope,
and found that the spermatozoon always penetrates at the parts to
which it is applied, and at no other part of the egg, and theta short
time afterwards it may be detected striking into the vitellme mem
brane, by its thicker or body portion, in a line with the              at
                                                                 *pomt
                                                              15

                                   216
which it has entered, and the centre of the yelk, and that he has
usually found eggs so penetrated to have been fertilized and produce
embryos.     Further, that eggs in which no spermatozoa have been
seen in contact with the yelk membrane, have usually been un
fruitful, although numerous spermatozoa have been observed on
their surface.   During his experiments the author had an oppor
tunity of examining some eggs which had been impregnated by the
natural concurrence of the sexes, and then found that these most
fully con<U+FB01>rmed the results obtained by arti<U+FB01>cial impregnation.
Spermatozoa were observed sticking into the vitelline membrane for
many hours after the time at which the egg must have been fecun
dated; which the author believes must be within the <U+FB01>rst half-hour,
and perhaps within the <U+FB01>rst few minutes; as he has sometimes found
spermatozoa close to the vitelline membrane within one minute after
they had been supplied to the egg.        The spermatozoon invariably
enters the egg with its thicker or body portion foremost, and passes
onwards with a direct but slightly serpentine motion, in a centripetal
direction to the vitelline membrane.        A large proportion of the
spermatozoa never enter the envelopes of the egg, if they happen to
come into contact with them laterally, as is frequently the case; they
then merely adhere to the surface, but do not fecundate.            The
greatest number penetrate when supplied to the egg within a few
seconds after removal from the male body, and of the eggs from the
body of .the female.    Some experiments are then detailed which the
author states arose out of a communication made to him by Mr.
Busk, F.R.S.     The spermatozoa were narcotized'by exposure for
eight or ten minutes to the vapour of chloroform, and it was then
found that when in this state, while perfectly motionless, as when
dead, they did not impregnate.       These experiments, in connection
with others, seemed to show that the entrance of the spermatozoon
into the egg is not the result of an endosmic action of the envelopes,
but is that of the operation of a distinct power in the spermatozoon.
    The nature of the in<U+FB02>uence of the spermatozoon is then examined.
The author has endeavoured to put this to the test of experiment,
<U+FB01>rst, by immersion of eggs, both before, and at the period of fecun
dation, and during the segmentation        of the yelk, in solutions of
potass; and next, by reducing the bodies of recently-obtained and
perfectly active spermatozoa, to a <U+FB02>uid state, by trituration in a
glass mortar, prepared for the purpose, and then applying the ma
terials so obtained to the egg immediately it is expelled from the
female, and before it has been in contact with water; and conse
quently at the time it is most susceptible of the fecundatory in<U+FB02>uence.
The experiments by immersion in potass solution showed that the
endosmic action of the egg envelopes is exceedingly rapid, as decom
position of the yelk was commenced in somewithin three minutes of
the application of the solution.   In very weak solution the result was
different, and appeared to be favourable to the action of the sperma
tozoon.    The <U+FB02>uid obtained by trituration of the spermatozoa was
 applied to several sets of eggs, but no fecundation of the egg was
 effected by it; the yelks, however, became affected, being in some

                                    217
   cases shrivelled and contracted, as when potass solution or decom~
   posing seminal <U+FB02>uid is applied, thus showing that the substance of
   the broken down spermatozoa had passed to the yelk by endosmosis.
   These experiments were made at the same time with others made
  with portions of the same <U+FB02>uid which had not been triturated, and
  in which the spermatozoa were still active.     In these instances fe
  cundation was constantly effected, so that the conclusion deduced
  from these comparative trials was, that fecundation is not the result
  simply of the addition of the substance of the body of the sperma
  tozoon to the egg, but primarily seems to be due to a force or
  dynamic power in the spermatozoon, which is lost when this body
  has ceased to give evidence of its retention of it, in its power of
  motion.                                              _
   '
      The author then proceeds to inquire whether these results do not
 justify our viewing the spermatozoon as the organ of a special form
  or condition of force in the animal structure? and states, as he
  has done on a former “occasion     (Proceedings, June 1851, p. 83),
  other grounds on which ' the hypothesis seems to be supported,
 pointing out that the spermatozoon, like muscle and nerve, has both
 general and special anatomical structure and spedial chemical com
 pOsition ; and that as we have been accustorned to regard the power
 of muscular cOntractilityas a distinct force, or form of force, of the
 body,—the same'view being held with regard to nerve, the properties
 of these two tissues being perfectly distinct from each other,~—so'
 it appears to be correct to view the property of the spermatic-str-uc
 ture; which is not only perfectly distinct from either of these, but
 different from that of' every other tissue in the organization, and is
 not exercised until' the structure itself has been entirely separated
 from the body of which it'originally formed a part.
     2. “On the Functions of the Membrana Tympani, the Ossicles
 and Muscles of the Tympanum, and of the Eustachian Tube in the
 Human Ear, with an account of the Muscles of the Eustachian Tube
and their action in di<U+FB01>erent classes. of Animals.”           By Joseph
 Toynbee, Esq., F.R.S. &c.       Received June 15, 1852.
     The author commences his'paper by making some observations on
the general arrangements of the ossicula auditris.       The malleus and
incus being <U+FB01>rmly connected together by ligaments, are considered
as a single bone, forming an elastic arch, the anterior extremity of
which is <U+FB01>rmly attached to the Glasserian <U+FB01>ssure, the posterior to
the anterior part of the mastoid cells.     This arch is kept steady by
the actions of the tensor tympani.       The movement of this arch is
that of rotation; and it is effected by the tensor tympani muscle.
When this muscle contracts, the lower part of the arch, consisting
of the handle of the malleus and the long process of the incus, is
drawn inwards; by this action the membrana tympani is rendered
tense, and the stapes being pressed towards the cavity of the laby
                                                              '
rinth, the <U+FB02>uid in the latter is compressed.
     The anatomy and attachments of the stapes are next minutely
described. The base of this bone, generally stated by writers on

                                    2l8
 the physiology of the ear as being attached to the margin of the
fenestra ovalis by a simple membrane, Iigamentum unnulare ba'seos
 stapidis, is shown to possess some points of considerable interest.
 instead of a simple margin to which the ligament above noticed is
 <U+FB01>xed, the base of the stapes is stated to present a circumferential
 surface for articulation with the fenestra ovalis.    This circumferen
 tial surface, larger at the anterior and posterior extremities than in
 the middle, is covered by articular cartilage.      The surface of the
fenestra ovalis, to which the circumference of the base of the stapes
 is applied, is somewhat larger than that of the stapes. It is smooth,
 has a very compact structure, and is not covered by cartilage.
     The base of the stapes is attached to the fenestra ovalis by two
 ligaments.     The inner or vestibular ligament passes from the inner
 margin of the fen‘estra ovalz's to the inner margin of the circumferen
 tial surface of the base of the stapes.     The outer one passes from
 the outer margin of the fenestra ovalis to the corresponding margin
 of the stapes.     These two circular ligaments leave between them a
 space which may be considered as an articular cavity; this cavity
 always containing a suf<U+FB01>cient quantity of <U+FB02>uid to lubricate the arti
 cular surfaces of the bones.
     The movements of the stapes are of two kinds, one being produced
 by the action of the tensor tympani, the other by the stapedius
 muscle.     If the tensor tympani muscle be drawn in the direction of
 its course, while the cavity of the vestibule has been exposed to
 view, the base of the stapes will be observed to be slightly projected
 towards the cavity of the vestibule, and it returns to its normal posi—
 tion as soon as the muscle is left quiescent: the'ligaments above
 described appear to be the organs whereby the stapes is again
 drawn outwards.        In this movement the stapes may therefore be
 described as passing to and fro within the fenestra' ovalis, as a
 piston does in a cylinder.     The second movement of which the base
 of- the stapes partakes is one of rotation, and it is effected by the
 stapedius muscle.      To show this movement, it is requisite to per
 form one or two careful experiments.       The stapedius muscle being
 exposed in its canal, while the stapes is left undisturbed in the tym~
 panic cavity which has been laid open, if the muscle be drawn in
 the direction of its course, the anterior eras of the stapes is observed
 to move slightly outwards and backwards.          In whatr manner the
 base of the stapes is affected during this movement of the crura it is
 dif<U+FB01>cult to decide, but it would appear probable that its anterior
 part is drawn outWards from the cavity of the vestibule while the
  posterior part is pressed inwards, though to a less extent.         That
  the action of the stapedius muscle is to relax the <U+FB02>uid of the laby
  rinth, is however shown by the following experiment.          The tymi
 panic cavity and stapedius muscle being exposed to view, a section
  is to be made through the cochlea, a small portion of the 'scala ves
  tibuli being left'continuous with the cavity of the vestibule.    If, the
  stapedius muscle be now drawn in the direction of its course, the
  <U+FB02>uid in thecut extremity of the scala vestibuli is observed to recede
  slightly towards the_vestibule, and it‘ returns to its former position

                                        219
    as soon as the stapedius     muscle is left quiet.    A second action of
    the stapedius muscle is to act as a laxator of the membrana tympani,
   and it thus appears that the stapedius muscle is the antagonist of
   the tensor tympani; and it seems to be brought into action during the
   act of listening, while the tensor tympani, on the contrary, contracts
   when the ear has to be protected from any loud vibrations.
       The next part of the paper is devoted to the consideration of the
   functions of the membrane tympani; which, besides the one usually
   ascribed to it, viz. of receiving the sonorous vibrations from the air
  and of conducting them to the chain of bones and thence to the
   labyrinth, the author considers to be as follows :—
       1. To act in conjunction with the ossicles and muscles of the
  tympanum as the analogue of the iris in the eye, and to exclude
  from reception by the labyrinth, of such strong vibrations as would
  be injurious to its integrity ; also, in exactly opposite circumstances,
  to receive the most faint undulations, which would not be perceived
  unless the membrane tympani were rendered less tense than is the
  case in ordinary circumstances.         The former of the two duties is
  performed by the tensor tympani muscle, the latter by the stapedius.
  The membranavtympam' is not only of use in preventing powerful
  sonorous vibrations from compressing too forcibly the expansion of
  the auditory nerve, but it also protects the labyrinth from the ford-4
  ble pressure of air or of a foreign substance in the meatus, during a
  blow on the ear or the introduction of a solid body which presses
  against the membrana tympani.
  7 2. The membrana tympani shuts out the air in the meatus from
'that in the tympanic cavity, and by this means an atmosphere of
  certain physical conditions is constantly kept in contact with the
  membranes between the tympanum and labyrinth.
      The second part of the paper is devoted to the examination of [the
  Eustachian tube inman and animals.           Anatomists seem to have in
 ferred    that the  Eustachian  tubes  in their natural state are constantly
 open, and that the air of the tympanic cavities is always continuous
  with that in the fences.      An examination of the guttural portion of
 the Eustachian tube in man and animals has led the author to con
 clude, that excepting during muscular effort, this ori<U+FB01>ce is always
 closed, and that the tympanum is a cavity distinct from the outer
 air. iThe agents whereby the Eustachian tubes are opened in the
 human subject, are the muscles of the palate, and it is by their
 action during the process of swallowing that the tubes are ordinarily
 opened.        That the act of swallowing is the means whereby the
 Eustachian tubes are Opened, is shown by some experiments of which
 the following may be cited.         If the mouth and nose be closed du
 ring    the  act of swallowing,   a sensation of fulness and distension is
 produced in the ears; this arises from the air, which is slightly com
 pressed in the fences, passing into and <U+FB01>lling the tympanic cavities;
 upon removing the hand from the nose, it will be observed that this
 feeling of distension does not disappear, but remains until the act of
 .deglutition is again performed, but while the nose is not closed; in
 this experiment the Eustachian tubes were opened during each act

                                    2‘20
of swallowing; lrut during the <U+FB01>rst act, while they were open, air
was forced into the cavity of the tympanum by the contraction of
the muscles of the fauces and pharynx, and the ori<U+FB01>ces were again
closed, and remained so until the second act of swallowing, which
opened the tube and allowed the air to escape. That the act of de
glutition opens the Eustachian tubes, was inferred also from the cus
tom usually adopted of swallowing while the descent in a diving-bell
is performed; by this act the condensed air is allowed to enter the
tym'panum and the sensation of pain and pressure in the ears is
avoided. The author then proceeds to show that the tensor and levator
palati are the muscles which are attached to and open the Eustachian
tubes in man, and the mode in which they act is pointed out.
    The third part of the paper is devoted to the examination of the
Eustachian tube in animals; and the author arrives at the conclusion,
that in Mammalia, Birds, and those reptiles having a tympanicpavity,
the Eustachian tubes, as in man, are closed excepting during muscular
effort.   In some mammalia the muscles opening the tubes are, as in
man, those belonging to the palate ;-in others the function is per
formed by the superior constrictor of the pharynx.         In birds it is
shown that there is a single membranous tube into which the two
osseous tubes Open; this membranous tube is situated between, and
intimately adherent to, the inner surface of each pterygoid muscle,
and by which muscles the tube is opened.
    The conclusion respecting the in<U+FB02>uence of the closed Eustachian tubes
to which the author arrives, is that the function of hearing is best
carried on while the tyrn'panum is a closed cavity; that the analogy
usually cited as existing between the ordinary musical instrument, the
drum and the tympanum, to the effect that in each it is requisite
for 'the air within to communicate freely with the outer air, is not
correct. The view that the sonorous vibrations of the air in a closed
tympanic cavity are more effective in impressing the membrane of
the fenestra rotunda than when it is open to the outer air, is strength
ened by the performance of the following experiment with the tuning
fork. v'If this instrument be made to vibrate by striking it against
a <U+FB01>rm solid, and if the handle be then placed in contact with the
head, the sound at <U+FB01>rst loud, gradually becomes fainter, and soon
 ceases to be heard ; if at the moment that it has ceased to be heard,
a <U+FB01>nger be placed over the tragus of one ear, and <U+FB01>rmly pressed-e0
 as to close the external meatus from the outer air, the sound of the
 tuning-fork is again heard, and continues to be heard for some
 seconds; thus showing that the soncrous undulations existing in
the external meatus are not suf<U+FB01>ciently powerful to affect sensibly
the membrana tympani until they are wholly con<U+FB01>ned by the walls
 of the tube when closed.
    The leading results arrived at in the paper are as follows :—
    1. That a principal function 'of the membrane tympani muscles
 and ossicles of the tympanum, is to act as the analogue of the iris in
 the eye.
    2. That the tensor tympani muscle, by drawing tense the mem
 bruna tympani, and by compressing at the same time the <U+FB02>uid in the

                                   221
labyrinth, protects the ear from the injurious in<U+FB02>uence of very
powerful vibrations.
    3. The stapedius muscle, by slightly relaxing the membrana
tympani and the <U+FB02>uid of the labyrinth, places the ear in a position
to be in<U+FB02>uenced by vibrations of a most delicate character.
    4. Another function of the membrane tympani is to form part of
 the resonant walls of the closed tympanic cavity.
    5. The guttural ori<U+FB01>ces of the Eustachian tubes are closed, and the
 tympanic cavities do not communicate with the cavity of the fauces
 excepting during certain muscular actions.                        t.
    6. In man and some mammalia the Eustachian tubes are opened
 by the muscles of the palate, in other animals by the superior con
 strictor of the pharynx.                                    ‘ I
    7. In birds there is a membranous       tube common to the two
 osseous Eustachian tubes, and this common tube is opened by the
 action of the internal pterygoid muscles.
    8. For the fun'ction of hearing to be perfect, it is requisite that
 the tympanic cavity should be closed from the outer air.

 fested during the organic process of Secretion in living animals
 (continued). By H. F. Baxter, Esq‘ Communicated by R. B. Todd,
 M. D., F.R.S.     &c.  Received  April 30, 1852.
    The present communication is acontinuation of a series of expe
 riments, the <U+FB01>rst part of which was published in the Phil. Trans.
 for theyear 1848.      The object is to show that the changes which
 occur during the organic process of secretion in living animals are
 accompanied- with the manifestation of current force; and the prin
 cipal facts upon which this conclusion is founded are the following :—
     lst. It was found that when the electrodes of a galvanometer are
 brought into contact with the secreted product and the venous blood
 <U+FB02>owing from the same organ, an effect upon the needle is produced,
 indicating the venous blood to be positive.    This fact was established
 in the liver, kidneys and mammary gland.
     2ndly. The effect could not be referred to the heterogeneity of the
 <U+FB02>uids without assuming that the blood was acid and combined with
.the. secreted product; nor could it be referred entirely to thermo
 electric e<U+FB02>'ects, inasmuch as the current varied in each organ, and
 was capable of. traversing a liquid conductor.     The effects, however,
 maybe partly due to catalytic actions on the combining power of pla
 tinum ; and this last supposition tended to con<U+FB01>rm the opinion ori
  ginally entertained by Wollaston, that the changes which occur
 during secretion are analogous to those which take place in the de
 composing cell of a voltaic circle.
    Without giving any de<U+FB01>nite opinion as to the lungs performing
 the of<U+FB01>ce of a secreting organ, it was found, that when one electrode
 was in contact with the mucous surface, and the other in contact
 with the blood in the pulmonary veins, an effect occurred upon the
needle indicating the blood (arterial) to be positive.     This fact ap

                                    222
pears to afford some explanation of the failures of Muller, Pouillet
and of the author in his early attempts to obtain evidence of current
force being manifested when a circuit was formed between an artery
and a vein in the living animal.

   4. " On   a new Series of Organic Bodies containing Metals.”        By
Dr.   E. Frankland,   Professor of Chemistry, Owen’s College, Men
chester.    Communicated     by B. C. Brodie, Esq., F.R.S.       Received
May 10, 1852.
   The author communicates in this memoir the continuation of his
researches, a preliminary announcement of which appeared several
years ago, upon a new series of organic compounds closely allied to
cacodyl in their composition and properties, and which, like that
body, are formed by the union of 'the alcohol radicals with various
metals, and are distinguished for their powerful electro-positive cha
racter.   These remarkable compounds are procured by the action of
heat or light upon their proximate constituents, and are thus distin
guished from most other organic compounds of this nature by the
manner of their formation.        The author describes seven of these
compounds.
   Stanerhylium.-—Wlien iodide of ethyl and metallic tin are exposed
to the-in<U+FB02>uence of heat or light, which is most conveniently done in
sealed glass tubes, the tin gradually dissolves in the ethereal liquid,
which <U+FB01>nally solidi<U+FB01>es to a mass of colourless crystals.       A quantity
of gas, comparatively very small, is generated at'the same time.
This gaseous product of the reaction proved, on analysis, to be a
mixture of hydride of ethyl and ole<U+FB01>ant gas, produced from the de
composition of iodide of ethyl by tin into iodide of tin and ethyl,
which last is transformed at the moment of its liberation into the
two' gases just mentioned.       The principal and most important re
action, however, consists in the direct union of tin with iodide of
ethyl, giving rise to a crystalline body which is the iodide of a new
organic radical, stanethylium.
   By double decomposition the other compounds of stanethylium
can be readily formed; the author has prepared and described the
oxide, chloride, bromide and sulphide of stanethylium; these bodies
exhibit a striking resemblance to the corresponding bi-compounds of
tin, but are distinguished from them by a peculiar pungent and        ini
tating' odour resembling that of the volatile oil of mustard.        >
   If a slip of zinc be immersed in a solution of chloride of sums
ethylium, dense oily drops soon form on the surface of the zinc, and
<U+FB01>nally collect at the bottom of the vessel. This oily liquid is the
radical stanethylium, which possesses the following properties :—it
exists at ordinary temperatures as a thick heavy oily liquid of a
yellow or brownish-yellow colour, and an. exceedingly pungent
odour resembling that of its compounds, but'much more powerful.
It is insoluble in-water, but soluble in alcohol and ether. At about
150° 0. it enters into ebullition, but is simultaneously decomposed,
metallic tin being deposited.        In contact with air stanethyliurn
rapidly  absorbs  oxygen,  and is converted into oxide of 'stanethylium.

Chloride, iodide and bromide of stanethyliuniare' instantaneously
formed by the action of chlorine, iodine and bromine, or their hydro
gen acids respectively, upon stanethylium.         The two <U+FB01>rst are in
every respect identical with the salts above mentioned, and the iden
tity of the bromide is further proved by an ultimate analysis.v The
formula of stanethyliurn is 0, H5 Sn; that of the oxide C4 H,I SnO,
and that of the bromide C4 H5 Sn Br.        Stanethylium therefore per
fectly resembles cacodyl in its reactions, combining directly with
the electro-negative    elements, and regenerating the compounds from
                                                 '
which it has been derived.                                        " ‘
     Stanmethylium and stanamylium are formed when the iodides of
methyl and amyl respectively are exposed to the action of light in
 contact with tin ; their salts are isomorphous with those of stanethy
lium, but they have not yet been completely investigated.
     Zincmethylium.—-This radical is formed in an uncombined state
 when iodide of methyl and zinc are exposed to a temperature of
 about 150° C. in a sealed tube; the zinc gradually dissolves with
 an evolution of gas, whilst a 111858 bfl white crystals and a Colourless
 mobileliquid re<U+FB02>ecting light strongly, occupy, after a few hours,
 the place of the original materials.      In this reaction two distinct
 decompositions take place, viz. the decomposition of iodide of methyl
 by zinc with the production of iodide of zinc and liquid zincmethy
 lium, and the decomposition of iodide of methyl by zinc with the
 formation of iodide of zinc and the gaseousradical methyl.            The
 zincmethylium was obtained pure by distillation in "an vatmosphere
 of dry hydrogen.      Its formula is C2 H3 Zn, and 'it'possesse's the fol
 lowing properties. It is a colourless, transparent and very mobile
 liquid, possessing   a  peculiar penetrating and linsuPportable odour,
 and boiling at a low temperature.      Zincmethylium combines directly
 with oxygen, chlorine, iodine, &e., forming somewhat unstable com
 pounds. Its a<U+FB01>inity for oxygen is even more intense than that of
 potassium ;' in contact with atmospheric air it instantaneously ig
 nites, burning with a beautiful greenish blue <U+FB02>ame, and forming
 white clouds of oxide of zinc; in contact with pure oxygen it burns
 with explosion, and the presence of a small quantity of its vapour in
 combustible gases gives them the property of spontaneous in<U+FB02>amma
 bility .in oxygen. Thrown into water, zincmethyliurn decomposes
  that liquid with the evolution of heat and light; when this action is
  moderated,   the sole products of the decomposition    are oxide of zinc
  and hydride of methyl.
     The extraordinary affinity of zincmethylium for oXygen, its pecu
  liar composition, and the facility with which it can be procured, can
  not fail to cause its employment for a great variety of transforma
  tions in organic compounds; by its agency there is everyprobability
  that oxygen, chlorine, &c. can be replaced atom for atom by methyl,
  and thus entirely new series of organic'comp‘ounds will be produced,
  and clearer views of the rational constitution of- others be obtained.
      The gaseous methyl formed simultaneously with zincmethylium
  is identical in composition and properties with the methyl derived
  from the electrolysis of acetic acid; it Was 'miXe‘d,"‘hoWever, with

                                    224

hydride of methyl generated by the decomposition of accompanying
zincmethylium vapour by the water over which the gas was col
lected.
    Zincethylium and zincamylium are homologous bodies formed by
similar processes; their investigation is not yet completed.
    Hydrargyromethylium.-—'l‘he    author has only yet studied the iodide
of this radical, which is formed by the action of sunlight upon iodide
of methyl and metallic mercury.          After an exposure of several days
to sunlight, white crystals begin to form in the liquid, which <U+FB01>nally
solidi<U+FB01>es to a white crystalline mass; ether dissolves out the new
compound and deposits it perfectly pure by spontaneous evaporation.
    Iodide of hydrargyromethylium (C2 l-l3 Hgl) is a white solid,
crystallizing in minute nacreous scales, which are insoluble in water,
moderately soluble in alcohol, and very soluble in ether and iodide
 of methyl; it is slightly volatile at ordinary temperatures, and ex
hales a weak but peculiarly unpleasant odour, which leaves a nau
seous taste upon the palate for several days.         At 100° C. the vola
tility is much greater, and the crystals are rapidly dissipated at this
temperature when exposed to a current of air.           At 143° C. it fuses
and sublimes without decomposition, condensing in brilliant and ex
tremely thin crystalline plates.      In, contact with the <U+FB01>xed alkalies
and ammonia it is converted into oxide of hydrargyromethylium,
which is dissolved by an excess of all these reagents.
    A corresponding compound containing amyl is formed, though
 with dif<U+FB01>cultyhunder similar circumstances, but the attempts to form
one containing ethyl have not yet been successful.             Preliminary
experiments have also been made with other metals, amongst which
arsenic, antimony, chromium, iron, manganese and cadmium promise
interesting  results.
    From  a review    of the composition and habits of all the organo
metallic bodies and their compounds at present known, the author
is of opinion that the view most generally held respecting the con
stitution of cacodyl, according to which that radical is a conjugate
 compound consisting of arsenic conjugated with two atoms of methyl,
 and which view must, if true, he applied to all the organo-metallic
bodies, is no longer tenable; and he contends that the behaviour of
these bodies clearly indicates that they are compounds formed upon
 the type of the oxides of the respective metals, a portion of the city-
genbeing replaced by the several radicals, methyl, ethyl and amyl;
the establishment of this new view of their constitution will remove
these bodies from the class of organic radicals, and place them in the
most intimate relation with ammonia and the bases of Wurtz, Hof
mann and Paul Thenard; indeed the close analogy between stibethine
and ammonia <U+FB01>rst suggested by Gerhardt, has been most satisfac
torily demonstrated by the behaviour of stibethine with the haloid
 compounds of methyl and ethyl.          Stibethine furnishes us therefore
 with a remarkable example of the law of symmetrical combination,
 and shows that the formation of a <U+FB01>ve-atom group from one con
 taining three atoms can be effected by the assimilation of two atoms,
 either of the same or of opposite electro-chemical         character: this

                                        2'25
remarkable circumstance suggests the following question.                Is this
behaviour common also to the corresponding compounds of arsenic?
phosphorus and nitrogen, and can the position of each of the <U+FB01>ve
atoms with which these elements respectively combine be occupied
indi<U+FB01>'erently by an electro-negative          or an electro-positive element?
This question, so important for the advance of our knowledge of
the organic bases and their congeners, cannot now long remain
unanswered.
    5. “ On the Dentate Body of the Cerebellum.”                    By William
Brinton, M.D.        Communicated by R. B. Todd, M.D., F.R.S. &c.
Received May 23, 1852.
    The corpus dentatum has generally been described and recognised
as a wavy line or lamina of grey matter, which is seen in certain
sections of the crus of the cerebellum, and contains <U+FB01>bres apparently
derived from the restiform body, and the processus e cerebello ad
testes.    Reil's account, with some vague and con<U+FB02>icting details, gives
it a more de<U+FB01>nitely tubular form, although he is apparently not cer
 tain of the continuity of its upper and lower layers posteriorly.
    The author explains these somewhat varying descriptions by the
 physical characters of the tissues investigated, and by the condition
 -—fresh or hardened in spirit—of the specimens examined by differ
 ent anatomists.
     He deduces the form and situation of the recent corpus dentatum
 by uniting numerous and successive sections made in the three direc
 tions of space*.      Its arrangement with respect to the <U+FB01>bres of the
 cerebellum, cerebrum, medulla oblongata, and medulla spinalis, is
 chie<U+FB02>y deduced from examinations of specimens hardened in al
 cohol.
     By these two methods he is led to the following conclusions, that
 each corpus dentatum forms a tubular investment to the extremity
 of the processus e cerebello ad testem ; it is open towards the fourth
 ventricle, and is connected with the opposite body by a commissure
 of grey matter in its median line. While its interior exclusively
 receives the <U+FB01>bres of this cerebro-cerebellar           peduncle, its exterior
 radiates <U+FB01>bres to the various lobes of the cerebellum, which <U+FB01>bres,
 at the bottom of each lobe-stem, become inseparably mixed with a
 bundle from the restiform body, and with another from the pons
 varolii.                                                                       g
     Its comparative anatomy in mammalia corresponds with this view;
 its minute anatomy does not contradict it. And while the physiolo
 gical import of this arrangement eludes all: conjecture, the author has
 little doubt that its anatomical structure and relations are best com
 prehended in the formula which he would thus assign to it, viz. that
 of being the cerebro-cerebeilar ganglion.

         “ Proof  of a  sensible di<U+FB01>'erence between the Mercurial and       Air
 Thermometers from 0° to 100° C.”                  By   J. J.  Waterston, Esq.
                 * Diagrams to this  effect  accompanied the paper.

                                    226
Communicated       by Colonel Sabine, R.A., Treas. V.P.R.S. &c.
Received June 17, 1852.
    This paper has reference to a former communication “ On 2. Ge
neral Law of Density in Saturated Vapours."         In the present paper
the author states that the formula: that embrace MM. Dulong and
Petit’s four standard mean values of the relative expansion of air,
mercury and glass, exhibit the temperature by the air-thermometer in
advance of the mercurial thermometer, between 0° and 100° C. The
amount of difference increases from 0° to 48°, and then diminishes
to 100°; the maximum value being O°'513.              The most eminent
modern authorities deny the existence of any such difference, or
appear tacitly to admit that it is too small to be observed.          For
this reason no correction was made on temperatures below 100° in
Chart N0. 2, where indeed it could hardly be perceptible.             Al
though of little practical importance, this difference, if it exists,
cannot safely be neglected in theoretical researches, inasmuch as
the value of a degree of the mercurial thermometer must in such
case be a variable quantity, differing in the ratio of 23 to 24 from
100° C. to 0°.
    Having at last obtained satisfactory proof of the existence and
amount of the correction between 0° and 100°, he has thought it of
 suf<U+FB01>cient importance to give a detailed account of the method em
ployed to extract the required evidence from M. Regnault's obser-.
 vations on the tension of low pressure steam.
     As the law of density, illustrated in Chart No. 2, has clearly refer
 ence to the air-thermometer, if a series of observations were perfectly
 correct, they must perfectly exhibit this difference—if it really exists
 -when projected on the chart; because the divergence from the
 line that joins the points at 0° and 100° must exactly correspond
 with the correction required at the intermediate temperatures.         In
 short, the line of density would appear as a curve slightly concave
 towards the axis. and if the proper correction were made on the
 temperatures, that curve would be converted into a straight line.
 This view is illustrated by a sketch, in which the curvature is pur
 posely much exaggerated.        In this a straight line is drawn, as the
 gradient of density, and in which the points range if the tempe
 ratures are by the air-thermometer.         This line is inclined to the
 axis x of temperature, at an angle of which ll is the cotangent (see
 ‘Proceedings,’ vol. vi. p. 98). At points in it corresponding to
 temperatures 50°, 60°, 70°, &c., straight lines are drawn parallel to
 the axis x; and at‘ distances in these equal to the respective com
 puted differences, straight lines are drawn at right angles to the
 axis x, and meeting the lines of constant pressure drawn through
 thecorresponding points of the straight line which represents the
 gradient of density.    The curved line passing through the points of
 intersection, is that in which the points of density range if laid off
  to the temperatures by the mercurial thermometer.
     The author then states that the <U+FB01>rst attempt was made by 0b
  taining the value of the constants g and h (‘ Proceedings,’ vol. vi.
  p. 98) from the observation at 50° and 100°; then computing the

       It is remarked that the differences in the <U+FB01>rst table show a distinct

         The differences in this table are progressively increasing, and their
     relation to each other is very nearly that of the corresponding dif
     ferences of the inclination of the chords.                   They are represented by
     these inclinations        in a  <U+FB01>gure,     and,   in  order   to render the divergence
     from a straight         line   more     manifest,     the  scale   taken is 10° angular
     measure       to  the   unit   of   difference,     the  length     of the chords corre

       spending with the intervals of temperature below 100°.                        Joining
       the extremities of the chords, a magni<U+FB01>ed view is obtained of the
       curve determined from observations with temperatures uncorrected.
       On this the author remarks, that if the temperatures required no
       correction, the points so determined would lie in a straight line,
       always taking for granted the integrity of the law of density and the
       perfect accuracy of the observations.
           The next step was to perform the same computation with tem

           The difference between I: at 50° in the two tables being 1733, a
       straight line is drawn from the point corresponding to 100°, making
       an angle of 17°33, with the chord for 50° in the uncorrected tem
       peratures; and lines are drawn from the same point making angles
        1°38, 1°15, 0°68, &c. with this line. the intersections of which
       with the distances or chords corresponding to the temperatures,
       give the points which represent on the same magni<U+FB01>ed scale, the
       observations with the temperatures corrected.                   The author remarks
       that the line joining these points represents the empirical law of
       density, and that its relation to the standard right line for the tem
       perature 50° is precisely what might be expected to subsist between
       the empirical and true curve of tension.                It intersects that line—and
       intersection, not contact, is the character of empirical formula—at
        50°, 75°, and 100°, and at intermediate temperatures diverges from
        it to the extent of about <U+FB01>th of a degree at the maximum.
           Thus, he states, M. ltegnault’s observations between 50° and 100°
        afford a distinct answer to the inquiry in the affirmative, and it seems
        no longer possible to doubt that there is a ditference between the
        mercurial and air-thermometers below 100°; and that its amount
        does not sensibly differ from the formulae that embrace MM. Dulong
        and Petit’s standard observations.               He annexes these formulae in a
        combined form adapted to the Centigrade scale.

 loids are very expensive materials, and the principal object of the
 grant was to meet this expense.           The last grants 1 have'to-notice
 are to Professor Stokes, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cam‘
 bridge, for experiments to determine the index of Friction in di<U+FB02>'erent
 gases; and to Professor Ho kins, of Cambridge, for'investigations
 on the effect of pressure on t e temperature of fusion ‘of certain sub
 stances; both inquiries are attended with great dif<U+FB01>culties, but the‘
 results cannot fail to be of the highest interest.      In *each case appsA
 ratus of an expensive character was required, which'has recently:
 been completed ; and some progress has been made in the prelimi
 nary experiments, but a short time will necessarily elapse before the
 results shall have been ascertained with'su<U+FB02>icie'nt certainty to <U+FB01>t

  -" I have thus
                 given a very slight sketch of the various'inqairies which
 have been completed, or are in progress, aided by the Gmernment
 Grant. In all cases the notice has been as brief as possible; still I trust
 enough has been said to show that the efforts made by your Council
 to employ to the best advantage the means at their disposal, have
                               ’    '   ‘      ‘
 not been unsuccessful.                                         '
     The prospects of science are brightening in all directions: the
 many recent applications of science to utilitarian'purposes have satis
 <U+FB01>ed the masses, that scienceis not a mere unpro<U+FB01>table abstracticint
 the progress of knowledge dispelling error, seems to have dissipated
 the delusion that in science there might possibly'be s'otnethingvun
 genial"to        institutions and to stable government.          The feeling
 seems rapidly to be gaining ground, that our place, as 'a nation, will
 depend in no' small degree upon 'our success in seizing upon the
 truths of science, and applying them; that in fact it is true that
                           '
knowledge is power.           It is therefore not improbable that unusual
efforts will be made to give an impulse to scienti<U+FB01>c research of every
kind, and that this society, taking the place it 'has ever held, at the
head of English science, will be called upon for renewed efforts,
For that place your Society is more than ever <U+FB01>tted, as the fellow
ship stands much higher than it ever did before. i The merits of the
candidates for fellowship are tested with severity, but with strict
justice, and consequently'the felloWship is a real warrant of merit‘
 I need perhaps hardly add, that at everj7 election we see our ranks
recruited by men who hold the <U+FB01>rst place of eminence in theoretical
and practical science.

    Mr.-Clark.commen'ced his career <U+FB01>rst in Bristol and aftenwards
 with Messrs. Darby and-Co. at their-celebrated iron-works at Cole

 principles of Cast-iron Engineering, and which were afterwards more
 matured when he entered the service of the late Mr. Rennie in 1808,
 where he remained until 1811, when he was appointed Engineer to
 the Water-Works Company at Hammersmith,             in whose service he
 remained until the ‘day of his death on September 22, after a long
 and painful illness.   Of his works it may be said that they combined

    JOHN Gsonon CHILDREN, Esq. was born on the 18th of May, 17 77,
 at  Ferox Hall, Tunbridgc.     His father was the possessor of large
landed property near Tunbridge, and was a Bencher of the Middle
Temple, but never practised at the bar.       Mr. Children’s mother died
a few days after his birth.     His father did not marry again, but de
voted himself to- the care of his son, who receivad the rudiments of
 his education at the Grammar School at Tunbridge, and subsequently
 at Eton, on quitting which, he was entered a fellow-commoner of
 Queen’s College, Cambridge, in 17 94.        His views were at this time
 directed to the church as his profession, but having had the‘mis
fortune to lose his wife, a granddaughter of Governor Holwell whom
 he had married as soon as he was of age, he accompanied some in
 timate friends to Lisbon, and after arcsidence there ofv some months,
 he returned to England, and in March 1802 sailed for North America,
 where a cousin to whom he was much attached had established
 himself.    They travelled together through not only the more settled
 towns, but among large tracts of the then uncleared backwoods,
‘both of the States and Canada.        The change of scene had a bene
 <U+FB01>cial effect on Mr. Children’s spirits, but had nearly cost him his life.
 He was attacked by a terrible fever, and it required the most judi
 cious treatment of his medical friends to save him.        As soon as he
 was suf<U+FB01>ciently recovered he returned to England, entirely restored
 to health by the voyage.     He found his native county, Kent, busy in
organising national defences, at that time the great object of
attentionjand he entered the West Kent Militia as one of its cap
 tains ; which post he retained until 1805, when severe illness obliged
                              ‘
 him to resign.
    From this period histime was principally devoted to science, to
 which he had been from his early youth greatly attached.            Mine
 ralogy, chemistry, and galvanism, became his favourite studies, and
 he soon made the acquaintance          of the leading men of science.
 From their society he derived the highest grati<U+FB01>cation, and he lived
 much among them.         Sir Humphry, then Mr. Davy, Mr. Hatchett,
 Dr. Wollaston, and many more great names of that day were among
 his intimate friends, and his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society
 in 1807, was at once the result and the cause of increasing attach
 ment to his scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits.      He had an excellent laboratory at
 Tunbridge, where he constructed a galvanic battery, with a small
series of very large plates, of which he gave an account to the Royal
 Paocsnnmos OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.             Von. VI. No. 92.         I7

                                       246
 Society in November 1808; and subsequently heconstructed another
 with much larger plates, the performance of which is fully detailed
 in a second paper read to the Society in June 1815.' Both these
 papers are printed in the Philosophical Transactions. \
      Between the date of these papers he made along journey in Spain,
  and visited the quicksilver mines of Almaden, with which English
  men were at that time very imperfectly acquainted.          On his return
  to England in 1809 he married the eldest daughter .of George
.Furlong \Vise, Esq, of \Voolston in Devonshire, but; he again expe
  rienced the heaviest of all domestic calamities by losing her within
  eight months of their marriage.        After her death in 1810, he con
  tinued to reside chie<U+FB02>y with his father at T unbridge until the year
   1816, when, in consequence of the failure of the 'l'unbridge Bank,
  in which his father was a partner, his prospects in life were wholly
  altered. and he found it necessary to seek some remunerative employ
  ment that might enable him to contribute to the comfort of his
  revered and now aged parent.         He succeeded, through the kindness
  of'the late Marquis of Camden, in obtaining the situation of one of
 the librarians of theBritish Museum, in the department ofAntiquitiea.
   He still retained his love for chemistry, and a little before his
appointment to. the Museum, he had warmly espoused the cause of
 his friend Sir H. Davy, in a controversy respecting the safety lamp;
   arpaper relating to which will be found in the Philosophical lVIaga
   zine for 1816.
     . After his father’s    death Mr. Children married the widow of the
   Rev. Johnson Towers, and removed from Chelsea to the British
   Museum, in which establishment he had an of<U+FB01>cial residence.           It is
 ,worthy of mention, that after he had been for some years an o<U+FB01>eer
   of the Museum, his post was changed without his own solicitation
   from. the Department of Antiquities to that of Natural History.
       In 182-6 Mr. Children Was elected Secretary o<U+FB01> the Royal Society
   in the place of Mr. Brande.      He resigned mill-327, but was re-elected
 in 1-830, and remained in of<U+FB01>ce until 183 7, when his delicate health
   obliged. him to relinquish it.    This honourable position was rendered
   particularly agreeable to-him by the regard and kindness of his col:
   leagues, and of the Presidents under whom he acted ; andhis zeal for
   the interests of the Society is commemorated by the unanimous
   thanks of the Society having been given to him in 1835, for “ the
   zeal and ability which be uniformly displayed, and the many valu
   able services he rendered in promoting the objects of'the Society.”
       On his retirement from o<U+FB01>ice in Nov. 1837, the President, then
   the Duke of Sussex, in his Anniversary Address, alluded in a very
   marked and complimentary         manner to Mr. Children’s services “as
   Secretary, and lamented that the Society would no longer have the

  Major.                                                    -
     In 1824 'Major Colby commenced the great work of his life, the
  Ordnance Survey of Ireland. In that year a Committee of the House
  of Commons reported on the necessity of a General Survey of Ireland,
  and recommended thatit should be undertaken by the Ordnance.
  The Duke of Wellington was Master-General, and having assumed
 the responsibility of such a task, he con<U+FB01>ded its execution to Major
  Colby, who had then for some years conducted the Survey of Great
 Britain.    The survey required for Ireland was very different in its
 nature and objects from that of Great Britain: it was expected to be
 laid downand published on a scale of 6 inches to a mile, and was
 designed to form the basis of a land valuation, and of a revised
 system of local taxation.     For a work of such minute detail and
 such close precision, as these objects rendered necessary, Major Colby
 was obliged to create the means of execution and to devise a. plan of
 operations which should enable him to employ numbers as well as I
                                                          ’
 skill.   Taking for his model the celebrated
                                                 ‘
                                                   Down Survey of Sir
 \Villiam Petty (subsequently so well described by Major Larcom,
 RE), and applying the wholeenergiesof his mind to the subject,he de
 vised that beautiful system of disciplined and co-operative labour
 which enabled him to apply to the work all the resources of science,
 and yet to employ upon it both private soldiers and peasants.     The
 Royal Sappers and Miners supplied the highly-trained soldiers who
 formed a nucleus for the work, and the quick and ' intelligent
peasantry of Ireland produced numbers of candidates suf<U+FB01>ciently in
 structed to serve as materials for its perfect construction.  To those
 who saw the work in its infancy, when everything had to be created,
 and remained to witness it as a vast and beautiful machine, combi
ning into harmonious action the labours of about forty observers and
many hundreds of surveyors and draughtsmeu, and producing annu
ally a perfected survey of several millions of acres, the success of
 General Colby must appear most complete and most wonderful.
    To secure the undisturbed and uniform movement of so compli
cated a machine, it was necessary to form an equally perfect o<U+FB02>ice
establishment, and this was done in the Survey Of<U+FB01>ce at Mountjoy,
in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, the arrangements of which (including
those of the Engraving Establishment) were carried by Colonel
Colby to the utmost perfection, under the personal superintendence
of Captain (now Major) Larcom; and the <U+FB01>nal excellenceof that
establishment    may be now studied in that of the Map O<U+FB01>ice at
Southampton, which is, in fact, no more than its re<U+FB02>ected image.

                                  249
  ‘
    Having thus grasped in his mind the requirements of the survey in
its mere practical character, Major Colby felt, as a man of science,
that so great a national work ought not to fall short of the excellence
of Continental works in any'of its operations, and that some scien
tific advance should be made in the mode of measuring its <U+FB01>rst base
line. With the beautiful differential rods of the French philosophers
he was not perfectly satis<U+FB01>ed, nor would he adopt the mode, proposed
by the late Captain Drummond, of measuring with broad bands, or
ribands formed of mica; but feeling a preference for the principle of
compensation, 'he gave it a 'new application, by inventing those ad
mirable compensation‘bars, which stamped on the Irish Stirvey a
character of novelty, and inscparably connected the name of their
author with the history of geodetic science. It is not to be supposed
that so great a work could have been carried on successfully without
the cooperation of many most able and zealous'o<U+FB01>icers; but when it
is considered that their efforts were all directed and regulated on the
system planned by General Colby, it must be felt that the Irish Sure
vey, in its beginning and in its end, was eminently his own work.
    Were this narrative now to end, it would fail to do full justice to the
comprehensive mind of General Colby.          When asked by Sir Henry
Hardinge, then Clerk of' the Ordnance, to state the advantages of a
survey, he did not content himself by describing'its ordinary useful
ness, but nobly represented it as the proper basis for geological,'stae
tistical and antiquarian surveys. .' These views were acted upon at
the commencement of the Survey, and to General Colby must there;
fore be ascribed the merit of having <U+FB01>rst originated a national
 Geological Survey, and, connected with it, a museum of Economic
 Geology. He did indeed more, as his scheme comprised natural
history and antiquities; and the museum at Mountjoy contained not
 only a most valuable collection of minerals and fossils, but also an
 equally important one of the plants and animals of Ireland.           It is
 true, that subsequently General Colby shrank from that responsibility
 which at <U+FB01>rst had seemed so light to him; that the Ordnance
 abandoned these collateral works ; and that the Geological Surrey
 passed into the hands of the Woods and Forests, there to acquire a
 full development under the able guidance of Sir Henry De la Beche‘;
 but let us recognize in the Memoir of Londonderry, published in
 lSS5,—in the Report of the Geology of Londonderry and'Tyrone,
by Captain now Lieut.-Col. Portlock, R.E., published in 1843,-and
in the Statistical Papers of the Census Commission drawn up by
Major Larcom, and founded on the Statistical Section of the Memoir
of Londonderry, to which that of<U+FB01>cer had so largely contributed,
proofs that the scheme proposed by General Colby in 1824, would,
if it had been followed up, have led to the publication of a national
work, which, both in the grandeur of its conception and the import
ance of its results, would have been unrivalled

    In 1825 Major Colby became Lieutenant-Colonel; in 1837
Colonel ; and in 1846 h'lajor-General. It is greatly to be regretted
that his attainment of the last-named rank should have required that

his connexion    with the great work he had so long and so ably

associated, should cease.                                         '~

although restricted to a provincial sphere, obtained a high reputation,

operating surgeons in this country. The subject of our memoir
entered the medical profession as pupil at the, Norwich and Norfolk
Hospital under his father, who was Surgeon to that Institution.        He
subsequently removed to the Borough Hospital, the schools of which
were atlthat time united; and after completing his studies there, he
became a member of the College of Surgeons in 1827, after which
he commenced practice in the city.        Mr. Dalrymple paid especial
attention to the practice of Ophthalmic Surgery, and in the year
3832 was elected Assistant-Surgeon to the Royal Ophthalpje
Hospital, where he contributed greatly, by his talent and high pro
fessional character, to raise that excellent charity to its present high
standing in public estimation.     During the period of his. residence in
the city he struggled against the disadvantage of almost continual
ill health, to lay the foundation of    a  profound knowledge of the
anatomy and diseases of that organ to which he had determined to
devote his principal attention, and hence, on his removal to the west
end of the town in 1839, he‘was well prepared for that great, pro

in January 1846, the Magnetic Survey of the Eastern Archipelago.
His observations were taken at sixteen di<U+FB01>'erent stations :--four in
the islands adjacent to Singapore; one in Borneo; one in Java;
two in Sumatra; one in the island of Mindanao; one in Celebes;
one at the Cocos or Keeling Islands; one at Penang, and one in its
immediate vicinity; one at Nicobar in the Bay of Bengal; one at
Moulmein, and one at Madras.           His zeal and energy will he appre
ciated, when we re<U+FB02>ect that these <U+FB01>xed stations were spread over
 the immense area of 28° of latitude and 45° of longitude, and were
 carried on, under great I<U+FB01>ivations, at great personal risk, and some
 times in places where no European had ever set foot before.           In
 Borneo his <U+FB01>xed station was at Sarawak, near the house of his
 friend Rajah Brooke.       Having completed his Survey at Madras in
 October 1849, he applied for furlough, and arrived in England at
 Christmas 1849, for the sole purpose of publishing his Observations
 —'1 work of great labour, which occupied him incessantly for nearly
 two years; they were printed in the Philosophical Transactions for
 1851.      Last December he returned to India in. the hope of being
 able to carry through the magni<U+FB01>cent undertaking of the Magnetic
 Survey of the whole Peninsula. In May last he left Madras,
 intending to go round by the coast through Masulipatam to Hy
 drabad.      On his journey he was tempted to visit some extensive
 works carried on by the Government at Rajarnundy, near the Goda
 very river, where he was seized with fever, and expired at Masuli
 patam, after a few days’ illness, on the 4th of August last, at the
 early age of thirty-seven.                     -                        ,
     He was universally admired for the manliness of his character and
 beloved for his amiable social qualities.                        _
      He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1850: the
  entire disinterestedness,    self-sacri<U+FB01>cing exposure in climates and
  seasons most unfriendly to life, and the well-directed ardour and
  remarkable ability (giving yet higher promise for the future had his
  life been prolonged) which marked his short but highly active scien
  ti<U+FB01>c career, claim for his memory an honourable place in our records,
  and combined with the frankness, loyalty and sweetness of his cha
   racter and temper, have endeared it in a peculiar manner to those
  amongst us who had most opportunity of appreciating him.
      GIDEON ALGERNON MANTELL, LL.D., F.G.S. and F.L.S., was
  born at Lewes in 17 90.       His father was a shoemaker in the enjoy
   ment, according to the statement of Mr. Thomas Mantell of Lewes,
   a brother of the subject of this memoir, of a large business, having
   as many as twenty-three     men in his employ at one time.    Dr. Man;
   tell received his <U+FB01>rst instruction at a dame-school at Lewes, from
  which he was transferred to Mr. Button’s establishment, also at
   Lewes, and subsequently was sent to a school in Wiltshire, con
  ducted by a clergyman.
      His father then articled   him to  Mr. James Moore, a surgeon and
   apothecary,   paying  a premium     of two hundred guineas;      Young

                                   253
Mantell was fortunate in gaining the esteem of his master, who,
after his pupil had ‘ walked the hospitals,? and what was then a no
velty in country practice, become a licentiate of Apothecaries’ Hall,
admitted him into partnership, and he forthwith commenced prac
tice, in which he was eminently successful.      He made midwifery an
 especial study, and contributed several papers on that branch of me
 dical science, and on the use of ergot of rye, to the ‘ Lancet,’ and also
 other articles-on various branches of medicine.                          '
    It is recorded greatly to his honour, and as a proof of his early
attention to science, that with the assistance of his brother, the late
Joshua Mantell, who was a surgeon at Newick, the life of. a woman
condemned to death.»er the murder of her husband by arsenic was
saved, Dr. Mantell having distinctly proved that the tests used, and
which were said to show the presence of this mineral poison, had
entirely and chemically failed.    This led to his publication, in 1827,“
of his .‘Observations on the Medical Evidence necessary to prove the
presence of Arsenic in the Human Body, in cases of' supposed poison.
ing by that mineral.’                         ,
    It was while Dr. Mantell was at Mr. Button’s school that he <U+FB01>rst
evinced a strong disposition for the study of natural history, and
upon commencing practice at Lewes, he devoted as many hours as'
he could from his very arduous professional labours to the investiga.
tion of organic remains, <U+FB01>rst in the Chalk and next in the Tilgate
formations, which were at that period comparatively new ground.
    He was greatly encouraged in these researches by the late Mr.
 Davies Gilbert, and hewas largely assisted by the Zeal and know
ledge of Mr. Stewart Warren Lee, who was his intimate friend and
companion in all his early discoveries.
    For nine years he deVOted himself to the prosecution of his re
searches into the chalk formation, and in laying the foundation of
 the collection now in the British Museum.         In May 1822 he pub
lished by subscription the result of his labours in a quarto volume,
entitled ‘The Fossils of the South Downs, or Illustrations of the
Geology of Sussex.’      The work was dedicated to Mr. Davies Gilbert.
    In 1825 he communicated his <U+FB01>rst paper to the Royal Society,
 entitled ‘ Notice on ‘the Iguanadon, a newly-discovered fossil reptile
from the Sandstone of Tilgate Forest in Sussex.’          This paper was
printed in the Philosophical Transactions, and, at the recommené
dation of Mr. Davies Gilbert, its author was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society the year of its publication.
    We now <U+FB01>nd him eagerly pursuing his favourite study of Geology.
In 1826 he published his ‘Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex,’
with <U+FB01>gures and descriptions of the fossils of Tilgate Forest, which
include several discoveries that will always be associated with his
name.      He also contributed the Natural History of the district to
Horsfield's ‘ History of Lewes,’ and several articles on geology to
different periodicals.
    All this time he spared neither trouble nor money in collecting
 geological specimens for his museum, which soon became so famous,
 that parties from Brighton were in the habit of going to see it. u]

and as one who in the infancy of geological science placed before
the world. the means by which others could write a thesis or found
a system. that Dr. Mantell's merits were best displayed, and will be
honestly acknowledged.
 -- At the instigation of the Earl of Egremont, who was a warm friend
of Dr. Mantell's, and evinced his admiration of his scienti<U+FB01>c labours
by contributing the sum of £4000 to aid in the formation of his

removed to Brighton.          This change was effected in 1836, but'from

    His professional practice was not increased by these removals, and
Wes additionally injured by his great devotion. to science and archae

    GEORGE RICHARDSON Pon'raa, Esq. was born onythe 29th of June,
 1790; he was brought 'up for mercantile pursuits, and commenced
life as a wine-merchant in London. Being, however, unsuccessful in
business, he turned his attention to literature, for which he was
well quali<U+FB01>ed by his previous studies and pursuits; as it was his
habit from earliest youth to compose (though not publish) papers on
any subject which interested him. His <U+FB01>rst published work was the
‘
  History of the Sugar-Cane’ (in 1830).       This book, together with
other circumstances, led to an introduction to Mr. Charles Knight,
who immediately gave him literary occupation, and the acquaintance
turned out to be highly advantageous to the author.
    Mr. Porter wrote several papers for the Companion to the Almanac,
810., and was for some years a constant and valuable contributor to
the Penny Cyclopaedia.      But Mr. Knight’s just appreciation of his
abilities produced to him much greater and more lasting advantages
than casual employment for his pen. Mr. Knight having been asked
by the late Lord'Auckland, when his Lordship was President of the
Board of Trade, to undertake the task-of arranging and digesting for
the Board the mass of information contained in O<U+FB01>icial Books and
Parliamentary Returns, Mr. Knight felt that he could not enter
upon the work without injuring his publishing business, and he
declined it, but he at the same time strongly-recommended Mr.
Porter to Lord Auckland as a person highly qualified for the unders
taking.
    This was in the year 1832, at which period the department of
statistics at the Board of Trade was <U+FB01>rst organized as an experiment;
but at the end of two years the utility of the department was so
evident that it was de<U+FB01>nitely established, and Mr. Porter was placed
at its head as Superintendent.      It was here that he had access to
those stores of information which his peculiarly statistical turn of
mind enabled him to calculate and arrange with so bene<U+FB01>cial an
effect for public use, and few o<U+FB02>icial volumes have tended more to
introduce important commercial reforms than that which emanated
yearly from the Statistical Department of the Board of Trade under
the laborious and careful editorship of Mr. Porter.
    In 1840 he was appointed senior member of the Railway Depart
ment of the Board of Trade.        In the transaction of the arduous
duties of that department, which, in 1845, when railway speculation
was at its height, increased to an overwhelming extent, Mr. Porter’s

                                  257
services were as valuable as they were energetic, and were thoroughly
appreciated by Lord Dalhousie, who then so ef<U+FB01>ciently presided over
the department.     On the retirement of Mr. M°Gregor in 1847,, Mr.
Porter  was   appointed  one of the Joint Secretaries to the Boardiof
Trade. This promotion added greatly to Mr. Porter’slabours. ; .5..

Would have alarmed many men, that he found time, without in. any.

whichrhas passed through several editions,.and which will be of in
ealculahlc value to future political economists.      The amount of in;
formation in this very remarkable work, and the manner in which it
is presented to'the reader, entitles Mr. Porter to take-the. highest

    His contributions to the Statistical Section of the British Asso

valuable, and he made frequent communications        to the Statistical
Society, which are printed in the Society’s Journal.            7

    Mr. Porter’s integrity, his elegant and  varied   accomplishments,
and his amiable disposition, rendered him   a cherished ornament of   a
large social circle, and he was always ready and willing to do all in
his power to assist in any humane undertaking. »,
   VA remarkable instance of this disposition was communicated by
Mr. Porter to the writer of this memoir, and which, as being con
nected with Sir Joseph Banks, when President of the Royal Society,

    In consequence of the seizure by England of the Danish Fleetjh
the early part of this century, Iceland was afflicted-by grievous-fa
mine, so that almost the only resource of the inhabitants for obtain.
ing food was the sea-Weed.left by the receding tides.      Under these
circumstances a merchant from Copenhagen arrived in England with
introductions to the mercantile house with which Mr. Porter was
connected;     His object was to obtain from the British Government
licenses for the protection of Danish ships which should be employed
in conveying provisions to Iceland but his applications to the Board
                                   ;
of Trade were, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, quite unsuccessful.    As soon as
Mr. Porter-became aware of these facts, he remembered that Sir
JosephvBanks, Who had visited Iceland in 1772, was an Honorary

Society, and is printed in the Philosophical Transactions of that year.
This was followed on June 4, 1829, by another paper, “On the
geometrical representation of the powers of quantities, whose indices
involve the square roots of negative quantities." Having previously
con<U+FB01>ned his attention to representing geometrically quantities of the
 form a+bt/ —1, in the last memoir he succeeded in representing
geometrically quantities of that form affected with-an index of the
same form (n+6 t/jm-t-n V—l ), and at the close of it stated that
 “ it will be manifest from what has been demonstrated, that all alge
braic quantity may be geometrically represented, both in length and
 direction, by lines drawn in a given plane from a given point." This
 extension of the subject Mourey had hinted at, but had not then
 published.
     Mr. Warren’s mathematical productions are limited to those above
 mentioned, with the exception of a short communication to the Cam
 bridge Philosophical Society on a correction of Mourey’s proof that
 every equation has as many reots as it has dimensions, which may
 be regarded as an instance of the scrupulousness with which he was
  accustomed to seek for exactness in mathematical demonstration.
  In the latter part of his life, when his time was chie<U+FB02>y taken up with
  ecclesiastical duties, he did not wholly lay aside mathematics, but
  with friends would converse largely on favourite topics, showing re
  markable power in carrying on a mathematical demonstration vied
  voce.   He continued to entertain a high estimate of the capabilities
  of the geometrical representation of impossible quantities, which he
  made some attempts to extend to space of three dimensions, and he
  even contemplated the possibility of applying it to the solution of
  the problem of three bodies.       On these questions, however, he has
  left nothing in writing.
     Mr. Warren was Chancellor of the Diocese of Bangor, and was the
  rector of Graveley in Cambridgeshire, and Caldecott in Huntingdon
  shire.   He was also owner of the adt‘owson of Caldecott, which, as
  Well as an adjoining parish, was without a resident clergyman.         In
  order to remedy this evil, he was desirous that the union of the two
  parishes might be effected.       With this view he sold the advowson
  of-Caldecott to the patron of the other parish, and gave up the pur
  chase-money for the purpose of building a parsonage-house         for the
  united parishes.     It is not intended in this sketch to enter into de
  tails with respect to Mr. Warren’s private history, but the above in
  cident in his life is deemed worthy of record as being characteristic
 of the man.     He was a clergyman of unaffected piety, simple habits

    1. "-An Experimental Inquiry undertaken with the view of ascer
 taining whether any signs of Current Electricity are manifested in
 Plants during vegetation.“ By H. F. Baxter, Esq. Communicated
 by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. RS. 8w.        Received August 9, 1852.
    In the present communication the author has related the experi
 mental results that he has arrived at, and which tend to show that
 electric currents exist in the leaves and in the roots or spongioles of
 plants.   Becquerel and Wartmann have already proved that electric
 currents may be obtained in different parts of vegetables, but the
 object of the paper is to point out the connection of the currents in
 the above-named organs with the vital or organic changes which
                                                                        '
 take place in them.                                               -.
    In consequence of the secondary actions which occur at the elec
 trodes some di<U+FB02>iculty is experienced in ascertaining the true or
 normal result in the roots.    Combining however the facts obtained
 by means of the galvanometer with analogical evidence, the author
 considers that they tend to establish the conclusion, that, during the
 changes which occur in the leaves and in the roots of plants, current
electricity is manifested.
    2.  “ On the relation of Cardioids to Ellipses."          By Joseph
Jopling, Esq. Communicated by S. H. Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
Received Oct. 29, 1852.
    The object of this communication is to point out the relation of
cardioids to ellipses, and that the former as well as the latter are
related to and deducible from the cone.
    The author remarks that the motions of the common trammel show
most beautifully the mechanical relation of ellipses and cardioids, and
that they are thus reciprocals of each other; that an ellipse, as is
well known, is a plane section, or a projection of a plane section of a
cone upon any other plane, the limits being the circle and the right
line ; and a cardioid is also a. projection from a cone ; the difference
being that the cardioid is obtained from a curved. section, formed by
the intersection of a sphere or other curved solid with a cane.
    After referring to properties of the sections of cones by spheres,
depending on the magnitude of the vertical angles of the cone, the
author states that these and many other new curves, their relations,
                                                       \

                                                           268
 and new properties of the cone and the sphere are made most clearly
manifest, and numerous practical results are very readily obtained by
the application of a double scale of sines to the rays of the cone—
distributed equally on the plan—correspondingly on the elevation, and
on the developed surface, or on any other projection of the cone.
   He considers that it is of great importance that ;ome method
should be devised to give appropriate names to these new curves,
especially those so evidently and intimately related to old ones.
Thus the curved intersection of a cone and a sphere, from which the
cardioid is projected on the base, and which has then the cusp turned
symmetrically inwards, by another projection on a vertical plane
gives a symmetrical     line with the cusp turned outwards, having
other distinct points of change in the curvature.
   As ellipses are related to cardioids, so it is stated are hyperbolas
in a similar way related to conchoids; conchoids to their mechani
cal reciprocals; and parabolas to cissoids; amongst the vast number
of curves, any of which can conveniently be derived by scales prac
tically from the cone.
   By this method it is considered that not only projections of curved
sections of cones, spheres, &c. are obtained with ease, but also by
means of scales, ruled papers, hollow cones and diagrams, the plane
sections of cones, and all projections from them are greatly facilitated.
   In conclusion the author remarks, that if this subject can be en
tertained by the Royal Society, he will make copies of a series of
diagrams to illustrate what he has here stated in reference to scales

   A paper was read, entitled “ On the Solution of Urinary Calculi
in dilute Saline Fluids,- at the temperature of the body, by the aid of
Electricity.”   By H. Bence Jones, M.D., F.R.S., Physician to St.
George’s Hospital.       Received Oct. 12, 1852.
   In 1848 the author <U+FB01>rst attempted to dissolve'calcali in a solution
of nitrate of potash, by placing them at the same time between the
electrodes of a galvanic battery; an effect was produced on the uric
acid at the negative pole, but no very decided result was obtained.
The experiments were resumed during the last summer.
  -The results with uric acid calculi may be thus arranged.        The
action was chie<U+FB02>y at the negative electrode.

       From these experiments the following conclusions are drawn :—
    From two to nine grains of uric acid calculus can be dissolved in an
    hour in a neutral dilute solution of nitre at the temperature of the
    body, whilst in the same time from two to twenty-<U+FB01>ve grains of
    phosphatic calculus can be dissolved.         However, only from half                                                                              a
    grain to two grains of oxalate     of lime  can be removed by the same
    means in the same time.     Still,     the stone consists of oxalate with  if
    urate, from one to two grains may be dissolved in an hour         and                                                           ;

    half grains can be taken away in that time.
       These results may be obtained with calculi which have been long
    removed from the bladder, and have been dried at 212°.
      MM. Prevost and Dumas in 1823 proposed to treat calculi by the
    galvanic pile. By means of the mechanical action of the mixed gases
    evolved by decomposing water, they found that phosphatic calculi
    might be disintegrated.   The chemical action of the substances
    evolved by galvanic action on the surface of calculi was not deter

     A paper was read, entitled “ On Molecular In<U+FB02>uences.        Sect. 1.
 Transmission of Heat through Organic Structures.”             By John
 Tyndall, F.R.S.      Received Oct. 20, 1852.
     In this paper the author has examined the in<U+FB02>uence exerted by
 the molecular structure of wood upon the passage of heat through
 the substance.     Finding the usual modes of determining the con
 ductivity of bodies inadequate to his purpose, he has been led to
 the construction of a new instrument which is capable of indicating
 very slight differences of transmissive power.
     A cubical space is cut out of the centre of arectangular slab of
 mahogany.      The same slab holds a thermo-electric pair. of bismuth
 and antimony, which are <U+FB01>xed in trenches cut out to receive them.
 The junction of the-pair (which is of a V-shape) abuts upon one of
 the faces of the cubical space just mentioned; the end of a wooden
 slider forms the opposite boundary of the cubical space, and against
 this end a platinum wire, bent several times up and down so as to
 form a kind of micrometer-grating, is laid and imbedded in the
 wood. A small projection of ivory abuts at each side of the bismuth
 and antimony junction, and from one projection to the other a thin
 membrane is drawn, thus enclosing a space in front of the junction,
 which is <U+FB01>lled with mercury.       Two similar projections jut at the
 sides of the micrometer-grating,    and across from one projection to
 the other, a second membrane is stretched, thus enclosing another
 chamber in front of the wire. This chamber is' also <U+FB01>lled with mer
 cury, and against the wire a thin plate of mica is cemented, thus
 preventing all contact between the two metals.      From the free ends
 of the bismuth and antimony bars wires proceed to a delicate galva
nometer.
    The substances to be examined by this instrument are reduced to
 the cubical form and placed between the two membranes; the slider
 being brought closely up against the cube, the latter is clasped
 <U+FB01>rmly between the rigid projections before-named. The membranes
 are pressed gently against the two opposite faces of the cube by the
 mercury behind, and thus a contact is secured which, as the mer
 cury is not changed during an entire series of experiments, remains
 perfectly constant.    This is a most important point in experiments
 of this nature, for when the conditions of contact vary in even a
 slight degree, comparable results are out of the question.        This
remark of course applies exclusively to an inquiry like the present,
where the object is to detect minute di<U+FB01>'erences of molecular action.
The protrudingends of the micrometer-wire are united to the poles
of a small galvanic battery, and the wire is heated by the passage of
the current; the heat is transmitted through the <U+FB01>lm of mica to the
mass of mercury in front, which thus becomes the source of heat
immediately applied to the face of the cube.        The current is per
mitted to circulate through the bent wire for 60 seconds.       During
this time the heatvpasses from the face of the cube in contact with

                                     271
the source to the opposite face; the quantity transmitted          to the
opposite face at the end of a minute, will of course depend on the
conductivity of‘ the body in the giVen direction.        This quantity is
measured by its effect upon the galvanometer.
   The temperature of the source will, of course, depend upon the
amount of electricity transmitted through the bent wire, and to pre
serve this amount perfectly constaut from day to day, a tangent
galvanometer and rheostat are introduced into the voltaic circuit; a
current which produces the invariable de<U+FB02>ection of 35° is made use of
to heat the wire.         By this arrangement experiments which are
separated from each other by long intervals of time are rendered
                                                              '
strictly comparable.
   In the manner above indicated, the author has submitted <U+FB01>fty
four different kinds of wood, both English and foreign, to examina
tion. The cubes were taken so that four faces of each were parallel‘
to the <U+FB01>bre, and the remaining two consequently perpendicular to it.
Of the four parallel to the <U+FB01>bre, two opposite ones were parallel to
the ligneous layers, and the other two perpendicular to them.         The
amount of heat transmitted in 60 seconds across the mass of each
cube in these three directions, respectively, was determined in the
way described, and the following law of action established :—
   At all points except the centre of the tree, wood possesses three un-‘
equal axes of calori<U+FB01>c conduction which are at right angles to each
 other.   The first and greatest axis is parallel to the <U+FB01>bre; the second
axis is perpendicular to the <U+FB01>bre, and to the annual layers of the wood ,
while the third and least axis is perpendicular to the <U+FB01>bres and parallel
to the layers.     It is observed that these axes of calori<U+FB01>c conduction
coincide in order of magnitude and in direction with the axes of
elasticity discovered by Savart.
   The author furthermore points out the existence of two other
systems of axes in wood,—the axes of cohesion and the axes of <U+FB02>uid
permeability, both
                 '
                        of which coincide with the axes of calori<U+FB01>c con
duction.                   \
   Experiments have been made on the conductivity of various other
bodies, and the non-conducting powers of the substances which enter
into the composition of organic tissues is strikingly exhibited.    From
comparative experiments       with quartz and some  other substances,  the
author points out the in<U+FB02>uence which a mass of silica exposed to the
sun's rays, as in the African deserts, must exert upon climate.‘
   The paper concludes with experiments on some other organic
structures: Tooth of Walrus, Tooth of Elephant, Whalebone, Rhi
                                                                           '
noceros’s-horn, Cow's-horn ; and which show how small is their trans-
missive power: that of sealing-wax, bees’-wax, sole-leather, glue,
gutta-percha, India-rubber, <U+FB01>lbert-kernel, almond-kernel, boiled 11am
muscle, raw veal-muscle, appears to be unappreciable by the method
described.

    The Earl Granville was elected a Fellow of the Society.
    A paper was read, entitled “Description of some species of the
 extinct genus Nesodon."        By Professor Owen, F .R.S. Received
 Nov. 25, 1852.
    The author commences by referring to a genus of extinct herbi
vorous mammals which he had founded in 1836, on certain fossil
remains discovered in Patagonia, and which, from the insular dispo
 sition of the enamel folds characteristic of the molar teeth, he had
 called Nesodon. _ Subsequent transmissions of fossils from the same
 part of South America, by their discoverer, Capt. Sulivan, R.N., now
 enabled the author to de<U+FB01>ne four species of the genus.          The <U+FB01>rst
 which he describesis founded on a considerable portion of the era
 nium and the_lcwer jaw, with the teeth, and is called Nesodon
 ovinus.    After the requisite osteological details and comparisons the
 author proceeds to describe the three incisors, the canine, and <U+FB01>ve
 molar teeth, which are present on each side of both upper and lower
jaws, and then enters upon an inquiry as to the nature and homo
 logies of the grinding teeth.      The result is to show that the <U+FB01>rst
 four molars belong, with the incisors and canines, to the deciduous
 series, and that the <U+FB01>fth molar is the <U+FB01>rst true molar of the perma
 nent series; the germ of a second true molar was discovered behind
 this, in both the upper and the lower jaws, whence the author con
 cludes that the Nesodon ovinus had the typical number of teeth when
 the permanent
        =
                    series was fully developed, viz.  if:2

    The structure of the grinding teeth proving the extinct animal to
have been herbivorous, the number and kinds of teeth in the entire
 series show that it was ungulate. In this great natural series of mam
 malia the author next shows that the Nesodon had the nearest af<U+FB01>
nities to the odd-toed or perissodactyle order amongst the existing
 species; but certain modifications of structure, hitherto peculiar to
 the even-toed or Artiodactyle Ungulates, are repeated in the cranium
of the Nesodon: more important marks of af<U+FB01>nity are pointed out in
the Nesodon to the Toradon; and both these extinct forms of South
American herbivores are shown to agree with each other in characters
 of greater value, derived from the osseons and dental systems, than
any of those by which the Nesodon resembles either the Perissodac
tyle or Artiodactyle divisions of hoofed animals.
    The genus Nesodon is characterized by the following modi<U+FB01>cations
of the teeth, which in number and kind are according to the typical
dental formula above given.       Incisors trenchant, with long, slightly
curved crowns, of limited growth: canines small, not exceeding in
length ‘the contiguous premolars.        Molars, in the upper jaw, with
long, curved, transversely compressed crowns, which contract as they
penetrate the bone and ultimately develope fangs; the outer side of
the crown ridged, the inner side penetrated by two more or less

                                    273
 complex folds of enamel, leaving insular patches on the worn crown :
 enamel thin.      The lower molars, long, straight, and compressed;
 divided by an external longitudinal indent into two unequal lobes,
both penetrated at the inner side by a fold of enamel, which is com
plex in the hinder lobe.        All the teeth have exserted crowns of
 equal height and arranged in an unbroken series.        The bony palate
is entire and extends back beyond the molars, the maxillaries and
 palatines forming the back part in equal proportions.           A distinct
 articular cavity and eminence for the lower jaw; the eminence long
 and concave transversely, short and convex longitudinally; a protu
berant post-glenoid process; a strong and deep zygoma, the orbit
and temporal fossa widely inter-communicating;         the premaxillaries
                                                                    -
join the nasals.
     Of the genus presenting the above dental and osteal characters
 the author de<U+FB01>nes four species :--the <U+FB01>rst, about the size of a Llama,
 is the Nesodon imbricatus; the second, of the size of a Zebra, is the
 Nesodon Sulivam' ; the species to which belong the portions of skull,
 with the teeth, described in the present memoir, did not exceed the
 size of a large sheep, and is termed the Nesodon ovinus ; fourthly, a
 species of the size of a Rhinoceros, Nesodon magnus, is satisfactorily
 indicated by a grinder of the upper jaw.       In conclusion, the author
 remarks, that the osteological characters de<U+FB01>ning the orders of hoofed
 quadrupeds, called Proboscidia, Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla, are
 associated with modi<U+FB01>cations of the soft parts of such importance,
 as not only to establish the principle of that ternary division of the
 great natural group of Ungulata, but to indicate that the known mo
 di<U+FB01>cations of the skeleton of the extinct Toxodons and Nesodons of
  South America, in the degree in which they differ from the osteology
 of the already de<U+FB01>ned orders of Ungulata, must have been associated
  with concomitant modi<U+FB01>cations of other parts of their structure which
  would lead to their being placed in a distinct division, equal to the
 Proboscidia; and, like that order, to be more nearly allied to the Pe
  rissodactyla than the Arliodactyla.’ This new division of the Ungulata
  the author proposes to call Towadontia, and he remarks that its dental
  and osteal characters, while they illustrate the close mutual af<U+FB01>nities
 between the Nesodons and Toxodons, tend to dissipate much of the
  obscurity supposed to involve the true af<U+FB01>nities of the Towodon, and
 to reconcile the con<U+FB02>icting opinions as to the proper position of that
                                                               ‘
  genus in the mammalian class.
     The paper is illustrated by twenty-three highly'<U+FB01>nished draw
 ings, by Dinkel, of the fossil bones and teeth of the different species
  of Nesodon.

F.R.A.S.   Communicated by S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S. Sic.
Received November 17, 1852.
   The author, referring to a former communication on this subject,
published in the Phil. Trans. 1841, states that, in the value of 1r
there given to 208 places of decimals, there exists, in the latter
part of one of the terms of the series for determining the value
of               a transposition               of the <U+FB01>gures            of   a     recurring decimal,
      tan“'%,
which vitiates a considerable number of the <U+FB01>gures in the latter part
of the value.  This error had been detected in consequence of Pro
fessor Schumacher having observed that in the value of r which had
been given him by M. Dase, who had calculated it to 200 places,

and the author’s result was shown                         to differ from           the correct value
by the periodic decimal '36.
   Having been informed by Mr. W. Shanks of Houghton-le~Spring,
that he had pushed his computation of the value of 11' to the extent
of 318 decimals, the author resolved       extend his operations to
                                                              to
upwards of 400 decimals.     As Mr. Shanks had employed Machin's
formula, the author resolved to make use of the same. At his request
Mr. Shanks resumed his calculations, and has not only veri<U+FB01>ed the
author’s value of 7r to 440 places‘of decimals, but has carried his
own to the extent of 530 places.  The author states that the values of
      _    1              1
tan       1——and tan"1         as      well         as the value            of   1r,   which are    here
           5             2—3—9,
subjoined, have been obtained by the independent computations   of
Mr. Shanks and himself, and that they both feel con<U+FB01>dent that
these values are correct in every <U+FB01>gure as far as 440 decimals.

pceived    January     20, 1853.                            ,
     This sounding was obtained on a calm day, October 30, 1852,
 in the course of the passage of H.1VI. ship Herald, from Rio de Ja—
 neiro to the Cape of Good Hope.                   The sounding-line was {6th of
 an inch     in  diameter,    laid   into  one   length, and weighing, when dry,
 llb. for every hundred fathoms.                  Captain Denham received from
 Commodore M‘Keever of the United States Navy, commanding the
 Congress Frigate, a present of 15,000 fathoms of this line, 10,000
 fathoms on one reel, and 5000 on another; and considers it to have
 been admirably adapted for the purpose for which it was made and
 to which it was applied. The plummet Weighed 91bs., and was 11'5
 inches in length, and 1'7 inch in diameter.                      When 7706 fathoms
 had run off the reel the sea-bottom was reached.                      Captain Denliam
 states that Lieut. Hutcheson and himself, in separate boats, with

                                   276
 their own hands, drew the plummet up 50 fathorris several times,
 and after it had renewed its descent, it stopped, on each occasion,
 abruptly at the original mark to a fathom, and would not take an
 other turn off the reel. _ The velocity with which the line run out
 was as follows :

    The whole time therefore taken by the plummet in descending
 through 7706 fathoms, or nearly 7'7 geographical miles of 60 to the
 degree, was 9“ 24‘“ 45‘. The highest summits of the Himalaya, Dha
 walagiri and Kinchinginga, are little more than 28,000 feet, or 4'7
 geographical   miles above the sea.    The sea-bottom has therefore
 depths greatly exceeding the elevation of the highest pinnacle above
its surface.
    The strength of the line tried before the sounding was found to
be equal to bear 72lbs. in air.     The 7706 fathoms which ran out
weighed, when dry, 77lbs., exclusive of the plummet, 9lbs.      Great
care was taken in the endeavour to bring the plummet again to the
 surface to show the nature of the bottom, but, whilst carefully reel
ing in, the line broke at 140 fathoms below the water-line, carrying
away   a Six’s thermometer which had been bent on at 3000 fathoms.

  By Francis Higginson, Esq., R.N. Communicated by Thomas Bell,
  Esq.. Sec. R.S. &c.     Received December 23, 1852.
     The writer states that his attention having been aroused by the
‘
  highly electrical state of the atmosphere during a severe gale of wind,
  he proceeded along the beach in the vicinity of Dover, at   A-M. on the        2
  morning of Friday, the 17th of December 1852.
     It had blown very hard during the night, the wind veering from
  West to W.S.VV.. in occasional heavy squalls of rain and sleet,
  accompanied at intervals by faint <U+FB02>ashing scintillations, which at

                                   277
 <U+FB01>rst, being considered sheet lightning, were only noticed from their
 unusual colour, 0. deep and sombre red.    At about 4“ 50m A.M., how
 ever, these <U+FB02>ashes constantly emerging from a dense, triangular and
 very remarkable cloud in the S.E., which perceptibly increased in
 size with great rapidity, he was induced to observe it with minute
 attention. At 41‘55’“ A.M., Greenwich mean time, the cloud had
 assumed the form of a riglitfangled triangle, its hypothenuse, or
 longest side, tending east and west.   At this instant he <U+FB01>rst heard a
singular and extraordinary hissing sound in the air, not unlike that
 of a passing shot, which, although at <U+FB01>rst not very loud, was yet
clearly distinguishable above the howling of the gale. At 5 A M. the
cloud had nearly doubled its original size, advancing steadily from
the SE. in a N.W. direction, or from nearly dead to leeward, to
 wards the wind’s eye ; whilst the scintillations spoken of were
emitted with increased rapidity. He also then <U+FB01>rst perceived in the
centre of the cloud, a dull, red, obscure nucleus, or <U+FB01>re-ball, appa
rently about half the diameter of the moon, having a tail <U+FB01>ve or six
times that length, from which the <U+FB02>ashes mentioned were sent forth,
of surpassing brilliancy, as the meteor clearly descended with great
velocity through the-air, accompanied by a detonating, hurtling,
hissing sound, impossible to describe, yet resembling that which
precedes the shock of an earthquake.       At three minutes past <U+FB01>ve
o’clock A.M., the meteor having apparently spanned the Channel
from S.E. to N.W., upon approaching the land—evidently throw
ing o<U+FB02>' portions of its substance as it passed through the atmo
sphere—the nucleus suddenly exploded with a report similar to a
very heavy clap of thunder, giving out an intensely brilliant light,
which rendered the minutest objects distinctly visible, although it
rained violently and the sky was obscured by dark and threatening
clouds.    The dense body of the meteorite seemed to fall in the
water about half a mile from the land, as indicated by a great vo
lume of spray, which rose foaming in the distance.

         GENTLEMEN,                                       London, February 3, 1853.
  By the kind indulgence of   my co-executors, Mr. George Thornton
and Mr. John Daniell, I am    permitted to announce to you a most
interesting bequest   to the Royal Society, from my uncle the Rev.
Charles Turnor, F.R.S., who was suddenly taken from us on the
12th ultimo, namely, a collection of drawings, memoirs, a few,me
dals, and other articles enumerated in a list, illustrative of Sir Isaac
                                           ~
Newton.                                       ,
   The well known property at Woolsthorpe in Lincolnshire, which
formerly belonged to Sir Isaac Newton, was purchased by the an
cestor of Mr. T urnor in or about the year 1730, four years after his
death.
   My father-in-law, the late Mr. Tumor, wrote what he could col
lect in his ‘ History of the Soke of Grantham,_’ and his younger
brother, the Rev. Charles Turnor, continuing the subject, has at
great expense devoted much time to this collection.     I may there
fore be excused in saying that it is from no common hand you re
ceive this valuable addition to your Library.
   We send you a copy of the Codicil of the Will relating to the
bequest, and will immediately arrange the several articles in the
collection for delivery to you.    I should certainly wish the Dial
presented by Mr. Charles 'I‘urnor, to either form part of the colle -
tion, or be placed near     it,
                            as  was taken from the wall of Sir Isaac

    Ewtract from   the   Codicil   to the   Will   of   the Rev. Charles   Tumor.
   “I give and bequeath to the President and Council of the Royal
Society at Somerset House, Strand, London, the sum of two hun
dred pounds free of legacy duty, in trust, that they shall apply and
expend the same, at their discretion, in the completion of my col
lection called the ‘Collectanea Newtoniana,’ within the period of
twelve months after my decease.     And hereby give and bequeath
                                                   I

                                   279
kept for ever in their apartments in Somerset House. And I hereby
declare that my will and intention as to the arrangement of the
memoirs, engravings, drawings, autographs, books, the gold watch
formerly belonging to Sir Isaac Newton, the gems and other relics
of which the said ‘ Collectanea’ is composed, is expressed in a ma
nuscript catalogue, which will be found in the box containing the
collection, and signed by me. But it is not my intention that the
plan therein described should be strictly adhered to, if the President
and Council prefer any other method with regard to the arrange
ment of the work.
   “ And I
            hereby direct my executors to pay the above legacy within
three months after my decease; and if two hundred pounds should
not be suf<U+FB01>cient for the purposes before mentioned, then my exe
cutors are hereby required and empowered to advance <U+FB01>fty pounds
more (free of legacy duty) ; and if there should be any overplus in
either case, then the President and Council of the said Society are
at liberty to apply such overplus in the purchase of books for the
Library, or in any other way for the bene<U+FB01>t of the Royal Society.”
   The reading of Mr. Airy’s paper, entitled “On the Eclipses of
Agathocles, Thales and Xerxes,” was resumed and concluded.
   The author, after remarking that the calculations of distant eclipses
made in the last century possess little value, proceeds to give the
successive steps of improvement in the lunar theory as applicable
to the computation of eclipses, and especially in the motion of the
moon’s node.     The <U+FB01>rst great improvement was the introduction by
Laplace of terms expressing a progressive change in the mean secu
lar motions. With Biirg’s tables, in which these changes were in
troduced, or with the same elements, Mr. Francis Baily and Mr.
Ottmanns computed many 'eclipses in the search for that usually
called the eclipse of Thales; and both these astronomers <U+FB01>xed upon
the eclipse of 13.0. 610, September 30, as the only one which could
be reconciled   with the account of Herodotus. Mr. Baily however
subjoined a computation of the eclipse of Agathocles from the same
elements, and found that this could not by any means be reconciled
with the historical account; he inferred from this that some serious
change in the theory is necessary, and that when it was introduced
the eclipse of 5.6. 610 might not be found to agree with history;
but he thought it certain that no other eclipse could be adopted.
The various values of the motion of the node adopted by different
writers from different observations (principally total or annular
eclipses) are then collected.   Allusion is then made to the peculiar
value of the eclipse of Stiklastad (brought to notice by Professor
Hansteen), and which will be increased when the calculations shall
have been made on unexceptional elements.         The author then ad
verts to the great Reduction of the Greenwich Observations from
1750 to 1830, to Hansen’s new inequalities, and to the numerical
amounts of corrections of the principal elements.      Then are given
the coef<U+FB01>cients of the change in secular value of mean motion of the
mean of the moon’s perigee, and of the moon’s node, as found by

                                       280
Laplace, Damoiseau, Plana, and Hansen ; the principal change made
by the latter writers from Laplace's values being in the motion of
perigee.
    The method of computation adopted by the author is then ex
plained.     He adopts the Greenwich mean motions and Damoiseau’s
coef<U+FB01>cients for progressive change of secular'mean motion.         He then
repeats    the  calculation   with  an  arbitrary change   of longitude  of
node; considering that, from the loose nature of the early Green
wich observations, this element is most likely to be in error, and that
its errors will produce the greatest effect.
    The author then discusses the account of the eclipse of Agathocles,
so. 310, August 15. Adopting Alhowareah (under Cape Bon) as
his landing-place in Africa, he states his belief that Agathocles sailed
northward from Syracuse (a conjecture which he owes in the <U+FB01>rst
instance to J. W. Bosanquet, Esq.), and was not far from the Straits
of Messina. On the usual supposition of his sailing to the south,
he would be near Cape Passaro.
    On making the calculation with the Greenwich Elements unvaried,
it is found that the eclipse would be total on the southern possible
place of Agathocles, but not on the northern. The calculation being
repeated with an arbitrary change in the place of the node, a gra
phical construction is employed to discover the numerical amount of
 the changes that must be made to satisfy the four following condi
 tions :——1, the ndrthern edge of the shadow touches the south station;
 2, the northern edge touches the north station ; 3, the southern edge
 touches the south station; 4, the southern edge touches the north
 station.    If the south station be adopted, the change must lie be
 tween those of conditions 1 and 3; if the north, the change must
 lie between those of 2 and 4. The numerical values must be slightly
 increased for application      to a more distant eclipse, as to that of
Thales.
    The eclipse of Thales is then considered.      There appears to be no
 reason for connecting the locality (as Mr. Baily supposed) with the
 river Halys.      The historical circumstances indicate with great pro
 bability that two large armies had met; and the question appears to
 be, in what part of Asia Minor is it likely that such bodies of troops
 would be collected.        The author adverts to the form and passes of
 the mountains, and decides that the Median army entered most pro
 bably by the pass of Issus, or possibly by that of Melitene, and that
 the battle-<U+FB01>eld might be anywhere in the space bounded by Melitene,
 Issus, Iconium, Sardes, and Ancyra.
    On calculating the eclipses which occurred for many years before
 and after 11.0. 600, it appears that only the eclipse of 13.0. 585, May
 28, answers to the requisite conditions, and that it does so in a most
 satisfactory way.      [This is the date adopted by the principal ancient
 chronologists   ;  it would seem that it was <U+FB01>rst veri<U+FB01>ed, by calculations
 founded on good elements, by J. R. Hind, Esq. during the prepara
 tion of this paper.]      The path of the shadow which is most agree
 able to the military and geographical circumstances, is one which
 implies a correction to the Greenwich Elements corresponding to that

                                     281
 which would make the eclipse of Agathocles nearly central over the
 northern station, and excludes the possibility of his passing by the
                                                             '
 southern route.
    The author then adverts to the principal remaining causes of un
 certainty in these conclusions, and points out the values of progress
 ive change in the secular mean motions as peculiarly deserving
                                          '
 investigation.
    Allusion is then made to a record in the Persian poetical history,
preserved by Sir ,John Malcolm, which appears to point to a total
 eclipse as occurring under similar circumstances in the province of
 Mazenderan.        It ,appears however on calculation, that no total     '
 eclipse passed over Mazenderan, at least for many years, about the
 time   in question.
    The author then calls attention to the statement of Herodotus,
 that something like a total solar eclipse occurred when Xerxes was
 setting out from Sardes for his invasion of Greece.     On calculation
it appears impossible to explain this by a solar eclipse, and moreover    -
 the peculiar turn of the answer of the Magi to the inquiries of Xerxes
 would seem to be irreconcileable with a solar eclipse.      The author  v
 thinks it most likely that the phenomenon really was the total eclipse
 of the moon which occurred on the morning of 13.0. 47 9, March 14.
 If this were adopted, the date of the invasion of Greece must, be
brought down one year later  '
                                  than that given by the received chro
nology.

         “ On the determination of the Mean Temperature         of every
 day   in  the  year, as deduced from    the Observations taken at the
 Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in the Years from 1814 to 1851.”
By James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S.         Received Dec. 30, 1852.
    This paper has for its object the determination of the true distri
bution:o£ heatover the year, and is based upon an extensive series
of observations taken at the Royal Observatory during thirty-eight
y ears.                                                        _
    In order to obtain a correct determination of the mean daily tem
perature of each month, necessary to the proposed object, the author
at the commencement of his memoir explains how the entire series
of observations has been divided into groups, according to the re
corded times of observation, for the purpose of applying the neces
sarycorrections calculated from his tables of Diurnal Range, published
in the Phil. Trans. for 1848. Having carefully explained his method
of arranging and testing his data, and providing for exceptional days,
upon which but few observations were recorded, the author gives
the results in twelve separate tables, which exhibit the mean daily
temperatures of every month in each of the thirty-eight years.      In a

 note to the table for each month are given :-51. The mean tempe
rature of the coldest day of that month, with the day of the month
 and the year, from 1814 to 1851 ; 2. the mean temperature of the
 hottest day of that month, with the day of the month and year, and
the extreme difference of mean temperature of two days in that mouth;
 3. The day of the month on which the mean temperature was sub
jected to the greatest change’, with the minimum and maximum
 mean temperatures, the year of the minimum and of the maximum;
 4. the day of the month on which the mean temperature was sub          \
jected to the least change, with the minimum and maximum mean
 temperatures, the year of the minimum and of the maximum.        These
results are embodied in the opposite table :--
     The author then treats of the method adopted to deduce the most
probable true mean temperature due to every day in the year ; and
 Concludes his paper by observing that there are periods of some dura
 tion which are very remarkable on account of the dif<U+FB01>culty of as
 signing a physical cause for the anomalies apparent in the mean
 temperature.     Starting from the lowest temperature, in January, it
increases till the beginning of March, when, between the 3rd and
 10th, not only is the increase checked, but there is a remarkable
 depression of temperature.      After the 10th, the increase proceeds
 and is very rapid towards the end of April and the beginning of May ;
 this rapid increase is rather suddenly checked, and followed by a
 period of cold towards the middle of May : this period is very marked.
 As remarkable a depression of temperature at this time of the year
 seems to have taken place in France, having been noted in Paris
 and at various localities, some situated near the coast; but it does
 not appear that the equally remarkable rise at the end of April has
 been noted.    After the middle of May the numbers steadily increase
 till the 5th of July, when they attain their maximum value. The I
 decline in the temperature towards the end of July is followed by
 an increase at the beginning of August, after which the decline of
 temperature is very regular till towards the end of November, when
 a sudden and considerable increase of temperature takes place ; after
 this the curve declines to its lowest point on the 8th of January.

         “ On the periodic and non-periodic variations of Temperature
  at Toronto in Canada from 1841 to 1852 inclusive.”           By Colonel
  Edward Sabine, R.A., Treasurer and Vice-President of the Royal
  Society. Received 20th Jan. 1853.
     The principal object of this communication is to make known the
  non-periodic variations of temperature for every day in the twelve
  years, from 1841 to 1852 inclusive, at Toronto in Canada.      The non
  periodic  variations are those differences of the  temperature  from its
  mean or normal state which remain after all the known periodical
  variations are allowed for, and are such as are generally accompanied
  by peculiarities of wind or of other meteorological circumstances.
  Recent investigations have led to the inference that opposite condi
  tions of weather prevail simultaneously in the same parallels of lati
  tude under different meridians, and that in particular Europe and
  America usually present such an opposition, so that a severe winter
  here corresponds to a mild one there, and vice versd ; and recent
                                                                            '
  theories of the distribution of heat on ’the surface of the globe pro-
  fess to furnish the explanation.     To place the facts on indisputable
  ground, it is requisite that a comparison should be made of unex
  ceptionable records of the non-periodic variations in Europe and
‘ America, continued for a suf<U+FB01>cient time 'to afford a proper basis for
  inductive generalisation.    Toronto, from its latitude 43° 40' N. and
  inland situation, is well suited to supply such a comparison with
  stations in the middle parts of Europe where similar records have
  been kept; and the twelve years embraced by the observations, viz.
   1841 to 1852, have been years of unusual meteorological activity in
  Europe.
     Details are given in the commencement of the paper showing the
  care bestowed on the examination of the thermometer employed,
  with a standard divided “(1 l’e'chelle arbitraire,” by the method of
  M. Regnault; as well as the precautions adopted for its fair ex.
  posure, and for its protection from rain and radiation.       The obser'
  vations were made by the non-commissioned         of<U+FB01>cers of the detach
  ment of the Royal Artillery employed in the duties of the obser
                                                  '
  vatory.
      The period of twelve years comprises two series, in one of which the
   thermometer was observed hourly, and in the other less frequently,
   each observation in the second series receiving however a correction
   to the mean temperature of the day furnished for every hour and
   every day of the year by the <U+FB01>rst series.      The two series, each of
   six years, are separately discussed; from the <U+FB01>rst series equations
   are derived from the mean monthly temperatures by the method
  suggested by Bessel (Astron. Nach. No. 136), whereby the most
  probable values of the temperature, on every day and every hour,
  are computed corresponding to the whole body of the observations.
  Thes‘e the author regards as approximate normal ‘values, and by
  comparing with them the actual daily temperatures,—-which          in the
  <U+FB01>rst six years are the means on each day of twenty-four equidistant
  observations, and in the second six years the means of all the obser
  vations made on each day, each observation having been corrected

                                     285
 for the hour in the manner described,-—the non-periodic variations
for every day in the year are obtained and are given in a table.
    From the approximate normal temperatures the author has repre
sented in a Plate the phenomena of the temperature at Toronto, ac
cording to a method which, if applied to the different meteorological
elements and in different localities, might, he thinks, materially facili
tate their intercomparison.   This method, in which three variables are
represented, one being dependent on the other two, is essentially the
same that has been long used in magnetic maps, and in the ordinary
isothermal maps ; from which latter however it differs in this respect,
that, whereas in the ordinary isothermal maps the two variables on
 which the variation'of temperature is dependent are the geographical
latitude and longitude, in the present case the two variables are the
hour of the day and the day of the year. The variation of tempe
rature is here referred therefore to time and not to space; a distinc
tion which the author proposes to convey by employing the term
 Chrono-Isothermals, as applicable to lines of this description. From
 the delineation in the Plate, and from the tables contained in the
paper, many characteristic and some peculiar features of the climate
and meteorology of the part of the North American Continent in
which Toronto is situated, are readily perceivable.    Several instances
 are pointed out; amongst these may be noticed the peculiar ano
maly of the North American winter, which is very conspicuous in
the Plate ; and the absolute as well as relative variability of the tem
perature at different seasons of the year, exhibited by means of a
numerical index analogous to the probable error of the arithmetical
mean of a number of partial results, and deduced in a similar man
ner from the differences of individual years, months, and days, from
their mean values: whence it appears, in respect to the annual
temperature, for example, that in any particular year there is an equal
probability that its mean temperature will fall within the limits of
 43°'6 and 44°‘9, as that it will exceed those limits on either side.
    Finally, the author has shown the “ Thermic Anomaly” (as it has
been recently termed) of the monthly and annual temperatures at
Toronto by comparison with the normal temperatures computed by
Dove (Verbreitung der Wiirme, 1852), for the parallel of 43° 40' N.
from 36 equidistant points on the parallel; from which comparison
it appears that after allowance has been made for the elevation above
the sea (342 feet), every month of the year is colder than the normal
temperature of the same month in the same parallel ; that the thermic
anomaly reaches its extreme in February, when it exceeds 10° of
Fahrenheit; and that on the average of the whole year it is little less
                                            ‘
than 6°.

     A paper was read, entitled “On the Muscles which open the
Eustachian Tube.”        By Joseph Toynbee, M.D., F.R.S.        Received
February 2, 1853.
     The author commences by alluding to the opinion generally held
by anatomists, viz. that the guttural ori<U+FB01>ce of the Eustachian tube
is always open, and that the air in the tympanum is constantly con
tinuous with that in the cavity of the fauces.         An examination of
the guttural ori<U+FB01>ce of the tube in man and other animals has led the
author to conclude, that, except during muscular action, this ori<U+FB01>ce
 is always closed, and that the tympanum forms a cavity distinct and
isolated from the outer air. The muscles which open the Eustachian
 tube in man are the tensor and levator palati, and it is by their ac
 tion during the process of deglutition that the tubes are ordinarily
 opened.     That the act of swallowing is the means whereby the Eu
 stachian tubes are opened, is shown by some experiments of which
 the following may be cited.      If the mouth and nose be closed during
 the act of swallowing the saliva, a sensation of fulness or distension
 is produced in the ears; this sensation arises from the air, which is
 slightly compressed in the fauces, passing into and distending the
 tympanic cavities: upon removing the hand from the nose, it will be
 observed that this feeling of pressure in the ears does not disappear,
  but it remains until the act of deglutition is again performed while
  thev nose is not closed.     In this experiment the Eustachian tubes
  were opened during each act of deglutition; during the <U+FB01>rst act,
  while they were open, air was forced into the cavity of the tympanum
  by the contraction of the muscles of the fauces and pharynx, and the
  guttural ori<U+FB01>ces of the tubes remained closed until the second a'ct of
  swallowing, which opened the tubes and allowed the air to escape.
  That the act of deglutition opens the Eustachian tubes, was inferred
  also from the custom usually adopted of swallowing while the de
  scent in a diving-bell is performed ; by this act the condensed air is
  allowed to enter the tympanum, and the sensation of Pain  '
                                                                and pres
  sure in the ears is removed or entirely avoided.
      The author gives an account of the Eustachian tube and its
  muscles in Mammalia, Birds and Reptiles.         In some mammalia the
   muscles opening the tubes appertainI as in man, to the palate, in
   others this function is performed by the superior constrictor muscles
  of the pharynx. In Birds it is shown that there is a single mem
  branous tube into which the two osseous tubes open; this mem
  branous tube is situated between and is intimately adherent to the
  irmer surface of each pterygoid muscle, and by these muscles the
  tube is opened.     The conclusion to which the author arrives re
  specting the in<U+FB02>uence of the closed Eustachian tubes is, that the
  function of hearing is best carried on while the tympanum is a closed
  cavity, and that the analogy usually cited as existing between the
  ordinary musical instrument, the drum and the tympanum, to the
  effect, that in each it is requisite for the air within t0 mmunicate

                                      287
freely with the outer air, is not correct. On the contrary, the author
shows that no displacement of the air is requisite for the propagation
of sonorous undulations, and that were the Eustachian tubes con
stantly open, these undulations would extend into the cavity of the
fauces, there to be absorbed by the thick and soft, mucous membrane,
instead of being con<U+FB01>ned to the tympanic cavity, the walls of which
are so peculiarly well adapted to the production of resonance, in order
that they shall be concentrated upon the labyrinth.
   In corroboration of the above views the author states, that in
cases of deafness dependent simply upon an aperture in the mem
brana tympani, whereby the sonorous undulations are permitted to
escape into the external meatus, the power of hearing has been
greatly improved by the use of an arti<U+FB01>cial membrana tympani
made of vulcanized india-rubber or gutta-percha, which is so applied
as again to render the tympanum a closed cavity.

   A paper was read, entitled “On Periodical Laws in the larger
Magnetic Disturbances.” By Captain Younghusband, R.A., F .R.S.
Received February 16, 1853.
   In this communication the author has arranged, in tables, the
disturbances of the magnetic declination at St. Helena and the Cape
of Good Hope, for the purpose of exhibiting the systematic laws by
which those phenomena are regulated, which were long described
as irregular variations, because they were of occasional and appa
rently uncertain occurrence.
   The frequency of the disturbances, and their-amount, whether
viewed   separately   as easterly   or westerly   movements,      or as general
abnormal variations (easterly and westerly being taken together), is
shown to be dependent upon the hour of the day, the period of the
year, and upon the year of observation.       This dependence upon the
year of observation affords additional testimony of a periodical varia
tion in the magnitude of magnetic changes of the same character as
that which has been found to exist at other places, and which has
been considered to be coincident with variations of the solar spots.
   The disturbances of larger amount only are noticed; those ob
servations which dilfered by 2'5 scale divisions (1"8 in arc at St.
Helena, and 1"9 in are at the Cape) and upwards, from the normal
place, were separated from the others and the values of the differ
ences taken; there were therefore two series of <U+FB01>gures to be dealt
with, viz. the number of disturbances, and the aggregate amount of
disturbance. These were separated into disturbances of the north
end of the magnet towards the east and towards the west, and the
effect of each considered separately.
   The periodical character of disturbances at St. Helena and the
 Cape in a cycle of years is indicated insofar as the limited extent of the
 observations would permit; suf<U+FB01>cient however to point            the year
                                                                       tko

                                      288
   1843 as that of least disturbance at these two places, by showing a
  regular decrease from the previous years, and an increase in every
   succeeding year of observation.       Though the hourly observations
  were discontinued    before 1848, the year which Colonel Sabine has
  shown to be that of periodical maximum, as 1843 was that of mini
   mum magnetic activity at Toronto and Hobarton, the observations
   now discussed are shown to be quite consistent with this period, and
   thus tend to establish it as a general law of magnetic phenomena.
   In the aggregate of each year the disturbances towards the west are
   shown to preponderate over those towards the east, both at St.
   Helena and the Cape of Good Hope; a similar preponderance of
   westerly over easterly has been found in every year of observation
   at Hobarton, but at Toronto the easterly disturbances exceeded the
   westerly both in number and amount inv every year.
      Arranging the disturbances into the several months of their oc
   currence, the greatest disturbance       is found to occur in January
   and the least in June at St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope;
  the same months being those of greatest and least disturbance at
  Hobarton, whereas at Toronto, both January and June are months of
  minimum disturbance, the maxima disturbance occurring there in
  April  and September.                                                   .
      From this identity of the epoch of greatest and least disturbance,
  -—at St. Helena, where the months of January and June are not
  those of opposite seasons, viewed either with respect to the sun’s ex
  treme altitude or to extreme periods of temperature,-—at the Cape,
  situated in S. latitude 33° 56',—and at Hobarton in S. latitude
  42° 52',-—and contrasting this identity with a different law at T0
  ronto in N. latitude 43° 39', the author infers that the principal
  causes which produce an annual period of disturbance are not de
  pendent upon local seasons.       It is likewise pointed out that about
. the period of the-equinoxes     there is a tendency to maximum dis
  turbances at all the stations, producing absolute maxima at Toronto,
  faintly but systematically indicated at the other stations.
     The westerly disturbances were found to exceed the easterly in
  every month in the year at St. Helena and the Cape, which agrees
  with the results deduced from the Hobarth observations, while it
  appears from the observations at Toronto that the easterly disturb
  ances exceeded the westerly in every month. The average value of
  a westerly disturbance is greater than that of an easterly in every
  month at St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope. The disturbances
  at Hobarton again coincide with this result; and in a slight and less
  perfectly marked degree, Toronto has the same peculiarity.
     Arranging the disturbances into the several hours of their occur
  rence, the heurs of the day are found to be those of greatest disturb
  ance in a very considerable degree; the sum of the ratios, during
  the twelve hours of the day, being about seven times as great as the
  sum of those in the twelve hours of the night at St. Helena, and
  about 2'6 times as great at the Cape of Good Hope; “while at Ho
  barton the sum of the twelve night ratios slightly exceeded the day;
  at Toronto the excess was larger, viz. as 1'3 to l.        The laws of
  easterly and westerly disturbances, in relation to the local hours, are

                                   289
 then examined separately.     At St. Helena and the Cape, the easterly
 day-disturbances    exceed the easterly night-disturbances, and the
 westerly day-disturbances    exceed the westerly night-disturbances.
 These results are compared with those at Toronto and Hobarton.
    At St. Helena, although but comparatively few disturbances occur
 during the night hours, those disturbances are almost all westerly
 (183 disturbances. in all, occurred in nine night hours during <U+FB01>ve
years, of which 174 were westerly and but nine easterly).         In the
 day hours thekwesterly only sliy/ztly exceed the easterly disturbances.
At the Cape, the westerly excess is less in the night and greater in
the day than at St‘. Helena, and the night excess much greater
                                                                     than
the day excess.
    At St. Helena, the fact of the disturbances being more frequent in
the day than in the night is consistent in every month of the year;
 this appears worthy of remark when it is remembered that at St.
 Helena the curve of the diurnal variation of the declination is pre
 cisely reversed at.two opposite periods of the year; in one case cor
 responding to the curve of diurnal variation in middle northern lati
 tudes, and in the other to that in middle southern latitudes.
    The mean effect of the disturbances which have been separated
 as described, and which comprise all of largest magnitude, is a con
 stant westerly e<U+FB01>’ect at every hour both at St. Helena and the Cape
 of Good Hope, acting more energetically in the night than in the day.
 At Toronto the mean effect is westerly in the day and easterlyin the
 night; at Hobarton, easterly in the day and westerly in the night.

      paper was read, entitled
Lake District (Sixth paper, for 1852).” By John F. Miller, Esq.,
F.R.S. &c. Received February 22, 1853.
    This paper contains records of the meteorology of the Lake district,
 similar to those of former years which have been communicated by
 the author. _ These are given in tables z—Table I. is a Synopsis of
 the fall of Rain in the Lake district of Cumberland and Westmore
 land in the year 1852.     Table II. Wet days (the number in each
 month and the whole year at each station).      Table III. The quantity
 of Rain received by the mountain gauges in the year 1852 (for each
 month). Table IV. The quantity of Rain for the summer months
 (May to October). Table V. For the winter months (November to
 April). Table VI. Temperature (max. min. approximate mean) at
 Seathwaite, Borrowdale, 368 feet above the sea' level (for each month
 and for the year).   Table VII. Temperature at Whitehaven. Table
VIII/Minimum temperature of each month, on Sea Fell Pike and
 Gabel, and at Sprinkling Tarn, from July 1851 to December 1852
inclusive.    Table IX. Monthly hygrometrical observations taken at
 the mountain stations adjacent to the Vale of Wastdale, in the year
 1852.     Table X. Deductions relative to the humidity of the atmo
 sphere at the mountain stations in 1852.       Tables XL, XIl., XIII.,
XIV. contain hygrometrical observations made at various stations in
April and July 1848, and in December 1850 and July 1851.
    In the remarks which follow the tables, the author states that the
past year is distinguished by several marked peculiarities, of which
the most prominent are—the Very large amount of rain and its very
unequal distribution over the different seasons; the enormous and
unprecedented fall in the <U+FB01>rst two and last two months ; and the pro
tracted drought of ten weeks in the spring, the longest, though not
the most severe which has occurred in the northern counties within
the memory of the existing generation.          The year_ is further re
markable for its high temperature;     the large amount of surface eva
poration; the great heat of July and August; the great quantity of
free electricity, as manifested by the unusual number and almost
tropical severity of the thunder-storms; the small number of frosty
nights, and the entire absence of snow; and, lastly, for the violent
gales of wind which prevailed during the last week of December,
particularly the hurricane on the morning of Christmas-day.        After
the discussion of these irregularities, tables are given showing the
excess or de<U+FB01>ciency per cent. of the principal mountain gauges over
or under the quantity of rain received by the adjacent valleys, both
in the summer and winter months, in each year since the instruments
were erected in 1846.     The remainder of the paper is occupied with
details referring to the temperature and the hygrometrical observa

     Dean Sm,-—-In    the report in the Athenaeum of your lecture at the
  Royal Institution on the 21st of January, I observe that you refer to
 the highly interesting observations of Schwabe, Sabine, Wolf, Gautier,
 &c., from which it would appear that a connection exists between the
 solar spots and the variations of the terrestrial magnetic           forces.
 Since a connection has been demonstrated to exist between the lat
 ter and auroral phenomena, I was induced to look over my notes
 relating to the aurorae observed at this place, with a view to ascer
 tain whether these also exhibited maxima and minima, and if so,
 whether the periods of such agreed with those of the solar spots and
 of the magnetic variations.     The subjoined table shows the distri
 bution of the aurorae seen here in the years 1838 to 1847 inclusive :—

    The following communication was likewise read :~—“ On the Re
production of the Toad and Frog without the intermediate stage of
Tadpole.”       By Edward Joseph Lowe, Esq., .F.G.S., F.R.A.S.
Communicated       by J. Lee, LL.D., F.R.S. 810.       Received February
 19, 1853.
    The following brief remarks on the Toad (Bufo vulgaris) and the
Frog (Rana temporaria) may perhaps be received with some degree
of interest, as they are, I believe, contrary to the generally received
notion of the procreation of these reptiles.    Ray, and most natural
ists, at least, consider toads and frogs as oviparous animals, yet it
is apparent that they are viviparous as well, or if they do not bring
forth their young alive, have the power of reproduction in a differ
ent manner to the ova and subsequent       tadpole.
    Mr.   J. Higginhottom of Nottingham, who has paid great atten
tion to this subject, has clearly proved the development of the tad
pole to the perfect toad in situations wholly deprived of light, as I
have through his kindness several times witnessed.         My present re
marks are intended to show that occasionally frogs and toads are
reproduced in localities where it would be impossible for the inter
mediate stage of tadpole to have any existence.
    First. Toads deposit spawn in cellars and young toads are after
                                                                      '
 wards observed.
    Last summer several masses of spawn were procured from my
 cellar, having been found deposited amongst decaying potatoes, &c.,
 and subsequently      young toads were noticed.        The cellar is free
 from water, and at a considerable distance from any brook.
     Secondly.   Young toads are observed about hot-beds.
     In the kitchen-garden at Highiield House (which is entirely walled
 round) young toads have been noticed about the cucumber- and
 melon-beds.      The gardeners have been in the habit of bringing
 toads to these beds to destroy the insects; these have continued
 amongst the warm damp straw all summer.            It is after these beds
 have remained three or four months that the young ones have been
 noticed.     Toads would have to travel nearly half a mile to reach
 this garden from tlie brook or lake, and also to mount a steep hill,
 besides taking the opportunity of coming through the door.          Toads
  so small are not seen in any other part of the gardens.
     Thirdly. Young toads and frogs observed in abundance at the sum
  mit of another hill, whilst quite small.
     During the past summer, especially in the month of July, very
  many young toads and frogs were seen amongst the strawberry
 plants, apparently from a week to a month old.          These might pos
  sibly have travelled from the brook a few hundred yards distant;
  yet it is strange, that with the exception of these beds, no young
  toads could be found elsewhere in the garden.          A number of full
  grown toads are mostly to be seen about these beds.
      Fourthly. Young frogs dug out of the ground in the month of
 January.
      In digging in the garden      amongst the strawberry-beds (near
  where so many toads were observed last summer) in the middle of
                                            \

                                     293
January in    the present year, a nest of about a score young frogs
were upturned.      These were apparently three or four weeks old.
This ground had beenpreviously dug in the month of August and
many strawberry plants buried; it was amongst a mass of these
plants in a state of partial decomposition that these young ones were
observed.
   Fifthly. Young frogs are bred in cellars where there is no water for
tadpoles.                          \
   In mentioning this    subject to Mr. Joseph Sidebotham of Man
chester (an active botanist), he informed me that young frogs, and
in fact frogs of all sizes, were to be seen in his cellar amongst de
caying dahlia tubers.      The smallest of them were only about half
the ordinary size of the young frog when newly developed from the
tadpole.   He further stated that there was no water in the cellar,
and no means of young frogs entering, except by <U+FB01>rst coming into
the kitchen, a mode of entry, if not impossible, highly improbable.
Mr. Sidebotham never found any spawn.
   It seems probable from the above, that frogs are occasionally
born alive in situations where no water can be found for the spawn
to be deposited in, and that toads are either reproduced in the same
manner, or from the egg directly.          The latter mode seems most
likely, owing to spawn having been found previously to the young
toads.
   Mr. Higginbottom tells me, the same remark on the birth of the
Triton, without the stage of tadpole, has been mentioned to him.
   These are the facts; should the subject be deemed worthy of
further investigation, Lshall be glad to continue observations upon
these reptiles during the present year, or to make any experiments
that may be deemed advisable.

Barry, M.D., F.R.S., F.R.SE.           Received February 24, 1853.
   After referring to the drawings to his paper on Fibre, published in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1842, and the Opinions entertained
by physiologists regarding the peculiar views he advanced in that
paper with reference to the original composition of organic <U+FB01>bre,
the author states that, after the lapse of eleven years, these views
have been fully con<U+FB01>rmed, and in proof of this refers to a paper-‘
“De cellula vegetabili <U+FB01>brillis  tenuissimis   contexta” (Lundae, 1852),

                                   294
 by Agardh.      He further remarks, that his paper of 1842 contains a
 record of other observations made in a <U+FB01>eld beyond the region of
 Agardh’s researches; observations which he thinks explain how it is
 that <U+FB01>bre forms the membrane of the cell, and, what he deems of
 more importance still, the mode of origin of <U+FB01>bre.      He refers gene
 rally to the drawings in that paper, from which, in connection with
 facts previously recorded in the Philosophical Transactions, he states
 that it appears—1, that <U+FB01>bre has its origin in the so-called “ cyto
 blast,” the outer part of which always passes into a ring or coil of
 <U+FB01>bre ; 2, that when a cell is to arise, its primary membrane is formed
 out of this ring or coil of <U+FB01>bre; 3, that then the nucleolus of the
 “cytoblast” becomes the nucleus of the cell; 4, that the outer
 part of the nucleus of the cell also passes into a ring or coil of <U+FB01>bre,
 wherewith to form deposits such as the annular and spiral, or to
 weave the secondary membranes; 5, that the term “cytoblast” is
 unsuitable, as the body so called does not always become a cell;
 6, that <U+FB01>bre is thus more universal as well as more primitive even
 than the cell, for <U+FB01>bre not only forms the cell, but it forms other
 structures without having <U+FB01>rst to form a cell; 7, that the prime
mover in both the “cytoblast” and the nucleus is the nucleolus,
which is the organ of absorption, assimilation, and secretion; 8,
that the nucleolus is continually giving off its substance and con
 tinually renewing  it, continually passing from the state of nucleolus
                              or nucleus,‘—so that the “ cytoblast ” and
                            ”
 into that of “ cytoblast
 the nucleus are each of them but the nucleolus enlarged;      9,  that  it
is  therefore the nucleolus enlarged that passes into <U+FB01>bre; 10, that
the nucleolus always passes into <U+FB01>bre, andvdirectly into no other
form than that of <U+FB01>bre; 11, that thus the whole organism arises
out of nucleoli, for <U+FB01>bre     isbut the nucleolus in another shape, and
every structure arises out of <U+FB01>bre; 12, that the nucleolus     is  repro
duced by self~division, and that subsequently, when      it   has passed
into the form of <U+FB01>bre, the mode in which the nucleolus gives origin
to other structures  is   such as to imply even here the continued re
production of its own substance—that mode being self-division.
    The author describes particularly the mode of origin of primary
and secondary membranes, and division of the cell.         He considers
that the latter initiated by self-division of the nucleolus into halvas
               is
which become “ cytoblasts,” and     it   is  completed by the formation
out of these of two young cells, the walls of which, where in contact
with one another, form a septum dividing the parent cell into two
compartments.      Thus for division of the cell there occurs no folding
inwards of a " primordial utricle,” as maintained by Von Mohl,
nor any division of the contents of a parent cell into two parts, around
which contents are formed the walls of two young cells, as supposed
by Nigeli and Hofmeister. On the subject of annular, spiral, and
other deposits in the vessels of plants, the author remarks, that when
the divisions of an annular or spiral <U+FB01>bre are not continued, but par
tial and irregular, We have the reticular form, as well as an expla
nation of the supposed tendency in vegetable <U+FB01>bre to anastomosis.
    The two spiral <U+FB01>laments composing <U+FB01>bre at <U+FB01>rst appeared         tothe

  author to run in opposite directions, which he subsequently saw was
  not the case,—their direction is the same.       This error he corrected
  in Miiller’s Archiv for 1850.
     The author remarks, that observers in their endeavours to reach
  the ultimate structure of the muscular <U+FB01>bril have actually gone too       .
  far, and reached a later generation,—mistaking for the <U+FB01>bril a row of
  quadrilateral particles, the mere elements thereof.      These particles,
  he observes, are known to be alternately light and dark in alternate
  order; they give origin to the term spirals; and for this purpose
  the dark particles undergo what observers have entirely overlooked,
  division and subdivision, which changes ,he has <U+FB01>gured in Miiller’s
  Archiv, 1850.       The preparation in which he has again met with
  the subdivision into four is still, the author states, in his possession
  for demonstration to others.
      2. “ On   the penetration of Spermatozoa into the interior of the
  Ovum;     a Note showing this to have been recorded as an established
  fact in the Philosophical Transactions for 1843.”             By Martin
  Barry, M.D., F.R.S.,                  Received February 24, 1853.
      Referring to a statement by Dr. Nelson, in a paper “On the re
  production of the Ascaris Mystaz',” that the investigations in that
          “ appear to be the <U+FB01>rst in which the fact of the penetration of
  paper
  spermatozoa      into the ovum has been distinctly seen and clearly
  established in one of the most highly organized of the EntOZoa,”
  the author of the present communication remarks, that when Dr.
  Nelson made this statement he was evidently not aware of what had
  been published on the subject.       In proof of this Dr. Barry refers to
                             “
  his own paper, entitled      Spermatozoa observed within the Mammi~
  ferous Ovum” (Phil. Trans. 1843, p. 33), in which he states that
  he had met with ova of the Rabbit containing a number of sperma
  tozoa in their interior; and to the Edinburgh New Philosophical
  Journal for October 1843, which contains a drawing in which seven
  spermatozoa are represented in the interior of an ovum, besides the
   statement that in one instance he had counted more than twenty
  spermatozoa in a single ovum.        In conclusion he remarks, that Dr.
  Nelson merely added a further con<U+FB01>rmation in ova of an entoZoon, to
  what his OWn researches on mammiferous ova had enabled him to
  record as an established fact nine years before.

'
         paper was read, entitled
   Antennae   in  a small species of Crustacean.” By John D. McDonald,
   M.D., Assistant Surgeon to H.M.S.V. Torch. Communicatedby

                                    296
 Sir William Burnett, F.R.S., Director-General of      the Medical De
partment of the Navy.      Received March 3, 1853.
    The little crustacean which is the subject of this paper was taken
in considerable numbers in the voyage from St. Vincent to Rio Ja
neiro.    There are several anatomical peculiarities mentioned, but
the most remarkable is the structure of the right antenna of the
male.    These organs are in the female perfectly symmetrical,       and
resemble that of the left side in the male; and although in the very
young state of the latter sex the right antenna differs but little in
external appearance from the left, yet the peculiar hypertrophied
condition of the modi<U+FB01>ed segments in the corresponding organ of
the adult male is to be distinctly traced in a rudimentary state.
    As the animal lives in the open ocean, none of the limbs are
adapted for walking; but when placed in a vessel of sea-water, they
rested upon their antennae on reaching the bottom, and paddled
themselves about by their fore-limbs and tail.
    The author remarks that in all their movements the males exhibit
a tendency to turn towards the left side, and concludes the rationale
of this fact to be, that the brain on the right side being more deve
loped at the part from which the right antenna derives its nerves, a
corresponding predominance is given to the power of the locomotive
organs on that side.
    When fully developed, each antenna in both sexes consists of
twenty-<U+FB01>ve segments.       Of these, the <U+FB01>rst thirteen present nothing
remarkable; but all the remaining pieces on the right side enter
into .the composition of the curious prehensile organ which forms
the principal subject of the paper.
    This organ is composed in the following mannera—The fourteenth
and four following segments are dilated into a large <U+FB02>ask-like organ,
the neck of which is eked out by the nineteenth and twentieth.
The next two segments are fused together, and are articulated with
the foregoing by a simple joint, and the whole of the remaining
 segments form another piece similarly articulated with the inter
 mediate piece; so that the whole results in two simple joints sus
 ceptible of <U+FB02>exion in one direction only. On the eighteenth segment
is a barbed process having its apex directed backwards, and its an
terior border beset with sharp teeth.      Two processes of the same
 nature, but differently placed and more elongated, lie side by side
upon the fore-part of the <U+FB01>rst compound segment.         This piece and
 that which succeeds it act upon each other like a pair of jaws, each    ,
 furnished with an array of sharp conical teeth, while the last com
 pound member of the series plays over the upper surface of the
 eighteenth segment.
    The author then proceeds to describe the muscles which move
 this complex apparatus.     The extensors are small and feeble, but
 the <U+FB01>exors are, as might be anticipated, more complex and power
 ful. They are two in number.       The <U+FB01>rst has its origin in the large
 <U+FB02>ask-like dilatation, and is inserted by a tendon into the second
 compound piece, from which the second muscle arises, and is in
 serted, also by tendon, into the third piece. The paper is illustrated
 by elaborate drawings.

  I A paper was read, entitled                                     Spinal
Chord.”       By J. Lockhart  Clark,  Esq. Communicated by E. Solly,
Esq., F.R.S. Received March 15.
    These investigations were undertaken by the author partly with
the view of settling the long-agitated question whether all the roots
of the spinal nerves terminate in the spinal chord, or whether any
part of them ascend within the white or grey columns to the brain.
The preparations employed for this purpose were made according to
the new method described in the author’s former communication,
Phil. Trans. 1851, Part 2; and the animals selected were the Ox,
Calf, Cat, Rat, Mouse and Frog.          Of the spinal chord of the Cat,
he has succeeded, after much. trouble, in rendering transparent
longitudinal "sections %th of an inch in thickness, and more than
two inches in length, including the roots of four or <U+FB01>ve pairs of
nerves
    The principal results at which the author has arrived are as fol
 lows :—
    That the posterior-roots of the spinal nerves consist of three kinds ;
 two of these enter the posterior grey substance at right angles, and
 the third kind with different degrees of obliquity upwards, a small
 proportion of the latter taking a longitudinal course and becoming
 lost in the posterior white columns.
     That in no instance were any of the <U+FB01>bres of the anterior roots
 seen to ascend with the anterior white columns, before they entered
 the grey substance.
     That besides the transverse bundles that form the anterior roots,
 a continuous system of exceedingly <U+FB01>ne transverse <U+FB01>bres issue from
 the anterior grey substance and become lost as they proceed towards
 the surface of the chord.            I
     That from the preceding facts, it may be inferred that nearly all,
 if not the whole of the <U+FB01>bres composing the roots of the spinal nerves
 proceed at once to the grey substance of the chord; and that if any
 of them ascend directly to the brain, it must be those only of the
 posterior roots which run longitudinally in the posterior white
 columns.
     That the communication between the sensorium and the spinal
 nerves is not established by the posterior White columns, but by the
  antero-lateral columns, especially the lateral.                         ‘
     That many   of the <U+FB01>bres  which  belong respectively  to the anterio
  and posterior roots in different regions of the chord, terminate there
 by forming with each other a series of loops of various sizes and
  lengths ; and that it is not improbable that some of them may reach
  even as far as the brain, as it is well known that the formation of
  loops is one mode in which nerve-<U+FB01>bres do terminate there. ,A por

                                   298
 tion of the roots however may be connected with the vesicles of the
 chord, although the evidence of any such connection is very un
 satisfactory.
    That there are reasons for believing that the grey substance of
 the chord does not transmit impressions to and from the brain ; and
that the fine longitudinal fibres described by Stilling have not been
found by the author.                                                     -
    That there is a great correspondence in the fibrous arrangement
 between the grey substance of the chord and the chiasma of the
optic nerves. That the fact that the nerve-roots not only diverge
both upwards and downwards to a considerable distance beyond
their point of entrance, but intermingle also with each other in the
most intricate manner, may explain how impressions made at one
 particular spot are communicated in different directions to distant
parts of the chord, so as to excite a simultaneous and sympathetic
action in classes of muscles which otherwise would appear uncon
nected.

    MoN cHER CoL. SABINE,-Je reçois aujourd'hui les Transactions
Philosophiques de 1852, et j'y vois, avec surprise et avec une grande
satisfaction, que la Société Royale de Londres m'a fait l'honneur, au
mois de Novembre dernier, de me nommer un de ses membres étran
gers. Jusqu'ici je n'en avais reçu aucun avis ; je viens donc vous
prier de vouloir bien remercier, en mon nom, la Société Royale pour
le témoignage d'estime qu'elle m'a donné, et de lui indiquer en
même temps les circonstances qui m'ont empêcé de lui adresser
plustôt ces remerciments.
    J'ai trouvé dans les Transactions de 1852 un mémoire de MM.
Joule et Thomson sur la chaleur spécifique de l'air atmosphérique, et
des expériences des mêmes auteurs sur les effets calorifiques qui se pro
duisent pendant le passage de l'air à travers de petites ouvertures. Je
me suis occupé depuis longtemps de ces divers sujets, et, depuis plu
sieurs années, tout ce qui se rapporte à ce point est terminé. Si je
n'ai pas publié mes résultats jusqu'ici, c'est qu'ils forment une très
petite partie de mes recherches qui m'occupent depuis six ans, et que
mon intention est de publier dans leur ensemble.      Elles formeront un
volume des mémoires de notre Académie ; leur publication est longue
à cause des calculs numériques énormes qu'il a fallu exécuter. Cette
publication s'est d'ailleurs trouvée fortement entravée par mes nou
velles fonctions de Directeur de la manufacture de Sèvres que j'ai
acceptée bien malgré moi, prévoyant bien les obstacles qu'elles pré
senteraient à l'exécution de mes travaux scientifiques. Mais, enfin,

                                   299
aujourd'hui, l'impression de cette suite de mémoires est commencée,
et je ferai tous mes efforts pour les mettre au jour le plustôt possible.
Je vous donne ici la liste des sujets que j'y ai traités.
    1. Nouvelles recherches sur la compressibilité des gaz. Elles se
rapportent à un certain nombre de gaz qui n'avaient pas été étudiés
dans mon premier mémoire sur ce sujet, et dont j'avais besoin de
connaître les lois de compressibilité pour mes recherches subsé
quentes.
    2. Sur les forces élastiques des vapeurs depuis les températures
les plus basses jusqu'à celles qui correspondent à une tension de 12
atmosphères. Ces expériences se rapportent à un grand nombre de
liquides autres que l'eau, et qui sont à peu près tous ceux que nos
moyens chimiques nous permettent aujourd'hui d'obtenir à l'état de
pureté.
    3. Sur les forces élastiques des vapeurs produites par les mêmes
 liquides mélangés. Ces expériences m'ont conduit à des résultats
curieux, souvent en contradiction complète avec les idées actuelle
 ment admises dans la science.
    4. Sur les forces élastiques des mêmes vapeurs dans les gaz à
 saturation et à non saturation.
    5. Sur les chaleurs latentes des mêmes vapeurs sous diverses
 pressions depuis les pressions les plus faibles jusqu'à la pression de
 plusieurs atmosphères.
  - 6. Sur la chaleur latente de vaporisation de ces mêmes liquides,
 quand ils se vaporisent dans les gaz à saturation ou à non saturation.
    7. Sur les chaleurs spécifiques de ces liquides depuis les tempé
 ratures les plus basses jusqu'à celles de leur ébullition.
    8. Sur les chaleurs spécifiques des gaz, la pression de l'atmo
 sphère, et entre les diverses limites de température. Ce travail
 m'occupe depuis plus de dix ans et m'a présenté un grand nombre
 de difficultés.  Il est toujours facile d'obtenir des évaluations appro
 chées de ces éléments ; la difficulté ne commence que quand il s'agit
 de décider si le nombre que l'on obtient n'est pas trop faible, ni trop
 fort. Un expérimentateur habile trouve facilement des nombres
 identiques en opérant toujours de la même manière ; mais l'identité
  des résultats ne prouve nullement leur exactitude.         Les erreurs
 accidentelles sont toujours faciles à éviter; il n'en est pas de même
 des erreurs constantes et de celles qui tiennent au procédé employé.
  Le nombre trouvé par Mr. Joule pour la chaleur spécifique de l'air
 sous pression constante (O 226) est beaucoup trop faible. Celui qui
 résulte de mes expériences très nombreuses, et faites dans des cir
 constances variées, afin de reconnaitre et d'éliminer les erreurs con
 stantes, est 0237. Je l'ai publié à l'Académie des Sciences depuis
 plusieurs mois lorsque je lui ai présenté mon second mémoire sur
 l'hygrométrie où cet élément était nécessaire.         Mon travail com
 prend la chaleur spécifique d'un grand nombre d'autres gaz ; tels
 que l'oxygène, l'hydrogène, le chlore, le brôme, l'acide carbonique,
 l'oxyde de carbone, le protoxyde d'azote, le deutoxyde d'azote, les
 hydrogènes carbonés, l'acide sulfureux, l'acide sulfhydrique, l'acide
  chlorhydrique, l'ammoniaque, &c. &e,

                                        300
    9. Sur les chaleurs spécifiques des gaz sous des pressions plus
grandes que    la pression de l'atmosphère. Ce travail a pour but de
décider si la chaleur spécifique d'une même masse de gaz reste con
stante sous les différentes densités que l'on peut donner à ce gaz, et
de trouver la loi de la variation.
    10. Sur les chaleurs dégagées ou absorbées par l'air pendant sa
compression ou son expansion. Ce travail est celui qui m'a le plus
longtemps arrêté et qui m'a empêché de publier l'ensemble de mes
recherches.     C'est à cette occasion que j'ai étudié les phénomènes
calorifiques qui se produisent pendant le passage des gaz comprimés
à travers de petites ouvertures ou par des tubes capillaires, suivant
                                                                               -,
que le gaz est chaud ou qu'il est froid. J'ai étudié- le même sujet sur
le gaz qui produit un travail moteur
    l.  Complètement intérieur au calorimètre.
   2. Extérieur au calorimètre et produisant un effet mécanique qui
puisse être assigné.
   Je suis encore arrêté dans les conclusions à déduire de ce dernier
travail, par suite de plusieurs anomalies, dont je ne trouve l'explica
tion par aucune des théories proposées.
    1 l. Sur les chaleurs spécifiques des vapeurs sous diverses pres
sions. J'ai soumis à ces recherches un très grand nombre de vapeurs,
mais en insistant plus spécialement sur celles qui peuvent être ob
tenues à l'état de pureté parfaite, et hélas ! elles ne sont pas très
nombreuses.      La chaleur spécifique que j'ai trouvé à la vapeur d'eau
sous la pression de l'atmosphère est 0475 par rapport à l'eau liquide.
    L'ensemble de ces recherches permettra de calculer numériquement
les effets mécaniques que l'on peut retirer théoriquement de 1 kil.
 de charbon, suivant que l'on applique la chaleur à la production de
la vapeur d'eau ou d'une autre vapeur, sous diverses pressions, à
 saturation ou sous détente, ou qu'on l'applique à un gaz quelconque
à détente ou sous pression constante. En un mot, j'espère que les
résultats obtenus dans ces recherches permettront de résoudre enfin,
avec quelque certitude, les questions qui divisent depuis si longtemps
les ingénieurs, en même temps qu'elle fourniront un grand nombre
d'épreuves pour décider les diverses théories qui ont été proposées
pour la chaleur.
    Je vous prie, mon cher Colonel, de donner lecture de cette lettre
à la Société Royale, et d'en demander l'insertion dans ses publica
tions, si elle n'y trouve pas d'empêchement.
                                 J'ai l'honneur d'être,
                                               Votre dévoué serviteur,

    2. Extract from a letter from M. Kämtz addressed to Colonel
 Sabine (Translation) :-Received         April 10, 1853.
                            -
                                          Dorpat, 15th March (N. Style), 1853.
    I have just  completed    the memoir on terrestrial magnetism which
I  mentioned to    you in former letters. It would follow from the ma
terials which    I have employed, that the horizontal force requires
constants which differ from those for the vertical force, and the

                                           301
 differences,   although    for the most part not considerable, are some
 times too large,     as   it  appears to me, to be overlooked: it is for
 observers to decide in this matter.             To avoid the introduction of
 insecure numbers I have not computed the potential, but have con
 tented myself with deriving the values of X, Y and Z (declination,
 inclination, and force horizontal and total) being the quantities
principally used for comparison.              A second calculation of the con
stants for X and Y would have given rather more exact values, but
I think that with the existing data the result would. scarcely repay
the labour of so extensive a calculation, for the tables would have to
be entirely recomputed.
    After obtaining the data from the theory, I wished to compare
them with observation.           I could take for the inclination and force
the values which had served as the bases of the calculation; there
are indeed several observations of inclination without our knowing
the force, and a few of the force without inclination; but on the
other hand, there are more extensive districts where I had no declina
tions, although the other two elements were well determined. Under
these circumstances       I was   obliged to have recourse to older observa
tions, which indeed      I had occasion to use also for secular change and
reduction for epoch to 1830.            Thus the character of the work was
gradually modi<U+FB01>ed.         For the Atlantic Ocean I availed myself of your
excellent Memoir, Contributions No. IX.; I only added the obser
vations of Liitke, d’Urville, and Rumker; of older observations, I
took those of Abercrombie and Ekeberg, only using them however
in parts where they had observed the inclination, and principally
with the view of <U+FB01>nding its secular change.
    In the Paci<U+FB01>c there was more de<U+FB01>ciency; with the exception of
what has been furnished by Liitke, d’Urville, the ships of the Prus
sian Merchant Service, and in the neighbourhood of the magnetic
equator by Duperrey, modern voyages scarcely gave me anything;
for Becquerel, in his detailed table*, omits all determinations made
at sea     I therefore took all I could get since the voyages of Byron,
Carteret and Wallis, chie<U+FB02>y from Hansteen's great work, and reduced
to 1830, taking from each observer the mean of all his determina
tions within a space of 5° lat. and 10° long.           I did not allow myself
to exclude any observer, for as all have errors from the ship’s iron,
it might easily happen that a man but little known may have, given
values which are much nearer to the truth than those given by a
celebrated voyager.           A selection is no less objectionable, as it
might easily lead to retaining observations which accord with a
possibly not altogether correct theory, and omitting others, other
wise good, which might depart from it. Moreover, such a full com
parison shows better what may be expected from the observations :
incomplete as are the data they afford, yet, when I arrange the re
maining errors in latitude and longitude, Irarely <U+FB01>nd groups in which
the errors show a certain degree of systematic character over ex
tensive districts, so as to alter the declination or inclination a degree.

     of Alexandria.   In India the few results of Elliot’s given in the

   The author states that, assuming that when a ship is swung com
pletely round, so that her head bears exactly as it did at <U+FB01>rst, the
magnetism of the ship, and that of the compass~needle return to
their original condition, the following theorem is necessarily true :-1—
   The mechanical power developed by the mutual action of the ship and
of the compass-needle during a complete revolution of the ship, is equal
to zero.

    Additional remarks to the foregoing paper.          Received  April 14,
1853.
    In consequence of a suggestion of Professor William Thomson,
the author here investigates the modi<U+FB01>cations required in the formula:
of the previous part of his paper, when the compass-needle produces
by induction a sensible effect on the mutual magnetic action of the
earth and the ship.                           p
    Let A, as in Mr. Archibald Smith’s formula, represent the mean
of the sines of the deviations of thei compass-needle observed during a
complete revolution of the ship.       As there is reason to believe that
this quantity does not vary for a given ship in different parts of the
earth so long as the quantity and distribution of her iron are un
 changed,~ it may be determined, once for all, while in port, in the
usual way.
    When the ship is out of reach of land, lets be the mean of the
 sines, and c the mean of the cosines, of the apparent magnetic azi
muths of a distant object observed during a complete revolution of
 the ship. Then the sine of the true magnetic azimuth of the object
 is given by the formula

      A paper was read, entitled “ A few Remarks on Currents in the
  Arctic Seas.”     'By P. C. Sutherland, M.D.        Communicated by
  Colonel Sykes,            &c.  Received April 16, 1853.
      The author states that, during a voyage lately made in the Arctic
  seas, his attention was arrested by the power exerted by refrigera
  tion and congelation in separating from water any saline ingredients
  it may contain, and of thus causing disturbances in the mean density
  of the waters of the ocean, which, after being in<U+FB02>uenced by cur
  rents, can be overcome only by subsequent intermixture with water
  from other localities where the disturbance in the equilibrium is of
  an opposite character.      He considers that evaporation, which is
  so active within the tropical and temperate zones, obviously renders
  the sea more dense by depressing its surface, and thus gives rise to
  the necessity for currents from the two poles of the earth, where de
  position of vapour predominates to a considerable extent over eva
  poration. This he illustrates by referring to the constant current
  from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, caused by the evaporation
  in this sea preponderating     over the supply of fresh-water.      He
  then points out the necessity also of a current out of this sea, in
  order that its waters, by the constant in<U+FB02>ux of saline matters, may
  not become a saturated solution of the salts of the ocean; and
  infers that counter-currents into the polar seas must also exist to
  obviate the contrary tendency which the waters of these seas have
  to become fresh.      He calls attention to the importance of ascer
  taining the di<U+FB02>'erences that occur in many parts of the surface of
  the ocean in respect to its saline contents, that we may be enabled
  to determine to what extent the currents and counter-currents may
  be in<U+FB02>uenced by the comparative freshness of the iced water _of the
  northern and southern regions, and the’necessary saltness of the
  equatorial and other overheated basins.       On this point, with re
  spect to the Arctic seas, he refers to observations by Dr. Scoresby,
  Sir Edward Parry, and those recorded in tables appended to this
  paper, which have been extracted from the Meteorological Journal
  kept in the North Atlantic and Davis’s Straits during the late voyage
  in the Isabel.
     The author next refers to the remarkable difference occurring in
   the climate of the east and west sides of Davis’s Straits, that of the
  latter being much the colder.     In the absence of thermometric re
  gisters for the west, to compare with those on the east side, he points
-
   out how the appearance of the land and development of plants and
  land animals on the two coasts enable us to determine which has
   the warmer climate.     Looking from the top of Bat<U+FB01>n’s Bay, which
   commands a good view of both shores, the east side at the sea-coast
   has many portions of land free from snow, whereas the opposite, by
  its snowy and icy covering, presents an appearance altogether un
   congenial.    On the former are found a tolerably abundant <U+FB02>ora,
   hares and deer; on the latter, there scarce appears to be a spot to
   receive the roots of plants or the feet of these animals; and in the
   productions of the sea, both vegetable and animal, the same dispro
   portion is met with.     Upon the whole, he considers complete the
   analogy that exists between the North Atlantic and Davis’s Stralts,

                                      306
both with respect to the climate of their shores and to their inhabit
ants of the animal and Vegetable kingdbms.              With reference to
the question how this analogy is brought about, the author Considers
it dif<U+FB01>cult to decide whether the increase in the temperature of the
water and the consequent improvement of the climate, 0n the east
side of the strait, arise from the disposition the ice has to leave the
coast, by which means the water becomes exposed to the in<U+FB02>uence
of the sun; or from currents of heated water from a more southern
region.    He further remarks that its density here cannot be restored,
if once disturbed, without admixture with a large volume of water
somewhat above the mean density.
    Again referring to the observations of Sir Edward Parry and those
recorded in the tables, the author remarks that from these it will be
seen that refrigeration has the effect of precipitating the salts of sea
water; and further, that it appears to him very probable that the
temperature at which water begins to expand by the continued ap
plication of cold is that at which saline and earthy matter begins to
 be precipitated in solutions of the density of sea-water.
    From the immense depth to which icebergs extend in Davis’s
 Straits, and also from their vast number, the author infers that the
 temperature of the water will be kept pretty uniformly the same
 throughout a considerable part of its depth, rarely exceeding +32°,
 except at the surface, where the action of the sun comes into ope
 ration, in which case the water of greatest density from saline con
 tents would aIWays occupy the lowest position.            In illustration of
 his ‘views, he describes experiments on the freezing of sea-water of
 the density 10%, in glass tubes; and from these he infers that, not
 only does congelation precipitate the saline matter in water, but
 refrigeration also at temperatures from 400 down to‘3‘2o. With re->
 ference to the in<U+FB02>uence of the density of the sea-Water on currents,
 he remarks that after the warm season ‘has fairly set in, in the Arctic
 seas, nothing is more common than to observe the surfaceswater,           in
 hollowed out lanes or <U+FB01>ssures of the land-ice, moving slowly towards
 the open water at the edge of the <U+FB01>xed ice; and this seaward mo
 tion is altogether independent of tidal motion or oceanic current,
 depending entirely upon the diminished density of the surface-water.
    In conclusion, the author states that he does not know that we
 are yet in a position to demonstrate the actual existence of currents
 into the icy seas, as well as out of them ; but that the necessity for them
 is obvious.    It is not necessary, he remarks, that these currents, as in
 other parts, should occupy the surface, and probably also the bottom
 of one of the sides of the basins whose waters require to be renewed,
 as the Gulf-stream occupies the east side of the North Atlantic.           It
 is plain that the cold and hot waters of two regions can be exchanged
 by the latter passing underneath the former; and although the arctic
 current from the Greenland sea does not contain much ice to the
 southward of Cape Farewell, it is mere than probable its chiin waters
 pass over a fork of the Gulf-stream, which ultimately sweeps along
 the shores of West Greenland.
    The Society then adjourned to the 26th of May.

       MY    DEAD. Sm,==l notice in the Preceedings of the Royal Society
   for  April 21, a letter from M. Regnault in which some experiments
   of my own are referred to in a manner which I feel does me injus
   tice.    M, Regnault says, " Le nombre trouvé par M. Joule pour la
   chaleur spéci<U+FB01>que de l'air sous pression constante (0'226) est beau
   coup trop faible.     Celui qui résulte de Ines experiences tres nom
   breilses,  et faites dans des circonstences variées, a<U+FB01>n de reconnaitre
  _et  d’éliminer les erreurs constantes, est 0237.”
      Now, in my paper on the airaengine, Phil. Trans. 1852-, part i.
   p. 74, I have given the results of three series of experiments, viz.
   023008, 022674, and 02325, and remark, “ The mean of the three
  fesults is 022977, or nearly 0'23, which we may take as the speci<U+FB01>c
  heat of air at constant pressure determined by the above experiments."
      I had been informed that M. Regnault was working on the spe
  ci<U+FB01>c heat of gases; and on that account did not feel it desirable to
  enter upon the laborious investigation which would haVe been Ira
  quisite in order to add a couple of decimal <U+FB01>gures to the-"numher             I
'had arrived at, and which was suf<U+FB01>cient for the object I had in ViEW,
  viz. to show that the discrepancy between the actual and theoreti
  cal velocity of sound arose from the incorrectness of Delaroche and
  Berard’s determination of the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air (2'67), and not
 from any notable error in my number for the mechanical equivalent,
 of the thermal unit.        Having succeeded in doing this, I calculated
 the Tables 3 and 4 of my paper, using 0238944 for the speci<U+FB01>c heat
 of air under constant pressure.       I feel much grati<U+FB01>ed that the result
 arrived at: by so eminent an experimentelist as M. Regnault con<U+FB01>rms
 the accuracy in the main of the number I adopted.
     I have only to add that Professor Thomson and myself, in pursu
 ing our research on the thermal effects of rushing elastic <U+FB02>uids, are
 following up the views on the relation between mechanical and
 thermal phenomena originated by ourselves ; and we shall feel most
 happy if M. Regnault’s results, in the important line of investiga
                                                                           ’

     2.   “ Experimental    Researches on Vegetation.”         By M. Georges
Ville.       Communicated     by The Earl of Roses, P.R.S.             Received
May       26\
     After stating that it-has often been asked if air, and especially

                           ’       308
azote, contributes to the nutrition of plants; and, as regards the
latter, that this question has always been answered negatively, the
author remarks it is however known that plants do not draw all
their azote from the soil, the crops produced every year in manured
land giving a greater proportion of azote than is contained in the
 soil itself. The question which he has proposed to himself for so
lution is, whence then comes the excess of azote which the crops
 contain, and in a more general manner, the azote of plants, which
 the soil has not furnished?      He divides his inquiry into the three
following parts :-
    First. Inquiry into and determination of the proportion of the
 ammonia contained in the air of the atmosphere.
     Second. Isthe azote of the air absorbed by plants?
    Third. In<U+FB02>uence on vegetation of ammonia added to the air.
     1. The author remarks that since the observation of M. Theodore
 de Saussure, that the air is mixed with ammoniacal vapours, three
 attempts have been made to determine the proportion of ammonia
 in the air: a million of kilogrammes of the air, according to M.
 Grayer, contain 0'333 kil. A2H5; according to Mr. Kemp 3'880
 kil. ; according to M. F résenius, of the air of the day, 0098 kil., and
 of night air, 0'169 kil. He states that he has shown the cause of
 these discrepancies, and proved that the quantity of ammonia con
 tained in the air is 22417 grrns. for a million of kilogrammes of the
 air; and that the quantity oscillates between 17'14 grrns. and
 29'43 grrns.
     2. The author states that though the azote of the air is absorbed by“
 plants, the ammonia of the air contributes nothing to this absorption.
 Not that ammonia is not an auxiliary of vegetation, but the air con
 tains scarcely 0'0000000224, and in this proportion its effects are
 inappreciable.   These conclusions are founded upon a great number
 of experiments in which the plants lived at the expense of the air
 without deriving any thing from the soil. For the present he con
 <U+FB01>nes himself to laying down these two conclusions :--1. The azote
 of the air is absorbed by plants, by the cereals, as by all others.    2.
 The ammonia of the atmosphere performs no appreciable part in the
 life of plants, when vegetation takes place in a limited atmosphere.
  After describing the apparatus by means of which he carried on his
  experiments on the vegetation of plants placed in a soil deprived of
  organic matter, and the manner in which the experiments were con
  ducted, he adduces the results of these experiments in proof of the
  above conclusions.
     3. With reference to the in<U+FB02>uence of ammonia on vegetation, the
  author states that, if ammonia be added to the air, vegetation be
  comes remarkably active.      In the proportion of .4 ten-thousandths
  the in<U+FB02>uence of this gas shows itself at the end of eight or ten days,
  and from this time it manifests itself with a continually increasing
  intensity. The leaves, which at <U+FB01>rst were of a pale-green, assume
  a deeper and deeper tint, and for a time become almost black ; their
  petals are long and upright, and their surface wide and shining. In

                    \
                                    309
short, when vegetation has arrived at its proper period the crop is
found far beyond that of the same plants grown in pure air; and,
weight for weight, they contain twice as much azote. Besides these
general effects there are others which are more variable, which de
pend upon particular conditions, but which are equally worthy of
interest.     In fact, by means of ammonia we can not only stimulate
vegetation, but, further, we can modify its course, delay the action
of certain functions, or enlarge the development and the modi<U+FB01>ca
tion of certain organs.      The author further remarks, that if its use
be ill-directed, it may cause accidents.     Those which have occurred
in the course of his experiments appear to him to throw an unex
pected light upon the mechanism of the nutrition of plants.         They
have at least taught him at the expense of what care ammonia may
become an auxiliary of vegetation.       These experiments, which were,
made under the same conditions as those upon the absorption of
azote, are then described, and their numerical results given.
     To the conclusions already stated, the author adds that there are
periods to be selected for the employment of ammonia, during which
this gas produces different effects.      If we commence its use when
 several months intervene before the <U+FB02>owering season of the plants,
it produces no disturbance; they follow the ordinary course of their
 vegetation. If its use be commenced at the time of <U+FB02>owering, this
 function is stopped or delayed.     The plant covers itself with leaves,
 and if the <U+FB02>owering takes place all the <U+FB02>owers are barren.

 Ascents made under the direction of the Kew Observatory Com
 mittee of the British Association.”       By John Welsh, Esq. Com
 municated by Colonel Sabine, R.A., Treas., V.P.R.S., President of
 the British Association, on the part of the Council of the Association.
                                                                          '
 Received    April  27th, 1853.
     The object contemplated by the Kew Committee in the balloon
  ascents, of which an account is given in this communication,       was
 chie<U+FB02>y the investigation of the variations of temperature and humidity
  due to elevation above the earth’s surface.    Specimens of the air at
  different heights were also obtained for analysis.
     The instruments employed were the barometer, dry- and wet-bulb
                                                                 ‘
  hygrometcr, and Regnault’s condensing hygrometer.
     The barometer was a siphon,~on Gay-Lussac’s construction, with
  out verniers; the upper branch of the siphon being alone observed,
  corrections having been previously determined for inequality of the
  tube at different heights of the mercury.
     Two pairs of dry and wet thermometers were used, one pair having
  their’ bulbs protected from radiation by double conical shades open at
  top and bottom for the circulation of the air, the surfaces being of
  polished silver.    The second pair were so arranged, that. by means
  of an “ aspirator,” a current of air was made to pass over the bulbs
  more rapid than they would be exposed to by the mere vertical
  motion of , the balloon.    The object of this arrangement was to

                                     310
  enable the thermometers to assume with 'more rapidity the tam->
 perature of the surrounding air, and also to diminish the effect of
 radiation, in case the shades should not be a suf<U+FB01>cient protectien,
 especially when the balloon was stationary or rising very slowly.
 The thermometers used were very delicate, the bulbs being cylinders
 about half an inch long and not'more than Tlgth of an inch diameter.
 It was found on trial that when the bulbs were heated 20° above the
 temperature of the air in a room, they resumed their original reading
 in 40 or 45 seconds, when moved through the air at the rate of 5 or
  6 feet in a second.    It is thus probable that any error arising from
 want of sensibility in the thermometers will be small, and in all like
 lihood not more than may be expected frOm other accidental causes.
     The observations were taken at short intervals during the ascent,
it  having been seldom practicable to obtain a regular series in the
  descent.   The intervals were generally one minute, but frequently
 only 30 seconds, so that an observation was for the most part
 recorded every 200 or 300 feet.       All the observations are given in
 detail in the tables accompanying the paper.       They are also given
 in the graphical form in the curves.
     The ascents took place on August 17, August 26, October 21,
 and November 10, 1852, from the Vauxhall Gardens, with Mr.
 C. Green’s large balloon.
     The principal results of the observations may be brie<U+FB02>y stated as
 follows :—
     Each of the four series of observations shows, that the progress
 of the temperature is not regular at all heights, but that at a 'certain
 height (varying on different days) the regular diminution becomes
 arrested, and for the space of about 2000 feet the temperature
 remains constant or even increases by a small amount: it afterwards
 resumes its downward course, continuing for the most part to di
 minish regularly throughout the remainder of the height observed.
 There is thus, in the curves representing the progression of tempe
 rature with height, an appearance of dislocation, always in the same
 direction, but varying in amount from 7° to 12°.
     In the <U+FB01>rst two series, viz. Aug. 17 and 26, this peculiar inter-‘
 ruption of the progress of temperature is strikingly coincident with
 a large and rapid fall in the temperature of the dew-paint. The same
 is exhibited in a less marked manner on Nov. 10. On Oct. 21 a
 dense cloud existed at a height of about 3000 feet; the temperature
 decreased uniformly from the earth up to the lower surface of the
 cloud, when a slight rise commenced, the rise continuing through
 the cloud and to about 600 feet above its upper surface, when the
 regular descending progression was resumed.        At a short distance
 above the cloud the dew-point fell considerably, but the rate of dimi
 nution of temperature does not appear to have been affected in this
 instance in the same manner as in the other series ; the phenomenon
 so strikingly shown in the other three cases being perhaps modi<U+FB01>ed
 by the existence of moisture in a condensed or vesicular form.
     It would appear on the whole that about the principal plane of

                                        311
condensation heat is developed in the atmosphere, which has the
effect of raising the temperature of the higher air above what it
would have been had the rate of decrease continued uniformly from
the earth upWards.
    There are several instances of a second or even a third s'u'dden fall
in the dew-point, but any corresponding variation in the temperature
is not so clearly exhibited, probably owing to the total amount of
moisture in the air being, at low temperatures, so very small that
even a considerable change in its relative amount would produce but
                                                         ‘
a small thermal e<U+FB01>'ect.                                                     .
    As the existence of the disturbance in the regular progression of
temperature now stated rendered it necessary, in order to arrive at
 any approximate value of the normal rate of diminution with height,
to make abstraction of the portion affected by the disturbing cause,
 each series was divided into two sections, the <U+FB01>rst comprising the
 space below the'stratum in which the irregularity existed, and the
 second commencing from the point where the regular diminution of
 temperature was resumed.           It Was then found that the rate of dimi
 nution was nearly uniform within each section, but that it was
 somewhat greater in the lOWer than in the upper sections.
     On taking a mean of both sections for each series, giving each
 section a Value corresponding to its extent, it is found that} the
 number of feet of height corresponding to a fall of one degree Fahr;

 The <U+FB01>rst three values being remarkably coincident, and the last dif
 fering from them by about {3th of the whole.                    ‘

       “
    1.   Further Experiments and Observations on the Properties of
Light.” By Lord Brougham, F.R.S., Member of the Institute of
France. Received May 9, 1853. _
    l. The author considers that Sir Isaac Newton's experiments to
prove that the fringes formed by inflexion and bordering the sha
dows of all bodies, are of different breadths when formed by the
homogeneous rays of different kinds, are the foundation of his theory,
and would be perfectly conclusive if the different rays were equally
bent out of their course by in<U+FB02>exion, for in that case the line joining
the centres of the fringes on opposite sides of the shadow being, as
he found them, of different lengths, the fringes must be of different
breadths.    He found that line to be 317% inch in the red, 11-6 in the
violet of the nearest fringe; $13 in the red, ?17 in the violet of the
second fringe; and these proportions he found to be the same at all
distances of the chart from the hair.     But if the rays are of different
<U+FB02>exibility, if the red, for example, is bent to a greater distance from
its course than the violet, the experiment becomes wholly inconclu
sive; and the line joining the centres may be greater in the red than
in the violet, although the breadths of the two fringes are equal,
or even though the violet fringe may be broader than the red.           I
   2. Avariety of experiments are adduced in the paper to show that
this property of different <U+FB02>exibility exists, which Sir I. Newton had

                                     313
   not remarked.    These experiments are either made with two bodies
   actingjointly on the rays, or with a single body so acting.
      3. When made with two bodies, as sharp edges, these edges
   must be perfectly parallel, and when placed in the axis of the pris
   matic spectrum they form fringes more distant in the red than in
  any other part; least distant in the violet.    The fringes are both
   broadest in the least refrangible rays and most removed ; narrowest
  and least removed in the most refrangible.      They incline from the
  red towards the violet.            I
     4. The same experiment is easily made with a lamp or candle,
  placing a, prism between the <U+FB02>ame and the edges.         This renders
  that exact parallelism of the edges which is required in the experi
  ment with the spectrum, comparatively immaterial; because a con
  siderable inclination of the edges, as at an angle of half a degree or
  more, does not affect the action on the rays in the very small space
  through' which they pass by the edges.
     5. With a single edge, or other body as a hair, the same difference
 in the position, as well as in the breadth of the fringes, is found to
 be observable, though not so manifestly as when two act together on
 the light.   The manner of making the observation most conveniently
 is pointed out.                                                '
     6. These experiments are varied so as to show the various disten
 sions of the disc of a <U+FB02>ame subjected to <U+FB01>exion between two edges,
 according as we regard the various portions of the <U+FB01>ame’s spectrum
 when seen by the prism.        The red part is broadest, and when the
 near approach of the edges to each other divides the disc into two
 with a dark interval between them, that interval is the broadest in
 the least refrangible rays.
     7. The experiments are further varied by using coloured glass
 instead of refracting with a prism.
     8. The same phenomena are found to exist in all the other cases
of <U+FB01>exion as where it is combined with re<U+FB01>exion by the action of
specula, or by the effect of striated surfaces.     There is always the
same difference in the effects produced by the different kinds of
homogeneous light.
     9. The same phenomena are not so easily observed in the internal
fringes, or those of the shadow; but the dark gray line in the axis
of the shadow, having a line of deep black on each side, is found to
vary in breadth and position in the different parts of its length cor
responding to the colours of the spectrum, when a needle or other
small body is placed in that spectrum.
     10; The angle of in<U+FB02>exion is shown to be obtained by taking the
distance at which the internal fringes begin to appear; and the pro
portion of this angle in the red to the same angle in the violet is
ascertained. The de<U+FB02>exion (as deduced from Sir I. Newton’s ex
periments) is much greater than in<U+FB02>exion appears to be. He had
not observed the internal fringes of Grimaldi, to whom, however, he
refers.
     1 1 . The author states that the property in question, the different
<U+FB02>exibility of light, coexists with the other property, whatever it may

                                   314
be, which disposes the different rays in fringes of different hreadths;
but he considcri that the two properties are wholly independent of
each. other.
   12. He thinks there is reason to believe that the dark intervals
behveen the fringes made in white light are only the dark tint of the
adjoining fringes, of which the red of one runs into the violet of the
other.    The greatest care in repeating Sir I. Newton’s experiment,
with the same distances and sizes both of the body and the beam,
leaves little or no doubt of the fringes running- intn each other.   In
homogeneous light it is otherwise; and there appear in that case to
be the intervals, as might be expected from the different <U+FB02>exibility of
the different rays.
    1,3, The fringes made in homogeneous light have a considerable
admixture of colours from the scattered rays; so have the small
spectra by refraction made when a second prism is placed behind a
small hole in the screen, through which hole the rays of the spectrum
made by the first prism are successively passed.
    1.4. The phenomena of <U+FB02>exion by bodies placed in the portion of
the spectrum near the prism, and therefore white, are stated to he
not easily accounted for in any received theory.
    15. The Newtonian hypothesis of the different breadths of the
fringes being caused by the action of <U+FB02>exion extending to different
distances over the different rays, is stated to be insuf<U+FB01>cient to account
for it, and also to account for the different colours in the fringes to
be made by white light. It is considered that the diifetent <U+FB02>exibility
will account for the latter, but not for the different breadths of the
fringes, Without another hypothesis, namely, the di<U+FB01>‘erent ratio of the
force to the distance from the bending body, in different rays,
    16. The entire difference of <U+FB02>exion and refraction is shown from
the different breadths of the fringes, and from their formation upon any
possible hYpothosis being shown to have nothing similar or analogous
in the phenomena of refracticn. though the different <U+FB02>exibility is P11?!
cisely similar to the different refransibility, only applicable inversely
                                                '
to the different rays.                                        .
   17. The relation of the doctrine of interference to the phenomena
of <U+FB02>eXiQ<U+FB02> is considered   ; and it is shown that certain of these phe
nomena are at variance with the doctrine.     This is particularly on
empli<U+FB01>ed     the case of the phenomena observed where bodies acting
               ill
on light are not placed directly opposite to each other, but one be
hind the other.
   18. The same phenomena are adduced to disprove M. Fresnel's
hypothesis, that the phenomena of <U+FB01>exion (termed by him diffraction)
depend entirely on the size of the aperture through which the light
enters,   Three experiments are adduced in disproof of this; the
<U+FB01>rst made   on the aperture when the edges are directly opposite each
other; the second. when the edges are moved to different distances
from each other on    a  line exactly parallel to the rays; the third,
when the edges are moved on a line at any inclination to the rays.
 In both the rm“ and third experiment, the vertical distance of the
edges   (1'.
          a. the aperture) being the same. the breadth as well as the

                                   315
separation of the fringes is found to vary with the distance of the
edges from each other horizontally, or in the direction of the rays.
    2.  “  Researches  on the distribution of the Blood-vessels. &c. in
the   Lungs.“     By James Newton Heale, M.D. Communicated by
J.  Hodgson, Esqu F.R.S-       Received May 20, 1853.
    After referring to the discrepancies in the opinions entertained
by anatomical writers both with respect to the distribution and to
the functions of the blood'vessels with which the, lungs are supplied,
the author states the leading features in which the. observations made
by him di<U+FB01>’er from those which have hitherto been published.         He
<U+FB01>nds that :-.
    1st. The pulmonary artery makes no anastornosis whatever with
any other artery, nor do its own branches anastomose together; its
branches go direct to the airscells, and are there distributed, and tar!
minate as arteries; none of its branches go to any other tissues of
the lungs besides the. air-cells, except some few which perforate the
sub-pleural cellular tissue, and are distributed to the pleura; some of
these also cross the posterior mediastinum beneath the pleura, and
reach the thoracic pleura.
    2ndly. The bronchial (so called) arteries have their own special
distribution, which will be described further on; they do not supply,
in the smallest degree, any portion of the bronchial mucous membrane,
 and they form no sort of communication, either with the pulmonary
 arteries or veins, except as supplying their cellular sheaths, and
 therefore in all probability furnishing their vasa vasorum.
    3rdly. The bronchial mucous membrane is very freely supplied
 with an exceedingly vascular plexus, of a peculiar and very characs
 teristic description, which is found to ramify in every part of the
 bronchial membrane, and which may be traced even as high as the
 trachea. The whole of this plexus is derived from the air-cells, and
 terminates ultimately by means of minute radicles, which form trunks
 and join the pulmonary veins.       No trace whatever of any branches
 of the pulmonary artery, previous to this becnming capillary in the
  air-cells, is found in any part of the bronchial membrane.             '
     4thly. The blood being brought to the airwoells by means of the
 Pulmonary artery, is wholly returned by the pulmonary veins; but
 the trunks of these latter are. formed by the junction of two distinct
 sets of radicles, namely, one set which comprises those which are
 formed from the perimeters of the air-cells (ale. that part of the
 air-cell which is distant from the bronchial tube to which it is
 connected). and which at once form trunks which are visible on the
  surface. of the lungs, and of all the lobules, and especially of the
  surfaces which adjoin the interlobular <U+FB01>ssures; the other set consist
  of those which are derived from the bases of the air-cells, and which
  supply the bronchial membrane, and then terminate by radicles form,-
                                                                           /
  ing trunks, which join the before-.rnentioned set of pulmonary veins;
  and from these conjoined, the larger venous trunks are derived, which
  at length accompany the larger bronchi, and the pulmonary arteries,
  and which <U+FB01>nally terminate in the left auricle of the heart ; so that

                                     316
   the blood brought to the left auricle is formed of that portion which
    comes direct from the air-cells, and that which, after leaving the
/ air-cells, has undergone the further process of distribution on the
    bronchial membrane, and has been the source from whence the
   epithelium and the bronchial mucus have been derived, and may
   therefore be considered as somewhat altered in character from that
   which, coming direct from the air-cells, has not been eXposed to
   such changes.
      5thly. It is possible to inject entirely the pulmonary artery and
   veins, without injecting the bronchial artery or veins ; and it is also
   possible thoroughly to inject the latter without at all injecting the        I
   former; and when that is the case, i. e. the (so called) bronchial
   arteries are injected while the pulmonary vessels are empty, it will
   be found that the bronchial membrane is wholly uninjected, however
   perfectly the (so called) bronchial vessels may have been <U+FB01>lled.
       6thly. By injecting the lung through the pulmonary veins, the
   bronchial membrane becomes thoroughly injected, even before the
   air-cells are so ; on the contrary, when the pulmonary artery is alone
   injected, the air-cells become injected long before the liquid reaches
  the bronchial membrane.         In neither of these cases are the bronchial
   arteries,
           2'.  e. those derived from the aorta or veins which correspond
                                                                          '
   to them,in     the slightest degree injected.           \
      7th1y. The bronchial arteries, which are injected by <U+FB01>lling the
   aorta, terminate in veins, which ramify in the subpleural cellular
   tissue
       ;     the greater part of these, after ramifying on the surface of the
   lung beneath the pleura, pass along the broad band of pleura, which
   extends from the peduncle of the lung to the posterior mediastinum,
   and encloses ‘the root of the lung, and which may be called the
   mesopleura, and the veins then empty themselves into the oesophageal
   veins and other veins in the posterior mediastinum.          It
                                                                is   probable
   also that some terminate in the azygos veins, the jugular veins, the
   diaphragmatic veins, and the venae caves; in short, wherever they
   can meet with      asystemic vein situated conveniently; but they form
   no sort of communication with the pulmonary veins, either in their
                                                                '
   capillaries or their larger trunks.
       Sthly. It is  found that the coats of the lymphatic vessels of the
  lung are supplied by blood-vessels which are derived from the air
  cells, ‘and which terminate in the pulmonary veins, and the distribu
  tion of the blood-vessels on the coats of the lymphatics bears strong
                                                                     a
  resemblance to those distributed on the bronchial membrane.
      The author then describes his apparatus for injection; the sub
  jects injected; and the drawings which accompany his communica
  tion. In conclusion he states, that sufficient has been adduced to
   confute the opinion that there  is    one set of vessels for the nutrition
   of the lung in its ordinary acceptation, and another for the respira
  tory function. Without doubt the bronchial (so-called) vessels and
  the pulmonary are distinct, both as to their distribution and func
  tions; the one being for the purposes of breathing, while the other
  solely supplies the cellular tissue of the organ.

       the    different Media by.which they are re<U+FB02>ected, refracted or ab
       sorbed.”      By Joseph Power, Esq., M.A., Fellow of Clare Hall and
       Librarian of the University of Cambridge,       &c.  Communicatedpby
       the Rev. Jonathan Cape, M.A., F.R.S.         Received May 26, 1853.
          For the train-of thought which suggested the considerations in
      this communication,      the author states that he is more particularly
      indebted to the researches of Professor Draper of New York, con
      tained in his work “ 0n the Organization of Plants,..the Chemical
      effects of the Solar Rays,” &c., his experiments        tending to show
      that the law of action and reaction which prevails so generally in
      other departments of nature is no less true in all the varied pheno
      mena of the sun-beam, so that the latter cannot be re<U+FB02>ected, re
     fracted, much less absorbed, without producing some effect upon the
     recipient medium.         Whilst however he acknowledges the informa
     tion he has received from that work, he differs in opinion with its
     author, as to the necessity of admitting more than one imponlderable,
     being strongly of opinion that all the effects of the solar rays may
     be attributed to some or other of the in<U+FB01>nite variety of undulations    of
     which the universal other is capable, and which, in the case 1of the
     sun-beam, are impressed upon it at the surface of the sun. He cem
     siders that the vis viva, which has its origin in these vibrations, is
     transmitted through the ether, with the velocity of light, in extremely
    minute undulations of different lengtle and periods.         If then a sun
     beam, fraught witha vast variety of such undulations,          be incident
    upon a medium so constituted that particles are capable of vibrating
    in unison, or even in harmonious consonance less perfect than uni
   son, with some or other of the ethereal vibrations of the incident
   beam, it must necessarily happen that one system of vibrations will
   be called into existence by the other according to the laws of Reso
   nance.          He states that there may be a dif<U+FB01>culty in explaining, but
   there can be no doubt of the fact, that the 1158 viva due to such in
   duced vibrations may, like those of heat, become- 1nore or less per
   sistent in the medium, producing at one time the) phenomenon of
   <U+FB01>xed chemical action; at another. that of permanently latent heat,
   at another that of less permanently latent or retarded heat; at anv
   other that of coloration and absorption; at another that of phos
  phogenic action. The remarkable phenomena lately discovered by
  Professor Stokes seem to him to be closely allied to the latter, .diffeb
  ing however in the circumstance that they cease to exist the moment
  the exciting rays are withdrawn. Guided by analogy, he is, however,
  inclined to think that these phenomena will be found hereafter to
 possess some slight though insensible duration, while he regards all
 action which is really momentary as expending itself upon the pass
 ing rays as they emerge in the form of re<U+FB02>ected or refracted rays.
       But all these effects, of whatever kind, the author regards as due
 to one and the same cause, which‘ can be no other than the expen
diture or distribution of the vis viva originally derived from the sun,
and conveyed by the ether.               Such expenditure he considers we may
regard as of two kinds, according as the vis viva is retained by the
      Pnocnnnmos or THE ROYAL Soornrv. Von. VI. No. 97. 22

                                   318
medium,    or transmitted with the emergent rays.         If it be expended
solely upon   the emergent rays,  the vis  viva of the  incident  ray ought
to be exactly equal to the sum of the vires viva: of the re<U+FB02>ected and
refracted rays.     But if it be partly expended on the medium and
partly upon the emergent rays, the vis viva of the incident ray ought
to exceed the vires vivce of the re<U+FB02>ected and refracted rays by a certain
quantity. The object of his present investigation was to take into
account the effect of such supposed excess, in the hope of arriving at
some explanation of the Stokesian phenomena.           The remarkable re
sult he has obtained, that every loss of vis viva will be accompanied
with a diminution of the refractive index, is quite in the direction of
Professor Stokes’s own idea of “ a change of refrangibility,” but
throws no light on the change of period. This the author is inclined
to think is due to an action of the nature of harmonic resonance, and
from some calculations which he has made, he thinks it probable
that the light produced in the Stokesian experiments may be due to
resonant vibrations which are about a major or minor third lower in
pitch than those of the invisible rays producing them.
   The mode of procedure which appeared to the author most likely
to lead to a successful result, was to assume, in the first instance,
the hypothesis that the vis viva is expended solely on the re<U+FB02>ected
and refracted rays, and afterwards to modify, if possible, the steps
of the process so as to adapt them to the hypothesis that a portion
of it is expended on the medium.       In adopting the more simple hy
pothesis, he was much struck by the formulae at which he arrived ;.
for not only did the general law of refraction spring out most unex
pectedly, but the very same expressions for the intensity of the re
<U+FB02>ected rays, which were <U+FB01>rst discovered by Fresnel, and subsequently
veri<U+FB01>ed by the experiments of Brewster and Arago, were an imme
diate consequence of the formulae.        His results however differ in
some particulars-from those of Fresnel.       In the first place, the index
of refraction is not the simple quotient of the velocities of undula
tion, but of those velocities each multiplied by the density of the
ether in the corresponding medium.        In the second place, the vibra
tions of the ethereal particles are performed in the plane of polar
ization, and not perpendicular to that plane, as Fresnel supposed.
Further, the expressions for the intensities of the refracted rays
differ slightly in other respects from those of Fresnel, as given in
Airy’s Tracts.
   The author states that he con<U+FB01>nes his attention to an isotropical
singly refracting medium, though he thinks, if he had more time at
his disposal, he could extend the theory to doubly refracting crystals.
A very simple integration gives him a general expression for the vis
viva of an elementary cycloidal wave, in terms of the amplitude and
the constants of the periodical function.       By help of this he obtains
two equations of cis viva; one for a wave whose vibrations are in
the planes of incidence, and the other for a wave whose vibrations
are perpendicular to that plane, both vibrations being transverse to
the axis of the ray.- By the principle of superposition           these two
equations will hold true simultaneously when the above waves are

                                       319
    regarded  as the components of one and the same wave.        He obtains
    three  other equations between the amplitudes from the simple con
    sideration that a particle situated in the common surface of the two
    media cannot vibrate in more than one way at once.        Of these three
    equations two involve the amplitudes of the <U+FB01>rst component wave,
    and the third those of the second.      The <U+FB01>ve equations serve to de
   termine, in terms of the angle of incidence and the component am
   plitudes of the incident wave, the <U+FB01>ve following quantities, namely,
   the angle of refraction,     the two component amplitudes of the re
   <U+FB02>ected wave, and those of the refracted wave.
       By the aid of the result referred to, that every loss of tie viva is
   always accompanied by a diminution of the refractive index, coupled
   with the general view which he takes of the cause of absorption,
   the author   is enabled   to give an explanation  of Frauenhofer’s  lines,
  and    in general of the lines of absorption in coloured media ; and also
  to explain the phenomena discovered by Sir David Brewster, that
  violet light may exist in the blue spaces, and blue light in the red.
       In the course of the investigation, the altered expressions for the
  intensities of the reflected and refracted rays, so far as they are
  affected by the coef<U+FB01>cient of absorption, are given.      The expressions
 for the intensities of the two component re<U+FB02>ected waves are very
 little affected; but those for the intensities of the two component
 refracted waves are materially altered in value.
      The theory likewise affords an explanation, the <U+FB01>rst the author
 believes that has ever been offered, of the remarkable properties of
 saccharine solutions and of certain crystals, such as right-handed
 and left-handed quartz, which exhibit the phenomenon of circular
 polarization.

      1. “ On the Anatomy and Physiology of Corolylopkora, a contri
bution to our knowledge of the 'l‘ubularian Zoophytes." By George
James Allman, M.D., M.R.1.A., Professor of Botany in the Univer
sity of Dublin, &c.         Communicated     by Professor Edward Forbes,
F.R.S. 8w. Received May 31, [853.
     The author, after pointing out the necessity of giving greater de
<U+FB01>niteness to the terminology employed in the description of the true
zoophytes, proceeds to the anatomical details of Cordylophom, a genus
of Tubulariadw. He demonstrates that Cordylopkora is essentially
composed in all its parts of tWQ distinct membranes enclosing a
cavity, a structure which is common to all the Hydroida.                  For
greater precision in description, he <U+FB01>nds it necessary to give to these
                                                               22*

                                    320
membranes special names, and he therefore employs for the external
the name of ectoderm, and for the internal that of endoderm. Each of
these membranes retains its primitive cellular structure.    In the ecto
derm thread-cells are produced in great abundance ; these are formed
in the interior of the ectodermal cells by a process of endogenous cell
formation, and are afterwards set free by the rupture of the mother
cell.    The thread-cells in a quiescent state are minute ovoid capsules,
but under the in<U+FB02>uence of irritation, an internal sac is protruded by
a process of evagination;       the surface of the evaginated      sac is
furnished with a circle of curved spicula, and from its free extremity
a delicate and long <U+FB01>lament is emitted.        The thread-cells of Cordy
lophora thus closely resemble the
                                       " hastigerous organs " of Hydra.
The polypary is a simple unorganized secretion deposited in layers
from the ectoderm.       In the endoderm, the author points out a di
 stinct and well-developed      glandular structure composed of true
 secreting cells, which are themselves produced in the interior of
 mother-cellsI and elaborate a brown granular secretion which he
 assumes as representing the biliary secretion of the higher animals.
 He describes, as a system of special muscles, certain longitudinal
 <U+FB01>bres, which may be distinctly seen in close connection with the
 inner surface of the ectoderm.        The tentacula are shown to be
 continuous tubes communicating with the cavity of the stomach,
 and thus possess the same essential structure as those of Hydra;
 they are Formed of a direct continuation of the ectodern of the
 polype, lined by a similar continuation of the endoderm.             The
 appearance of transverse septa at regular intervals, which is so very
 striking in these tentacula, must not be attributed to the existence
 of true septa.    It is due to a peculiar condition of the endodermal
 layer, but the author has not been able to give a satisfactory ex
 planation of it. Through the whole of the canal which pervades
 the axis of the stems and branches, a constant though a regular
 rotatory movement is kept up in the contained <U+FB02>uid; this movement
 is not due to the propulsive action of vibratile cilia, and is explained
 by the author as the effect of the active processes going on in the
  secreting cells of the endoderm, processes which can scarcely be
  imagined to take place without causing local alterations in the
  chemical constitution of the surrounding <U+FB02>uid, and a consequent
                                                                   4
  disturbance in its stability.
     The reproductive system of Cordylophora consists of ovoid cap
  sules situated on the ultimate branches at some distance behind the
 polypes; some of these capsules contain ova, others spermatozoa;
 they are plainly homologous with the ovigerous sacs of the marine
  Tubulariadze ; they present a very evident, though disguised medusoid
  structure, having a hollow cylindrical body, whose cavity is conti_
  nuous with that of the polype-stem, projecting into them below, and
  representing the proboscidiform stomach of a Medusa, while a sy
  stem of branched tubes which communicate at their origin with the
  cavity of the hollow organ, must be viewed as the homologues of
  the radiating gastro-vascular    canals, and the proper walls of the
  capsule will then represent the disc. From comparative observations

                                     321
made on other genera of Hydroida, the author maintains the presence
of a true medusoid structure in the <U+FB01>xed ovigerous vesicles of all the
genera he has examined, and he arrives at the generalization,that for
the production of true ova in the hydroid zoophytes, a particular
form of zooid is necessary, in which the ordinary polype-structure
becomes    modi<U+FB01>ed,    and presents,   instead,   a more    or less obvious
medusoid conformation,     Hydra being at present the only genus
which appears to offer an exception to this law“, though the author
believes that the exception is only apparent, and that further obsers'
vations will enable us to refer the reproductive organization of this
zoophyte to the same type with that of Cordylophora and the marine
Hydroida.    The author has satis<U+FB01>ed himself that the ova-like bodies
contained in the capsules 'of Cordg/lophora are true 02m," and not
gemmw'; he has 'demOnstrate'd 'in them a distinct germinal vesicle,
and has witnessed the phenomenon of yelk-cleavage ; and the paper
details the development of the embryo to the period of its escape
from the capsule in'the form of a free-swimming ciliated animacule,
and traces its subsequent progress into the condition of the adult
zoophyte.
    2. “ On the Secular Variation of the Moon’s Mean Motion.”          By
 J. C. Adams, Esq., M.A., F.R.S. 810. Received June 16, 1853.
    The author remarks, that in treating a great problem        approxi
                                                                of_
 mation, such as that presented to us by the investigation of the
 moon’s motion, experience shows that nothing       ismore easy than to
 neglect, on account of their apparent insigni<U+FB01>cance, considerations
 which ultimately prove to be of the greatest importance.        One in
 stance of this occurs with reference to the secular acceleration of the
 moon’s mean motion.      Although this acceleration and the diminu
 tion of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, on which        it
                                                                depends,
 had been made known by- observation as separate facts, yet many of
 the <U+FB01>rst geometers altogether failed to trace any connexion between
 them, and it  was not until he had made repeated attempts to explain
 the phenomenon by other means,’ that Laplace himself succeeded in
                                                                     '
referring it to its true cause.
    The accurate determination of the amount of the acceleration        is
                                                                        a
 matter-of very great importance.      The effect on the moon’s place,
 of an error in any of the periodic inequalities,     isalways con<U+FB01>ned
 within certain limits, and takes place alternately in opposite direc
 tionswithin very moderate intervals of time, whereas the effect of
 an error in the acceleration goes on increasing for an almost inde
 <U+FB01>nite period, so as to render  it  impossible to connect observations
 made at very distant times.
    In the ‘Mécanique Céleste,’ the approximation to the value of
 the acceleration is  con<U+FB01>ned to the principal term, but in the theories
 of Damoiseau and Plana, the developments are carried to an im
 mense extent, particularly in the latter, where the multiplier of the
 change in the square of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, which
 occurs in the expression of the secular acceleration,    given to terms
                                                           is
of the seventh order.

                                    322
    As these theories agree in principle, and only differ slightly in the
numerical value which they assign to the acceleration, and as they
passed under the examination of Laplace, with especial reference
to this subject, it might be supposed that only some small numerical
recti<U+FB01>cations   would be required in order to obtain a very exact
determination of this value.
    It has not been, therefore, without surprise, which he has no
doubt will be shared by the Society, that the author has lately found
that Laplace’s explanation of the phenomenon in question is essen
tially incomplete, and that the numerical results of Damoiseau's and
Plana’s theories, with reference to it, consequently require to be very
sensibly altered.
    Laplace’s explanation may be brie<U+FB02>y stated as follows. He shows
that the mean central disturbing force of the sun, by which the
moon’s gravity towards the earth is diminished, depends not only
on the sun's mean distance, but also on the eccentricity of the
earth’s orbit.     Now this eccentricity is at present (and for many
ages has been) diminishing, while the mean distance remains unal
 tered.    In consequence of this, the mean disturbing force is also
diminishing, and therefore the moon’s gravity towards the earth at
a given distance is, on the whole, increasing.         Also the area de
scribed in a given time by the moon about the earth is not affected
by this alteration of the central force; whence it readily follows
that the moon's mean distance from the earth will be diminished in
the same ratio as the force at a given distance is increased, and the
mean angular motion will be increased in double the same ratio.
    This, the author states, is the main principle of Laplace’s analytical
method, in which he is followed by Damoiseau and Plana; but it
will be observed that this reasoning supposes that the area described
by the moon in a given time is not permanently altered, or in other
words, that the tangential disturbing force produces no permanent
 effect.    On examination, however, he remarks it will be found that
 this is not strictly true, and he proceeds brie<U+FB02>y to point out the
 manner in which the inequalities of the moon’s motion are modi<U+FB01>ed
 by a gradual change of the disturbing force, so as to give rise to
                                                I '
 sucbpan alteration of the areal velocity.
    As an example, he takes the case of the variation, the most direct
 effect of the disturbing force.     In the ordinary theory, the orbit of
 the moon, as affected by this inequality only, would_be symmetrical
 with respect to the line of conjunction with the sun, and the areal
 velocity generated while the moon was moving from quadrature to
 syzygy, would be exactly destroyed while it was moving from
 syzygy to quadrature, so that no permanent alteration would be
                     '
 produced.
     In reality, however, the magnitude of the disturbing force by
 which this inequality is caused, depends in some degree on the ec
 centricity of the earth’s orbit ; and as this is continually diminishing,
 the disturbing forces at equal intervals before and after conjunction
  will not be exactly equal. Hence the orbit will no longer be sym
  metrically situated with respect to the line of conjunction, and there

                                    323
fore the effects of the tangential force before and after conjunction
no longer exactly balance each other.
    The other inequalities of the moon’s motion will be similarly mo
di<U+FB01>ed, especially those which depend, more directly, on the eccen
tricity of the earth’s orbit, so that each of them will give rise to an
uncompensated change of the areal velocity, and all of these must
be combined in order to ascertain the total effect.
    Since the distortion of the orbit just pointed out is due to the
change of the disturbing force consequent upon a change in the
eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, and the actiOn of the tangential
force permanently to,change the rate of description of areas, is only
brought into play by means of this distortion, it follows that the
alteration of the areal velocity will be of the order of the square of
the disturbing force multiplied by the rate of change of the square
of the eccentricity. It is evident that this alteration of areal velocity
will have a direct effect in changing the acceleration of the moon’s
mean motion.
    Having thus brie<U+FB02>y indicated the way in which the e<U+FB02>'ect now
treated of originates, the author proceeds with the analytical inves
tigation of its amount.     In the present communication, however, he
proposes to con<U+FB01>ne his attention to the principal term of the change
 thus produced in the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion, de
ferring to another, though he hopes not a distant opportunity, the
fuller treatment of this subject, as well as the determination of the
 secular variations of the other elements of the moon’s motion,
which, arising from the same cause, have also been hitherto over
Icoked.
    In the usual theory, the reciprocal of the moon’s radius vector is
 expressed by means of a series of cosines of angles formed by com
binations of multiples of the'mean angular distance of the moon
 from the sun, of the mean anomalies of the moon and sun, and of
 the moon’s mean distance from the node; and the moon's longitude
 is expressed by means of a series of sines of the same angles, the co
 ef<U+FB01>cients of the periodic terms being functions of the ratio of the
sun’s mean motion to that of the moon, of the eccentricities of the
two orbits and of their mutual inclination.
    Now, if the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit be supposed to remain
constant, this is the true form of the expressions for the moon’s c0
ordinates ; but if that eccentricity be variable, the author shows that
the differential equations cannot be satis<U+FB01>ed without adding to the
expression for the reciprocal of the radius Vector, a series of small
supplementary terms depending on the sines of the angles whose
cosines are already involved in it, and to the expression for the lon
gitude, a series of similar terms depending on the cosines of the same
angles; all the coef<U+FB01>cients of these new terms containing as afactor
the differential coef<U+FB01>cient of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit
taken with respect to the time.
    The author <U+FB01>rst determines as many of these terms as are neces
sary in the order of approximation to which he restricts himself, and
then takes them into account in the investigation of the secular ac

                                            3‘24
celeration.  The expression which he thus obtains                          for the <U+FB01>rst two
terms of this acceleration, is

   In conclusion, the author states, that the existence of the new
terms in the expression of the moon’s coordinates occurred to him
some time since, when he was engaged in thinking over a new me
thod of treating the lunar theory, though he did not then perceive
their important bearing on the secular equation.     His attention was
<U+FB01>rst directed to this subject while endeavouring to supply an omis
‘sion in the Theory of the Moon given by Pontécoulant in his
‘
  Théorie Analytiquc.’     In this valuable work, the author, follow
ing  the  example— originally set by Sir J. Lubbock in his tracts on
the lunar theory, obtains directly the expressions for the'rnoon’s
coordinates in terms of the time, which are found in Plana’s theory
by means of the reversion of series. With respect to the secular
acceleration of the mean motion; however, Pontécoulant unfor
tunately adopts Plana’s result without examination.       On perform
ing the calculation requisite to complete this part of the theory,
the author was surprised to <U+FB01>nd that the second term of the expres
sion for the secular acceleration thus obtained, not only differed
totally in magnitude from the corresponding term given by Plana,
but was even of contrary sign.
                      a              His previous researches, however,
 immediately led him to suspect what was the origin of this discord
 ance, and when both processes were corrected by taking into account
the new terms whose existence he had already recognized, he had
the satisfaction of <U+FB01>nding perfect agreement between the results.

   The memoir consists of four sections.      In the <U+FB01>rst section, the
theory of the residues obtained by applying the process of the common
measure to two algebraical functions     discussed. isIt shown that            is
            |

                                    325               ~
a certain super<U+FB02>uous or allotrious factor enters into each, the value
of which, in terms of the leading coe<U+FB01>icients of the residues in their
simpli<U+FB01>ed form, is determined; and the simpli<U+FB01>ed residues them
selves are subsequently obtained from the given functions by a di
rect method.
     In the case where the two functions are of the same degree (m)
in .z', m functions of the degree m—l in x are formed, which, being
identical with those employed in the process which goes by the name
of Bezout’s abridged method, the author terms the Bezoutics or
Bezoutic primaries.     By linear elimination performed between these,
a second system of functions, whose degrees in to extend from
m—l to O, are formed, which he terms the Bezoutic secondaries:
these Bezoutic secondaries are preved to be identical with the sim
pli<U+FB01>ed residues.      A similar theory is shown to be applicable in the
general case of the functions being of unlike degrees. Other modes
of obtaining the simpli<U+FB01>ed residues by a direct method are also given.
 The coef<U+FB01>cients of the primary system 'of Bezoutics form a square“
 symmetrical about one axis, to which (as to every symmetrical ma
 trix) a certain homogeneous quadratic function of (m) variables is
 appurtenant. This quadratic function is termed the Bezoutiant, the
 properties of which are discussed in the fourth section.
      Every residue is what may be termed a syzygetic function or con
junctive of the two given functions; these being respectively multi
 plied by certain appropriate rational integral functions, their sum
 may be made to represent a residue.        These multipliers are termed
 the syzygetic multipliers;     and they form two series, one corre
 sponding to the successive numerators, the other to the successive
 denominators of the convergents to the algebraical continued frac
 tion which expresses the ratio of the two given functions.          The
 residues are obviously a particular class of the conjunctives that can
 be formed from the given functions ; every conjunctive has the pro
 perty of vanishing when the two functions to which it is appurtenant
 vanish simultaneously ; and in general, for any given degree in w, an
 in<U+FB01>nite number of such conjunctives can be formed.
      In the second section, the author commences with obtaining in
 terms of the roots and factors of the two given functions, a variety
  of forms, all containing arbitrary forms of function in their several
  terms, and representing a conjunctive of any degree not exceeding
  the sum of the degrees of the two given functions in its most general
  form.    The author then reverts to the Bezoutic system of the <U+FB01>rst
  section, and obtains the general solution for the conjunctive of any
  given degree in a: in terms of the coe<U+FB01>icients of the given function;
  by aid of this general solution he demonstrates that the residues ob
  tained by the common measure process (divested of their allotrious
  factors), are the conjunctives of the lowest weight in the roots of the
  given functions for their several degrees; and obtains the value’of
  this weight.    He then demonstrates that certain rational but frac.
   tional forms ascribed to the arbitrary functions in the general ex
  pressions for a conjunctive in terms of the roots, will make these
   expressions integral and. of the rninimum'weight; they will all be

                                    326
 consequently identical (save as to a numerical factor) with one an
 other, and with the simpli<U+FB01>ed residues.      The formulae thus obtained
 for the simpli<U+FB01>ed residues deserve particular attention on their own
 account, being double sums of terms, any single series of which is
 made up of fractions whose denominators are the products of the
 differences between a certain number of the roots of each one of the
 functions and a certain other number of the same combined in every        7
 possible manner, thus containing a vast extension of the ordinary
 theory of partial fractions.      The author subsequently determines
 under a similar form, the value of each of the multipliers which con
 nects the given functions syzygetically with the simpli<U+FB01>ed residues,
 and establishes a general theorem of reciprocity, by aid of certain
 general properties of continued fractions, between the series of resi
 dues and either series of syzygetic multipliers.
    The third 'section is divided into two parts.    The first part is de~
 voted to a determination of the values of the preceding formulae in
.the case to which Sturm’s theorem refers, where one of the given
 functions is the <U+FB01>rst differential derivative of the other ; when this is
 the case the roots and factors of the second function are functions of
 those of the <U+FB01>rst, and it will be found that one of the polymorphic
 representations for the residue of any given degree will consist of
 terms, each of which is convertible into an integral function of the
 roots and factors of the given primitive function; in this way are
 obtained the author’s well-known formulae for Sturm’s auxiliary
 functions. In like manner, the multiplier which affects the deri
 vative function in the syzygy between the primitive, the derivative
 and any simplified residue,may also be expressed immediately as a sum
 of integral functions of the roots and factors of the primitive, com
 plementary in some sort to the formulae for the residues.       The for
 mula for the remaining syzygetic multiplier, (that which attaches to
 the primitive itself,) cannot be obtained directly by a similar method,
 but it is deduced by aid of the syzygetic equation itself, all the
 other of the <U+FB01>ve terms of which are known, or have been previously
 determined.     The process of obtaining this last-named multiplier is
 one of great peculiarity and interest, and results in a form far more     '
 complex than that for the residues orfor the othersyzygetic multiplier.
    In the second part of the third section are contained some curious
 and valuable expressions for the residues and multipliers, communi
 cated to the author by M. Hermite; and an instantaneous demon
 stration is given of the properties of the author’s formulm for Sturm’s
 auxiliary functions in determining the real roots of an equation by a
 method quite irrespective of the theory of the common measure, and
 depending upon a certain extremely simple but unobserved law of
 quadratic forms, which he terms the law of inertia.     In place of these
 formulae it is shown that others greatly more general, and possessing
 the same properties as regards the determination of the real roots,
 may be substituted; the known formulae are, however, the most
 simple that can be employed.       The author then proceeds to inquire
 as to the nature of the indications afforded by the signs of a series
 of successive simpli<U+FB01>ed residues, taken between any two functions

                                   327
independent of one another, instead of standing in the relation of
primitive and derivative, as in Sturm’s theorem; this leads to the
theory of interpositions, of whch it is shown that,the Sturmian
theorem may be treated (not so much as a particular case) as an
easy corollary.     In this part, the author obtains an entirely new
rule for determining, in an in<U+FB01>nite variety of ways, a superior and
inferior limit to the real roots of any algebraical equation, whether
numerical or literal.
    The fourth section is also divided into two parts. In the <U+FB01>rst
part, the index of interposition for two functions of the same degree
is shown to be determinable by means of the quadratic form, pre
viously termed the Bezoutiant; and as a corollary, it follows that
the number of real roots of an equation of the degree m depends in a
 direct manner on the number of positive roots in another equation
 of the degree m-l, all of whose roots are real, and the coef<U+FB01>cients
 of which are quadratic combinations of the coef<U+FB01>cients of the given
 equation.
    In the second part of this section, the Bezoutiant is considered
 under a purely morphological point of view.          It is shown to be
 a combinantive invariant of the two given functions (each treated
 as homogeneous      functions of two variables), remaining unaltered
 when any linear combination of the two given functions is substi
 tuted for the functions themselves, and also when any linear substi
 tutions are impressed upon the variables of the given functions, pro
 vided that certain corresponding     substitutions are impressed‘upon
 the variables of the Bezolitiant.    The family of forms to which the
 Bezoutiant belongs is ascertained, and a method given for <U+FB01>nding
 the constituent forms of this family (one less in number than the
 number of odd integers not exceeding in magnitude the degree of
 either of the given functions which, throughout this section, are
 supposed to be of equal dimensions in w), of which all other forms of
 the family will be numerico-linear functions.     The numerical coe<U+FB01>i
 cients connecting the Bezoutiant with this constituent group, are
 calculated for the cases corresponding to any index from I to 6 in
 elusive.   Finally, the author remarks upon the different directions
 in which the subject matter of the ideas involved in Sturm’s
 justly celebrated theorem admits of being expanded, and of which
  the most promising is, in his opinion, that which leads through the
 theory of interpositions.    Several of the theorems in this memoir
 have been previously published by the author, but they are here given
 along with a great deal of new matter in a connected form, and with
 the demonstrations annexed, for the <U+FB01>rst time.

     4.             frequent occurrence of Indigo in Human Urine,
  and on its Chemical and Physiological Relations.”       By Arthur Hill
  Hassall, M.D., Physician to the Royal Free Hospital, 810.        Com
  municated by Professor Sharpey, F.R.S.        Received June 9, 1853.
     The author was led to the investigations laid before the Society
  in the above communication, by the following circumstances :—
     Some three or four years since, when examining urinary deposits

                                    828
under the microscope, he frequently observed in the <U+FB01>eld of vision
particles of a deep blue colour; so often did this occur, that he
 could not even then help suspecting that their presence was not ac
 cidental; however, no analysis of the blue colouring matter was
 made at that time, and the circumstance was in a fair way of being
forgotten, until the recollection of it was revived by another oc
currence.
    In June 1852, a sample of urine, freely exposed to the air in an
 open vessel, was observed after four or <U+FB01>ve days’ exposure, gradually
to change colour; the pellicle or scum which had formed upon the
 surface of the urine became <U+FB01>rst slate-coloured, and at length deep
blue, with here and there a rusty-red tint.       The urine also under
went at the same time some remarkable changes; it became thick
and turbid, deep brown, greenish, bluish-green, and * <U+FB01>nally of a
faded yellowish-green colour; a considerable sediment was found
at the bottom of the glass; this was deep brown, intermixed with a
little blue colouring matter, and it had a medicinal smell resembling
somewhat that of Valerian.      In this state, without undergoing any
further material changes, the urine remained for many days.
    Examined with the microscope, the scum or pellicle on the sur
face was found to consist of vibriones, innumerable animaleules, and
crystals of triple phosphate, with a great many fragments and gra
nules of a deep and bright blue colour.
    A second sample of the same urine was therefore procured, taking
every-precaution   to avoid fallacy.   Gradually the same changes en
sued as in the <U+FB01>rst sample, and this likewise became blue.      Having
thus ascertained that the changes observed were due to something
contained in the urine itself, the author next proceeded to set aside
in open vessels, a series of urines all from the same patient, noting
the alterations which occurred from day to day; these samples
underwent nearly similar changes; but the quantity of blue colour      ‘
ing matter and brown extractive gradually diminished, until at length
they were present in such small amount as to be visible only under
the microscope, and at last they entirely disappeared.
    The results obtained from an examination of the urine, the blue
colouring matter and the brown extractive, are then given by the
author; they are as follow   :-
    The Mina—The urine of the second sample at the time of analysis,
when shaken, had a dark, greenish-brown colour; but on standing
at rest for some time, the colouring matter fell to the bottom, form
ing bluish-green <U+FB02>occuli, while the supernatant liquid was of a
deep wine-red colour. The bottle was set aside corked, for ten days,
at the end of which time the bluish-green precipitate had entirely
disappeared; but on removing the cork, and allowing free access of
air for some time, the coloured deposit was again produced. This
was washed with water, drenched with hydrochloric acid, and <U+FB01>nally
dried; by this means was obtained a rich blue powder possessing all
the chemical characters and properties of indigo.
    The-urine that ‘was <U+FB01>ltered off from the above precipitate was
allowed to evaporate spontaneously, by which means it yielded an

                                   329
additional quantity of indigo, which adhered in the form of very
small <U+FB02>akes to the sides of the dish.      It also gave a rather large
proportion of a deliquescent brown colouringmatter,          which was
treated, <U+FB01>rst with alcohol, and then with water.
    The alcohol acquired a deep brownish-red colour, and the water a
dark brownish-green. Both of these solutions were evaporated at a
temperature of 160° Fahr.       The alcoholic solution furnished a rich
brown extractive which was soluble in water, but not in dilute acids,
and, nitric acid did not produce that play of colours which is cha
racteristic of bile pigment; nor did the precipitate formed with basic
acetate of lead furnish a purple liquid with alcohol and free acid.   A
strong solution of potash dissolved the extractive and yielded a deep
blood-red <U+FB02>uid, which was rendered green and opalescent by boiling.
These reactions show that the brown pigment was somewhat like
haematin in its chemical manifestations.
    While the aqueous solution of the brown matter was undergoing
 evaporation,,it gave a further supply of indigo, which was formed
 most freely at the edge of the liquid,    The residue was made black
 by concentrated sulphuric acid and deep brown by potash.
    The blue colouring matter.—~Of two samples of this in a dry state,
 mixed with a large quantity of earthy phosphates, vibriones, mucus,
 and epithelium, one gave a dark brown solution with concentrated
 sulphuric acid, and the other a dirty blue.    Both of these solutions
 were decomposed by water, furnishing in the former case a dark
 brown deposit, and in the latter a dirty green.       In most of their
 other reactions, however, they presented the characters of indigo;
 and it is especially deserving of notice, that they were reduced by
 lime and sugar, giving a liquid from which hydrochloric acid threw
 down a greenish-blue precipitate.                        ,
    The cause of concentrated sulphuric acid giving with one of these
 samples a brown solution, and with the other only a dirty blue, was,
 the author considers, mainly owing to the large quantity of animal
 matter with which the specimens were contaminated; the acid, from
 its charring effect on this, would produce a brown or blackish solu
 tion, thus obscuring the colour of the solution of indigo.
     The brown extractive—The     brown extractive yielded nearly the
 same results as on its <U+FB01>rst analysis, and the aqueous solution fur
 nished a few blue <U+FB01>occuli.     A portion of the alcoholic extract was
 heated with Liq. Potassae for the purpose of ascertaining whether it
 contained leucine, and the product, on being treated with hydro
 chloric acid, gave off a powerful odour, which was somewhat like
 valerianic acid; but the result was too doubtful to be of much value.
 The author had already referred to the peculiar smell of Valerian
 emitted by the extractive of more than one of the samples. He con
 siders that the clearest and most positive evidence was thus obtained
 that the blue colouring matter in this case was indigo.
     It was not very long after the occurrence of the <U+FB01>rst case of blue
 urine that numerous other instances fell under the author's observa_
 tion.   The urines of all these cases underwent very nearly the same
 changes as in the <U+FB01>rst; in some, the quantity of blue colouring mat

                                        330
     ter found was very considerable, in others less; and in the third
‘
     class of cases the microscope was necessary for its discovery.       In
    nearly all these cases the blue colouring matter was submitted to
     analysis, and ascertained, on the clearest evidence, to be indigo.
         The author in the next place considers the question of the source
                                          '
    and origin of indigo in the urine.
         It appeared that in the cases related by the author, coloured
    indigo was not present in urine when <U+FB01>rst Voided, but that it was
    gradually formed some time afterwards by a process of oxidation on
    exposureto the air, being in most of the cases probably derived from
    the brown extractive, which in its chemical manifestations so closely
    resembles haematin.
         The author contrasts cyanourine with the indigo detected in urine.
    He observes that the most distinctive tests’laid down for cyanourine
    are its solubility in boiling alcohol, and the action of sulphuric acid
    upon it, which give a reddish-brown solution; and states he had
    ascertained that these tests are not to be relied upon, since indigo,
    when contaminated (as in the urine it frequently is) with a large
    quantity of animal matter, vibriones, &c., gives a/reddish-brown so
   lution with concentrated sulphuric acid, from the charring of the
   animal matter, and in many cases forms a bright blue solution with
   boiling absolute alcohol; hence he could not help suspecting that
   cyanourine and indigo are very closely connected with each other,
   if they be not identical. He observes, it is at least singular that
   while so many cases of indigo were met with, not a single instance
   of cyanourine presented itself.      He also contrasts indigo with apo
   glaucin, and remarks that this is acknowledged by Heller himself to
   be nothing more than cyanourine mixed with urrhodin.
     -Taking then into consideration the whole of the facts described
   in this communication, the following'conc-lusions are deduced :—
        lst. That blue indigo is frequently formedin human urine, the
   quantity being subject to the greatest variation; in some cases it is
   so considerable as to impart a deep green, or 'biuish-green colour
   to the whole urine; a pellicle of nearly pure indigo also extending
   over the entire surface of the liquid; while in others it is so small
  that it can only be detected by means of the microscope.
       2nd. That for the formation of this indigo, it is in general neces
  sary that the urine should be exposed to the’air for some'days in an
  open vessel, oxygen being absorbed and the blue indigo developed.
  Whatever facilitates therefore oxygenation, as free exposure to light
  and air, warmth and sunshine, hastens the appearance of the blue
  indigo; hence in summer the changes described take place much
  more quickly than in winter; on the contrary, these changes are re
  tarded and even stayed by exclusion of the atmosphere.       Blue indigo
  may even be deprived of its colour and reformed, alternately, accord
  ing as air is excluded or admitted to urine containing it. From some
  of the cases recorded, it would appear, however, that blue indigo is
  occasionally formed in the system, and is voided as such in the
 urine.
       3rd.  That there is usually found with the blue indigo, where the

                                    331
amount of this is considerable, a brown extractive, sometimes in
large quantity, the aqueous solution of which, by exposure to air,
yields a further supply of coloured indigo, and which closely re
sembles haematin in its chemical manifestations and elementary com
position. There is therefore great reason for believing that in the
majority of the cases here recorded, the blue indigo was derived
from altered haematin, although it-is at the same time probable, that
 in some cases it is formed from modi<U+FB01>ed urine pigment which is
itself supposed to be a modi<U+FB01>cation of haematin. Between the greater
number of the animal colouring matters there is the closest relation
 ship in, chemical composition, so that the transformation of the one
into the other would appear to be both easy and natural.
     4thly. That the urines in which the Coloured indigo occurs in the
 largest quantity, are usually of a pale straw colour, readily beco
 ming turbid, alkaline, and of low speci<U+FB01>c gravity. Small quantities
 of indigo are however frequently found in urines possessing charac
 ters the very reverse, that is, in such as are high-coloured, acid, and
 of high speci<U+FB01>c gravity; but, as a rule, in these urines the blue pig
 ment is usually absent.
     5thly. That as coloured indigo does not occur in healthy urine,
 and since where the amount of this is at all considerable it is ac
 companied with strongly-marked symptoms of deranged health, the
 formation of blue indigo in urine must be regarded as a strictly
 pathological phenomenon, apparently associated rather with some
 general morbid condition, than essentially with disease of any one
 organ; although there is reason for believing that the blue deposit
 is met with very frequently in Bright’s disease, and in affections of
 the organs of respiration, it should however be remarked that none
 of the worst cases of indigo in the urine which the author met with
 were cases of Bright’s disease.
     The paper is illustrated by drawings, and a specimen of the indigo,
 as deposited from urine, was exhibited.
     5. “On   the Thermal Effects of Elastic Fluids.”       By Professor
 William Thomson, F.R.S.,      and  J. P. Joule, Esq., F.R.S.  Received
 June 15, 1853.
     The authors had already proved by experiments conducted on a
  small scale, that when dry atmospheric air, exposed to pressure, is
  made to percolate a plug of non-conducting porous material, a de
 pression of temperature takes place increasing in some proportion
 with the pressure of the air in the receiver.     The numerous sources
  of error which were to be apprehended in experiments of this kind
 conducted on a small scale, induced the authors to apply for the
 means of executing them on a larger scale; and the present paper
 contains the introductory part of their researches with apparatus
 furnished by the Royal Society, comprising a force pump worked by
  a steam~engine and capable of propelling 250 cubic inches of air per
  second, and a series of tubes by which the elastic <U+FB02>uid is conveyed
  through a bath of water, by which its temperature is regulated, a
  <U+FB02>ange at the terminal permitting the attachment of any nozle which
 is desired.

                                  332
   Preliminary experiments were made in order to illustrate the ther
mal phenomena which result from the rush of air through a single
aperture.   Two effects were anticipated, one of heat arising from
the vis viva of air in rapid motion, the other of cold arising from
dilatation of the gas and the consequent conversion of heat into me
chanical effect.   The latter was exhibited by placing the bulb of a
very small thermometer close to a small ori<U+FB01>ce through which dry
atmospheric air, con<U+FB01>ned under a pressure of 8 atmospheres, was
permitted to escape.    In this case the thermometer was depressed
13° Cent. below the temperature of the bath. The former effect was
exhibited by causing the stream of air as it issued from the ori<U+FB01>ce
to pass in a very narrow stream between the bulb of the theer_
meter and a piece of gutta percha tube in which the latter was en
closed.   In this experiment, with a pressure of 8 atmospheres, an
elevation of temperature equal to 23° Cent. was observed. The same
phenomenon was even more strikingly exhibited by pinbhing the
rushing stream with the <U+FB01>nger and thumb, the heat resulting there
from being insupportable.
   The varied effects thus exhibited in the “rapids” neutralize one
another at a short distance from the ori<U+FB01>ce, leaving however a small
cooling effect, to ascertain the law of which and its amount for
various gases, the present researches have principally been insti~
tuted. A plug of cotton wool was employed, for the purpose at once
of preventing the escape of thermal effect in the rapids, and of me
chanical effect in the shape of sound.     With this arrangement a
depression of 0°‘3l Cent. was observed, the temperature of the dry
atmospheric air in the receiver being 14°‘5 Cent., and its pressure
344 lbs. on the square inch, and the pressure of the atmosphere
being 14'? lbs. per square inch.                                     .

and Physics of T rin. Coll. Dublin.     Communicated    by S. Hunter
Christie, Esq., M.A., Sec. R.S. 8w. Received May 2, 1853.‘
   The author begins his investigations byiproving the existence of
principal aies for any point of a body, which he makes to depend ’on
the existence of principal axes of an auxiliary ellipsoid (Poinsot’s
central one) having its centre at the given point, and such that any
semidiameter of it is reciprocally proportional to the radius of gyra
tion of the body about that semidiameter.
   I—Ie afterwards employs another ellipsoid (called M“Cullagh’s ellip
soid of inertia) concentric to the former and reciprocal to it, which
admirably suits and facilitates the remainder of his investigations,
and whose characteristic property is this, that it gives the radius of
gyration itself (and not its reciprocal, as in Poinsot’s) about any
semidiameter of  it, the.radius of gyration being in fact equal to the
portion of that semidiameter between the centre and tangent plane
                                                        a

moments of inertia. of the body, and M its moment about OP. And
if l\l°Cullagh's ellipsoid of inertia be taken having 0 its centre, and
its principal axes coinciding in direction with the principal axes of
the body‘at O ; and if a tangent plane to this ellipsoid perpendicular

proportional to their masses,",the truth of which            very easily in           is
ferred from lvory's theorem.       This proposition      then employed in       is
proving that the expressions already found for the attractions of a
body of any shape on a very remote point hold true likewise for the

             the Change of Refrangibility of Light.”—No. II.    By
 Professor Stokes, M.A.,   .R.S. Received June 16, 1853..

   The principal object of this paper    to explain  mode of obser
                                                                 is                   a
 vation by means of which the author found that he could exhibit,
 with ordinary day-light, the change of refrangibility produced by
 substances opake as well as transparent, even when they possessed
   Pnocnsmnos or was ROYAL Socin'nr.         VOL. Vl. No. 98. 23

only   a low degree of sensibility.    The method requires hardly any
apparatus;    it is extremely  easy in execution; and it has the great
advantage of rendering the observer independent of sun-light.         On
these accounts the author conceives that it might be immediately
applied by chemists to the discrimination between di<U+FB02>‘erent sub
stances.    The method is as follows :
    A large hole, which ought to be several inches in diameter, cut in
the window-shutter of a darkened room, serves to introduce the light,
and a small shelf, blackened on the top, attached to the shutter im
mediately underneath the hole, serves to support the objects to be
examined, as well as one or two absorbing media.           The hole is
covered by an absorbing medium, called by the author the principal
absorbent, which is so selected as to let through, as far as may be,
the feebly illuminating rays of high refrangibility, as well'as‘v the in;
visible rays still more refrangible, but to stop the rays belonging to
the greater part of the visible spectrum.      A second medium, called
by the author the complementary absorbent, is chosen so as to be as
far as possible transparent with regard to those rays which the <U+FB01>rst
medium stops, and opake with regard to those which it lets through.
The object to be examined is placed on the shelf, and viewed through
the second medium.        If the media be well-selected, they together
 produce a very fair approach towards perfect darkness; and if the
 object appears unduly luminous, that arises in all probability from
 “ <U+FB02>uorescence.”      To determine whether the illumination be really
 due to that cause, it is commonly suf<U+FB01>cient to remove the comple
 mentary absorbent from before the eyes to the front of the hole,
 when the illumination, if it be really due to <U+FB02>uorescence, almost
 wholly disappears; whereas, if it be due merely to scattered light
 which is able to get through both media, it necessarily remains the
 same as before.      In the case of objects which are only feebly <U+FB02>uo
 rescent, it is sometimes better to leave the second medium in its
 place, and use a third medium, called by the author the transfer
medium, which is placed alternately in the path of the rays incident
 on the object-end of the rays coming from it to the eyes.
    Independently of illumination, the change of colour corresponding
 to the change of refrangibility, and the difference of colour with
 which the object appears, according. as the transfer medium, or the
 complementary absorbent used as a transfer medium, is held in front
of the eyes or in front of the hole, afford in most cases a ready mode
 of detecting <U+FB02>uorescence.        ‘
    Instead of trusting to the absolute appearance of the object, it is
 commonly better to compare it with some <U+FB01>xed standard.              The
 standard substance ought to be such as to scatter freely visible rays
 of all refrangibilities, but not to give out rays of one refrangibility
 when in<U+FB02>uenced by rays of another.       The author employed a white
porcelain. tablet as such a standard; and the object to be observed
was placed on the tablet, instead of being laid directly on the black
                                                                         -
ened shelf.
    Another mode of observation consists in using a prism in combi
nation with the principal absorbent.       The object being placed on

                                     335
 the tablet, a slit is held close to it, in such a position as to be seen,
projected partly on the object and partly on the tablet, and the slit
is then viewed through a prism. The <U+FB02>uorescence of the object is
evidenced by light appearing in regions of the spectrum, in which,
in the case of the rays coming through the principal absorbent, and,
therefore, in the case of the rays scattered by the tablet, there is
nothing but darkness.
    The author states that these methods proved to be of such deli
cacy, that, even on an unusually gloomy day, he was able readily to
detect the <U+FB02>uorescence of white paper; and even in the case of sub
stances standing much lower in the scale, the <U+FB02>uorescence could be
detected in a similar manner.
    In conclusion, the author states that he had found the property
of <U+FB02>uorescence to belong to a peculiar class of salts, the platinocya
nides, making a third instance in which this property had been
connected with substances chemically isolated in a perfectly satis
factory way. The present instance opens a new <U+FB01>eld of inquiry in
relation to the polarization of the <U+FB02>uorescent light.
    8. “ Researche in Embryology; a Note supplementary to Papers
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1838, 1839 and 1840,
 showing the con<U+FB01>rmation of the principal facts there recorded, and
pointing out a correspondence between certain structures connected
 with the Mammiferous Ovum and other Ova."               By Martin Barry,
 M.D., F.R.S., F.R.S.E.        Received   May   27, 1853-.
    Referring to his account of the process of fecundation of the mam
 malian ovum and the immediately succeeding phenomena, published
 in various papers in the Philosophical Transactions, the author calls
 attention to the con<U+FB01>rmation which his views have received from
 corresponding observations made by subsequent inquirers on the ova
 of other animals.     He more particularly adverts to a recently pub
lished memoir by Dr. Keber, in which that physiologist describes
 the penetration of the spermatozoa into the interior of the ovum, in
 Unio and Anodonta, through an aperture formed by dehiscence of
 its coats, analogous to the microper in plants.               ...
    Small pellucid vesicles, lined with ciliated epithelium and enclo
 sing a revolving mulberry-like object. such as the author discovered
 imbedded under the mucous membrane of the rabbit’s uterus and
 described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1839, have been like
 wise observed by Keber, not only under the mucous membrane, but
 also and most frequently in some part of the cavity of the abdo
 men.     Keber considers these bodies to be fecundated ova. The
 author agrees-with Keber in considering them to be ova, but he does
 not suppose them to be fecundated, nor does he think that their
 membrane is the vitellary membrane (“ zona pellucida"), which he
 believes to have been absorbed. He considers such ova to have been
 detached from the ovary along with their containing ovisac, which
 in their new situation constitutes the ciliated capsule, and as they
 present themselves in unimpregnated        animals, he now believes that
 the formation of a mulberry-like group of cells from the germinal

spot and the process of division and subdivision of the latter take
place without fecundation ; but when this happens, the mulberry is
not found to contain one cell larger than the rest, the nucleus of
which, according to his observations, is the embryo.       He is further
of opinion, that in all cases of separation of ova, the ovisac or in
ternal coat of the Graa<U+FB01>an follicle is detached from the ovary, either
entire and along with the ovum, as in the instances alluded to, or
after the ovum has <U+FB01>rst escaped by rupture, as in the instance of the
fecundated ovum.
   The author is led to the following conclusions with reference to
the structures connected with the ovum in different animals:—l.'
That in the mammalia the vesicle he described as the foundation of
the Graa<U+FB01>an follicle, and termed the ovisac, does not remain perma
nently in the ovary, but is expelled and absorbed.      2. That in the
Bird, the ovum, when escaping from the ovary, is accompanied by
the corresponding vesicle—the ovisac; and that the ovisac becomes
the shell-membrane of the Bird’s egg.    3. That the expelled and lost
ovisac in the mammalia therefore corresponds to the shell-membrane
in the Bird.    4. That after the formation of the ovum the albumi
nous contents of the ovisac in the mammalia correspond            to the
albumen in the Bird's egg.     5. That the author’s retinacula in the
mammalia, after all, <U+FB01>nd their analogue in the chalazae of the Bird;
and that both have their origin in the granular contents of the ovi
sac, which at an early period are in appearance just the same in
both.    6. That the shell-membrane of the Bird is thus a primary
cell.
   He then points out the position which from his observations is to
be assigned to the several parts of the ovum in the language of
“ cells ;" and shows the
                           presence of a plurality of ova in a Graa<U+FB01>an
follicle to be referable to the same cause as that producing more
than one yelk (ovum) in the Bird’s egg.

     l. “ On the Nerves which supply the Muscular Structure of the
 Heart."     By Robert Lee. M.D., F.R.S. Received Nov. 7.
    The author remarks that, in a paper entitled “ On the Ganglia
 and Nerves of the Heart,” published in the Philosophical Trans
 actions, Part I. 1839, it is asserted, that “it can be clearly demon
 strated that every artery distributed throughout the walls of the
 uterus and heart, and every muscular fasciculus of these organs, is
 supplied with nerves upon which ganglia are formed."
    He then states that “ recent dissections which I have made of
 the heart of the race-horse, in which both the muscular and ner
 vous structures are largely developed, demonstrate, that from the
 outer surface to the lining membrane the walls are universally per
vaded with nerves, on which ganglia are formed, or enlargements
invested with neurilemma, into which nerves enter and from which
they issue, as in all the other ganglia of the great sympathetic
nerve.
    “From these dissections it is seen that the ganglionic nerves
which ramify on the surface of the heart, those which have hitherto
been delineated in the works of anatomists, are few in number com
pared to those which are distributed throughout the muscular struc

blood-vessels.
    " This anatomical demonstration of the ganglia and nerves of the
muscular structure of the heart, completely subverts the opinion
still entertained by some physiologists, that the sensitiVe and con
tractile powers of the heart are independent      of nervous in<U+FB02>uence.
It further indicates the real source of the action of the heart as an
entire organ, from the commencement to the termination of life;
how the circulation of the blood is carried on when the foetus has
neither brain nor spinal cord, and how the detached parts of the
heart continue to contract for a time in some animals after its total

    2. “ On the In<U+FB02>uence of the Moon on the magnetic direction at
 Toronto, St. Helena, and Hobarton.”        By Colonel Edward Sabine,
 R.A., V.P. and Treas. Received Nov. 17, 1853.
    Having noticed the inference drawn by M. Kreil from the mag
netic observations at Milan and Prague, that the moon exercises an
 in<U+FB02>uence on the magnetic direction at the surface of our globe, cog
nisable by a variation in the declination depending on the moon’s
hour-angle and completing its period in a lunar day, the author pro
ceeds in this paper to state the results of an examination, analogous
to that pursued by M. Kreil, into the in<U+FB02>uence of the moon on the
magnetic declination at the three stations of Toronto, St. Helena,
and Hobarton.
    The observations employed in this investigation consisted of six
years of hourly observation at Toronto, <U+FB01>ve years at St. Helena, and
<U+FB01>ve years at Hobarton, forming, exclusive of observations omitted
on account of excessive disturbance, a total of 105,747 observations.
    The processes are related by which, after the separation of the
disturbances    of largest amount, the observations were treated,
for the purpose of eliminating the variations due to solar in<U+FB02>uence,
and of re-arrangement in a form by which the inequality of the moon’s
action at the different hours of each lunar day might be brought
distinctly into view. The results are shown in tables exhibiting the
amount of inequality at each of the three stations corresponding to
each of the twenty-four lunar hours.
    It appears from these results that the existence of a lunar diurnal
variation in the magnetic declination is shown at each of the three
stations of Toronto, St. Helena, and Hobarton, and that it has the
same general character at each, viz. that of a double progression in
a lunar day, having two easterly maxima nearly at opposite points
of the hour-circle, and two westerly maxima also at nearly two op
posite points of the hour-circle.      The extreme elongations are not
at precisely opposite points of the hour-circle at any of the three
stations, nor have the amounts of the two elongations which take
place in the same direction always precisely the same value; but
the slight inequalitiesin these respects are within the limits which
might be ascribed to accidental variations, and might therefore dis
appear with longer continued observations.         It is otherwise, how
ever, in the author’s opinion, [with the disparity between the amounts
of easterly and westerly extreme elongations which presents itself at
each of the three stations. At Hobarton and St. Helena the westerly
elongations have the larger values, at Toronto the easterly (the north
end of the magnet being referred to in all cases).
   The times at which the extreme elongations in the two directions
take place are not the same at the three stations, and are as follows :—
At Toronto the easterly extremes take place about the hours of 0
and 12, being the hours of the upper and lower culminations; at
St. Helena the westerly extremes about two hours before the culmi
nations; and at Hobarton about two hours after the culminations.
At Toronto the westerly extremes take place about the hours of 6
and 18; at St. Helena and Hobarton the easterly extremes respect

                                     339
ively two hours before and two hours after the same hours of 6 and
18.     The extreme inequality, or the amount of lunar variation
measured from one extreme elongation to the other, is about 28” of
are at Toronto, 20” at Hobarton, and 11” at St. Helena.                  The
resolved portion of the terrestrial magnetic force which acts in the
horizontal direction, and is opposed to any disturbing in<U+FB02>uence, is
approximately 3'54 at Toronto, 4'51 at Hobarton, and 5'57 at St.
Helena.

                                                Washington, 12 Sept. 1853.
    Lieut. Mackai returned to the United States in April, having made
 his magnetical observations successfully at all the elevations and at
 distances of 100 miles, entirely across the Pampas. Soon after leaving
 Mendoza he was thrown from his horse, breaking his barometer and
 so injuring his chronometer, that he has neither the longitudes of
 his magnetical stations nor barometric pro<U+FB01>le of the country.        Being
 desirous to make his work complete, he volunteered to retrace his
 ground, and left the United States for the purpose more than a month
 ago, taking with him the declinometer and dip-circle, two Bunten’s
 barometers, an apparatus for determining altitudes from the boiling
 point, and some smaller instruments.
     Conveyance of the uni<U+FB01>lar would have required another mule.
    Cursory inspection of the observations already made afforded evi
 dence of their reliability, and as repetition would have involved
 many hours’ detention at each station, it was not considered essen—
 tial to cumber him.     Should the Argentine provinces have become
 suf<U+FB01>ciently quiet, he will <U+FB01>rst cross the Andes at the Planchan Pass,
 lat. 35° 20', next at the Partillo (the most elevated) Pass, lat. 33° 40',
 and <U+FB01>nally at the Cumbre and Uspalata Pass, in lat. 32° 50', where
 observations have already been made.                                  ‘
    As he will remain at Santiago only a short time, I look for him
 home during February next.
    His and all the magnetical observations will then be discussed,
 and the volume be ready for press by the close of 1854.         Those on
 meteorology are very far advanced.
    The astronomical observations will <U+FB01>ll three volumes, one of which
 (Mars and Venus) will be ready about the same time as the mag
 netical and meterological volume; the zones not until two ,years
 later.

    A                                     “ On the Typical Forms of the
        paper was also read, entitled
large Secreting Organs          of  the  Human   Body.”     By Thomas H.
Silvester, M.D.        Communicated       by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S.
 Received Nov. 11, 1853.
    The author in this paper offers some observations on the large
secreting organs of the human body, namely,—
                   The lungs,
                   The liver,
                   The  kidney,
                   The  stomach,
                   The  intestines,   and
                   The  developments connected with reproduction.
    He observes that there are great obstacles to an attempt to re
 duce them to a uniform type, but that further observation reveals
 a typical uniformity, in adaptation to special purposes, unequalled in
 the rest of the human oeconomy.             The greatest hindrance to the
 discovery of this law of formation has been the habit of regarding a
 single element of the glandular organ as the whole and not a mere
 part of the glandular apparatus; for instance, the ovary has been
 described as the ovuliferous gland, although in reality the latter
 consists of the ovary, the Fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the vagina:
 also the lung has been said to be a gland, meaning by this expres
 sion the secreting portion; whereas the lung-gland is comp0sed of
 the vesicular structure, the excretory ducts, the bronchi, larynx,
 thyroid body, and even the nasal passages. The aim of the author
 has been to discover the constant elements of the glandular system
 and to compare them together in the several organs.
     A secreting gland is described as a more or less developed fold of
  mucous membrane, or even a plain surface--in its simplest form a
  follicle ; but in the organs to be described it is a highly complicated
  apparatus, composed of many parts, each possessing a peculiar func
  tion. It is an unvarying characteristic of these structures that the
  elements of which they are composed always hear the same relation
  to each other in position.       An accompanying diagram exhibited the
  type of a perfect gland, constituted of <U+FB01>ve elements and an ap
  pendage.

      Sketches of the several glands of the human body accompanied the
  paper, coloured in the same manner, so that the corresponding parts
  might be seen at a glance.            The elements are seldom wanting,

                                    341
though sometimes scarcely discernible in their rudimentary condi
tion, and retained apparently only in conformity to typical law.
    There is great difference in degree of development of the elements.
The secreting part of the liver is of large size compared to the ducts,
whilst that of the generative organ in the female, namely, the ovarium,
is comparatively minute.      The appendage of the cervix is very large
in the biliferous apparatus, but scarcely discoverable in the stomach
and sigmoid <U+FB01>exure.        The excretory duct in the digestive organ,
represented by a contraction across the middle of the stomach, is of
 enormous length in the seminiferous gland, as the vas deferens.
    The popular terms being inexact or without meaning, it was
proposed to substitute for the ordinary names of the secreting
organs designations more aptly descriptive of their functions and
 more in accordance with the principles of scienti<U+FB01>c nomenclature, a's
follows :—
            The uriniferous gland.
            The seminiferous gland.
            The biliferous gland.
            The pneumatiferous gland.
            The intestinal gland.
            The ovuliferous gland.
            The lactiferous gland; and
           The digestive gland.
    The kidney, or un'niferous gland, presents an almost typical re
 gularity of development.     The secreting element or cortical portion
is composed of small convoluted tubes covered with a net-work of
blood-vessels.
    The excretory duct or medullary structure arises from the cor
tical part by numerous straight tubuli, which terminate in a. duct
for the conveyance of the urine into
    The receptacle or bladder.    This organ has a cervix lined with
mucous membrane in longitudinal folds, studded with minute fol
licles and a rudimentary glandular appendage in the male.
    The e<U+FB01>'erent duct is constituted of the membranous portion of
the urethra.
    The 'seminiferous gland consists of the testicle, a collection of
convoluted tubercles, of an excretory duct called‘the vas deferens,
of a receptacle the analogue of the uterus, the vesiculae seminales
being the body, the prostate the glandular appendage surrounding
the cervix.    The efferent duct is of considerable length; the re
reptacle is lined with an alveolar <U+FB01>ssure like the gall-bladder and
some muscular <U+FB01>bres.
    The ovuliferous organ consists of the ovarium or secretory ele
ment, the fallopian tubes or excretory duct, the uterus or recep
tacle, the cervix and its glandular appendage in the shape of mucous
follices, and the vagina or efferent duct.   The secretory structure is
not tubular, but vesicular ; the excretory duct is connected with the
ovariurn by its <U+FB01>mbriated extremity at certain periods only, in con
formity with its peculiar function.                             _
   The lactiferous gland is remarkable for the singular distribution

                                    342
of its elements ; the secreting portion or breast, and the excretory
duct or nipple , being attached to one individual, and the receptacle
or mouth, cervix, glandular appendage or tonsils, and efferent duct
or oesophagus belonging to another, of which the mother and child
afford an illustration.
     The stomach or digestive gland does not appear at <U+FB01>rst sight to
be formed upon the same type as the other glands; it is however
divisible into three distinct cavities—the secreting or cardiac, the
receptacular or pyloric, and the efferent or duodenum.       It is a tube
of enormous calibre, divided into three compartments of unequal
area.     The excretory tube is recognized in the central contraction
of    the muscles during digestion; the cervix, lined with plicated
mucous membrane, has been poetically described as the pylorus.
   ‘
     Comparative anatomy as well as microscopical bear testimony to
the correctness of this view with regard to structure and develop
ment.
     The biliferous gland is constituted as follows:
     The secreting element, popularly called the liver.
     The hepatic duct is the excretory tube.                              '
     The gall-bladder is the receptacle terminating in the duodenum
 in conjunction with the pancreatic duct, the pancreas being the
 glandular appendage surrounding the slender cervix of the recep
 tacle, and the duodenum performing         the function of an efferent
 canal to the digestive and biliferous glands.
     The glandular appendages are subject to great variety of deve
 lopment.     The thyroid, the pancreas, and the prostate are large
 structures, whilst in the pylorus, the sigmoid <U+FB01>exure of the colon
 and the cervix uteri, the same element is little more than a fold of
 Innocus membrane with follicles interspersed. This element, like the
 glandular apparatus, is greatly predisposed to cancerous degenera
 tion.
     The writer of the paper now proceeds to describe the most re
 markable and important gland of the human oeconomy, namely. the
 sanguiferous.
      The jejunum and ileum constitute the secreting element of this
  organ.    The ileo-caecal valve or verminiferous appendage is the ex
  cretory duct in a'rudimentary state.     The colon, though enormously
  developed in a longitudinal direction, must be regarded as the re
  ceptacle ; the sigmoid <U+FB02>exure folded upon itself like the letter S (as
  in the cervix of the gall-bladder) is the cervix of the colon recep
  tacle; the rectum or the efferent duct completes the system.
      The function of this system is not fully known ; the tract is lined
  with mucous membrane and glandulae for the secretion of air and
  other products of the blood.     It can scarcely be denied that the in
  testinal tube, in its structure and form and arrangement of the ele
  ments, bears the closest analogy to the glandular apparatus as seen
  in the other large viscera of the human body.
      The jejunum, as its name implies, is generally empty; it is con
  voluted, and its parietes are covered with a net-work of capillaries;
  it resembles therefore in all these particulars the tubes which form

                                     343
the secreting tissue of the testicle and kidney, and differs from them
but in size.     The jejunum and ileum, regarded as a continuous tube,
constitute a magni<U+FB01>cent secreting structure, and its function is pro
bably something more than the supply of the air and mucus gene
rally contained in its canal.     It has been suggested, that the blood,
the lymph and the faeces owe their existence to the active capillaries
of the mesenteric arteries, but some certain proofs are still wanting
in con<U+FB01>rmation of this opinion.
    In the lung-gland, or pneumatiferous organ, the vesicular struc
ture is the secreting element ; it secretes carbonic acid: the rami
<U+FB01>cations of the bronchia ending in the two bronchi represent the
excretory duct; the trachea is the receptacle;         and the glandular
appendage covering the cervix (or cricoid cartilage) and marking
 its position, passes by the name of the thyroid.                    -
    The e<U+FB02>’erent duct commences at the cricoid and ends at the carti
laginous ori<U+FB01>ce of the nostrils.
    The lacrymiferous organ is formed upon the same plan as the
preceding; but in consequence of some peculiarities of development,
that, together with the simpler secreting structures, will be reserved
for a future opportunity.

    The President then addressed the Society        as follows :
    GENTLEMEN,
 I AM happy that it is in my power again to congratulate you on the
 progress made in the researches which have been carried on, aided
 by the Grant the Government have placed at your disposal: after
 an experience of more than three years we may say with con<U+FB01>dence
 that much has been accomplished.           At <U+FB01>rst there were some mis
 givings : continental experience was not altogether relied upon. Al
 though it had been very much the practice of foreign governments
 to take an active part in encouraging the pursuit of science, and with
 decided success, here the smallest effort in that direction was looked
 upon by some as an experiment little harmonizing with our institu
 tions, our feelings, perhaps our prejudices, and only to be followed
 by failure and disappointment.    It was feared that because occasion
 ally there had been some di<U+FB01>iculty in employing effectively the small
 fund which had been bequeathed to us, that therefore there would
 be increased dif<U+FB01>culty in employing a larger fund ; and this no doubt
 would have happened if there had been restrictions limiting the
 application of the larger fund to certain speci<U+FB01>c objects, or if the
 <U+FB01>eld of discovery had been of limited extent: the reverse however
 was the case.      Your Council were not embarrassed by any unwise
 restrictions, and in science there is room for every one. It is one
 of the deductions of economic science that labour creates a demand
for labour; in fact, that where a community is industrious, and
labour accumulates and becomes capital, that there the people will be
fully employed: the same is true in the inductive sciences, and it
is true universally; there no modifying causes interfere to diminish
the force, or limit the application of the great principle, and we see
strikingly that as facts accumulate, and facts are the capital of
inductive    science, fresh employment        is everywhere provided for
those who are willing to work.          Take any one of the inductive

                                       345
  sciences as an example, and we at once see how this is. Take for
  instance chemistry, compare it as it now is with what it was when
  Priestley commenced his career. The whole of the science then con
  sisted of an imperfect knowledge of the properties of a few of the
  metals, of sulphur, phosphorus, and the three alkalies as they were
  then called.     There was a little known also about salts and acids, and
  the existence of hydrogen and carbonic acid gas had recently been
  ascertained.     In a range so limited there was little room but for one
  master mind, when Priestley discovered oxygen, and at once an open
  ing was made for researches into the nature of the atmosphere, of
  water, and of combustion, of the acids and the alkalies, and ample
   employment was provided for a host of distinguished philosophers
  for years to come.       Other important discoveries were soon made,
   each becoming as it were a new origin of light, throwing perhaps
   at <U+FB01>rst but feeble rays upon the objects around us, but revealing so
   much of their strange forms as to excite curiosity, and awaken the
   strongest passion of the" human mind,—-the desire to discover the
   truth.    Inorganic chemistry was then rapidly becoming a great
   science, when the foundations of organic chemistry were laid in a
   succession of brilliant discoveries.    That was but a few years ago,
  but there were many men then ready trained for the work, and the
  progress was proportionally rapid. To take a few of the disco
   veries in organic chemistry, and show how each has been the germ
   of others, as it were the <U+FB01>rst term of a diverging series, and thus
   to exhibit the great principle at work that in science labour creates
   a demand for labour, might perhaps be of some interest, but it would
  lead me from the object which I have in view, which is simply to
   point out the grounds upon which I. have ever felt a strong conviction,
   that whatever means were placed at the disposal of the Royal Society,
   no lasting dif<U+FB01>culty could occur in turning them to useful account.
      During the last year considerable progress has been made by Mr.
   Hopkins in the important experiments which he has been carrying
   on in conjunction with Mr. Fairbairn and Mr. Joule.             You no
   doubt are aware, that, as we descend below the surface of the earth,
   it has been found that the temperature increases: numerous experi
   ments made in different places with all the necessary precautions to
   guard against fallacy, seem clearly to have established the fact. The
   increase is about one degree of Fahrenheit for a depth of from 50 to
‘
   60 feet.    If therefore the conducting power of the materials of the
   globe was the same at all depths, we should have a series, which
   would give us the depth proportional to every required temperature.
   Reasoning in this way, we conclude that a temperature higher than
   that of melting iron exists at a depth of thirty miles, and that at
   double that depth the materials of thesurface of the globe, combined as
   we <U+FB01>nd them in nature, would enter into fusion. It has therefore been
   supposed by many that the solid crust beneath our feet is not more
  than forty or <U+FB01>fty miles thick. It has however been assumed that the
  increasing pressure at increasing depths does not alter either the
  conducting power of materials, or the temperature at which they
  melt. This no doubt is to a certain extentincorrect, and it is highly

                                      346
probable that the conducting power of the different strata increases
considerably with the depth, the materials becoming more compact
under augmented pressure.         It is not improbable also that pressure
may    raise the  temperature  of <U+FB02>uidity. In either case the solid crust
of the globe would be thicker than it had been supposed to be on
the assumed data.         With the view of throwing light upon this
question so interesting to all geologists, Mr. Hopkins undertook,
with the assistance of Mr. Fairbairn and Mr. Joule, to subject
various substances under different temperatures to enormous pres
sure.     Considerable time was required, even with Mr. Fairbairn’s
unlimited mechanical means, to construct the necessary apparatus;
however, recently it has been completed, and in the few substances
examined it has been found that the temperature of fusion has
increased with the pressure: in the case of wax, by a pressure of
13,000 pounds to the square inch, the fusing-point was raised 30°.
Whatever may be the in<U+FB02>uence of these experiments as affecting the
great questions of Terrestrial Physics, we may predict with certainty
that data will be obtained most valuable in philosophical research.
   Mr. Joule, I <U+FB01>nd, has been actively engaged, in conjunction with
Professor Thomson, in his experiments on the thermal effects of
<U+FB02>uids in motion, and has determined with considerable accuracy,
operating on a great scale, the depression of temperature when com
pressed air escapes into the atmosphere through a porous plug. The
laws of the phenomena as to the temperature and pressure of the
con<U+FB01>ned gas, will also soon be determined.
    Carbonic acid gas has been found to give a depression of four and
a half times as great as atmospheric air, while it passes through
the porous plug with greater facility than atmospheric air; equal
volumes requiring pressures of 1 and 1'05 respectively in order to
be transmitted in equal times. Certain heating effects of air rushing
through a single ori<U+FB01>ce have been observed, which will probably
lead to a further development of the mechanical theory of the tem
perature of elastic <U+FB02>uids in rapid motion.
    The examination of the sedimentary deposits in the Nile valley,
mentioned at the last Anniversary, is still going on.          Mr. Horner
states, that by the muni<U+FB01>cent aid of His Highness Abbas Pacha, the
Viceroy of Egypt, a series of operations have been carried on at
 Heliopolis, and at another station thirteen miles above Cairo, which
have led to interesting results.       A pit has been sunk to the depth of
 24 feet below the pedestal of the colossal statue of Ramses the
 Second, who reigned, according to the chronology of Bunsen, about
 1400 years before Christ, and borings have been continued by which
 cylinders of soil have been extracted at an additional depth of 48
 feet.    A series of thirty-two pits has been sunk across the valley in
 a line between the Libyan and Arabian deserts, occupying a line of
 about <U+FB01>ve miles, passing through the site of the statue alluded to;
 and it is proposed to sink a similar line of pits next year about twenty
 miles lower down the river, passing through the site of the obelisk
 of Heliopolis. Above sixty persons were employed in the operations
 at Memphis. The plan, as proposed by Mr. Homer, was, through the

                                    347
intervention of the Hon. Charles Augustus Murray, Her Majesty's
late Consul-General in Egypt, submitted to the Viceroy, and met with
the most ready acceptance.        He gave directions to his government
that every assistance should be afforded for carrying on the proposed
researches; he appointed an able engineer o<U+FB01>icer high in his service,
M. Hekekyan Bey, to conduct them, and ordered that the whole
expense should be defrayed by his government.            Such enlightened
liberality on the part of His Highness Abbas Pacha justly entitles
him to the gratitude of all cultivators of science.
     The other researches alluded to on the last occasion are proceeding
 satisfactorily, but there is nothing which seems to call for especial
notice at present; I will therefore at once proceed to give some
 account of the steps which have been taken by your Council for the
 advancement of science in another direction.
     In the history of individual sciences we perceive there have been
 always successive periods of activity and repose. In Astronomy, for
 many years we have had a period of activity. Physical Astronomy
 has achieved perhaps its greatest triumph within the last few years
 in the discovery of Neptune; and the discovery of the numerous
 Asteroids and Comets is evidence that Practical Astronomy has kept
 pace with it.     Within the same period the nebulous contents of the
 Southern Hemisphere have for the <U+FB01>rst time been made known to us;
 we have now a catalogue of the highest excellence, with an ample
 guarantee for its accuracy in the zeal, ability, and experience of Sir
 John Herschel.
     That catalogue will be a record for future ages, leading probably
 to the detection of change in the wonderful objects revealed by the
 telescope, and so giving a clue to the mysterious laws which rule'
 the remote universe.
     The Cape observations were not long before the world when some
 astronomers expressed a desire that it should not be left to posterity
 to turn them to account, but that some effort should be made to
 employ them in the service of the present generation.        It was sug
 gested, that with such an admirable working list, much might be ef
 fected ina short time. Acomparisonof the Northern andSouthern cata
 logues had led many to believe that the same instrument had-effected
  more in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere.           Whether
 that had been owing to a better atmosphere, or whether the objects
  themselves were more remarkable, in either case it was reasonable
  to expect that an instrument of great power would do more in a
  well-selected situation in the Southern Hemisphere than in these
  islands; and on that account alone there seemed to be grounds for
  a well-founded hope that interesting discoveries would be made;
  but there were other grounds.
      In the present state of Nebular Astronomy, the best proapect we
 have of extending our knowledge, seems to be by carefully sketching
 and measuring every object sufficiently within reach of our instru
 ments, to make details discernible.       It is highly probable that the
 objects   we  see are presented to  us in every  variety of position, that
 they often differ in form merely because we see them in a different

                                   348
aspect, and that if all were similarly placed as to the line of sight, a
few normal forms would represent the whole.          If this is the case,
had we a suf<U+FB01>cient number of accurate sketches, it is probable that
out of the apparent confusion we should succeed in extracting the
normal forms.       It is also probable that in the nebular systems
motion exists. If we see a system with a distinct spiral arrangement,
all analogy leads us to conclude that there has been motion, and
that if there has been motion that it still continues.     The apparent
motion is probably very slow, owing to the immense distance of the
nebulae; still there are double stars known to be physically double
from their motions, which are probably as distant as some of the
nebulae.    In certain nebulae stars are so peculiarly situated that we
can scarcely doubt their connection with the nebular system in
which we see them, and some of these stars are as bright as some
of the stars known to be physically double; as bright even as some
of the stars which the latest Pulkowa observations have shown to
have sensible parallax, and whose distance therefore is approximately
known. We have therefore some vague idea, resting on probable
evidence, even of the distance of the nearest nebulae. It seems there
fore not unreasonable to expect that measurements perseveringly
carried on will detect motion, and that a fulcrum will thus be
obtained, by which the powers of analysis may be brought to bear
upon the laws which govern these mysterious systems.
   In the northern catalogue of Nebulae, and the same observation
no doubt applies to the southern also, there are vast numbers much
too faint to be sketched, or measured, with any prospect of advan
tage ; the most powerful instruments we possess, showing in them
nothing of an organized structure, but merely a confused mass of
nebulosity of varying brightness.      The number of nebulae in the
northern hemisphere, in which details are well brought out,
is not very large, and even in these, a great proportion of the
measurements are necessarily rough, and wanting in that precision
by which the motion of certain double stars was so soon detected.
It is evident therefore that to obtain a true knowledge of the forms
of the nebular systems, our sketches must be as numerous as possi
ble ; and to obtain evidence of motion with rough measures, our
measures should be very numerous also; but the northern hemi
sphere presents but a very limited list of suitable objects, therefore
it is desirable to take in the southern hemisphere also.
    I have thus, I believe, in part at least, explained the views of
 those who felt anxious that the southern hemisphere should be exa
 mined with a telescope of great power: the <U+FB01>rst attempt to give
practical effect to their wishes was at the meeting of the British
Association held at Birmingham in 1849.
    The President of the Association was on that occasion directed to
apply to Government to send a telescope of great power, in charge
of an experienced observer, to the southern hemisphere.             That
application   was  unsuccessful; the  Government,   while  they  acknow
ledged the importance of the proposed obj ect,declined to proceed, from
 an apprehension of dif<U+FB01>culties, through which they did not then see

                                   349
their way clearly. At a subsequent meeting of the British Association,
the matter was again discussed, and a Committee was appointed, to
take such measures as they considered best calculated to effect the
object. The Committee, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, laid the whole matter
before your Council, and the Council, approving of the suggestion,
appointed a Committee to consider the subject in detail.
    It was necessary before the Government could be applied to with
a reasonable prospect of success, that a. speci<U+FB01>c plan should be in
readiness, complete in all its details : the size of the instrument, its
optical principle, its mounting, and its site.
     With the view of obtaining the best information, the Committee
consulted several eminent men, conversant with the management of
large instruments.      The <U+FB01>rst question proposed was, whether the
instrument should be a refractor or re<U+FB02>ector, and it was decided in
favour of the re<U+FB02>ector—there was in fact no choice.       In the present
state of knowledge, there was no probability that a good refractor
 could be constructed of suf<U+FB01>cient power. As to size, the Committee
 were disposed to recommend a telescope of 4 feet aperture, and
 35 feet focal length, to be mounted equatorially; not that an instru
 ment of that size was the best, a much larger no doubt would have
 been better, but it would have been obviously unwise to have re
 commended a plan involving a very large expenditure.         The Com
 mittee proceeded one step further, they pointed out a mechanical
 engineer of character and experience in the construction of optical
 instruments, who was willing to undertake to make the instrument
 for a speci<U+FB01>c sum, and having proceeded thus far, they laid the
 whole matter‘before Government, with whom it at present rests.
     Another application is also before the Government of a very
 different character, but with the same great object, the advancement
 of human knowledge: it is to provide a building for the reception
 of the Scienti<U+FB01>c Societies of the metropolis.     That application did
 not proceed from your Council, but from a large number of indivi
 duals, many of them Fellows of this Society, the remainder distin
 guished members of the other Scienti<U+FB01>c bodies of the metropolis.
 The application was made in the shape of a Memorial to Govern
  ment, the signatures amounting to about 200.       There had been no
  effort, I believe, on the part of those who brought the subject for
  ward to procure a large number of signatures, or in any way to
  obtain a direct representation of the Scienti<U+FB01>c bodies : the Memorial
  was a preliminary step, and in that stage nothing more was required.
  than to show that it was supported by a large number of persons of
  that class, from which science, if called upon, would have selected
  her representatives.    The Memorial was presented by a deputation,
  and care was taken to explain to Government, that it did not ema
  nate of<U+FB01>cially from this Society or from any other.
     A detailed explanation was also entered into, showing in what
  way the cultivation of science would be promoted, by providing
  suitable accommodation for the scienti<U+FB01>c societies.      Carleton ride
  was suggested as a convenient situation, and other sites were named
  in the same neighbourhood.

                                      350
      Reference was made to the suggested site at Kensington, and it was
   explained that it would be inconvenient to a large proportion of the
   working men of the Societies, many of them engaged in business, and
   whose time was most valuable, that they would be unable to attend
   regularly, and that the usefulness of the Societies would be thereby
   greatly impaired.    It was also intimated that the purchase of a large
   tract of land at Kensington did not materially affect the question;
   as a small space would be suf<U+FB01>cient for all the Societies, and there
   fore that a free grant at Kensington could be but little object. Should
   the Government accede to the Memorial, I presume that then the
   Societies will be regularly consulted.     The site will then be pointed
   out, the plan of the building laid before you, and you will form your
   own opinion; you will decide whether to remain as you are, or to
  accept the enlarged accommodation, which the far-sighted liberality
  of the nation will have provided for you.
      The interests of science appear to me to be deeply involved in. the
  question of providing a suitable building for the Scienti<U+FB01>c Societies.
  It is a practical question, and we must look at it in all its bearings,
  as men of the world.       Had there been no Societies, science would
. not therefore have stood still; but its progress would have been
  much slower.       The desire of discovering the truth, which is so
  strongly implanted in every educated mind, would have been to
  some a suf<U+FB01>cient motive for exertion; but the aid and inspiriting
  in<U+FB02>uence of association would have been wanting, and many active
  members of our scienti<U+FB01>c bodies would probably never have taken
  up science as a pursuit at all. The love of ease, the fascinations of
  society, the little prospect of advancing their material interests,
  through the path of scienti<U+FB01>c discovery, would have been to them a
  suf<U+FB01>cient excuse for indolence.      This point was very well put at the
  last Anniversary, by one of the distinguished men to whom you award
  ed a medal ; he said, had he been like Robinson Crusoe on a desert
  island; the desire of discovering the truth would have been an induce
  ment to work, but to obtain the good opinion of his fellow-men,
  associated together, was with him avery strong additional inducement.
  If a man, naturally gifted, and well-educated, attends scienti<U+FB01>c meet
  ings, he will feel himself constrained to work, and therefore it is so
  important for the advancement of knowledge, that able men should be
  induced to join and attend the different societies ; but nothing I think
  would have greater attractions than a building in a convenient central
  situation, where the business of science would be transacted, where
  there would be access to the best libraries, and where that kind of
  society most valued by scienti<U+FB01>c men would always be within reach.
      Where the question is, shall a great country like England provide
  a suitable place of meeting for its scienti<U+FB01>c bodies, I should hope
  there are not many who would be disposed to count the cost, I scarcely
  think the question, cui bono, could be asked; should any one however
  ask it, I should answer, the object is to promote the increase of human
  knowledge, to extend the domain of reason ; and “it is the understand
  ing that sets man above the rest of sensible beings,and gives him all the
  advantage and dominion which he has over them.” To take lower

                                      351
  ground, science is a part of England's greatness : without science En
  gland would be nothing, and in the race with the world, if she is for
  saken by science, she will fall far behind.      The exact sciences are
  the foundation of navigation; they are the foundation of engineer
  ing; and many of our manufactures are based on principles, which
  have been evolved in the researches of a re<U+FB01>ned chemistry.       Besides,
  have we not sometimes been at fault where science was not ready
  to guide us?       We have heard of failures in ship-building: some
  ships sail slowly, and are therefore of little use; others roll, and
  strain, and are also condemned;       where we have succeeded best we
  have taken our models from abroad, where high science has long
  been urged, to lend its aid in naval construction : where such men
  as the two Bernouillis, Euler, Chapman and others, have been in
  duced to examine and discuss the questions of most interest to the
  practical builder.    In civil engineering too, our most eminent men,
  I am sure, would not hesitate to acknowledge their obligations to
  our neighbours.      We have long been almost unrivalled in the appli
  cations of steam ; and yet, who is there who has not sought for the
  theory of the locomotive in the essay of De Pampour, or the prin
  ciples of steam in general in the researches of Regnault?
     In military engineering too, as well as in naval architecture,
  has not science been sometimes on the side of our adversaries? and
 have we not in consequence suffered severely?          But let me not be
 mistaken.      I do not contend that science can in a moment increase
 our success in the arts, upon which the greatness of this country de
 pends.     If we were to say to the mathematician, give us the best
 lines for a ship suited to a given purpose, however profound his ma
 thematical knowledge might be, he would fail; practice must be com
 bined, but in due subordination with theory.       It is where in a nation
 science is cultivated profoundly by a large class of persons, and cir
 cumstances exist tending to direct it to practice, that some men will
 always be found, gifted with the faculty of applying it in whatever
 way the interests of the country may require.                    v
     Popular science, however, will not do: it has its uses, subordinate
 as they are; it must be science of a high order; science as taught
 at our universities: there a power is created capable of effecting
 great objects; but in too many cases it is not applied at all, and it
 soon passes away without useful result.        Were it possible to enlist
 that gigantic power into the service of the country by making our
 scienti<U+FB01>c Associations more inviting, by placing science in this me
 tropolis in a position more attractive, a result would be obtained
 which the merest utilitarian would consider of immense value.
     I deeply regret that the last accounts have brought no intelli
 gence of Sir    J. Franklin’s expedition, and that science has sustained
 a heavy loss in the death of a distinguished French officer; the
latest sacri<U+FB01>ce to the perils of Arctic discovery.
    Many now present were acquainted with Lieut. Bellot, and           I am
sure they will bear me out in this, that there was a singleness of
purpose, and a propriety of feeling in everything he said and did.
in perfect keeping with the tenor of his previous life; and though

                                     352
he was here so short a time, he was regarded as a friend by all who
                                                          - '
knew him.
   You have heard no doubt with sincere pride, that British valour,
and British perseverance, have at length solved the problem of the
north-west passage.       A question of great geographical interest has
thus been settled, and an important fact has been added to the data
of terrestrial physics.    In all future inquiries relative to the oceanic
currents, the tides, the variations of temperature, the winds, and
meteorological phenomena generally, it will no' longer be a doubtful
assumption, that the sea <U+FB02>ows freely around the northern coast of
America.
   It now only remains for me to state, and I have the greatest plea
sure in doing so, that your Society is prosperous.         The publication
of your Transactions proceeds regularly, and they continue to be,
as they have been for two centuries, the records of every important
addition to British science.     There is no indication of a diminished
anxiety to share in your labours, the candidates for admission are
numerous, and your Council have had no dif<U+FB01>culty, though acting
under a heavy responsibility, in pointing out to you the required
number of persons in every way worthy of the Fellowship.
   So far the present system of election- appears to me to have worked
extremely well. The Fellowship is sought for as a high honour, and
here, as at the Universities, the claims of the respective candidates are
tested by responsible persons.
   In this, the Royal Society differs from every other Society; and
I think upon the preservation of that distinction, the welfare, the
position, perhaps the existence of our Society depends.           For 150
years the Royal Society stood alone; unaided it bore the whole
labour of wielding the power of Association, in the cause of pro
gressing science. Recently other Societies were formed to meet more
fully the wants of individual sciences; not as rivals to the Royal
Society, (in all of them our Fellows have held very prominent places)
but as the most friendly allies; not dependent on the Royal Society,
but fully admitting its pre-eminence.
   These‘Societies have rendered important services; much has been
effected through their means which otherwise would not have been
attempted.      Science has been carried out by them in the utmost
detail.    Besides, it is a law of human nature, that we usually form
a high estimate of the importance of the pursuit we are engaged in;
and in a Society limited to one science, that feeling will necessarily
predominate, and will act as a stimulus to exertion.          Under its in
<U+FB02>uence, labour will be cheerfully borne, from which under other cir
cumstances we should recoil with disgust.         That feeling, however,
would proceed too far were there not here a power to restrain it:
you hold that power: you exercise a presiding in<U+FB02>uence over all the
Societies.    The leading members of the scienti<U+FB01>c bodies have their
places here, and science is fully represented.
   You look at science as a whole, and you weigh the value of every
new discovery as adding to the mass of human knowledge.                The
honour of contributing to your Transactions is eagerly sought for,

                                   353
the medals you award are in high estimation, and science is stimu
lated to its grandest efforts, because you are viewed by all as just
and able judges.     To hold securely that proud position, learning
must be your distinguishing attribute; in the altered state of things
it is learning which <U+FB01>ts you for your new duties, and so long as the
Fellowship is regarded as the reward of services in the cause of
science of no common order, or of proved scienti<U+FB01>c eminence at the
universities, so long, I think, we may predict with con<U+FB01>dence that
the Royal Society will <U+FB02>ourish.
       COLONEL   SABINE,
   I am happy to have the honour of handing to you the Copley
Medal in charge for Professor Dove.
   Three important branches of Terrestrial Physics have recently
been greatly advanced, and by similar means; the adequate discus
sion of accumulated results of observation—I allude to the tides,
terrestrial magnetism, and the distribution of heat over the surface
of the globe.     Our knowledge of the tides was limited, and frag
mentary, till it became extended and systematized by the researches
of Dr. Whewell, and notwithstanding the numerous detached ob
servations which had long been made on the effects of terrestrial
magnetism, we were still ignorant of much of the real laws of the
phenomena, till under the leading in<U+FB02>uence of Gauss, not only indi
viduals, but Governments      were induced to unite in measures for
obtaining the accurate and systematic observations, which in the
hands of Colonel Sabine are leading to such determinate and inter
esting results. The labours of Dr. Whewell and Colonel Sabine have
received their well-merited acknowledgements in the Medals which
have been respectively awarded to them; and. this year the Copley
Medal has been awarded to Professor Dove for his laborious and
valuable researches on the distribution of heat over the surface of the
globe.   The results obtained in all these cases constitute unquestion
ably great steps in the progress of science; and though labours
such as these may not necessarily demand that acute discrimination
and inventive faculty required for the discovery of truths before
unthought-of, they do require what is scarcely less valuable, those
enlarged and comprehensive views by which we are enabled to
recognize real order in the midst of apparent confusion, and deduce
from the most complex and intricate phenomena, the simple laws to
which they may be referable.      The work which Professor Dove has
recently completed comprises     the   results obtained by him during
many years, by the careful and elaborate discussion of an immense
number of recorded observations of the temperature at numerous
stations, and in almost every accessible region of the globe.      The
details of these discussions have been published by him at different
times, principally in the Transactions of the Berlin Academy.        In
this recent work a large map exhibits the isothermal lines for
January and July, the months of extreme winter and summer tem
peratures; while twelve small maps engraved on two sheets exhibit
the isothermals for each successive month, and enable us to trace at
   Paocsemues on THE ROYAL Socrs'rr. Von. VI.               25

                                     354
 once their changing positions with the changing seasons.          Twelve
 other small maps of subnormal lines show, in like manner, for each
 month, the difference between the actual mean temperature for that
 month, and the normal temperature (that due to the latitude) at all
 places situated along each abnormal line.      These, with other subsi
 diary maps, present    to us at once, and with the greatest perspicuity,
 the principal results of these laborious investigations.
     These maps are accompanied by a considerable quantity of letter
 press, containing not only descriptive details, but also a very able
 discussion of some of the principal results obtained, and of the
 general conclusions deducible from them; more especially as regards
 the causes of the abnormal temperatures which characterise the
 northern hemisphere.       The in<U+FB02>uence of oceanic currents, on the
 temperature of the regions in which they prevail, was very inade
 quately appreciated before the publication of these researches.       Of
 these currents, the most important, and in<U+FB01>nitely the most interesting
 to ourselves, is that so well known as the Gulf-stream.     Its immense
 in<U+FB02>uence in moderating the winter cold along the shores of western
 Europe is shown by the singularly abnormal position of the winter‘
 isothermals in that region; and not only is this fact of great interest
 in itself, and of <U+FB01>rst-rate importance in meteorology, but it has also
 enabled the geologist to form a far more accurate estimate than
 otherwise it would have been possible to have done, of the probable
 climatal in<U+FB02>uences of particular con<U+FB01>gurations of land and sea, and
 thus to overcome, not by arbitrary hypothesis,           but by logical
 deduction, some of the greatest apparent anomalies in speculative
 geology.     The former existence of glaciers in our own islands need
 no longer be regarded as a mystery, for it is now demonstrable that
 they would be the highly probable, if not the absolutely necessary
 consequences of any*con<U+FB01>guration of land and sea which should
 divert the Gulf-stream from its present course; and the geologist
has no dif<U+FB01>culty in conceiving such a con<U+FB01>guration, not merely as a
possible, but as one which probably did exist during the glacial period.
I mention this as an instance of the diffusive in<U+FB02>uence of a great
 step in one science, on the progress of other sciences more or less
 directly associated with it. A further and very important conclusion
has been deduced by Professor Dove from the monthly isothermals,
 I mean the fact that the mean temperature of the surface of the
 globe, as a. whole, is higher when the sun is in the northern, than
in the southern signs. The explanation is, that the northern hemi
 sphere has more land than sea at the surface, and the southern much
more sea than land, and that from the different action of the sun’s
rays on the solid and <U+FB02>uid surfaces, it follows that the hot summer
of the northern hemisphere added to the mild winter of the southern,
gives a mean of general temperature several degrees of Fahrenheit
higher than the cool summer of the southern, together with the
cold winter of the northern hemisphere.
    It will, I doubt not, be generally felt by all who are acquainted
with these researches, that Professor Dove has well merited the
honour which the Council has conferred upon him in this award of
the Copley Medal.

                                    355
        Ma. DARWIN,
     I have much pleasure in announcing that a Royal Medal has been
 awarded to you.
    Adopting the views of Sir Charles Lyell, who has sought to
 explain natural phenomena by an appeal to the evidence afforded by
 still active causes, you have observed with great care, and no one
 has been more judicious, or more successful, in collecting facts.
 The frequent references made to your labours by writers on general
 geology, are evidence of the estimation in which they are held.
 Your work on Coral Reefs is a<U+FB01>ne specimen of an able argument on
 facts.    In that work you have brought together all the information
 collected by others, as well as by yourself, and you have explained
 the facts observed relating to the distribution of coral reefs, the con
 ditions favourable to their increase, the rate of their growth, and the
 depth at which they are found ; and thus laying a sound foundation
 to reason upon, you have shown that, with few exceptions, the old
 theory, that these reefs have been formed on the edges of submarine
 craters, and generally that the rocky or other basis on which the
 corals have grown had been elevated, is incorrect ; and, on the con
trary, that the true theory is, that the surface has been gradually
brought down to the proper level, a depth for the growth of corals,
by gradual subsidence.     No one probably can read your book with
out assenting to the general truth of your reasoning; and as it places
the fact of subsidence beyond doubt, a fact more dif<U+FB01>cult to prove
than elevation, and exhibits it on a scale of magnitude and genera
lization quite commensurate with that of elevation, I think it must
be accepted as one of the most important contributions to modern
geology.
    In your Monograph on the Pedunculated Cirripeds, you have
treated generally of the structure, economy, and zoological relations
of these animals, and given a systematic arrangement and descrip_
tion of the different species.    In the accomplishment of your task,
you have not only made use of previously existing materials with
sound and enlightened criticism, but, by the discovery of new facts
and the promulgation of original views, contributed most materially
to advance the department of knowledge to which your researches
more immediately belong, and rendered valuable service to physiolo
gical science in general.
    In the course of your inquiries you have con<U+FB01>rmed and widely
extended the observations of your predecessors respecting the larval
condition of the Cirripeds, and have shown that all the perfect Lepads
and Balanids pass through successive stages of metamorphosis.        You
have also added largely to our knowledge of the anatomy of the
larva, and brought to light the curious fact, that in one of its stages
its mouth is altogether rudimentary, and perfectly closed up by the
external covering, so that the creature in this stage is in fact a
“locomotive pupa,” incapable of feeding.         You have further ob
served that the prehensile antennae with which the larva <U+FB01>xes itself
in its <U+FB01>nal change, invariably remain permanent in the adult animal
                                                            25*

                                   356
at the attached end of its peduncle, and in many cases afford import
ant characters for zoological discrimination.
   The knowledge thus gained from the study of development                 is'
most sagaciously and hap ily applied by you to explain the homo
10gical relations between   the Cirripeds and Crustaceans; and in this
way you have conclusively shown that the peduncle of the mature
Lepad corresponds with the three anterior segments of the Crusta
cean.    Again, by your discovery of Proteolepas, a new parasitic
Cirriped of low organization, you have been able successfully to'
compare the remaining segments of the body in the two classes; for
whilst the chain of evidence      is  in some measure broken     bythe
absence of two segments near the middle of the series in Cirripeds
generally, the missing links are supplied by the newly-discovered
animal referred to.
   The existence of an eye with a pair of ophthalmic ganglia in adult
Lepads, as had been previously shown in Balanids,—the presence too
of organs seemingly intended for hearing and smelling—the chemical
nature of the tegumentary coverings—the cement-gland and ducts.
yielding a   plastic material for attaching the peduncle and for other
special purposes in! particular instances, and the singular organic
connexion between that— gland and the ovaries, are all most interest
ing discoveries in comparative anatomy, <U+FB01>rst made known in your
work.
   Some very singular facts respecting the reproductive function       in
the Lepadidae have been brought to light through your researches.
You observed that the ova, on leaving the ovary, are gathered         in
                                                                       a
layer underneath the internal lining of the sac or mantle, from
whence they are freed and extruded by the process of moulting, and
then form the ovigerous lamellae already known.      Again, you have
clearly established, that, contrary to the hitherto received opinion,
there are species of Lepadidaa consisting of individuals of distinct
sexes, the male being parasitic on the female  ;  and in certain other
species you have discovered a condition hitherto unknown in the
animal      kingdom, namely, bisexual individuals impregnated          by
                                                      “ complemental
parasites simply of the male sex, which you name
males,”--a fact unquestionably of <U+FB01>rst-rate interest in relation to
the physiology of the reproductive function in general.
~‘"Be‘si‘des these more important observations, there are many more
of lesser mark to be met with in the descriptions of particular
species,—descriptions, it   may be observed, which are founded on      a
care<U+FB01>ll examination, not only of the external characters, but of the
internal structure of the animals in question, in specimens obtained
from every available source, both at home and abroad; and the
zoological distinctions are rendered more precise and intelligible
than heretofore, by the introduction of   consistent and philoso
                                           a
phical nomenclature.

                                     357
      The President then called upon Mr. Christie to read the following
   obituary notices of some of the deceased Members.
     JONATHAN Panama, M.D., was born on the 22nd of May, 1804,
 in the parish of ShoreditchLLondon.         At ten years of age he was
 placed in a Classical Academy in Queen Street, Finsbury, where he
  remained about four years, and distinguished     himself as one of the
 most promising pupils in the school.
     Dr. Pereira’s education was now directed to the pursuit of surgery,
 but his appointment to the office of Resident Medical Of<U+FB01>cer of the
 General Dispensary in Aldersgate Street in 1823, led to his devoting
 himself more especially to the practice of medicine.
     In 1826 he succeeded Dr. Clutterbuck as lecturer on Chemistry
 at the Aldersgate Street Dispensary,       His <U+FB01>rst lecture was devoted
 to an account of the rise and progress of Chemistry from the earliest
 date to which the history of the science could be traced, and com
 prised a notice of the latest discoveries.   The theatre was crowded to
 excess, and the lecture created no little sensation from the profusion
 of illustrations, the amount of information, and the style of his
 delivery. Among other illustrations he exhibited bromine, which
 had recently been discovered by Balard, of Montpellier.
     His cultivation of chemistry at that time in connexion with medi
 cine, naturally directed his attention to the subject of the substances
 used as medicinal agents, and in 1824 we <U+FB01>nd him publishing a
 translation of the ‘ London Pharmacopoeia.’      This was followed by
 ‘
    A Manual for the Use of Students,’ ‘ A general Table of Atomic
 Numbers, with an Introduction to the Atomic Theory,’ and other
 works for the use of those who were pursuing their medical studies
 with a view to passing the usual examinations.            He afterwards
 published numerous papers on the adulteration and properties of
 drugs; and thus prepared himself for his great work—that on
 which his reputation as a physician and man of science will princi
pally rest,—his ‘Elements of Materia Medica.’            The outlines of
 this work <U+FB01>rst appeared as a course of lectures in the London Medi
 cal Gazette.     This work contained by far the most complete and
accurate account of substances used in medicine that‘had ever been
published. Not only were sources of medicine and their commercial
history fully treated therein, but the author entered with great caution
and skill into inquiries connected with the action of remedies: and
thus his book became at once a standard of reference for all who were
engaged in the business of selling drugs and chemicals, or in the
duty of prescribing them as medicines.       The first volume and a part
of the second of a third edition of this work had been published at
the time of the author's decease.       In 1843, Dr. Pereira published a
treatise on diet; which at the time of its appearance was one of the
most philosophical works that had yet been produced on the subject
of the food of man, and ' Lectures on Polarized Light,’ the best fami
liar exposition of that abstruse subject in our language.        He also
contributed numerous articles to societies, journals, reviews, etc.
    Paocnsnnvcs or THE ROYAL Socrs'rv.          VoL. VI. No. 100. 16

                                   358
 His death has left a great void in English Pharmaceutics, as no one
in England had a greater amount of knowledge on that subject.
As a lecturer, be secured the attention of his class by an earnestness
 of purpose, aptness of experimental illustration, and the practical
bearing of his remarks.
    Early in the year 1832 he resigned his o<U+FB01>‘ice at the General
 Dispensary, and on this occasion a silver salver was presented to him
 by the Governors of that Institution, as a memento of their regard
 and esteem.    In the following September he married, and establish
 ed himself in general practice in Aldersgate Street.
    In the winter of 1832 he became Professor of Materia Medica in
 the New Medical School in Aldersgate Street; and at the same
period succeeded Dr. Gordon as Lecturer on Chemistry at the Lon
 don Hospital.
    His connexion with the London Hospital procured him the oppor
 tunity of being appointed Physician to that extensive institution.
 In 1841 he procured the licence to practise in London from the Col
lege of Physicians.    He was elected a Fellow of that body in 1845.
 On the establishment of the London University, he was appointed
Examiner in Materia Medica and Pharmacy,—a position which he
held till his death.   He took great interest in the establishment of
the Pharmaceutical Society, and delivered lectures on Materia
Medica in connexion with that body.
    Dr. Pereira was the distinguished and highest representative of
 that science which involves the history, properties, and uses of drugs,
better known on the Continent than in England by its name of
 Pharmacology.      At the recent meeting of the Association for the
Advancement of Science at Wiesbaden, there was a Pharmacological
 Section specially devoted to the subject, attended by upwards of
                             ‘
two hundred members.           The Elements of Materia Medica and
Therapeutics,’   to which   Dr. Pereira gave the best years of his life,
is considered to be one of the most elaborate and thoroughly worked
out productions of modern science. Compared with similar phar
maceutical works of France and Germany, it is remarkable for its
diversity of character, excelling greatly in the amount of commer
cial and other practical information, in the preciseness and value of
its notes, and in the scrupulous exactness with which its statements
are authenticated by references to their original source.        Where
obscurity attached to any statement, the author was careful to
express it with a mark of doubt.      As a painstaking and conscien
tious writer Dr. Pereira was unsurpassed, and his work contains
nothing that may not be thoroughly relied on for its accuracy.       He
also added largely to the botany of pharmacy.
   Dr. Pereira had the happiness of enjoying during his life, large
honours, and there is little doubt, had he been spared, he would have
reaped the more substantial rewards of a lucrative practice.
   He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1838, and was
chosen on the Council in 1842-44.        He was also a Fellow of the
Linnean and other Scienti<U+FB01>c Societies, and was in constant commu
nication with the learned of all countries.

                                  359
    His death, which took place on the 20th of January last, was the
result of an accident.    Being engaged at the College of Surgeons
on some scienti<U+FB01>c business, he fell down a <U+FB02>ight of steps, which led
to the rupture of an artery, and terminated his life at the early age of
forty-nine, not however without leaving behind a name which will
occupy a prominent place in the history of the science of the nine
                                                                       '

    HUGH EnwrN STRICKLAND, Esq., was descehded from an ancient
Baronet family in Yorkshire, one of whose ancestors was Lord
Strickland in the Protectorate      of Cromwell.      From early life
Mr. Strickland was a zealous student of Natural History, and in
consequence of his pro<U+FB01>ciency in all its branches, but particularly in
Ornithology and Geology, was appointed to succeed Dr. Buckland
as Reader in Geology at the University of Oxford, and was subse
quently elected President of the Ashmolean Museum.               Besides
frequent and valuable zoological, botanical, and geological contribu
tions to periodical publications, Mr. Strickland obtained great cele
brity by the publication of an elaborate volume on the Extinct Dodo,
which he wrote in conjunction with Dr. Melville.         Mr. Strickland
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852.
    His death was most melancholy. He left Hull, where he had been
attending the Meeting of the British Association in September last,
to visit an interesting geological locality, on the line of railway be
tween Retford and Gainsborough.        Here, while engaged in taking
a, sketch, and imprudently standing on the railway, he was run down
by an express train, and in an instant was a mangled corpse.
    FRANQOIS  Aasoo was born on February 26th, 1786, at Estagal near
Perpignan,   in the department of the Oriental Pyrenees.      His father
had only a moderate patrimony, and was Treasurer of the Mint at
 Perpignan. Being intended for the legal profession, or some public
 o<U+FB02>ice, the early education he received was entirely literary, but
 having a predilection to become an of<U+FB01>cer in the Artillery, he entered
 himself at the Polytechnic School at Paris, and with but little aid
 from masters, instructed himself from the works of Euler, Lagrange,
 and Laplace, instead of resorting to the manuals where science is
retailed at second-hand.      In 1803, when he was eighteen years of
 age, he was received by the younger Monge at Toulouse, and a
 year afterwards, on account of the superiority of his scienti<U+FB01>c attain
 ments to the rest of his companions, he was recommended by the
 elder Monge to the Observatory at Paris. This occasioned a change
 in his original destination, and opened for him a career far more
 useful to science and mankind.    Whilst in the capacity of observer
 at this national establishment, he occupied himself with researches
 of the greatest value to astronomy and physics.
    The death of the astronomer Mechajn had interrupted the measure
 ment of the meridian of France, undertaken to determine the <U+FB01>gure
 of the earth. and to establish, on a scienti<U+FB01>c basis, the unit of the
  decimal system of measures adopted by the National
                                                           26Okonvention.

                                  360
For   this object, Delambre and Mechain had already measured the
part of the meridian between Dunkirk and Barcelona.        To continue
this operation to the Balearic islands, Messrs. Biot and Arago set
out for Spain in the year 1806, and were joined by the Spanish
 commissioners,    Chaix and Rodriguez. In April, 1807, M. Biot
returned to Paris to announce the results which had already been
obtained, and Arago was left with M. Rodriguez to perform all the
operations necessary to unite, geodesically, the islands of Majorca,
Ivica, and Formentera; he thus measured, by means of a single tri
angle, a meridional arc of a degree and a half.         At this time,
rumours of the approaching war between France and Spain caused
the Majorcans to regard with suspicion the nocturnal signals made
 on the heights of Galatzo, which they imagined were intended to
 direct the march of the French troops; Arago was thereupon taken
up as a spy, and imprisoned, on the 2nd of June, 1808, in the citadel
 of Belver, from whence he contrived to escape with his instruments,
 and embarked on the 28th of July for Algiers.
    The French consul procured him a passage, on the 13th of the
same month, for Marseilles; but on entering the bay of Lyons, when
in sight of the coast of Provence, the ship he was on board was
 captured by a Spanish privateer, and carried to Rosas on the 16th
of August. After residing for some time in a windmill, and passing
himself off as a travelling pedler, he was imprisoned, with the com
panions of his voyage, on the 25th of September, in the fort of the
Trinity, and on the 17th of October was thrown into the hulks of
Palamos, where he underwent great hardships, and was often left for
 two days together without food.      It happened that the Algerine
vessel in which Arago was captured, contained two lions sent as a
present by the Dey to the Emperor Napoleon ; one of these animals
 had died in consequence of neglect or ill-treatment on the part of
the Spaniards, and the Dey threatened reprisals on the Spanish
government unless satisfaction was given, and the vessel immediately
restored.     On the 28th of November, 1808, Arago reimbarked for
Marseilles, but in consequence of the incompetence of the pilot,
after being driven about the Mediterranean for several days, was
landed at Bougie, from whence he proceeded on foot, disguised as
an Arab, to Algiers.    He arrived at this city on the 26th of Decem
ber, but a revolution had taken place immediately          before; the
former Dey had just been beheaded, and disputes having arisen
between the French and Algerine governments, the new Dey refused
Arago permission to depart, and, had it not been for the protection
of the Danish consul, the future academician would have been sent
as a slave to the galleys.     Fortunately, another revolution broke
out; the new Dey was hung, and Arago was enabled to leava
Algiers on the 21st of June, 1809 ; but his misfortunes had not yet
entirely ceased, for when he was in sight of Marseilles, the vessel in
which he had embarked was pursued by an English frigate, from
which however it escaped, and Arago was safely landed, after his
three years of adventure, with all his instruments, at Marseilles on
the 2nd of July.

                                      361
      On the 17th of September, 1809, Arago was nominated to suc
   ceed Lalande    as member of the Academy of Sciences by forty-seven
   out of. <U+FB01>fty votes.   He was then only twenty-three years of age.
      A short time after Arago's admission into the Institute, he was
   appointed professor at the Polytechnic School, where, on account of
   the variety and extent of his knowledge, he was able to give success
  ively <U+FB01>ve courses on di<U+FB01>'erent subjects.      He was also chosen Exa
  miner of the Engineer and Artillery o<U+FB01>icers leaving the School of
  Application at Metz.       In 1812 the Bureau of Longitudes appointed
  Arago to give a course of lectures on astronomy at the Observatory,
  and this course was continued           until 1845 ; a more eloquent
  expounder of the truths of science was never heard within these or
  any other walls, and crowded audiences from every class of society
  followed, with pro<U+FB01>t and pleasure, the facile expositor of subjects so
  dif<U+FB01>cult.    It was justly said by the present ruler of France, when in
  his captivity at Ham, that Arago “ possessed, in ahigh degree, those
  two faculties so dif<U+FB01>cult to meet in the same man; that of being the
 grand priest of science, and of being able to initiate the vulgar into
 its mysteries.”
     In 1821, Arago was engaged in making geodesical observations
 on the coasts of France and England, and in 1822 he was nominated
 member of the Bureau of Longitudes.            The notices, which from
 1824 to the present time, Arago furnished to the Annuaire of the
Bureau of Longitudes, for the instruction of the unlearned public on
various important points of science, are perfect models of what such
writings should be. In the words of M. Combes, President of the
                “
Academy,          They will always be reperused with the same pleasure
by men of science and by the ordinary reader; in them we <U+FB01>nd an
admirable clearness, with an erudition as correct as it is extensive,
and joined thereto, the most rigorous accuracy in the statement of
the phenomena, and the consequences which result from them."
     On the 7th of June, 1830, Arago obtained the honour which he
valued the highest, being elected to succeed Fourier as Perpetual
Secretary of the Academy of Sciences. He received on this occasion
thirty-nine out of forty-four votes.
     After the revolution of 1830 broke out, Arago entered into poli
tical life; he was elected deputy for his native department, and
became a member of the Municipal Council of Paris.           In both these
capacities he had many opportunities of rendering service to science
and advancing public improvements.                              ~
     The revolution of 1848 evolved another change in the fortunes of
Arago ; he became one of the members of the Provisional Govern
ment, and was nominated Minister both of the Marine and of War.
On his retirement from these onerous o<U+FB02>ices, for his services in
which he never made the slightest demand upon the national trea
sury, disheartened with the state of public affairs, he entirely relin
quished politics, and devoted himself with renewed ardour to his
duties as Secretary of the Academy; be commenced putting in order
and perfecting his numerous unpublished researches, and continued
to do so until increasing in<U+FB01>rmities prevented him. In May 1852

                                    362
 he was called upon, with all other public functionaries, to take the
 oath of allegiance to Louis Napoleon, as President of the Republic ;
 this his antecedents and his convictions would not allow him to do,
and he resolved, rather than put this constraint on his conscience,
 to abandon the establishment with which his name had been so
 gloriously identi<U+FB01>ed.    Happily, he was spared this wrong ; the
 Prince President authorized his Minister to inform him, that he
 made “ a special exception in favour of a philosopher whose labours
 had rendered France illustrious, and whose existence the Govern
 ment would be loath to sadden.”       Arago did not long survive this
 event; a complication of disorders was carrying him to the grave ;
 he returned, after a painful journey to his native place, seriously
 indisposed, and died at the Observatory, on the 2nd of October in
 the present year. His funeral took place on the 5th, at the cemetery
 of Pere la Chaise; a brigade of infantry marched with the procession,
 and the Emperor was represented at the ceremony by Marshal
 Vaillant, Grand Marshal of the palace.       Though it rained inces
 santly, above 3000 persons attended the funeral cortége.
    Arago was but once married, and had the misfortune to lose his
 wife, a lady of great accomplishments, in 1829.       He has left two
 sons: Emanuel, a member of the Parisian bar, and formerly repre
 sentative with his father for the Oriental Pyrenees; and Alfred, a.
 painter of distinguished reputation.
     It now remains to give a short retrospect of the most prominent
 original investigations in physical science made by this indefatigable
 philosopher during the intervals of a busy and sometimes agitated life.
    The important discoveries of Malus relating to polarized light
 attracted the attention of Arago strongly to this new and fertile <U+FB01>eld
 of physical research, and on the 11th of August, 1811, he read to
 the Academy a memoir abounding with new and beautiful facts, each
 forming a starting-point for subsequent investigations which have
 extended in no mean degree our knowledge of the laws of light. In
 this valuable communication, M. Arago examined, for the <U+FB01>rst time,
 the changes in the properties of polarized rays when they pass
 through plates of mica, sulphate of lime, and other crystals; he
 showed that they acquire the property of being divided by a bi
 refringent prism into two complementary coloured pencils; and he
 examined the changes of colour and intensity dependent on the
 thickness of the plate, its inclination to the ray, its rotation in its
 own plane, and the rotation of the analysing prism ; he also ascer
 tained that when the emergent light was re<U+FB02>ected from a glass plate
 at the polarizing angle, only a single-coloured image appeared, which
 changed to the complementary colour when the mirror was turned
 round 90°, the angles of incidence and re<U+FB02>exion remaining constant.
 He also discovered the different remarkable modi<U+FB01>cations which a
 polarized ray undergoes when transmitted through a thick plate of
 rock crystal cut perpendicular to its axis, viz. that it is analysed
 by a bi-refringent prism into two complementary rays which remain
  the same, however the plate is turned in its own plane, and pass
  through all changes of colour in successive order, when the analysing

                                    363
prism is turned round ; phaenomena very different from those of the
crystalline plates he at <U+FB01>rst examined. These experiments, followed
by the more extensive researches of Biot, Fresnel, Brewster, and
many more recent investigators, have created a beautiful and import- ,
ant branch of physical optics, designated that of chromatic polar
ization. In this memoir it was also <U+FB01>rst announced, that while the
light from a clouded sky undergoes no modi<U+FB01>cation, that re<U+FB02>ected
from the atmosphere when the sky is unclouded is polarized, the
intensity of the polarization varying with the hour of the day, and
the position of the point with respect to the sun.
     In 1816 Arago published a fact which has been generally received
as an experimmtum crilcis between the two rival theories of light,
that of emission and that of undulations.        Dr. Young had shown
 that two rays of light, emanating from the same source, act con
jointly when they pass over equal paths, or paths differing by an
 even number of times a certain very small quantity, and that they
 destroy each other when this difference is an uneven number of
 times the same quantity ; whence it follows that the interference of
 two rays under the stated circumstances produces a series of fringes
 alternately dark and bright.       Dr. Young further ascertained that
 the interposition of an opaque screen in the path of one of the rays
 completely prevents the formation of the fringes. Arago ascertained
  that if one of the rays be made to pass through a thin transparent
  <U+FB01>lm, such as glass, the fringes are displaced towards the side to
  which it is applied, the magnitude of the displacement depending on
  the thickness of the <U+FB01>lm.     This proves that the transmitted ray has
  been retarded in its passage, a result conformable with the theory
  of undulations, but in direct opposition to that of emission.   Arago
  subsequently showed how this principle might be employed to mea
  sure the minutest differences in the refractive densities of bodies, to
  resolve various delicate questions in physics, and in the construction
  of new meteorological instruments.
      In 1819 Arago and Fresnel published their joint experiments on
  the action which rays of polarized light exert on each other.     By a
  variety of ingenious methods, they proved that rays polarized in the
  same plane mutually interfere with each other, producing fringes as
  in the case of ordinary. light; while rays polarized in planes at right
   angles manifest no appreciable action on each other.        They also
   showed that two rays primitively polarized at right angles to each
   other and afterwards brought to similar planes of polarization, pro
   duce fringes only when they have proceeded from a pencil originally
   polarized in the same plane.     These new properties enabled Fresnel
   to give a complete explanation of the production of colours in cry
   stalline plates, which Dr. Young had before referred to the interfe
   rence of the transmitted rays, though he was unable to explain in
   what circumstances the interference took place, or why we see no
   colours unless polarized light be transmitted through the crystalline
   plates.                                                 .
       Hitherto Arago’s original researches had been con<U+FB01>ned to subjects
   connected with Astronomy and Physical Optics, but the great dis
   covery of (Ersted~ gave his inventive ingenuity another direction.

                                   364
On the 4th September, 1820, he gave an account to the Academy of
the recent investigations of the Danish philosopher, and was in con
sequence charged to repeat them before that body.            In preparing
these experiments he ascertained some hitherto unobserved pheno
mena.     M. (Ersted had discovered the action which the voltaic
current exerts on a steel needle previously magnetized; M. Arago
found that the same current developes the magnetic power in bars
of iron or steel, which are at <U+FB01>rst deprived of this property, and that
the magnetism thus communicated to soft iron is temporary, ceasing
with the removal of the current, while that imparted to steel is per
manent.      He also found, adopting a suggestion of Ampere’s, that
steel needles were more strongly magnetized by placing them within
a helix forming part of the circuit.     These discoveries subsequently
led, in the hands of others, to the invention of the electro-magnet
and its valuable applications ; also to a ready means of making per
manent magnets of great power.
    On the 22nd of November, 1824, Arago communicated to the
Academy the results of a series of experiments, showing the in<U+FB02>uence
which metals, not magnetic, and other substances exert on the mag
netic needle; this effect being to diminish rapidly the amplitude of
the oscillations without sensibly changing their duration: and on
the following 7th of March he announced a still more remarkable
discovery, the reverse, as it were, of the preceding.      Since a needle
in motion is stopped by a plate at rest, M. Arago thought that a
needle at rest ought to be carried along by a plate in motion; and he
accordingly found that on rotating a copper plate, for instance, beneath
a magnetic needle, the needle was moved out of the magnetic meridian
and stopped in a position more distant from it in proportion as the
rotation of the plate was more rapid ; and if this motion were suf
<U+FB01>ciently quick, the needle rotated itself continuously round the
thread from which it was suspended.        He added some further facts
 relating to this subject on July 23rd, 1826.       These beautiful ex
periments proved the important fact, that bodies, which in a state of
rest exert no action on a magnet, become capable, when they are in
motion, of acting upon it as if they are magnetic.            Mechanical
motion was thus, for the <U+FB01>rst time, shown to play an important part
in the manifestations of electric phenomena.         No satisfactory ex
planation was, however, given of these experiments until Faraday,
in 1832, referred them to the more general laws of electro-magnetic
induction which he had then discovered.
    In 1839,Arago laid before the Academya proposed system of experi
 ments by means of which the theory of emission and that of undula
 tions might be submitted to decisive proofs. The object of this cofnmu
 nication was to show that the method invented and employed by Mr.
 Wheatstone to measure the velocity of electricity in metallic conduct
 ors, was equally applicable to measure the comparative velocities of
light in air and in a liquid. By following the indications of this memoir
 and employing Mr. Wheatstone's revolving mirror, aided by many
original and ingenious arrangements of his own, M. Foucault has re
cently completely succeeded in realizing these anticipations of Arago.
    A passing allusion is all that can be made to other important in

                                   365
vestigations of this active-minded philosopher.        We owe to him
the discovery of a neutral point in the polarization of the atmo
sphere; the determination, by simultaneous hourly observations with
M. Kupifer of Kasan, of the synchronous perturbations of the mag
netic needle at places very distant from each other; a series of deli
cate experiments in photometry, and various exPerimental           veri<U+FB01>
cations of Fresnel’s theory; a new method of measuring the dia
meters of the planets; and many valuable astronomical and meteor
ological observations.
   In the autumn of 1834 Arago visited this country. His principal
object was to make himself acquainted with the methods of observa
tion employed at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, then under
the direction of Mr. Pond.      He also attended the meeting of the
British Association which was that year held at Edinburgh ; on this
occasion he received a diploma of the freedom of the city, and was
nominated an honorary member of the Association. He made several
interesting communications to the Physical Section; and the Com
mittee having requested him to state his views as to any points on
which it appeared to him it might be useful for the British Associa
tion to co-operate with the Institute of France, he noticed in par
ticular "the great advantage which might be expected to accrue
to magnetical science from the establishment of observatories fur
nished with adequate instruments, and under the superintendence of
a competent observer, throughout the extensive possessions of the
British empire, and dwelt on the necessity of arranging magnetical
observations upon a uniform and well-approved plan."
   The ensuing year the Committee of the British Association acted
on this suggestion, by resolving that an application should be made
to the Government to carry it into effect. In 1836, the Royal Society,
on whose attention the subject was strongly urged by Baron von
Humboldt, added its weight to the recommendation, and the joint
endeavours of these two bodies resulted in the establishment by Her
Majesty’s Government and the East India Company, of numerous
magnetic observatories in widely separated parts of the British domi
nions, co-operating with others instituted in various parts of Europe
and the United States of America.       It is to be regretted, that, not
withstanding M. Arago’s strong interest in this great scienti<U+FB01>c
combination,   no corresponding     observations were made in Paris ;
Algiers having been the only station established at his suggestion
in the French Empire.
   M. Arago was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society in
 1818, and on two subsequent occasions the Council of that body
marked their sense of his high scienti<U+FB01>c merits by adjudging to him
in 1825 the Copley Medal, “ for his discovery of the magnetic pro
perties of bodies not containing iron,” and again in 1850, the Rum
ford Medal,
             “ for his
                       experimental investigations on polarized light."
   The late Rev. Cn'antss Turmoa, M.A., F.R.S., and F.R.A.S.,
was an ardent benefactor to Science.       He was born in Lincolnshire
on the 10th of August, 1768; and after receiving the <U+FB01>rst rudiments
of education at Grantham, graduated in Trinity College, Cambridge.
On the 15th of May, 1802, he was instituted to the Vicarage of

                                    366
 Wendover, at the foot of the range of the Chiltern Hills, in Buck
 inghamshire; the duties of which he faithfully exercised for many
 years.    In 1818 he was collated to the prebendal stall of Sutton
 in-the-Marsh, in the cathedral church of Lincoln, by Bishop Prety
 man Tomline, on the death of the Rev. Dr. Charles Barney; and in
  1825, obtained a dispensation to hold the vicarage of Milton Ernest,
 in the county of Bedford. He resigned this Vicarage, and all other
preferments, excepting his prebend, in 1837.       Beloved and respected
 by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, he passed a long
life in active utility, and died on the 12th of January, 1853.
    Mr. Turner was descended from an ancient family of Stoke
 Rochford, and Penton House in the county of Lincoln.              Among
 his ancestors were Sir Edmund Tumor, Paymaster to the Forces in
the reign of Charles I., who was taken prisoner at the battle of
Worcester in 1651 ; and his brother Christopher Turnor, one of the
Barons of Exchequer in 1660.         The property of Sir Isaac Newton,
being only three miles from Stoke Rochford, was purchased by the
family about four years after Newton’s death, and its integrity re
 mains much the same as in Sir Isaac’s time.       This circumstance led
 Mr. Charles Tumor during a series of years to collect medals, papers,
portraits, and all he could <U+FB01>nd connected with the illustrious philoso
pher, regardless of trouble or expense; and in 1847 he erected an
 obelisk, 64 feet high, in the park of Stoke Rochford, with an appro
priate inscription written by himself.
    The interest which Mr. Turner felt in the progress of science,
 is amply evinced by his valuable and useful donations to various
 institutions, and the liberal sums he bequeathed them.            Besides
being a real patron of the sterner branches of knowledge, he was
an excellent artist, and a critical judge of all objects of taste.
    There remains but to add, that Mr. Turnor bequeathed the above
mentioned interesting memorials of Newton to the Royal Society,
on the understanding      that the collection, which he did not live to
<U+FB01>nish, should be completed.
    On the motion of the Rev. Baden Powell, seconded by Dr. Roget,
the best thanks of the Society were given to the President for his
excellent Address, and his Lordship was requested to permit the
same to be printed.
    The Statutes relating to the election of Of<U+FB01>cers and Council having
been read, and the Rev. John Barlow, and Captain Younghusband
having, with the consent of the Society, been nominated Scrutators,
the votes of the Fellows present were collected.

     A  paper was read, entitled “On some of the Products of the
 Decomposition     of Nitrotoluylic Acid.”     By Henry M. Noad, Ph.D.,
 Lecturer on Chemistry at St. George’s Hospital.           Communicated
 by A. Ho<U+FB01>'mann, Ph.D., F.R.S.         Received Nov. 17, 1853.
     The author refers to a former memoir in which he described the
 mode of preparation and properties of two new organic acids, the
 analogues of benzoic and nitrobenzoic acids in the toluyl or im
 mediately succeeding series, and to which the names of toluylic
 (0,6 H,, O“) and nitrotoluylic
                         '          (Cm H7 (N04) 0,) acids were con
 sequently given.
    In the present paper he resumes the study of the action of nitric
 acid on cymol (020 H“), and describes <U+FB01>rst some unsuccessful
 attempts to procure from that oil the substitution compound
 C,0           , from which, by the action    of reducing agents, he had
      {    4}
hoped    to procure a new organic base homologous           with aniline,
toluidine, &c,      He then investigates the products of the decompo
sition of his new nitrogen acid.       He describes the preparation and
properties of nitrotoluylamide                         NH,,   and having
                                     0,6{360 4 }O,,
succeeded, though by a rather tedious process, in obtaining this
substance in some quantity, he studies the action of reducing agents
on it. By the action of hydrosulphate of ammonia upon an aqueous
solution of the amide, a crystalline substance was procured, which
analysis proved to be homologous with the carbamide—carbanilide of
Hofmann, and with the anilo-urea of Chancel. The study of its
properties showed that it must be considered as the analogue of the
latter, that it is the true urea of the toluyl series, being a well
de<U+FB01>ned organic base, forming a series of crystalline salts, of which
the nitrate and oxalate were qualitatively examined.         A synoptical
view of these ureas is given, showing their relation with the urea
type.
    By the action of  a boiling solution of caustic potash on toluyl urea
(C, H, (CH    H7) N2 0,), a new acid was procured, the analysis of
which showed that it has three homologues in the benzoyl series,
viz. anthranilic acid, benzamic acid, and carbunilic acid, all of which
are represented by the formula Cl4 H7 NO,, the composition of the
new acid being expressed by the formula (C,6 Hg N04).
   The limited quantity of this acid at the author’s disposal, and the
great dif<U+FB01>culty with which itwasprocured, did not enable him todecide
positively with which of the above acids it corresponds, though its
    Pnocnxnmos or run ROYAL SOCIETY.            Von. VI. No. 101.      27

  mode of formation would render it probable that it is the true ana
  logue of carbanilic acid.     The determination of this question is of
  some interest, inasmuch as should it prove to correspond to anthra
  m'lic acid, a road might through it be opened for the introduction of
  a series of new substances at present entirely wanting, namely, the
  proper homologues of salicylic acid and its derivatives.     The author
  proposes to return to this subject, and he gives, in conclusion, a syn
  optical view of those corresponding members of the benzoyl and toluyl
  groups which in the present and former paper he has established.

                THOMAS BELL, Esq., V.P. in         the Chair.
     The following communications were read :—
     1. Extract of a Letter from Dr. Edward Vogel to Colonel Sabine,
  dated Mourzuk, Oct. 14, 1853.
     “ You will receive through the Foreign Of<U+FB01>ce a
                                                         packet of Astro
 nomical, Meteorological, and Magnetical Observations, made on the
  way from Tripoli and since my arrival here. My instruments are
  almost all in good condition, although their cases have split from
  the e<U+FB01>'ects of heat and dryness, notwithstanding their double, and in
  some instances triple, leather protection.    I saw the great comet for
  the <U+FB01>rst time on August 23, but others had seen it three or four
  days sooner.     Its nucleus was very bright, resembling a star of the
 <U+FB01>rst magnitude, with a distinctly de<U+FB01>ned disc of the apparent dia
 meter of Jupiter.      The tail made an angle of 86° or 87° with the
 horizon, inclining to the north. It was a single tail with almost
 precisely parallel sides.    Its length was 10° on the 25th of August,
  12° on the 26th, and 15° on the 27th and 29th of August.         I have
 seen here repeatedly the apparent <U+FB02>uctuation in the position of stars
 which is spoken of in the third volume of Cosmos, and have sent the
 particulars of my observations to Baron von Humboldt.           There is
 no regular rainy season at Mourzuk, but slight showers occur
 sometimes in the winter and spring, seldom in the autumn.        A heavy
 rain is considered a great calamity, as it destroys all the houses,
 which are built of mud dried in the sun. It would likewise kill the
 date trees, by dissolving the salt which is in large quantities in the
 soil.   About twelve years ago there perished above 10,000 date
 trees in the neighbourhood of Mourzuk, on account of a rain which
 continued for seven days.       The prevailing winds are south and east,
 the strongest generally west or north-west.        Twice or three times
 I have seen whirlwinds pass through the town, a phenomenon which
 was common in the deserts between Benioleed and Mourzuk. All the
 whirlwinds I observed turned in the direction from east by north
 and west to south.       In December and the <U+FB01>rst half of January the
 thermometer falls at sunrise (at Moorzuk) as low as 42°, and in
places exposed to the wind water freezes during the night.             At
,Sokna I found no one who could remember having seen snow; but
 at Ghadamis snow was seen by Mr. F. Warrington on the 15th of

                                     375
January      1851.   At Tripoli we had heavy dews at night; and I
phserved     the same until we had passed a small chain of mountains
 <U+FB01>fteen miles north of Sokna; from thence we had no dew, and it was
 even often impossible to get the dew-point with Daniell’s hygro
 meter.     In the desert the thermometer generally rose till 4P.M.,
 from the sand (which was sometimes heated to 140° at 1 P.M.) giving
 out its heat.     Earthquakes are unknown in Fezzan; slight shocks
 are sometimes felt at Benioleed and Sokua, as was the case the end
 of last May.       Shooting stars were observed in great quantities
 (about forty an hour) on the 7th, 8th, and 31st of July; very few
 on the evenings of the 9th, 10th, and 11th of August, averaging
 <U+FB01>fteen an hour, mostly coming from Cassiopea and Ursa Minor. On
 the 10th, at 8 A.M., Isaw in ten minutes three shooting stars coming
 from a Cassiopeaa, and rising right upwards towards the zenith.
 About 4 mm. on the 11th, I observed in a quarter of an hour about
 twenty very bright ones in Pegasus and Aries.      Shooting stars were
 numerous also on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd of October.”
    2. Notice of a Comet seen from      H.M. Brig Penguin off the Coast
 Of  South Africa.                                      u

    “ Sir,--—I am not aware that it can be of any service, still I have
 thought proper to write you, for the information of the Royal Society,
 that on the 1st of May 1853, on board H.M. brig Penguin, in lat.
 35° 0' 8., long. 21° 52' E., at 6h 30m P.M. I observed a comet
 bearing N.W. by W. &W., measuring from the centre star in the
 belt of Orion 14° 30', the altitude of the comet being 26° 19', its
 length being about 5°. It went down at 9h          m, bearing W. % N.,
 and from the altitude, time, and rate it appe       to move at, it must
 have been the <U+FB01>rst evening of being seen.      On <U+FB01>rst observing it, it
 appeared to be making a retrograde motion, or tail <U+FB01>rst, and not
 travelling as fast as the two small stars above it, as by the time it
 set it had approached very close to them: the weather <U+FB01>ne, warm,
 and cloudy.       On the 3rd of May a gale came on which lasted till
 the 7th, after that time it became rather indistinct, not being seen
 but when very clear, or by the aid of a glass.     Having sailed on the
 29th April from Simon’s Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and not hearing
 there, or seeing anything of a comet, in either the Nautical or Cape
 Almanacs, I concluded it had not as yet been observed, and there
 fore have thought it my duty to forward a rough sketch of its
 appearance on the days mentioned, and its positions, as near asl
 could place it with my left hand, my right unfortunately having been
 partially smashed and disabled on the night the gale commenced,
 and which also prevented me from measuring its distance from any
 of the stars, &c. A copy of the latitude, longitude, and bearings is
 from the ship’s log. I found on our arrival at Quilemane that it had
 been observed by the other two cruisers, but not till the 6th of May.
 I must apologize for troubling you with the above, but considering
 it as a point of duty that I should do so, I have the honour to be,
                             " Sir,

    3. “ On a New Method of propagating Plants." By E.                             J.   Lowe,
Esq., F.R.A.S., F.G.S. &c. Received Nov. 17. 1853.
    The author states that the experiment of a new method of propa
gating plants has been so successful, that he has taken the liberty
of forwarding to the Royal Society this short paper upon the sub
ject, for the guidance of those who are interested in the advance of
horticulture.
     It had occurred to him, that if a cutting of a plant were sealed
at the base. so as to exclude the moisture of the soil from ascending
the stem in injurious quantities, the method of striking cuttings of
most species of plants would not be so precarious a process as at
present; and accordingly some collodion was obtained in order to
make the experiment.
    With respect to this new process, he states, that immediately
upon the cutting being severed from the parent stem, the collodion
was applied to the wound, and then left a few seconds to dry, after
which the cuttings were potted in the ordinary manner.
    To test the value of this new process more e<U+FB01>'ectually, duplicates
of all the species experimented upon were at the same time similarly
planted, without the collodion being applied to them.
    Experiments were carried on in two di<U+FB01>'erent ways; one batch of
 cuttings being placed on a hot-bed, whilst a second batch was
 planted in the open ground, without even the protection of glass.
     First Batch—All of which were placed on a hot-bed on the 1st
 of September, and examined on the 1st of October :—

   The experiment, the author considers, speaks for itself.        Not
withstanding the season being too far advanced for the full bene<U+FB01>t
of the process to be thoroughly observed, still twice as many cut
tings took root treated by the new method as had rooted by the old.
The mortality in the open ground was increased by slugs having
eaten off above the soil some of the cuttings; those thus damaged
were examined after they had been in the ground            month, and         a                            it
was found that the collodion was quite as sound as when <U+FB01>rst ap
plied. It would therefore appear that the collodion seals the wound
of the cutting, and protects      from the fatal effects of damp, until
                                            it
roots are prepared to force through the covering of gun~cotton.       It
is further stated, that the application of this solution has been found
to be exceedingly bene<U+FB01>cial in the pruning of such plants as Euphor
bia speeiosa, Impatiens latifolia, Impatiens latifolia-alba, Hoya bella,
Hoya imperialis, &c., the cut branches being prevented from bleed
m     .
     gitthe author’s intention next spring to follow out this experi
           is
ment, in budding and grafting, as he considers that      will also be               it
useful in this branch of horticulture.
   Gutta-percha, dissolved in tether, was in some instances substi
tuted to heal the wounds caused by pruning; yet owing to this so
lution not drying as rapidly as collodion, the <U+FB01>rst, and sometimes
the second application was not suf<U+FB01>cient.
   The effect of these solutions upon cut <U+FB02>owers was very marked.
Two branches were gathered as nearly alike as possible; to the
<U+FB02>ower-stalks   of the one, collodion was applied.     These flowers
were placed in vases <U+FB01>lled with water; those coated over with
collodion began to fade in thirty-six hours, and many were quite

                                        378
dead in three days; whilst the <U+FB02>owers merely placed in water in the
ordinary manner remained fresh and healthy. Those that faded
soonest were Reseda adorata and Tropwolum majus, and those which
were least affected were Tagetes erecta and Senecio erubescens.
   4. “ On the Acidity, Sweetness, and Strength of Wine, Beer
and Spirits.” By H. Bence Jones, M.D., F.R.S.               Received Nov. 17,
1853.
   (1.) The acidity of the different liquids was determined by means
of a standard solution of caustic soda.           The quantity of liquid neu
tralized was always equal in bulk to 1000 grs. of water at 60° F.
   The acidity in different-—
      Sherries varied from 1'95 grs. to         2'85 grs. of caustic soda.

    The Burgundy and Claret have less alcohol than was found by
Mr.    Brande forty years ago in the wines he examined.       The Sherry
is now stronger, the Port is not so strong, the Marsala is weaker,
the Rhine wine is the same strength, the Brandy is as strong              ,
as formerly; the Rum is nearly half as strong again; the Porter is
stronger, and the Stout rather stronger than formerly.
    Lastly, the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of each liquid was taken.         As this
however chie<U+FB02>y depends on the amount of alcohol and sugar present,
and as these were directly determined, the speci<U+FB01>c gravity may be
taken as a distant control on the amount of sugar present.
    Thus, in those wines in which the amount of alcohol was the
same, the speci<U+FB01>c gravity was found to vary with the amount of
sugar found by the saccharometer.
    The results of the analysis of each sample of wine, &c. is given
in a series of tables, which do not admit of any abstract.

    The following papers were read :—
    1. “ An Inquiry into some of the circumstances and principles
 which regulate the production of Pictures on the Retina of the Hu
man Eye, with their measure of endurance, their Colours and
 Changes.”     By the Rev. W. Scoresby, F.R.S., Corresponding Mem
ber of the Institute of France, &c.        Received Nov. 19, 1853.
    The investigations of the author embrace three distinct cases,—
 the case of achromatic pictures; that of coloured pictures of un
 coloured objects, derived simply or mainly from the in<U+FB02>uence of light
 on the eye; and that of the spectra of coloured objects, together
 with certain applications of the results obtained to other optical
 characteristics,  determinations   or phenomena.
    The general mode of experiment employed in these researches is
 described as “ the viewing of illuminated objects with a steady <U+FB01>xed
 gaze at a special point, and then determining the impression on the
 retina by examining the images developed with closed eyes.”          The
 time of viewing the objects varied from a momentary glance up to
 half a minute, more rarely to a minute; and the mode of eliciting
 the impression was, primarily, by closing the eyelids into gentlest
 contact, whilst the head was kept unmoved, and the eyelids steady
 in their original direction.    Thus performed, the experiment becomes
 very simple and manageable, and the results, various as they are in
 colour or depth of tint, are almost unfailingly elicited and often
 curious or beautiful.
     Whilst the general    result of viewing an illuminated object is the
 production    of a clearlyde<U+FB01>ned     picture on the retina, appearing in
  certain cases instantly, or more commonly, from 3 to 5 seconds after
  the eyes are closed,-—the nature or quality of the picture, with its

                                   381
degree of endurance and changes, is found to present, under differ
ences in the circumstances, an almost endless variety.         Thus the
results, it was found, might be varied by differences in the time of
gazing on the object; by differences in the intensity of the external
light, and by the partial or total exclusion of the light of the room
from the eyelids; by alterations in the degree of compression of the
eyelids; by the movement of the eyeballs during the time of obser
ving the picture; as also by variations in the normal state of the eyes
on commencing the experiments.
   All these in<U+FB02>uencing circumstances had been made successively,
or sometimes combinedly, the subjects of special investigation by the
author; and ultimately, in most respects, he considered, so far as
his own eyes might be deemed to yield general phenomena, with
satisfactory or conclusive results.     Various experiments had been
made on the spectra derived from light re<U+FB02>ected from opake objects
in comparison with those elicited by light transmitted by transparent
substances, both white and coloured; as also on the differences in
the measure of endurance, the variety of their repetitions, and the
phenomena of their changes in colour, of the pictures photographed
within the eye, under curiously modi<U+FB01>ed conditions.
   The present communication,       however, comprises only a part of
these investigations,   the <U+FB01>rst of the cases referred to at the outset,
viz. inquiries respecting colourless pictures on the retina, derived
from the viewing of objects under low or moderate degrees of light,
or of pictures observed irrespective of chromatic effects.
    1. As to the effect of Time in the viewing of an illuminated object,
on the nature and permanency of the picture produced, it was
found that, in favourable states of the eyes, a mere momentary
glance (such as of a window viewed from the back of a room) was
suf<U+FB01>cient for producing a distinct negative picture of the illuminated
aperture, with the cross bars of the window-frame, which, under
certain changes, could be seen ordinarily for about 20 seconds, and
 under strong light, sometimes for an interval of a minute or two of
time, if not more.     But the impression from a continuous viewing
of a window rather strongly illuminated, for a period of a minute,
was very remarkable, the image remaining on the retina whilst the
experimenter was breakfasting, and also engaged in writing, so as to
be distinctly seen, on slightly closing the eyes, an hour afterwards,
and, in another case which he particularly describes, after a lapse of
80 minutes.
    2. Experiments on the effects of quantity or intensity of light, on
the visual spectra derived from uncoloured objects, showed that
such spectra were yielded by extremely low degrees of illumination.
The light, for instance, of the moon or stars thrown on a white
linen blind, produced distinct negative pictures of the slightly illu
minated aperture.      Candlelight gave also negative pictures of white
and black objects.      Low illumination from transmitted solar light
gave, in most cases, colourless pictures, appearing sometimes imme
 diately on closing the eyes, as by a <U+FB02>ash of light, or otherwise in 3
to 5 seconds in negative tints; these pictures, where the object had

                                    382
been viewed for some seconds, were found to fade away and subse
quently reappear in less dark shades, sometimes with several such
changes.
   3. The changes‘in the optical spectra from the partial or entire
exclusion qf light from the closed eyelids were found to be very
striking.    No matter how this diminution or exclusion of light was
effected,—whether by the thickening of the eyelids by compression,
or turning the face away from the light, or interposing the hand
or other opake substance betwixt the eyes and the light, or covering
the face altogether,—the spectra assumed a new character as to light
and shadow, ordinarily, but not in all cases, complementary to the
tints originally observed.     A total exclusion of the external light
still left the picture clear and distinct, with a continuance, after oc
casional changes, little differing from that of other experiments.
   4. This measure of <U+FB01>xidity of the spectra impressed on the retina
led the author to some curious results in obtaining duplicate or
multiple pictures of the same object.     Thus, by gazing at a window,
successively at different <U+FB01>xed points previously determined on, he
multiplied the cross bars so as to produce a picture of a window with
twice or quadruple the number of panes.        A white statuette, viewed
at different points in succession, whilst strongly illuminated, enabled
the author to obtain double pictures in black or grey, associated
according to the relation of the points gazed at, in unlimited variety.
Or viewing the statuette from two positions differing in distance, he
obtained images of different dimensions.      Double images, too, were
obtained by using the eyes separately; and also by looking at an
object nearer to the eyes than the statuette, so that the lines of the
axes might diverge at the distance of the statuette, thus beautifully
elucidating one of the chief causes of the indistinctness of vision as
to objects nearer to, or more remote from the eyes than that directly
contemplated.
   5. Complete pictures were also obtained by the combination of
parts separately viewed, whilst various impressions, however incon
gruous, were combined into one picture.      Thus parts of the statuette
were viewed, under the adoption of a moveable screen, so as either
to combine the separately-viewed portions rightly, or to transfer one
part, such as the head, to either shoulder, or to adjust two heads in
different positions.    Separate impressions, also, of segments of the
statuette were taken on the eyes singly, and these combined,          ac
cordingly as the same or different points of view were selected,
into perfect or distorted pictures.   The appearance of the parts of the
resulting spectrum,   however,  were  not always synchronous portions,
sometimes appearing and disappearing by separate or partial changes,
like the effect of the dissolving views of the magic lantern.
   6. Pictures, diagrams, printing, &c., were found, under due in<U+FB02>u
ence of light, to yield cognizable and sometimes vivid impressions
on the retina. Diagrams in black and white, or chequered surfaces
like that of a chess-board, gave very distinct pictures, always nega
tive, the squares coming successively into view, beginning with the
portion gazed at. The succession of changes, when the impression

                                    383
was strong, in this experiment was not a little curious, the perfect
image of the chess-board after bursting into view, gradually fading
altogether away, and then reviving, in les strung tints, in a series
of repetitions.
    Another curious, though anticipated result, the author also de
 scribes under this section,—the determination, by viewing the ocular
 spectra, of portions of diagrams or elements in pictorial or typogra
phical surfaces, which had not been noticed in the act of gazing.
 Thus, particularly on viewing a. line of printed <U+FB01>gures at a particular
 point, without noticing those on either side, a considerable series,
 right and left, were so plainly depicted on the visual organ as to be
 easily known ; whilst, in like manner, a point in a line of a printed
 placard being gazed at, the lines above and below came into view on
 closing the eyes, and could frequently be read.
    Of certain general facts elicited by this <U+FB01>rst series of investigations,
 the author notices, that in viewing impressions on the retina with
 closed eyes, all the pictures appear to occupy a position externally,
 similar to the effect when the objects are directly seen; that the
 spectra derived from moderate or strong degrees of transmitted light
 have prevalently the character of transparency, and those from very
 low degrees, most ordinarily, of opacity; that although many of the
 spectral phenomena the author had observed were well known to be
 capable of elicitation in the ordinary form of the experiment with
 the eyes open, yet the series of phenomena, as a whole, could not
 be so elicited, nor was it possible by such form of experiment           to
 analyse and compare the phenomena whilst in progress of change,
 which, in the form he had adopted, were usually exhibited as plainly
 as if the spectra were the real and immediate effects of ordinary
 direct vision ; and that such is the precision and such the cer
 tainty with which the pictures are ordinarily developed, after duly
 viewing any illuminated object, that the expected result, so far as the
 eliciting of de<U+FB01>nite pictures is concerned, hardly ever fails.

     2.                                                           Quadratic
  Forms, with a Table by which all the odd numbers up to 9211 may
  be resolved into not exceeding four square numbers.”               By Sir
  Frederick Pollock, F.R.S. &c.      Received Dec. 20, 1853.
     In examining the properties of the triangular numbers 0, l, 3, 6,
  10, &c., the author observed that every triangular number was com
  posed of four triangular numbers, viz. three times a triangular num
  ber plus the one above it or below it; and he found that all the
  natural numbers in the interval between anytwo consecutive triangular
  numbers might be composed of four triangular numbers having the
  sum of their roots, or rather of the indices of their distances from
  the <U+FB01>rst term of the series constant, viz. the sum of the indices of
  the four triangular numbers which compose the <U+FB01>rst triangular
  number of the two.
     Not being at that time aware of any law by which the series that
  <U+FB01>lls up the intervals could be continued, he subsequently turned his
  attention to the square numbers as apparently presenting a greater

                                   384
variety of theorems.     He observed that if any four square numbers,
a2, b“, c‘, d“, have  their roots such, that, by making one or more
positive and the rest negative, the sum of the roots may be equal to
1, then if the root or roots of which the sum is 1 less be each of
them increased by l, and the others or other be each diminished by
l, the sum of the squares of the roots thus increased or diminished
will be (12+ bQ+c‘-‘+d’+ 2. This he found to be only a particular
case of more general theorems.
    Theorem A.—If the sum of the roots a, b, c, d=2n—1, and n
be added to each of the less set, and subtracted from each of the
greater, the increase in the sum of the squares of the new roots
will  be 2n.
    Theorem B.-—-If the sum of the roots =2n+ 1, and n be added to
each of the less set and subtracted from each of the greater, the
diminution in the sum of the squares of the new roots will be 2n.
    By means of these he shows—
    Theorem C.—If any four squares be assumed which compose an
odd number, these may be diminished till four squares are attained
the sum of whose roots will equal 1.
    By applying the <U+FB01>rst of these theorems to four roots, the sum of
 whose squares is an odd number, the author deduces, in a tabular
form, the squares (four or less) which compose the odd numbers
from 21 to 87 ; and remarks that there does not appear to be any
limit to this mode of continuing to increase the sum of four squares
by 2 each time.      As, however, although this may render it probable
that every odd number is composed of four, three, or two squares, it
falls very short of a mathematical proof, unless it can be shown that
 the series can be continued by some inherent property belonging to
 it, he proceeds to examine the series, in order to ascertain what
 approach can be made to such a proof.
    Adopting a method similar to that observed in the triangular num
 bers, the author forms what he terms the series of Gradation, by
 means of which the series of squares which compose the odd num
 bers may be advanced by steps or stages which increase regularly
 and obey a certain law, and at which this series is, as it were, com
 menced anew from roots of the form n, n, n, n+1, or n— 1, n, n, n ;
 the form of the sum of the squares of these roots being 4nqi2n+ 1,
 and the series of gradation 1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, &c.   On
 this principle a more extended table of the odd numbers resolved
 into squares (not exceeding four in number) is constructed.        On
 this the author remarks that it is complete to the 96th odd number
 (191), that is, there are in this table square numbers which will
 form the odd numbers in succession, whose roots (some + , some —)
  =1 ; and therefore the expression 4n’i 2n+1 up to 4n9i 2n+ 191
 may be divided into 4 or 3 squares, whatever he the value of n.
 The numbers in the table exactly <U+FB01>ll up the interval between
                        47", 479, 479, 4852:8931,
 and                    479, 48", 48“, 489:9121,
          '
 whose difference =190, the difference between      the <U+FB01>rst term   and

                                      385
the last term in the table : it will therefore resolve into square num
bers any odd number up to 9121 + 190:9211.
    With reference to the mode in which the intervals in the table
may be <U+FB01>lled up, the author states the following general theorems re
lating to the sums of three square numbers, by means of which the
roots may be varied, and yet the sum of the squares remain the
same.
    Theorem D.—-If any three terms of an arithmetical series, and
omitting the 4th term, the three following terms be arranged thus,
                     a+b,         a+2b,           11+ 61>.
                       a  ,       a+4b,           a+5b,
the sum of the squares of each set of terms will be the same.
   Theorem E.—lf four numbers in arithmetical progression be placed
thus,                           a   ,      a+2b,
                            a  + 4b,       a + 6b,
and the sum of the 1st and 4th be divided into two parts whose dif
ference shall be four times the arithmetic ratio, as a+ 7b—(a—b'),
and the parts he placed with the terms, the greater with the less,
and the less with the greater, thus.
                       a ,        a  + 2b,       a + 7b,
                    a—b,          a+4b,          a+66,
the sum of the squares will be equal.
   Theorem F.—Let two numbers which differ by              21: be placed thus :
                              a + n,       a + n,
                              a—n,         a—n,
then if the sum of the four (4a) be divided so as to have the same
difference (2n), and the parts he placed, the less with the greater,
and the greater with the less, thus,
                      a+n,          a+n,        2a—n,
                      a—n,          a—n,        2a+n,
the sum of the squares shall be the same.

Edmund Davy, Esq., F.R.S., M.R.I.A. &c.               Received December 4,
 1853.
    In this  paper the growing importance          of manganese since its
 discovery,   and   its   extensive  distribution  in   Nature are noticed.
 Manganese is chie<U+FB02>y found combined with oxygen, but its oxides
 are commonly mixed with those of iron, and though different methods
 of separating them have been recommended, yet no very simple or
 unobjectionable test for manganese seems to be known.                  Two
methods for detecting manganese are recommended, viz.—
    1. The pure hydrated <U+FB01>xed alkalies, potash and soda, and espe
cially potash.     2. Sulphur.
     With regard to the <U+FB01>rst method. Though the compound Cha
meleon    mineral made by strongly heating nitre or potash and
 peroxide of manganese together,            has long been known. yet it
 appears   hitherto    to  have   escaped  observation,  that potash seems
to be a more delicate test of manganese than any other known
 substance.     The use of potash in this way is simple and easy;
it is employed in solution; equal weights of the alkali and water
form a <U+FB02>uid well-adapted for the purpose; different metals may
be used in the form of slips on which to make the experiments,
but a preference is given to silver foil, as it is less acted on by alka
lies than platina, and is more readily cleaned.          A slip of such foil,
about two or three inches in length and half an inch wide, answers
well. Solids, to be examined for manganese, are <U+FB01>nely pulverized;
<U+FB02>uids require no preparation; the smallest portion of either is mixed
with a drop or part of a drop of the alkali on the foil and heated by
a spirit-lamp (for many experiments a candle a<U+FB01>'ords suf<U+FB01>cient heat),
when on boiling the alkali to dryness and raising the heat, the cha
racteristic green manganate of potash will appear on the foil. The
delicacy of the alkali as a test thus applied, will be obvious on using
the most minute portions of manganese ores in <U+FB01>ne powder, and the
author’s son, Dr. E. W. Davy, readily detected manganese in a
single drop of a solution containing one grain of solid sulphate in
ten thousand grains of water.         The presence of other oxides do not
appear to impair the ef<U+FB01>cacy of this test.            A strong solution of
hydrate of soda in water, used in a similar manner, affords an ex
cellent test for manganese, little inferior in delicacy to potash, but
the latter is shown to be preferable.
   Carbonate of soda has long been regarded as one of the most
delicate tests of manganese, especially if aided by a little nitrate or
chlorate of potash, but that carbonate is much inferior as a test for
manganese to potash or soda, requiring a far higher temperature to
form the manganate of soda, and the aid of oxidizing substances,
as nitre and chlorate of potash, which are quite unnecessary with
those alkalies.     Borax, too, in point of delicacy is not to be com
pared with the <U+FB01>xed alkalies as a test for manganese.
   The author is of opinion that the <U+FB01>xed alkalies in solution and
silver foil will form a valuable addition to the agents employed by the
mineralogist and chemist in the examination of minerals, ores, 8w.

                                    387
   2. Sulphun—lf a little <U+FB02>owers of sulphur be mixed with about its
own bulk of the common peroxide of manganese, and exposed on a
slip of platinum foil to a red heat, sesquioxide, sulphuret and sulphate
of manganese will be formed, and by continuing the heat for a short
time, an additional quantity of the sulphate will be produced from
the sulphuret.     On treating the mass with water and <U+FB01>ltering the
<U+FB02>uid, a solution of sulphate of manganese will be obtained which
will yield a white precipitate with the ferrocyanide of potassium,
without a trace of iron.
    Similar experiments may be made with any manganese ores, or
with substances known or suspected to contain manganese.             The
quantity of materials operated on may be increased or diminished at
pleasure; but if increased, the heat should be continued a little
longer, to decompose any remaining sulphuret, and thus add to the
quantity of sulphate formed.         In the same way manganese was
detected in some minerals in which it was known to exist, and in
others in which it had not been previously found; likewise in soils
and subsoils, in the ashes of coal and peat, in a number of pigments,
and also in the ashes of different fabrics partially dyed brown by
manganese.
    Sulphate of manganese is formed, with sulphuret, when sulphurous
 acid gas is made by heating a mixture of peroxide of manganese and
<U+FB02>owers of sulphur, even in close vessels. The sulphate may also be
more readily obtained, in quantity, by simply boiling a solution of
common green vitriol in water for about a quarter of an hour or
upwards, in contact with an excess of sesquioxide of manganese in
<U+FB01>ne powder, till the solution affords a white precipitate with ferro
cyanide of potassium.
    Chloride of manganese may also be formed in a similar manner by
boiling an aqueous solution of protochloride of iron with an excess
of sesquioxide of manganese, or it may be made with greater facility
by dissolving this oxide in the common muriatic acid of commerce,
taking care that the oxide be present in excess.
    The brown sesquioxide of manganese may be made, not only by
means of sulphur, but more readily and better by mixing the com
mon peroxide with about one-third of its weight of peat mould, saw
 dust or starch, and exposure to a red heat in an open crucible with
 occasional stirring for about a quarter of an hour, or until the oxide
acquires    a uniform brown colour.
    The   sulphate and chloride of manganese being extensively used.
in dyeing, calico-printing and other arts, and in making the com
poundsof manganese, the simple means stated of forming those
 salts, free from iron (it is presumed), are material improvements on
the circuitous methods hitherto adopted.

                              “ On certain Properties of
    Supplement to a paper                                Square Numbers
 and other Quadratic     Forms,   with a Table, 8w.”     By Sir Frederick
 Pollock, F.R.S. &c.        Received Jan. 9, 1854.
    In the original draft of this paper there was a suggestion that all
 the terms of the series 1, 3, 7, l3, 8w. [there called the Gradation

                                                       388
Series] possessed the property that was exhibited as belonging to
the odd number 197.      This was omitted in the copy from some
doubt whether it was universally true.     Since the paper was read
that doubt has been removed, and it turns out that the property
belongs not only to all the terms of the series 1, 3, 7, 13, 810., but
to all odd numbers whatsoever.      I am desirous to add to the paper
this statement by way of supplement.        The property referred to
may be thus enunciated :-
   Every odd number may be divided into square numbers (not ex
ceeding 4) whose roots (positive or negative) will by their sum or
difference [in some form of the roots] give every odd number from
1 to the greatest sum of the roots, which
                                          (of course) must always be
an odd number.
   Or the theorem may be stated in a purely algebraical form,
thus :—If there be two equations
                                          a’+b’+c’+d’=2n+1
                              +0 +d=2r+1, a +1)
a, b, c, d being each integral or zero, 71 and 7‘ being positive, and r
a maximum; then if any positive integer r' (not greater than          be                         7')
assumed,     will always be possible to satisfy the pair of equations
                     it
                                       w2+w2+y2+22=2n   +1
                                       w +.z1 +y +z =2r'+l
by integral values (positive, negative or zero) of w, .r, y, z.
   Ihope shortly to communicate a proof of the above theorem, in
dependent of any of the usual modes of proving that every odd
number     composed of (not exceeding) four square numbers.

       A                                             Representation
of the Expansive Action of Heat, and the Theory of Thermo-dynamic
Engines."            By William John Macquorn Rankine, Civil Engineer,
F.R.S.S. Loud.           and Edinb. 810.    Received December      1853.            5,
            The author remarks, that     abscissa: be measured from an origin
                                                  if

of rectangular coordinates, representing the volumes assumed by an
elastic substance, and if ordinates, at right angles to those abscissae,
be taken to denote the corresponding expansive pressures exerted by
the substance, then any succession of changes of pressure and volume
may be represented geometrically by the coordinates of a curve.           If
such a curve have two extremities, the area included between the curve
and the ordinates let fall from its extremities will represent (when
positive) the expansive power given out by the substance during the
process represented by the curve. Should the curve be closed, return
ing into itself, so as to denote a cycle of periodical changes of pressure
and volume, then will the area, enclosed within the curve, represent
(when positive) the expansive power given out during one cycle of
changes.     This area is positive when increase of volume takes place
on the whole at greater pressures than diminution of volume.           The
area of such a closed curve represents also (when positive) the me
chanical equivalent of the heat which permanently disappears, or is
converted into expansive power, during a cycle of changes, for were
it not so, the sum of energy in the universe would be changed,
which is impossible.
   As the principles of the expansive action of heat are capable of
being presented to the mind more clearly by the aid of diagrams of
energy than by means of words and symbols alone, such diagrams
are applied, in the present paper, partly to the illustration and de
monstration of propositions previously proved by other means, but
chie<U+FB02>y to the solution of new questions, especially those relating to
the theory of thermo-dynamic engines.
   Throughout the whole of this paper, quantities of heat are ex
pressed, not by units of temperature in an unit of weight of water,
but by equivalent quantities of mechanical power, stated in foot
                                                       J
pounds according to the ratio established by Mr. oule’s experiments
 on friction (Phil. Trans. 1850), that is to say, 772 foot-pounds per
 degree of Fahrenheit, or 1389'6 foot'pounds per Centigrade degree,
applied to one pound of liquid water at atmospheric temperatures.
    A curve described on a diagram of energy, such that its ordinates
 represent the pressures of a homogeneous substance corresPonding
 to various volumes of an unit of weight, while the total sensible or
 actual heat (Q) present in an unit of weight of the substance, is
 maintained at a constant value ((1,), may be called the Isothermal
 Curve of Q1 for the given substance.       lts equation is
                                   Q: Q,
    If an unit of weight of a substance be allowed to expand, under a
 pressure equal to its own elasticity, without receiving or emitting
 heat, its actual heat will diminish during the expansion, and its
 pressure will diminish more rapidly than it would do if the actual
 heat were maintained constant.        A curve whose coordinates repre
 sent this mode of variation of pressure and volume may be called a
 Curve of no Transmission of Heat.         For every such curve a certain
 function of pressure, volume and actual heat, called a Thermody
 namic Function    (F),  has a constant value   (F A) proper  to the parti

    cular curve under consideration; whose equation is therefore
                                     F: F ‘.
       A curve whose coordinates represent the relation between pressure
   and volume when the substance is absolutely destitute of heat, may
   be called the Curve of Absolute Cold.      It is at once an isothermal
   curve and a curve of no transmission, and is an asymptote to all the
   other curves of both those kinds, which approach it inde<U+FB01>nitely as
   the substance expands without limit.
      The whole theory of the expansive action of heat is comprehended
   in the geometrical properties and mutual relations of those two
  classes of curves ; and all those properties and relations are the con
   sequences of and are virtually expressed by the two following theo
  rems :—
      Tanonnm I.--The mechanical equivalent of the heat absorbed or
  given out by a substance in passing from one given state as to pressure
  and volume to another given state, through a series of states repre
  sented by the coordinates of a given curve on a diagram of energy,
  is represented by the area included between the given curve and two
  curves of no transmission drawn from its extremities, and inde<U+FB01>nitely
 prolonged in the direction representing increase of volume.
      THEOREM   II.-If     across onypair of curves ofno transmission on a
 diagram of energy there be drawn any series of isothermal curves at
 intervals corresponding to equal di<U+FB02>‘erences of actual heat, the series
 of quadrilateral areas thus cut    offrom the space between the curves of
 no transmission will be all equal to each other.
      These two propositions are the geometrical representation of the
 application, to the particular case of heat and expansive power, of
  two axioms respecting Energy in the abstract, viz.—
      AXIOM I.--The sum of energy in the Universe is unalterable.
      AXIOM IL—The effect, in causing transformation of energy, of the
 whole quantity of actual energy present in a substance, is the sum of
 the affects of all its parts.
     The application of these axioms to heat and expansive power in
volves the following
     DEFINITION.—E.zpansive Heat is d species of actual Energy, the
presence of which in a substance afects, and in general increases, its
tendency to ewpand ;—
and this de<U+FB01>nition, arrived at by induction from experience, is the
foundation of the theory of the expansive action of heat.
     The <U+FB01>rst section of the paper is occupied chie<U+FB02>y with the demon
stration of the <U+FB01>rst of the theorems quoted and its immediate con
sequences, which are applicable to all substances, homogeneous and
                         ‘
heterogeneous.
     The 'second section relates to the theory of the expansive action
                                                                ‘
of heat in homogeneous substances.
     From the second theorem above quoted, it is deduced, that the
area of any quadrilateral bounded above and below by any two iso
thermal curves, and laterally by two curves of no transmission, is
the product of the difference between the two quantities of actual

                                     391
   heat proper to the isothermal curves, by the difference between the
                                                                         '

  sion, being represented by an expression of this form,

   While the area of a <U+FB01>gure bounded ab0ve by the isothermal curve
  of Q,, and laterally by the inde<U+FB01>nitely-extended curves of no trans
  mission corresponding     to the thermo-dynamic   functions FA, F5, is
  represented by                                 -
                                Q,(FB—FA).
     The area of a diagram of energy of any <U+FB01>guré is calculated by
  conceiving it to be divided, by a network of isothermal curves and
  curves of no transmission, into an inde<U+FB01>nite number of stripes or
  quadrilaterals, <U+FB01>nding the area of each and adding them by summa
  tion or integration. By the aid of these principles various problems
  are solved.
     In the third section the same principles are applied to determine
  the ef<U+FB01>ciency of thermo-dynamic      engines worked by the expansion
  and contraction of permanent gases without and with the aid of
  economisers or regenm'ators.     The e<U+FB01>ciency of a thermo-dynamic
  engine is the proportion of the whole heat communicated to the
  working substance which is converted into motive power.
     The maximum theoretical q<U+FB01>iciency of a thermo-dynamic engine
 working between the limits of actual heat Q1 and Q1, whether with
 out a regenerator or with a perfect regenerator, is expressed by the
 fraction
                                  Q1
                                     _ as
                                     Q
     A theoretically perfect regenerator does not increase the maxi
 mum e<U+FB01>iciency between given limits of actual heat, but merely
 enables that e<U+FB01>iciency to be attained with a smaller extent of expan
 sion, and consequently with a smaller engine.
     The fourth section treats of the relation between actual heat and
 temperature, which must be known before the propositions of the
 preceding sections can be applied to actual substances.       Existing
 experimental data are not yet adequate to the exact determination of
 this relation; but it is considered they are su<U+FB02>icient to show that a
relation deduced by the author from the Hypothesis of Molecular
Vortices (see Trans. of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xx.), is
at least near enough to the truth for all purposes connected with the
computation of the e<U+FB01>iciency of thermo-dynamic engines.        This re
lation is expressed by the formula
                                          + To):

privation of heat; and k, the mechanical value of the real       speci<U+FB01>c
heat of the substance.       According to computations mage     in 1852

considered suf<U+FB01>ciently correct for practical purposes.
   The maximum theoretical ef<U+FB01>ciency of every conceivable thermo
dynamic engine receiving heat at the temperature TI, and giving out
heat at the temperature   T,,  is

   The fourth section concludes with a system of formulae, illustrated
by numerical examples, for computing the power and ef<U+FB01>ciency of
air-engines.
   In the <U+FB01>fth section, the principles of the preceding sections are
applied to aggregates consisting of heterogeneous substances, or of
the same substance in different conditions, especially the aggregate
of a liquid and its vapour; and the results are applied to the nume
rical computation of the theoretical ef<U+FB01>ciency of steam-engines.

    1. A paper was read, entitled
                                    " On the Vibrations and Tones pro
duced by the contact of bodies having different Temperatures.”       By
J.  Tyndall, Esq., F.R.S.     Received Jan. 15, 1854.
   The author introduces the subject of his paper by a brief descrip
tion of the labours which have preceded his own, from the discovery
of the phaenomenon by Schwartz in 1805 to its revival and further
examination by Trevelyan, Faraday, Forbes and Seebeck.           The pe
culiar views of Prof. Forbes, who regards the effects as due to a new
species of mechanical agency in heat, were the chief inducement to
the resumption of the subject by the author.           He examines the
gronnd on which the theory of Prof. Forbes is based, and tests by
experiment the general laws at which he has arrived.         The <U+FB01>rst of
these laws is, that
                     “ the vibrations never take
                                                   place between sub
stances of the same nature.” By converting the cold metal on which
the hot rocker is placed into a thin plate, <U+FB01>xing this plate in a vice,
and causing the rocker to rest upon the edge of the plate, the author
obtained vibrations with iron on iron, brass on brass, copper on copper,
silver on silver, zinc on zinc, tin on tin ; and thus shows the <U+FB01>rst
law to be untenable.     The second general law a<U+FB02>irms that “ both
substances must be metallic.” As exceptions to this law, the author
adduces experiments made on about twenty non-metallic substances,
with which perfectly distinct vibrations were obtained. Among those
which signalize themselves by the force and permanence of the
rockings they produce, are to be found rocksalt, <U+FB02>uor-spar and
rock- crystal.   With rockers similar to those described in the paper,
and attending to the precautions there dwelt upon, vibrations and
musical tones can be obtained without difficulty on these substances.

                                    393
The third general law of Prof. Forbes states that “the vibrations
are proportional within certain limits to the di<U+FB02>'erence of the con
ducting powers of the metals for heat, the metal having the least
 conducting power being necessarily the coldest."          The evidence ad
 duced against the <U+FB01>rst law appears to destroy this one also.                The
author however proeeeds further, and reverses the conditions deemed
essential by Prof. Forbes.     Silver stands at the head of conductors;
 using it as the cold metal, he has obtained distinct tones with hot
rockers of brass, copper and iron, placed upon it.          These and other
experiments show that the third general law is, like the two others,
untenable.      Prof. Forbes further states that two of the metals, bis
muth and antimony, are perfectly inert; the author has however ob
tained distinct tones with both of these substances.                   He <U+FB01>nally
enters also into an examination of the arguments of Prof. Forbes
against the views supported by Faraday, and shows how the facts
adduced against the said views become, when duly considered, strong
corroborative evidence of their correctness.

     The following papers were read :-—
   1.   “ Sur la Théorie de l’orientation du Plan oscillatoire du
 Pendule simple, et son application    la recherche de l’aplatissement
                                                                a
 du sphéroide terrestre.”      By M. Oliveira.      Communicated      by
Charles Babbage, Esq., F.R.S. &c.       Received January 18, 1854.
     In this memoir the author <U+FB01>rst deduces a formula upon geometrical
considerations alone, expressing the deviation of a free pendulum
 (like Foucault’s) in terms of the latitude and difference of
meridians, or hour-angle; and this      done (as far as appears) with
                                                                is
out any reference to the dynamical considerations on which Foucault’s
formula    isdeduced, assuming only the inertia of the pendulum.
    The author’s formula assumes the earth to be asphere.        If now,
observation should give a slightly different deviation, the author
infers that this would be due to the elh'pticity of the earth; and in

                                       397
 vestigates a formula geometrically, to express the ellipticity in terms
 of such difference; and thus by accurate observations of Foucault's
 pendulum in different parts of the earth, he conceives the ellipticity
 might be determined.
    As an instance, he cites Foucault’s result for the latitude of Paris;
 which di<U+FB02>'ers by a small amount from the formula, and which he
 considers accordingly to express the ellipticity, though he does not
calculate it.

by G. B. Airy, Esq., Astronomer Royal, F.R.S. &c.                 Received
January 21, 1854.
   The author, after referring to the value of 71' to 527 decimals com
                                      ‘
puted b him and printed in the Proceedings,’ for January 20, 1853,
states I: at he has very recentlyextended and computed the valueswhich
form the subject of this communication to 205 places of decimals;
and as very great care has been taken to exclude error, it is presumed
there exist reasonable grounds for pronouncing them quite accurate.
At the same time it should be distinctly understood, that no direct
check or proqf has yet beenapplied tothevalues in question. He states
that the formulae employed in <U+FB01>nding these logarithms, are investi
 gated by Mr.      J. R. Young, in his ‘Elementary Essay on the Com
putation of Logarithms,’ pp. 13 and 14, and he considers that no
better formulae than these have yet been published for readily com
puting, to a great extent, the Napierian logarithms of 2, 3, 5, 7, &c.

      A paper was in part read, entitled “ Further researches into the
  properties of the Sulphate of Iodo-Quinine or Herapathite, more
   especially in regard to its Crystallography, with additional facts
  concerning its optical relations."       By William Bird Herapath, M.D.

        COLONEL SABINE, R.A., Treas.            and  V.P., in  the Chair.
      Joseph Beete Jukes, Esq., was admitted into the Society.
      The reading of Dr. Herapath’ paper was resumed and concluded.
      After referring to the observations of Professors Stokes and Hai
'
  (linger, as well as to papers already published by himself on this
  subject in the Philosophical Magazine, the author gives an account
  of a set of prisms perfectly complementary in their optical characters
  to those previously described by him, and proves this fact by an ela
  borate comparison of their various optical relations; from which it
  appeared, that whilst the a-prisms (those described in Philosophical
  Magazine for March 1852) were totally impervious to a beam of
  polarized light, re<U+FB02>ected from glass plates, when the plane of the
  length of the prism was at right angles to the plane of primitive
  polarization, the <U+FB01>-prisms (those now examined) were equally ab

                                       399
                                                                                '
   sorbent of avertically polarized beam, when the plane of their length
   lay parallel to that of primitive polarization.
       These prisms may be readily made _by the following process :—
        Dissolve 10 grains of disulphate of quinine in half a_<U+FB02>uid ounce
   of spirit of wine, having 3 grains of benzoic acid dissolved in it also;
   adding 2 drachms of water and warming the whole to complete
   solution, then upon adding a few drops of spirituous solution of
   iodine and placing in repose, prismatic crystals having the following
_  properties are produced :—
        1. When two are crossed in superposition      at right angles to each
                                                              ”
   other or even at 30°, the overlapped space is “ black        if the crystals
   are suf<U+FB01>ciently thick, but reddish brown or violet-red if very thin;
   in these respects they perfectly coincide with the alprisms.
        2. When examined by polarized light re<U+FB02>ected from glass, the
   vertical crystals now appear black, whilst the horizontal prisms are
   almost perfectly transparent to the polarized beam.
       3. Upon introducing the selenite stages beneath the prisms, those
   which previously obstructed the polarized beam and appeared “black,”
                            ”             ”
   transmitted the “ red      or “ blue     colours of the selenite <U+FB01>lms,
   whilst the transparent, horizontal prisms, exhibited the comple
   mentary colours, viz. the green or yellow.
       The last two completely decided their complementary character,
                                                    ”
   for whilst the <U+FB01>-prisms were “ black,” “ red        or “ blue,” when the
   planes of their length were vertical, the a-prisms were “black,”
   “ red ” or “ blue ” whilst the
                                    planes of their length were horizontally
   placed.
       4. But by mixing the two prisms upon one slide their perfectly
   complementary character was completely demonstrated, for when an
   a-prism was crossed at right angles by a B-prism, the square space
  where they overlapped was still transparent to common light; but if
   a, <U+FB01>-prism were overlapped by an a-prism, the length of the two being
  parallel to each other, the oblong space where they overlapped be
  came black from their doubly absorbent properties; in short, the
  optical examination fully proved the complementary character of these
  crystals length for length.
       It was further shown that two varieties of hexagons existed ; those
  produced from strong spirituous solutions were longer than broad,
  and possessed two acute angles of 65° and four equal angles of
   147° 30'.     Examined by a vertically plane-polarized beam, these
  were “black” when a line passing through the long diameter or
  acute angles was parallel to the plane of primitive polarization : these
                              ”
  the author called “ acute      or <U+FB01>-hexagons.     The hexagons produced
                                                                     ”
  from acetic acid solutions, on the other hand, were “ obtuse         in their
  character, and had two angles of 115° and four equal angles of
  122° 30'. These, when examined by vertically plane-polarized light,
                          ”
  were always “ black       when a line passing through the two angles
  of 115° was perpendicular to the plane of primitive polarization: the
  author called these “ obtuse ” or a-hexagons.
      The rhombic crystals which presented themselves were also “black”
  (examined in the same way) when their long diameters lay parallel

                                     400
'to    the plane of primitive polarization, but transparent when they
  were rotated 90°.
      It was also shown that the doubly absorbent powers of the primary
  rhombic crystal extended more or less on each side of the vertical
  position, through an arc of 60°, so that upon rotating a crystal
  through the whole circle, there were two arcs of 120°, in which the
  crystals were more or less darkened, and two of 60°, each in which
  the light passed through without loss; this transparency was of course
  at its maxinum when the longer diameter of the rhombic plate lay in
  a horizontal position, and gradually became less evident through an
  arc of 30° above and below this line.       By a careful measurement
  of the angles of the various crystalline forms and by the results
  of their optical examination, it appeared that they may all be ob
  tained from the right rhombic prism, the acute angle of which is
  65° and the obtuse 115°, the major axis being to the minor as
  1'57 to 1, whilst the prism itself had scarcely appreciable length.
  It was a mere rhombic scale; but considered as a short prism, the
  axes were Foam, Ml-f‘<U+FB01>, T<U+FB01>), the quantity for P“ not being absolutely
 determinable in consequence of its variability and minuteness.
     It appeared also that the a-prism and obtuse hexagon were the
  results of truncation of the acute angles of the primary rhombic plate
 or prism by planes at right angles to the plane of primitive polariza
 tion, when the crystals were " black,” when examined by vertically
 plane-polarized light; whilst the <U+FB01>-prism and acute hexagon resulted
 from truncation of the obtuse angles of the same primary form by
 planes parallel to that of primitive polarization, the crystals being
 “ black " when examined
                              by a vertically plane-polarized beam; and
 that the octagonal and square plates, and rectangular parallelogram
 resulted from the coincidence of these truncation planes in the same
 individual form.
     It was shown that the solvent medium had the power of developing
 these truncation planes, and it appeared that water produced the
 a-truncation, and spirit the B-truncation; and if the two opposing
 forces of water and spirit were made equal in intensity, they neu
 tralized each other, so that the pure primary rhombic prism resulted
 without truncation.
     It was further shoWn that hyponitric ether developed other
 crystalline forms, converting the rhombic plate into one of 75°
 and 105° by truncation planes upon the acute angles of the primary
 rhombic plate, cutting off portions equal to half the long axis,
 and leaving the shorter or transverse axis untouched.           By this
 means the new rhombic crystal appeared
                                              “ black " when the
                                                                  longer
 diameter was at right angles to the plane of vertically polarized
light, as if it had been rotated through 90°, whilst it absorbed the
polarized light as before.
     As from the examination of certain rectangular quadrilateral prisms
of the a. and B varieties, it appeared that Herapathite possesses
doubly absorbent powers of nearly, if not perfectly equal intensity,
in directions coincident with all three rectangular axes P“, M“
and T“, the author inferred that the development of their optic

                                     401
axes could not be reasonably expected in these directions.               He
considered that the biaxial systems of rings would be found to exist
in thicker crystals (when discovered), having triangular replacement
planes upon the solid angles, either of the shorter or longer oblique
diameters of the right rhombic prism, and the results of these optic
axes would be seen in a direction perpendicular to these surfaces of
replacement.
    The various formulae necessary to produce different crystalline
forms are given in detail.
    The author enters into a re-discussion of the double refractive
powers,      and attempts     to show that Herapathite          possesses a
                           “         ”
principal axis having positive          characters.   He also endeavoured
to measure the thickness of certain very thin plates, by the differen
tial tints produced by the exercise of their doubly refracting powers
upon the colours of the selenite stages, and found that these thin
plates raised the blue of the second order to the yellow and violet;
the red of the second to the violet and blue-grey ; and the green of
the same to orange and violet of the second order. Assuming, there
fore, this substance to have similar doubly refracting powers to
selenite, and of equal intensity, and also the same index of refraction,
their thickness may be estimated as equal to that of a plate of selenite
necessary to give the same difference in tint, viz. '000517 of an inch.
    These very thin plates no longer possessed the Cantharides-like
or brilliant metallic green colour when examined by re<U+FB02>ected light.
They appeared more like portions of the elytra of the Blatta
germanica' ; still re<U+FB02>ecting a polarized beam, but of a brown colour,
 and also retaining their doubly absorbent powers when examined by
 transmitted light.         "
    The author considers that his recent investigations indicate that
 whatever properties Professor Stokes may have assigned to the ray
re<U+FB02>ected from the a-prisms (which alone were experimented on by
him) in the principal plane of 'the breadth, must be equally true in
that re<U+FB02>ected from the primary rhombic prism in the principal plane
 of its length, i. 0. its long diameter; and whatever properties he may
have assigned to the re<U+FB02>ected, ray from the principal plane of the
length of the a-prism, will be equally true of that re<U+FB02>ected from
 the primary rhombus in the principal plane of the breadth, i. e. its
 short diameter.
    The paper concluds with some recently determined facts relating
 to the chemical characters of this peculiar substance.
    Its sp. gr. at 60° Fahr. was found to be 1'895.
    It is very sparingly soluble in ether, turpentine or water at the ordi
 nary temperatures, scarcely more than     <U+FB01>wth     part; boiling water does
 not dissolve T<U+FB01>l<U+FB01>gth part.      It does not appear more soluble in ether
 or turpentine by boiling. Chloroform does not dissolve it, but has.
 a great attraction of surface for it.
    Alcohol of '837 dissolves The; part at 57° F ahr., and by boiling,
 it takes up Fl<U+FB01>th part, which readily crystallizes on cooling in
 B-hexagons.
    Acetic acid, sp. gr. 1042, dissolves TIl-Fth part at 60° Fahr., and

                                    402
 I526th part at boiling temperature—iodine volatilizing if the heat is
 prolonged.                      V
     Diluted sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1'068‘2, does not dissolve it at the
 ordinary temperatures, but does so readily with the aid of heat,
 Sulph. acid, sp. gr. 1845, rapidly dissolves it.
    Diluted hydrochloric acid has but little action on it, but when
 concentrated, it almost instantly reddens, without dissolving it;
 upon boiling, it forms, a yellow solution, from which minute dark
 opake radiating aciculae deposit on cooling.
    Nitric acid immediately decomposes it even in the cold: upon
 raising the temperature, iodine at <U+FB01>rst volatilizes; then nitrous acid
 vapours are evolved.      Iodine is probably partially converted into
iodic acid.                                                       _
   'Hydro-sulphuric acid passed through its alcoholic or acetic acid
 solution at once decomposes it, converting the iodine into hydriodic
 acid, with separation of sulphur.
     Alkalies and alkaline earths in solution at once decompose it,
 removing the sulphuric acid and leaving a Naples yellow residue
 containing the quinine and a portion of the iodine ; a soluble iodide
of quinine is also formed in ammoniacal liquids.
