     On the      Relation   between Tropical        and Extra-tropical
        Cyclones."     By Hon. Ralph Abercromby, F.R.Met.Soc.
        Communicated by R. H. Scott, M.A., F.R.S. Received
        February 7, — Read February 24, 1887.             Revised April,
        1887.
    The author has long been engaged in the study of cyclones in the
temperate zone, as illustrated by those in Great Britain; but as doubts
have     been expressed by many meteorologists as to the identity
between tropical and extra-tropical cyclones, he visited, in the year
1886, the observatories at Mauritius, Madras, Calcutta, Manila, Hong
Kong, and Tokiyo, so as not only to procure more published materials
for the investigation, but still more to learn from conversation with
those who have had great experience of tropical hurricanes, some
minute details of weather which were of primary importance, but
which could not always be extracted from existing reports.
    Though he was not fortunate enough to experience a hurricane
 himself, still he obtained sufficient information to enable him to arrive
at a very definite conclusion on the matter, and now has the honour
 of laying before the Royal Society the results of his investigations.
    He wishes to acknowledge here the assistance he has received from
 Mr. Meldrum at Mauritius ; Mr. Pogson at Madras ; Messrs. H. F.
 Blanford and A. Pedler at Calcutta ; Padre Faura at Manila ;
 Dr. Doberck at Hong Kong ; and Messrs. Knipping and Wada at
 Tokiyo.
     It  will be convenient to sketch first the character of a British
 cyclone ; then to detail the researches in India, the China Seas, and
 Mauritius ; and, finally, to compare the results 'so as to arrive at a
 conclusion as to the identity or otherwise of the different kinds of
 cyclones.
     The typical shape of a British cyclone is certainly oval, the suc
  cessive isobars  being non-concentric as in the diagram, fig. 1. The
  longer diameter of the oval may lie in any direction relative to the
  path of the cyclone, and often shifts during the existence of the same
  depression ; but on the whole the tendency of the longer diameter is
  to approximate in direction to the line of the path of the cyclone.

Diagram of cloud and rain in a British cyclone. The full lines are isobars, while
     the dotted lines define the areas of rain and cloud. The full-line arrows denote
     the direction   of the surface winds, the dotted arrowB that of the highest
     currents.
The side of the cyclone towards which the isobars are packed may
also vary indefinitely, bnt is usually either in front or rear of the
longer diameter.        On the whole, the compression of the isobars in a
typical cyclone seems to be towards the rear of the longer diameter.
   The recognition of the oval form of cyclones is of the utmost
importance in discussions as to the compass bearing of the centre
relatively to the direction of the wind in any part of a storm field.
   Another most important point is the fact that a cyclone is not an
isolated phenomenon, but an episode in the general circulation of the
atmosphere.       For instance, most British cyclones are formed on the
northern edge of a great anti-cyclone which constantly covers the
North Atlantic, while tropical hurricanes are always controlled by
their surrounding areas of high pressure.
    Before every cyclone, temperate or tropical, there is always a
complicated re-arrangement of pressure surrounding the true storm
field ; and many of the errors which occur in the handling of ships in
hurricanes arise from a confusion between the premonitory and actual
disturbances. For instance, in the normal distribution of pressure
over the West Indies, these islands lie on the S.W. edge of the
great Atlantic anti-cyclone, and it is manifest that a hurricane cannot
develop as an isolated phenomenon without disturbing the distribu
tion of pressure beyond the immediate sphere of cyclone activity. It

                  Tropical and Extra-tropical Cychnen.                    3
is for this reason that a rise of pressure so often precedes both
tropical and extra-tropical cyclones.
    The typical rotation of the wind round a cyclone is undoubtedly
that of an in-going spiral, counter-clockwise in the northern, clock
wise in the southern hemisphere.        In the commonest British type,
when the general distribution of pressure surrounding the cyclone is
higher to the south than to the north, the greatest incurvature is in
the right or south-east front of the depression.       It is important to
note this, for we shall find a different position for the most incurved
winds in the China Seas and the South Indian Ocean.
    The author has not yet found a satisfactory instance of the centre
of the wind rotation not coinciding with the minimum of the baro
meter on a synoptic chart.
    Bnt when the sequence of wind and barometer trace at any single
station is looked at, it is sometimes found that the sudden shift of the
wind belonging to the centre occurs either before or after the actual
minimum. The author has investigated the details of several examples,
and found that the apparent anomaly is to be explained on the sup
position that the depth of the cyclone was either increasing or
decreasing rather rapidly.
   For instance, in one case he found that the minimum of the baro
meter preceded the change of wind by three hours, because though
the mercury was falling at the rate of 0-03 inch per hour owing to the
passage of the cyclone, the depression as a whole was filling up at the
rate of 0-07 inch per hour. The balance of rise was therefore 0"04 inch
per hour. Full details of this example are given in a work by the
author on " Weather," which is now in the press.
   The rotation of the upper winds may be briefly stated thus : — At
a level of about 4000 — G000 feet the wind is nearly parallel to the
isobars, and above that height tends to blow more and more outwards ;
but the amount of out-curvature varies in different parts of a cyclone,
and need not be particularised here.
   As a consequence of this we get the following law of the vertical
succession of wind currents from the surface of the earth : — Stand
with your back to the wind, and the successive layers of clond will
come continually more and more from your left hand. In the southern
hemisphere the succession is reversed ; that is to say, the upper
currents come more and more from the right.
   In fig. 1 the surface winds in a typical British cyclone are marked
by full-line arrows, while the direction of the highest cirrus is denoted
by dotted arrows.
   The distribution of rain, cloud, and weather generally in a British
cyclone may be described thus.       An area of rain, surrounded by a
ring-shaped district of clond, is associated with every cyclone.      The
rain area is not exactly concentric with the isobars, as it usually
                                                               r  2

4             Hon. Ralph Abercromby.           Relation  between
extends further     in front than in rear of the centre of the cyclone, bnfc
still both rain and cloud are obviously related to that point (see fig. 1).
But, strange to say, the kind and character of the cloud and the
relative warmth and dampness of the weather are not related to the
 centre but to the front and rear of a line drawn through the centre and
 more or less perpendicular to the line of propagation of the cyclone,
 marked " trough " or line of barometer change in the diagram,
 fig. 1.  For instance, the whole of the weather in front of that line
 is warm, muggy, and damp, while all in rear is cold and dry. The
 effect of this is that when a cyclone drifts past an observer, he expe
 riences a sudden change from warm and damp to dry and cold weather
 the moment the trough has passed over him.
     Then as to the kind of cloud.- — A thin ring of halo forming cirro-
 stratus or cirro-nebula fringes almost all the outside of the front edge
 of the main cloud ring, but this kind of sky is rarely seen anywhere
  in rear of the cloud ring of the cyclone.      Moreover all the cloud in
  front of  the  trough   is usually more or less stratiform — cirro-stratus
 and strato-cumulus      —  while that in rear is distinctly of the cumulus
type.
     The portion of the line of the trough that is drawn southwards
 from the centre marks out the position of a long line of squalls, and
of a very much more sudden shift of wind than the symmetry of the
 cyclone might have suggested.        Instead of veering steadily from S.E.
 to N.W. the wind jumps during the passage of the trough sometimes
as much as from S.S.W. to W.N.W., and then veers more gradually.
     Considering then both cloud and wind, the sequence of weather to
a solitary observer as a cyclone is propagated over him, the centre
passing to the N., will be as follows : — Cirro-stratus and halo will
appear in a blue sky, while the wind comes from about S.E. Gradually
the clouds get lower and heavier, as they gather into strato-cumulus ;
then rain comes on, while the wind has veered steadily to S.W.
    All this time the barometer has been falling fast, but suddenly just
as tho mercury has reached its lowest point a violent squall comes
on, during which the wind jumps suddenly three or four points from
the S.W. up to W. or W.N.W.             Almost directly after, unless very
near the centre of the cyclone, the clouds take the form of cumulo
nimbus, and then of simple detached cumulus, till the sky is com
pletely blue again.
    Any number of observers, situated on the southern side of the path
of the centre, will find their weather change suddenly just as the
mercury has begun to rise ; and we, therefore, conclude that a line
drawn across a cyclone at any moment, through all points where the
barometer has just turned upwards owing to the onward motion of
the depression,      divides the cyclone into two halves which have
different physical characteristics.

                                            "
   This line may be called the " trough of a cyclone        ; aud the cha
racteristic sqoall, the sadden rise of the barometer,    aud the jump of
the wind associated with the passage of that line, together with the
different character of the weather and clouds in front and rear of
that line, may conveniently be classed together as the " trough phe
          "
nomena of a cyclone.
   The word " trough " requires some explanation, as that term has
been strongly objected to by some.         The difficulty of realising the
applicability of the word arises from the difficulty of realising the
forward motion of a cyclone when looking only at a set of oval
isobars. But when it is considered that a cyclouic vortex is propa
gated somewhat after the manner of a wave ; and that a barograph
during the passage of the cyclone traces out a wave-like curve, the
word trough comes in naturally to denote the line drawn across the
isobaric plan of a cyclone to show all the points where the minimum
has been attained, owing to the motion of the depression.
   A cyclone is really a complex moving eddy of air. For some
reason or other, pressure decreases under this eddy in a manner which
is conveniently mapped out by isobars.        In ordinary language the
oval isobars are called for shortness a cyclone, but of course they
are really only the symbol of what is taking place in the air over
head.
   Isobars give the plan, barograms the sections of a cyclone, and it is
always difficult to realise the relation of one to the other ; but there
is no difficulty in the conception of a moving vortex of air, which of
course would have a trough like an ordinary wave.
   A stationary vortex, like a stationary cyclone, would have no
trough.     Suppose a stationary cyclone to form over an observer and
then to die out.       His barometer would first fall and then rise,
but there would be no trough, and he would experience no trough
phenomena.
   It is important to notice that the line of the trough does not appear
to be always at right angles to the path of a cyclone, whose longer
diameter is not perpendicular to the line of propagation ; and that
the trough phenomena are far more marked on the southern than on
the northern side of the centre in Great Britain.
   Taking a general view of the phenomena of a cyclone, they appear
to have a double symmetry — a symmetry round a point, and a symmetry
about a line. The rain area, cloud ring, and general rotation of the wind
are obviously related to a point, the centre of the cyclone.       On the
contrary, the quality of the heat, the relative humidity, the character
of the clouds, and a particular line of squalls have nothing to do with
a point, but are related to the front and rear of the line of the trough.
   No attempt has been made as yet to discover the origin of these
trough phenomena; but from the results of his researches in the

  Office, for all well-defined cyclones in the years 1872-76, and for part
 of the year 1879. The intensity of the trough phenomena wai
  gauged by the amount of the effect of the squall on the barometric
 trace, and the suddenness of the shift of wind at the same time.
        The result is given in the following table, by which it is evident

      The author has made many efforts to find traces of a central spot
of blue sky in the centre of a British cyclone.                       He has never
 observed one himself, and though such cases have been reported, he
is not satisfied with the evidence. It is very common to see a patch
 of blue sky directly after the passage of the trough, some distance
 from the centre on the southern side of a cyclone, and soon to
 experience wind and rain continuing for some time afterwards ; but

                  Tropical and Extra-tropical Cyclones.                 7
this is quite different from the central calm and blue sky of a tropical
hurricane. Though he cannot say that a clear-centre cyclone never
occurs in this country, it is perfectly certain that the phenomenon is
very rare.
                              Indian Cyclones.
    Attention will now be directed to Indian cyclones.
    The result of the author's investigations, both of the published
records of the various Indian meteorological departments and from
•verbal communications, gives the following as the general      character
of Indian   cyclones.
    The shape is usually oval ; but the side towards which the isobars
are pressed, and the consequent lie of the longer diameter, varies
much, even in the same cyclone on different days.
    The diameter is smaller than in the Atlantic ; but pressure
diminishes much more rapidly near the centre than in Europe, though
 the actual minimum need not be very low.
    The general surroundings, the formation, development and dissipa
 tion of cyclones seem to be essentially the same as in Europe. Thero
 are two types of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. Those in May are
 associated with the breaking up of a belt of high pressure, in a manner
 to which we find many analogies in Great Britain ; while those in
 October are formed in a general depression over the Bay, exactly
 analogous to the commonest conditions of cyclone formation in the
 Atlantic.
    Secondaries  sometimes   form on the side of the primary cyclone,
 but not nearly  so often as in the temperate zone.
    The motion of the cyclone is almost invariably towards the N.N.W.
 or N.W. at first, with a marked tendency to recurve towards the N.
and N.E. later on.
    The velocity of translation is much less than in Europe, varying
 from about 3 to 20 miles an hour.
    The rotation of the wind is always in an in-going spiral ; but there
 does not seem to be any marked tendency to greater or less incur
 vature in any particular quadrant of the cyclone.       The violence of
 the wind seems to increase as the centre is approached, which is not
 the case in the British Isles.
    The author does not think that there is sufficient evidence for the
 assertion that the centre of wind rotation is not coincident with the
 barometric centre of the cyclone.        In the cases that have been
 reported on board ship, which he has investigated, he is unable from
 the materials at his disposal to separate the barometric change due to
 the motion of the ship in her course from that due to the motion of
 the cyclone.
    For instance, if a ship were motionless, and a cyclone passed over

                       I
8            Hon. Ralph Abercromby.          Relation between
her, the whole of the changes in the height of her barometer would
be due to the motion of the cyclone. If the cyclone were both motion
less and of constant depth, while she moved, the barometric changes
would be due to her passage from a place of higher to a place of lower
pressure, or vice versd.   In practice, the ship and cyclono are always
both moving, and as an additional complication the cyclone is often
increasing or decreasing rapidly in depth.        Hence the difficulty of
dealing with observations near the centre of a small cyclone. Suppose
a ship was lying-to a short distance in front of the central point of the
cyclone, but that the depression was filling up very rapidly.        Her
barometer would begin to rise before the centre passed over her,
while the wind would not change till the vortex had passed. Then it
would probably be reported that the centre of wind rotation was
not coincident with her barometric minimum. The centre of wind
rotation would, however, have been always really coincident with
the centre of the isobars at any particular moment.           The whole
question deserves further attention. It should be noted that the blue
centre is also sometimes reported as non-coincident with the baro
metric minimum.
    There are very few observations on the motion of the upper clouds,
but so far as they go, the general circulation of the air in a Bengal
cyclone appears to be identical with that in higher latitudes.
    There are no sufficiently detailed observations to enable us to con
struct synoptic charts of the distribution of rain, cloud, &c., round a
cyclone ; but by generalising the sequence of weather in many such
depressions, we find squalls, showers, and dirty-looking clouds all
round the cyclone, with more violent squalls and torrential rain sur
rounding the centre.      The actual centre is always calm ; and though
blue sky does not seem to have been always observed, a cessation of
 rain is usually reported.
    This clear " bull's-eye
                            " is the most characteristic feature of a
 tropical cyclone.   Otherwise the only difference is that the rear of
 the disturbance is not so clear in Bengal as in temperate cyclones ;
 and that squalls are formed all round the centre instead of only in the-
 right rear of the depression.
    The sequence of weather to any observer appears to be as follows : —
 The first indication is always a strange coloration of the sky at sun
 rise and sunset.   The author has examined this point carefully, and
discovered that abnormal colours are developed not only bofore the
 barometer has begun to fall at the place of observation, but before
any appreciable depression can be found anywhere on the synoptic
 charts.   He has observed the same in England, and the fact is impor
 tant, as it proves that the examination of synoptic charts can never
 supersede the necessity of observations on the appearance of the
 sky.

                  Tropical and Extra-tropical Cyclones.                  9
   As the cyclone approaches, a peculiar uneasy way of blowing of the
wind is sometimes reported, and the sky grows dirtier and dirtier till
the rain appears to grow out of the air.     This has always been de
scribed to the author as characteristic of cyclone rain, in opposition to
the showery rain from cumuloform clouds which is typical of the
ordinary precipitation of the monsoon.
   This peculiar cyclone rain seems to be only an intensification of the
rain associated with cyclones in Great Britain.       There we see the
blue sky grow pale and sickly, and then grey, till rain falls from a
uniform gloom, and not from any defined cloud.         In thunderstorm
rain, on the contrary, we see mountainous cumulus above the rain.
   Sometimes the front of an Indian cyclone is accompanied by thunder
and lightning ; but all observers are agreed that the absence of elec
trical disturbance is a sign of very bad weather.
   As the cyclone approaches the rain increases, and the wind rises
into the characteristic squalls of a hurricane.
   The author has been able to find very few signs of any trough
phenomena during the passage of a Bengal cyclone.           Sometimes    a
rather sudden shift of wind is described, and a squall with a sudden
jump of the barometer, just as is so common in England ; but there
does not appear to be the immediate change in the character of the
clouds which occurs in these islands.
   Almost all reports agree that the weather is quite as bad in rear
as in front of the cyclone ; and the clouds in rear seem to retain their
characteristic wild and dirty appearance.       The bad weather, how
ever, usually extends much further in front than in rear of the
centre.
   Besides these   primaiy cyclones there is another class of small oval
 depressions,  which might either be called primary or secondary,
according   to the judgment of the meteorologist.
   These form in the Bay of Bengal during the rainy season — from
June to September — and though they are much less intense than the
 storms we have just described, their shape and the rotation of wind
 round them unmistakeably define their cyclonic nature.        The wind
 round them is never strong ; their special characteristic is rain.     It
 has also been observed     that they traverse the land and moderate
 mountain chains without material disturbance of their shape, while
 the great cyclones are invariably broken up or deflected as soon as
 their centres touch the coast.
    It has been suggested, with a great deal of probability, that these
 small cyclones are formed at a higher level in the air than the larger
 ones.   They will not be further considered in this paper.
    The following examples will illustrate these facts.     In figs. 2, 3,
 and 4 we give synoptic charts for India and the Bay of Bengal for the
 three days May 16 — 18, 1877.     These and the extracts from ships'

10          Hon. Ralph Abercromby.         Relation  between
logs are derived from an exhaustive memoir by Mr. J. Eliot, Meteoro
logical Reporter to the Goverument of Bengal, entitled ' Report on
the Madras Cyclone of May 1877.'
   The broad features of these three days are very simple. In all the
highest pressure lies over Burma and the eastern side of the Bay of
Bengal, while a cyclone which has formed to the east of Ceylon passes
up the western side of the Bay in a generally northerly direction. On
every day the cyclone is oval, the longer diameter approximating in
direction to the line of propagation ; but while the isobars are packed
towards the rear of the cyclone on the first two days, the centre is very
decidedly pressed towards the front on the last day.
   The cyclone increased half an inch in depth between the first and
second days, and the last day especially the steepness of the central
                                 Fig. 2.

permit of the isobars being drawn at regular intervals, or this fact
would have been still more obvious. The numbers 760, 757, &c., are
the approximate equivalents of the isobars in millimetres.
   The path of the cyclone is given in fig. 2. The velocity of propa
gation was —
          From 16th to 17th                      43 miles per hour.

   The rotation of the wind as an in-going spiral, counter-clockwise, is
very obvious, and calls for no remark.
   The following extracts from ships' logs will sufficiently illustrate
the sequence of weather in this cyclone : —
   The " Mistly Hall," on the west side of the cyclone, remarked a
fiery suurise as early as the 14th May, before the barometer began to
fall. On the 15th and 16th she experienced rain, lightning, and
squalls from N.E. to N. On the 17th, two hours after the barometric
minimum, the wind went from N.W. to S.W., with lightning, tor
rents of rain, and terrific gusts.       Twelve hours later tho storm mode
rated.
   In this report we see little trace of trough phenomena. The appa
rent non-coincidence of the wind sequence with the barometric
minimum cannot be fully discussed for want of sufficient observations.
There does not appear to have been any rapid filling up of the cyclone
this day, as, on the contrary, the lowest reading report on the 17th is
29/043 inches, and on the 18th rather less, viz., 28 95.           But we may

 12            Hon. Ralph Abercromby.         Relation between
 note a transference of the centre       from the rear to the front of the
depression, and we cannot determinethe course of the ship from the
 published log.
    The "Bride," also on the west side of the cyclone, reports a very
similar sequence of weather, and no marked trough phenomena.
    The "Witch," which passed through the vortex, ran out of Madras
 Roads on the 16th, with threatening weather, thunder, lightning, and
 St. Elmo's fire on her mastheads.         On the 17th she ran before the
N.W. wind, with a heavy gale and more thunder and lightning, right
into the vortex. Then she experienced a calm for 10 minutes, when
the wind flew to the S.W., with a sudden rise of 0-2 inch in the baro
meter, and thunder, lightning, and rain for 12 hours afterwards.
Then the gale began to break, but the sun rose on the 18th with
a pale sickly sky, like gold, green, and blue all mixed together.
    What we have most to notice here is the amount of electrical
 discharge all across the cyclone, the sudden rise of the barometer
as the first squall burst from the S.W. — exactly analogous to what we
so often see in England, — and the dirty sky in rear of the whole dis
turbance.
    The " Oxfordshire
                         "
                           also passed through the vortex only a day after
      "
the Witch." The weather was similar in both cases ; but the mer
cury began to rise on board the former at least an hour, and to the
amount of 0"2 inch, before the wind jumped to the S.W. The cyclone
was, however, filling up fast now, for while the lowest reading on the
18th was 28 95 inches, that on the 19th was only 29-36, a difference
of nearly 0-4 inch.
    The " Asia " passed on the east side of the cyclone. She experienced
rain and squalls on the 16th, and on the 17th also rain, squalls, and
lightning, till at 5 a.m. that day the wind veered suddenly from
N.N.E. or N.E. to E.N.E., just at the lowest point of the barometer.
 About four hours later the storm seemed to collapse rather suddenly.
Here we may note a sudden shift of wind at the passage of the
trough.
    There is only one observation on upper clouds. The Master Atten
dant at Masulipatam reports that on the 19th, while the wind was
from the E., the scud had a more southerly motion. This is the normal
vertical succession in the northern hemisphere.
    The above exemplifies the May type of Indian cyclone ; the next
illustration will show the more violent October type.
    In figs. 5, 6, and 7 are given reductions of a cyclone which passed
up the Bay of Bengal from October 30 to November 1, 1876.           These
and the extracts from ships' logs are entirely derived from another
exhaustive memoir by Mr. J. Eliot, entitled ' Report of the Vi-aga-
patam and Backergunge Cyclones of October, 1876,' our diagrams
referring to the latter cyclone.

   On the first chart for October 30, fig. 5, a large oval area of low
pressure covers the Bay of Bengal ; the probable position of the
vortex is marked by a small circle, but no reading can be given there
for want of observations.
   By next day, October 31, fig. 6, the centre has moved towards the
X.N.E., and the cyclone has increased enormonsly in depth.         The
lowest reading for the day, about 20 miles west of the vortex, was
28-1 inch.   As the next isobar is marked 29-6, the steepness of the

central depression is of an amount unknown in higher latitudes.
The longer diameter of the cyclone lies about east and west, or
nearly at right angles to the path of the disturbance. The portion
of the general depression which lay near Ceylon on the previons
day has now developed into a well-defined secondary over that
island. This is very interesting, as we very often see precisely the
same thing in our own country, when a long oval depression gathers
itself up into two regular cyclones, or into a primary and secondary.
   By the third day, November 1, fig. 7, the cyclone is dying out
over the delta of the Ganges, and the longer diameter is now nearly
in a line with the direction of propagation.
   The velocity of translation appears to have increased irregularly,
but on the mean the rate was 9 miles an hour between the 30th and
31st, though during the last six hours the rate increased to 12 miles
an hour, and no less than 22 miles an hour between the 31st October
and 1st November.
   The ship " Tennyson " passed about 20 miles west of the vortex.
 So early as the 28th the clouds had a bad appearance at daybreak.
On the 29th the weather looked very bad, with lightning and squalls,
while the barometer had begun to fall fast.             During the 30th she
had rain with furious gusts, but no lightning.         By 11 a.m. on the 31st
the wind went from N.E. to N.N.E., by noon to N, and by 1.30 p.m. —
just as the barometer reached the minimum of nearly 28-0 inches — to
 N.N.W. with a perfect howl, but no rain fell from then to 6 p.m. No

                     Tropical and EMra-tropical Cyclones.                 n
lightning was seen any time during the day, and next morning was
beautifully clear.
    In this description the absence of lightning in the " kernel " of the
cyclone is very noticeable ; also, to a certain extent, the difference
between the threatening clouds a long way in front of the centre and
the beautifully clear sky in rear.
    Thus, when we combine this with the sudden shift of wind and
increased howl just as the mercury touched its lowest point, we see
slight traces of trough phenomena.
    The " Palmas
                     " also
                             passed to the west of the centre, and expe
rienced slight trough phenomena.             On the 31st she encountered
thick rain with increasing gale from N.E., while the barometer fell
fast. At 6 p.m., when the mercury marked 28-20 — apparently its
lowest point — she had the heaviest blow, the wind hauling to N.N.W.
and N.W., with fearful vivid flashes of lightning, thunder, and rain.
By 7 p.m., one bour later, the gale began to abate.
    The "Allahabad" passed on the east of the centre.          By the 29th
a brickdust       suurise was observed, and by the 30th the weather
became threatening, the wind from S. to E., but the clouds from S.,
with squalls and constant rain.         On the 31st the cyclone commenced
with fury from E.S.E., barometer falling fast with rain and lightning,
and by 8 to 10 p.m., when the mercury touched its lowest point, the
wind veered to S.E. and S.S.E. to S., with lightning and heaviest
blow.     By noon the next day the weather was fine.
    Here, and in all the other logs, we should notice how much further
the bad weather stretches in front than in rear of the cyclone.         This
also is exactly in accordance with our experience of temperate zone
cyclones.

longer diameter was perpendicular to the line of propagation of the
 whole cyclone or parallel to the trough.
                          Typhoons in  the China Seas.
    Manila. — The author will now consider the nature of typhoons in
 the China Seas.      These are very valuable, as they can be traced from
 their origin in the Philippines till they gradually acquire an extra-
 tropical character in the Japanese Islands.       The notice will therefore
commence with the author's researches in Manila, where, through the
 courtesy of Padre Faura, he obtained an immense amount of informa
 tion, which has not hitherto found its way to England.
    The general shape of typhoons in the Philippines is undoubtedly
 oval, but the side towards which the centre lies is not only variable,

              Hon. Ralph Abercromby.           Belation between
but changes during the course of the same cyclone.             On the whole,
the centre seems to have a tendency to lie towards the front of the
typhoon.
   There seems to be very little tendency for cyclones to form
secondaries in these latitudes, and therein they differ greatly from
depressions in the Atlantic.
   On the other hand, we find the same tendency for two typhoons to
follow one another closely, and along the same path, which is such a
characteristic feature of extra-tropical cyclones.        For instance, the
typhoon   of  October  20, which will be illustrated presently, had scarcely
died out on the 22nd to the south of Hainan, before a new cyclone
formed on the 23rd to the south of Panay — a little south of Manila —
which also died out near Hainan, on the 27th. Then by November
3rd, another typhoon formed to the east of the Philippines, and
traversed a line almost coincident with the path of the first cyclone.
   The intensity of typhoons in the China Seas appears to be about the
same as the October cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, but less than that
of the hurricanes of Mauritius and of the West Indies.
   In the Philippines, as elsewhere in the tropics, a rise of the
barometer very frequently precedes a typhoon ; and much has been
written about the relation of this high pressure area to the cyclone
itself. No synoptic charts which have yet been constructed in the
tropics are suflBciently detailed to enable us to say much on the
subject; but so far as they go, the changes, or re-adjustment of
pressure surrounding such an abnormal occurrence as a tropical
hurricane, are precisely analogous to the changes which precede a
temperate    cyclone.
   The weather in this high-pressure area is reported as beautifully
fine, often with great visibility ; and the formation of feathery cirrus
on the blue sky is one of the first and most certain forerunners of a
                                                 "        "
typhoon. This is exactly analogous to the wedges of high pressure,
and very fine weather, which we find in front of many European
cyclones.
   But there     is one phenomenon connected with the outskirts of a
typhoon    that   has been observed by Faura, and which is so important
and interesting that it may be described here. In the periphery of the
cyclone, that is to say in the winds blowing two or three days before
the storm from N. and N.W., the smoke of th^ chronically active
volcano of Abayon, in the island of Albay, descends.              During the
typhoon    no  observations  have  been   possible,  owing  to  the low-lying
nimbus ; but when this breaks up, after the passage of the hurricane,
the smoke is rising.
   Fig. 8a represents the appearance of the smoke before, fig. 86
that after a typhoon, as shown in some sketches belonging to Padre
Faura.

                          4. After typhoon, and usually.
   These sketches were shown to the author as proofs of a descending
current in front of a typhoon, but he is not altogether satisfied with
the evidence.     It is very difficult to decide on such a question with
out personal observation. It has been suggested that the downward
curl of the smoke was merely the vortex eddy on the lee side of the
volcano, and that a similar phenomenon is obvious in any factory
chimney during a high wind.             The original sketches, however, did
not the  least convey    that  impression ; and there must be some reason
why the smoke does not curl that way with other winds.              In England
there is a well-known saying, that when smoke falls down rain may
be expected.     This is often true, and is undoubtedly due to some
peculiarity in the way of blowing before certain kinds of rain, and not
merely to the velocity of the wind.              The author believes that the
downward curl of the smoke of Abayon is due to some peculiarity in
the wind preceding a typhoon, though he is not prepared at present to
assume the existence of a regular downward current in the high
pressure area that precedes the typhoon.
   Some physicists have apparently doubted the existence of downward
currents at all, on the ground that the stream lines of an air current
must be tangential to the earth's surface, and that wind cannot slant
downwards in the ordinary senso of the word.                   This would be
perfectly  true, if  air were   a perfect   fluid, and   wind blew like a con
tinuous theoretical current ; but in practice wind blows irregularly,

18           Hon. Ralph Abercromby.         Relation between
and forms eddies and vortices that break the continuity of the stream
lines. As a matter of observation, nothing is commoner than to see
a gust of wind blow down from a mountain on to a lake, and then
ricochet up again.
    The wind round a typhoon is always an in-going spiral. The
incurvature is usually strong, but differs in every segment, not only
in each cyclone,-'but even in the same cyclone at different periods of
its existence.    So much is this the case, that it seems impossible to
give any mean incurvature for the Philippines.        This is curious, for
farther north the variation of incurvature seems more constant.
    The motion of the lower nimbus is always more nearly parallel to
the isobars, and therefore more nearly eight points from the bearing
of the centre,, thkn the surface winds. This is identical with the
experience of European cyclones, and has an important bearing on
the rules for handling ships at sea, though that question cannot be
discussed here.
    The observations of Padre Faura on the variation in the destruc
tive effects of the wind in different parts of a typhoon, and the manner
in which he uses this knowledge in forecasting, are so important and
so unknown in this country, that the author proposes to devote one or
two paragraphs to their consideration.
    Faura finds that the position of the strongest winds relatively to the
centre of the cyclone varies not only in every typhoon, but in the same
one ; and also that for the same velocity, the wind will uuroof houses
in one cyclone, but do comparatively little damage in another.         He
assumes that the uuroofing wind is blowing slightly upwards, and the
wind that does little damage moves horizontally or slightly down
wards.
    If then he can find evidence that the wind is rising up in front of
a typhoon, he can be pretty certain that it will descend in rear ; and
therefore can and does forecast that the wind in that portion of the
storm will be less destructive.
    From all this, he has been led to the conception that the axis of a
 typhoon is inclined, and that it nutates during the progress of the
 vortex.
    For instance, in the typhoon of October 20th, 1882— figured below
 — he believed that the wind in front was certainly rising and low ; a
 beam lying near the sea, at a distance of 300 — 400 metres, was thrown
 upon the observatory (height 34 metres) and destroyed the Beckley's
 anemometer, while the roofs of many houses were pulled off.         From
 this Faura concluded that the rear would not have the same force as the
 front, because the wind would be high and falling ; and he published
a notice at noon on the 20th — " The S.W. winds will be very short." —
 This prognostication was justified by the event.
    The contrary took place in the typhoon which followed a few days

                     Tropical and Extra-tropical Cyclones.                    19
later on    November 4th and 5th, the wind falling, as he considered,
in front, and doing comparatively little damage.
    Again in the typhoon of August 19th, 1881, the wind blew during
eight hours with a rapidity of 44 metres a second, and nevertheless
did not damage the roofs, because it did not hit from beneath, but
from above.
    These facts are very interesting,         as similar  observations   on the
variable destruction for equal velocities have been made by Pidding-
ton in Bengal ; and the same has been observed on a much less
pronounced       scale  in Great Britain.      The utilisation of the idea in
forecasting has, we believe, never been suggested by anyone except
Faura ; and his views are worthy of the most attentive consideration
from those engaged in forecasting hurricanes.
    Faura thinks that this can all be explained by the supposition that
the axis of a typhoon is inclined to the earth's surface, instead of
being truly vertical, and that the whole system nutates                   like a
top.
    The author, however, believes that there are insuperable difficulties
in the conception of a nutating axis of a cyclone, though he does not
propose     to discuss the question in this paper.         The idea that the
variation of destruction for the same velocity was due to a slant in the
wind     has often been suggested before, and though slanting gusts
undoubtedly occur, he is not prepared to pronounce a definite opinion
on the question, from the evidence at present available.             His object
 in  introducing the subject here, was to point out how the variability of
 destruction can be used in practical forecasting, even if Faura's
 theory cannot be maintained as a whole.
    The weather in and surrounding a typhoon is very characteristic.
 The whole storm is surrounded by a ring of cirrus.                 Halo is an
 almost constant precursor of a cyclone, and is sometimes seen in rear.
 The author made special enquiry on this point, for herein tropical
 differ very much from extra-tropical cyclones.          In Great Britain we
 rarely see cirrus of any description in rear of a cyclone, still less
 the formless ice-dust called cirro-nebula by Ley, which is almost
  essential to the formation of halo.
    The form of cirrus in this ring, especially in front, is typically that
  known as
              " cat's tails " or " cock's plumes " (rabos de gallo) ; and there
 seems to be a tendency for the lines of cloud to radiate from the
  vortex.    This idea was first suggested by Padre B. Vines of Havana,
  but requires further investigation, for the author was informed at
  Hong Kong that they had not observed that allineation there.
    All observers are agreed that here, as elsewhere, cirrus is seen
  before the barometer begins to fall.
     Inside the cirrus comes a ring of dense black cloud, and then a
  smaller ring of heavy rain and dense nimbus.           When a typhoon can
                                                                      C 2

  be observed approaching at a distance, mountainous cumulus are seen
 over this central rain.
      But, just as in higher latitudes, the clouds in front are dirtier than
  those in rear of the trough ; for when, in the latter portion of the
  typhoon, the fracto-cumulus begins to break, either blue sky or firm
  f racto-cumulus becomes visible.*        Thus trough phenomena appear to
  be only slightly marked in the Philippines, but very much information
  on this point could not be procured.
      Lastly in the vortex of the typhoon we find the " bull's-eye " or
  calm clear spot, a few miles in diameter, surrounded on all sides by
  the fury of the hurricane. Many accounts received agree in saying that
 light cirri are usually seen over this area, that near land this space
 is full of birds taking refuge from the terrific surrounding squalls,
 and that the heat is suffocating.         During the passage of the vortex
 over Manila, on the 20th October, the thermometer rose rapidly, and
 the relative humidity decreased to an extent hardly known in the
 driest months.       The universal exclamation was " the air burns."         In
 the succeeding typhoon, November            4th  and 5th, no such central heat
 was observed, but the intensity of the cyclone was much less.
      The instrumental observations at Manila on these two occasions are
 almost unique ; but there is no doubt that a clear hot central spot is
 a normal feature of tropical cyclones.          The oppressive heat and great
 dryness     would  probably point    to the  existence  of a slight down draft
in the core of the cyclone.        It is extremely difficult to form a definite
conception of        such   a system of circulation, for there is not the
slightest doubt that the main mass of air in the centre of a cyclone
is rising.      The only reasonable suggestion which has yet been made,
 has been proposed by Vettin and Sprung, who think that under
certain conditions a local downward eddy is formed in the centre of
an atmospheric whirl. We must, however, consider the question to
 be as yet unsolved, and there is no point in the mechanism of a
cyclone to which more attention should be directed.
     But the most remarkable point is that the blue centre does not
always coincide with the barometric vortex. Sometimes the blue is
in front, sometimes behind, sometimes to one side of the absolute
minimum ; and this has been considered as a proof of the inclination
 of the axis of the typhoon. This non-coincidence of the blue and of
 the barometric centre of the vortex has been noticed in every other
hurricane country, but at present it is impossible safely to do more
than record the fact for further investigation.             The supposed non-
coincidence of the centre of wind rotation with the barometric
minimum has been noticed when discussing Indian cyclones.
     All the characteristics of a typhoon are well exemplified in figs. 9

greater.    The isobars are drawn at intervals of 0-4 inch, and as the
longer diameter is only about 315 miles, and the shorter one
"245 miles, the intensity of the depression can be readily realised.
   But perhaps this will be even more strikingly exhibited if we look,
at the barogram during the typhoon at Manila, as given in fig. 10.
There we find many of the typical features of a tropical cyclone, in
the strong diurnal variation of pressure on the top of the general
diminution of pressure which preceded the typhoon by several days,
and in the very sudden depression near the centre of the hurricane.
    The incurvature of the wind is very pronounced; and it is,
perhaps, important to note that the strong supposed rising impulse in
front of the centre, to which we have already alluded, is associated
with a rearward compression of the isobars.
   The vortex was almost exactly centred over Manila at the moment
for which the chart is constructed, and though the rain ceased and
the overcast sky grew higher, there was no blue visible.
    The velocity of the whole typhoon appears to have been about
19 miles an hour.
   Hong Kong. — From Manila the author went to Hong Kong, where
Dr. Doberck, of the Observatory at Kow-long, has been giving much
attention to the subject of typhoons.
    Among other interesting points, Dr. Doberck has remarked that
he has never found any indications of secondaries dependent on a
primary cyclone ; that the vertical succession of upper currents is the
same as obtains in higher latitudes ; and that the incurvature of the
 wind is less in front than in rear of a typhoon. The last is identical
with what Meldrum has found in the South Indian Ocean, but the
contrary of what usually occurs in Great Britain. Dr. Doberck also
 considers that the incurvature of the wind in a typhoon decreases as
 the depression recedes from the equator.
    There are many observations to the effect that the central calm
 does not coincide with the minimum of the barometer ; but nothing
 has yet been remarked with reference to trough phenomena.
    Thunder^ and lightning do not occur in the heart of the typhoon ;
 but 600 to 800 miles to the S. or S.W. of the centre thunderstorms
 may be experienced.
                            Japanese Typhoons.
    From Hong Kong the author proceeded to Tokiyo, in Japan, to
 study the transitional district between tropical and extra-tropical
cyclones ; and through the courtesy of Mr. E. Knipping and Mr. Y.
 Wada, he succeeded in obtaining most valuable information.
    The result of all his researches may be briefly summarised as
 follows : —

                   Tropical and Extra-tropical Cyclones.                  23
    The shape of Japanese cyclones is usually oval       ; but well-defined
typhoons are more nearly circular than the ordinary depressions of
that country.     The latter are, however, as a rule, far more pronounced
ovals than in Europe.      As typhoons move into higher latitudes, they
certainly tend to become larger, more irregular in shape, and to move
with greater rapidity.       The centre is almost always more or less
displaced,   hut the  longer diameter tends in a marked degree to lie
nearly parallel to the line of propagation.
    Secondaries seem to be rare on the sides of the primaries ; but the
latter have the same reluctance to traverse land, and the same
tendency to follow one another along the same path, which are found
so frequently in European cyclones.
    The velocity of translation is greater than in the Philippines ; but
the July typhoons usually move more slowly than those in August or
 September.
    Mr. Knipping thinks from observations on the upper clouds that
 the height of some typhoons does not exceed three-quarters of a mile,
 or about 4000 feet ; but the author considers this estimate far too
 low.
    The wind is usually less incurved in front than in rear of the
 centre ; and at some distance in front, with a S.E. wind, the centre
 may bear S.       This is a very important point with reference to
 handling ships, but cannot be discussed here for want of sufficient
 information.    It is, however, quite certain that though the baro
 meter may have begun to fall, a ship may not really be within the
 sphere of the typhoon.
    Much information could not be got on the movements of the upper
 clouds.   Some of the observations at Nagasaki are very discrepant.
    The author believes, however, that there is not the slightest doubt
 that the general circulation of a typhoon is exactly similar to that in
 an extra-tropical cyclone, for Mr. Harries (' Quarterly Journal of the
  Royal Meteorological Society,' vol. 12, p. 10) has traced a typhoon from
 the Philippines across the Pacific and the United States into Europe.
 This, like all other long-lived cyclones, received accessions of inten
 sity from time to time by fusion with other cyclones which had
 formed outside the tropics ; and it is inconceivable      that two eddies,
 circulating on different systems, could coalesce withont destroying one
 auother.    Cyclones are supposed to have the same general circulation,
 or to circulate on the same system, when the whole body of the storm
 circulates in the same manner — in-going counter-clockwise below,
 tangential to the isobars at low levels, outgoing at the highest altitudes.
 Two such cyclones, near one another, can and do easily coalesce ; but
 if the upper currents in a typhoon were essentially different from
 those in extra-tropical cyclones, two adjacent cyclones could not
 coalesce withont destroying each other.           Cyclones south of the

hemisphere, and it is certain that a hurricane generated south of the
line could not coalesce with one developed north of the equator.
   All accounts agree that cirrus is seen all round a typhoon in Japan
as at Manila, and that rain extends much further in front than in
rear of the centre, as in higher latitudes.       In some typhoons the
development    of  squalls is far greater in front than in rear of the
trough ; and this is the opposite of what is found in England.
   Lightning is sometimes seen in front of the centre of a typhoon,
but apparently rarely in the true storm field.
   Cirrus cloud is observed over the blue of the " bull's-eye," and
Mr. Knipping informed the author that the clear central spot is not
seen in quick-moving cyclones, while it is a very marked phenomenon
of those whose progress is slow. This is a most important obser
vation.
   The " bull's-eye " and the centre of the wind's rotation do not
appear to be always coincident with the barometric centre of the
cyclone ; but there are not enough land observations to enable the
author to do more than note this point.
   There are certainly traces of trough phenomena, though not
strongly defined.    Mr. Wada told the author that the clouds some
times brighten a little about the passage of the trough, and then
become dark again ; but he had never noticed a line of squalls along
the line of the trough.

typhoon which raged from September 18th to 20th, 1878, which are
taken from Mr. Knipping's paper
                                       " The September Taifuns, 1878,"
in the Mittheilungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Natur- und
         '
Volkerkunde Ostasiens,' Heft 18, p. 333.
   In figs. 11 and 13 the usual oval form and pressing of the centre to
one side are very obvious ; and on the intervening day, fig. 12, we find
the typhoon in a transitional irregular form, with all the indications
of secondaries.     The intensity of the whole is also much less than in
our example from Manila.
   The mean velocity of translation was 10 miles an hour, but varied
at times from 2-3 to 25 miles per hour.
   The incurvature of the wind is obviously much less than at
Manila ; and the squalls were far more pronounced in front than in
rear of the typhoon.
   The rain also extended much further in front than in rear ; and
the improvement in the weather after the passage of the trough wai
very rapid.
   The amount of precipitation was so great that Mr. Knipping calcu
lates that no less than 30,000 million tons of water fell on the
19th September on the portion of the earth's surface lying between
30° and 35° N. lat., and 120°— 130° E. long.

   The author does not propose to detail here his researches on hurri
canes in the Mauritius, as they bear more on the great value of
Mr. Meldrum's rules for handling ships in cyclones than on the
subject of this paper.    All that need be said here is that allowing for
difference of wind rotation due to the southern hemisphere, the phe
nomena of a Mauritius hurricane are exactly analogous to those in
the Bay of Bengal or in the Philippines.
   He finds the same oval shape, with displaced centre, and the same
variations in the shape during the progress of any particular hurri
cane.    The wind is also very slightly incurved in front, and very
markedly so in rear of the cyclone.        Cirrus extends all round the
storm field ; a blue bull's-eye is almost constant ; and any " trough
              "
phenomena       are very slightly marked.    But, just as at Manila, when
the nimbus breaks in rear the clouds are harder there than in front ;
and M. Bridet at Reunion has noticed that the squalls are rather
worse when the barometer turns to rise, i.e., along the trough of the
cyclone.
   The propagation of these hurricanes is usually very slow.

    The author has also visited New Caledonia and Fiji to gather infor
mation as to the character of hurricanes in that part of the world.
He was not, however, able to collect sufficient materials to justify him
in saying more than that those hurricanes seem to differ from those in
the Mauritius in little except their smaller intensity.
   The subject of wind in cyclones has already been fully investigated
in many countries, but the points on which further research is
urgently required are: — 1. The nature of the central "bull's-eye";
2. The phenomena of the trough ; and 3. The nature of the high
pressure areas which immediately surround a cyclone.
           —
    [Note. The difference of temperature in front and rear of all
t ropical hurricanes is much less than in extra-tropical depressions.  At
the outskirts of a hurricane, about the time that cirrus first begins to
form in the blue sky, the heat is sometimes very oppressive.          The
thermometer does not rise much ; but as the ordinary breezes have
failed, and been replaced by a suffocating calm, and the increasing
humidity diminishes the evaporation of perspiration, the quality of
the heat is peculiarly distressing.
    As the sky gets overcast and the rain commences, temperature
always falls, and continues relatively low till the sun shines again
after the disturbance has passed away.          This cold appears to be
simply due to the obscuration of the sun's rays by cloud, and possibly
partly also to a little cold air being brought down by the heavy rain.
    All this is very different to the temperature disturbance of a
 British cyclone. The thermometer rises in England rapidly after the
sky has become overcast, and remains high until the trough hai
passed, when a notable diminution of temperature suddenly takei
 place.
    In a tornado, the rise of temperature in front, and diminution in
rear of the disturbance, are very marked, and so far diminish the
 analogy between a tornado and a hurricane.
    Since this paper was in type the author has had an opportunity of
 studying Padre B. Vines' Apuntes relativos a los Huracanes de lai
                             '
 Antillas.'    That work confirms all the peculiarities of tropical
 cyclones   found in other countries.
    In Cuba hurricanes have the same oval shape and displaced centre
 as in other tropical countries ; and the same rise of pressure with
 unusually fine weather occurs just before the advent of the depression.
    The wind is little incurved in front, but very much so in rear ; and
 a clear "bull's-eye," surrounded first by a ring of squally rain and
 then by a fringe of feathery cirrus, is the normal distribution of
 weather round the centre of the hurricane.        No trough phenomena
 appear to have been observed by Padre Vines.     — Added June, 1887.]

  28            Hon. Ralph Abercromby.          Relation  between
                                  Conclusions.
     The conclusions as to the relation of tropical to extra- tropical cyclonei
  which the author has derived from the researches of which this paper
 gives an account may be stated thus : —
     All cyclones have a tendency to assume an oval form ; the longer
  diameter may lie in any direction, but has a decided tendency to
  range itself nearly in a line with the direction of propagation.
     The centre of the cyclone is almost invariably pressed towards one
 or other end of the longer diameter ; but the displacement may vary
 during the course of the same depression.
     Tropical hurricanes are usually of much smaller dimensions than
 extra-tropical cyclones ; but the central depression is much steeper
 and more pronounced in the former than in the latter.
     Tropical cyclones have less tendency to split into two, or to develop
 secondaries than those in higher latitudes.
     A typhoon, which has come from the tropics, can combine with a
 cyclone that has been formed outside the tropics, and form a single
 new, and perhaps more intense, depression.
    No cyclone is an isolated phenomenon ; it is always related to the
 general distribution of pressure in the latitudes where it is generated.
The concentric circles, which are usually drawn to represent a cyclone,
 ignore the fact that a cyclone is always connected with and controlled
by some adjacent area of high pressure.
     In all latitudes pressure often rises over a district just before the
advent of a cyclone.      The nature of this rise is at present obscure ;
 but the character of the unusually fine weather under the high
pressure is identical both within and without the tropics.
    In all latitudes a cyclone which has been generated at sea appears
to have a reluctance to traverse a land area, and usually breaks up
when it crosses a coast line.
    After the passage of a cyclone in any part of the world there is a
remarkable tendency for another to follow veiy soon, almost along the
same track.
    The velocity of propagation of tropical cyclones is always small,
and the average greatly less than that of European depressions.
    There is much less difference in the temperature and humidify
before and after a tropical cyclone than in higher latitudes.              The
quality of the heat in front is always distressing in every part of the
world.
    The wind rotates counter-clockwise round every cyclone in the
northern hemisphere ; and everywhere as an in-going spiral.                The
amount of incurvature for the same quadrant may vary during the
course of the same cyclone ; but in most tropical hurricanes the
incurvature is least in front, and greatest in rear, whereas in England

                  Tropical and Extra-tropical Cyclones.                   29
the greatest incurvature is usually found in the rigbt front. Some
obiervers think that, broadly speaking, the incurvature of the wind
decreases  as we recede   from the equator.
   The velocity of the wind always increases as we approach the central
calm in a tropical cyclone ; whereas in higher latitudes the strongest
winds and steepest gradients are often some way from the centre.
The portion of a cyclone which is of hurricane violence forms, as it
were, a kernel in the centre of a ring of ordinarily bad weather.         In
this peculiarity tropical    cyclones    approximate more to the type of a
whirlwind tornado ; but the author does not think that a cyclone is
only a highly developed whirlwind, as there are no transitional forms
of rotating air.
   The general circulation of a cyclone, as shown by the motion of the
clouds, appears to be the same everywhere.
   All over the world unusual coloration of the sky at suurise and
sunset is observed not only before the barometer has begun to fall at
any place, but before the existence of any depression can be traced in
the neighbourhood.
   Cirrus appears all ronnd the cloud area of a tropical cyclone, instead
of only round the front semicircle as in higher latitudes.      The alline-
ments of the stripes of cirrus appear to lie more radially from the
centre in the tropics, instead of tangentially to the isobars, as indicated
by the researches of Ley and Hildebrandsson in England and Sweden
respectively.
   The general character of the cloud all round the centre is more
nniform in than out of the tropics ; but still the clouds in rear are
always a little harder than those in front.
   Everywhere the rain of a cyclone extends farther in front than in
rear.    Cyclone rain has a specific character, quite different from that
of showers or thunderstorms; and this character is more pronounced
in tropical than in extra-tropical    cyclones.
   Thunder or lightning are rarely observed          in the heart of any
cyclone,   and   their  absence    is  a  very  bad sign of the weather.
Thunderstorms are, however, abundantly developed on the outskirts
of tropical hurricanes.
   Squalls are one of the most characteristic features of a tropical
cyclone, where they surround the centre on all sides ; whereas in
Great Britain squalls are almost exclusively formed along that portion
of the line of the trough which is south of the centre, and in the right
rear of the depression.    As, however, we find that the front of a British
cyclone tends to form squalls when the intensity is very great, the
inference seems justifiable that this feature of tropical hurricanes is
simply due to their exceptional intensity.
   A patch of blue sky in the centre of a cyclone, commonly known as
the "bull's-eye," is almost universal in the tropics, and apparently

30                             Mr. C. Chree.
unknown in higher latitudes. This blue patch does not apparently
always coincide exactly with the barometric centre.         The author'i
researches show that in middle latitudes the formation of a bull's-eye
does not take place when the motion of translation is rapid ; but an
this blue space is not observed in British cyclones when they are
moving slowly, it would appear that a certain intensity of rotation     ii
necessary to develop this phenomenon.
   The trough phenomena — such as a squall, a sudden shift of wind
and change of clond character and temperature just as the barometer
turns to rise, even far from the centre — which are such a prominent
feature in British C3"clones, have not been even noticed by many-
meteorologists in the tropics.    The author, however, shows that there
are slight indications of these phenomena everywhere; and he hai
collated their existence and intensity with the velocity of propagation
of the whole mass of the cyclone.
   Every cyclone has a double symmetry. One set of phenomena such
as the oval shape, the general rotation of the wind, the cloud ring, rain
area, and central blue space, are more or less related to a central point.
Another set, such as temperature, humidity, the general character
of the clouds, certain shifts of wind, and a particular line of squalls^
are more or less related to the front and rear of the line of the trough
of a cyclone.
   The author's researches show that the first set are strongly marked
in the tropics, where the circulating energy of the air is great and the
velocity of propagation small ; while the second set are most prominent
in extra-tropical cyclones, where the rotational energy is moderate
and the translational velocity great.
   The first set of characteristics may conveniently be classed together
as the rotational ; the second set as the translational phenomena of a
cyclone.
   Tropical and extra-tropical cyclones       are identical in general
character, but differ in certain details due to latitude, surrounding
pressure, and to the relative intensity of rotation or translation.
  " Conduction of Heat in Liquids."              By C. Chree, B.A.,
      King's College, Cambridge. Communicated by Professor
      J. J. Thomson, F.R.S. Received March 31, — Read April
      21, 1887.
   The conduction of heat in liquids has of late years been considered
by several observers in Germany.      In this country Mr. J. T. Bottom-
ley and Professor Guthrie carried out experiments a good many years
ago, but in neither case do the results agree well with those obtained
abroad.    In all the more recent methods the conduction has taken

                      Conduction    of Heat in Liquids.                  31
place through thin layers of the liquid, and thus in interpreting the
results, the conditions at the surfaces limiting the liquid layer are of
primary importance. It has been assumed by each observer that con
tiguous surfaces of any two media are in all circumstances at the same
 temperature. This, however, is contradicted by some high authorities,
so it would seem important to have independent results based on
experiments in which the liquid layer is of considerable thickness.
    It should also be noted that in methods employing thin layers the
 temperature varies so rapidly in passing from one surface to the other
 that the liquid forms a by no means very homogeneous medium. This
 is the more important because experiments indicate that the conduc
 tivity of most if not all liquids increases rapidly as the temperature
 rises.
    The following experiments were carried out in the Cavendish
 Laboratory at the suggestion of Professor J. J. Thomson, to whom 1
am much indebted for suggestions as to the form of the apparatus
and the methods to be employed.
    Two series of experiments were made with different apparatus. In
 the earlier series it was found that the apparatus was too large to be
conveniently worked, and few results of a satisfactory nature were
obtained. In the second series the apparatus was much reduced in
size, though otherwise closely resembling that first employed.      It will
 thus be sufficient to describe the second form and supply data as to the
size of the first.
    The liquid was contained in a wooden tub with vertical sides,
 19-15 cm. in diameter, which was carefully fitted up by the mechanic
at the Cavendish Laboratory. Not far below the rim and at equal
distances apart were fixed three conical wooden pegs. The axes of
the pegs formed parts of radii of a horizontal section of the tub, pro
jecting inwards from the cylindrical surface to a distance somewhat
exceeding 2 cm. The pegs supported a flat, thin-bottomed dish of
tin-plate, 14-85 cm. in diameter, whose base was thus maintained
horizontal.    The liquid was poured into the tub till it reached the
base of the dish.     The liquid surface being strictly horizontal, it was
easy   to judge by  the  eye whether the dish was so also ; if not the tub
 had to be adjusted till it was so.      It was then advisable to stir the
 liquid  to make  sure  that no air bubbles  remained clinging to the dish.
The bottom of the dish was about 5-2 cm. above that of the tub.
    The method required the temperature to be measured at a known
depth below the liquid surface.       This end was secured by measuring
 the electrical resistance of a fine straight platinum wire 6"6 cm. long,
 which was supported at a depth of 2-61 cm. below the surface by two
small trestles of gla3S.     These were fixed in the bottom of the tub and
 projected upwards.       The platinum wire was drawn tight over them,
each end being fused to a much thicker piece of copper wire, so that

   32                            Mr. C. Chree.
  the junctions were exactly at the same depth and immediately       below
  the level of the platinum wire.      The copper wires were tied with silk
  to the vertical parts of the trestles, and, passing straight down, were
  led through the bottom of the tub.      The middle point of the platinum
  wire was vertically below the centre of the dish, and thus its endp
  were much nearer the axis      of the tub than was the rim of the dish..
  The strictly horizontal position of the wire was tested by pouring in
  water first to the level of the wire and then to that of the dish.      It
  was thus made certain that when the tub was placed so that the dish
  was horizontal, the platinum wire was so also.      For most liquids the
  pegs, wires, &c., were secured by sulphur, but for bisulphide of carbon
  this was replaced by asbestos.     During the experiments the tub wai
  placed inside a double-walled wooden box, the space between the walli
  being stuffed with packing. The box was provided with a double lid
  similarly stuffed.   To the ends of the copper wires were attached
  binding screws, the wires leading from which passed through grooves
  cut in the rim of the box. Thus the wires were in no way disturbed
 in moving the lid. This was a point of some importance, as even the
  small variations in the electrical resistance produced by slightly dis
 turbing the binding screws was apt to affect the accuracy of the
 observations.
     The platinum and its connecting wires formed one of the resistances
 of a Wheatstone's bridge arrangement.        One of the others was a fixed
 resistance, and the remaining two were supplied by a wire bridge with
 a sliding-piece.    The resistance of the platinum wire varies with the
 temperature, and — at least for small variations — its change is propor
 tional to the change of temperature.       The current was supplied by a
 single   element  — a small   Daniell   or Leclanche.    A galvanometer,
 whose resistance could be reduced to 0-12 of an ohm, measured the
 variation from a balance between the resistances.       The usual precau
 tions in dealing with small resistances had to be taken ; in particular
 it was found difficult to avoid producing thermoelectric currents if
the sliding-piece were moved.
    In the first apparatus the tub was 38-2 cm. in diameter, and the
dish 30-2. The platinum was coiled in a spiral round a fine horizontal
glass tube at a mean depth of 6-45 em. below the liquid surface and
about 7 cm. above the bottom of the tub. The length of the spiral
 was less than the radius of the tub.
    The method of conducting the experiment was as follows : — The
tub was put inside the box and filled with the liquid to the level of
the dish.      The box having been adjusted till the dish was horizontal,
the lid was put on.       The sliding-piece of the bridge wire was then
moved     till no current  traversed the galvanometer.     As the tub and
liquid were in general at slightly different temperatures to begin with,
some time elapsed before the galvanometer reading became constant.

                         Conduction   of Heat in Liquids.                  33
  When this had occurred the sliding-piece was again moved till there
  -was   no current through the galvanometer.        It was then unnecessary
  to move the sliding-piece again, unless the deflection became greater
  than was usual in the experiment. When the galvanometer reading
  had remained some time constant, the lid of the box was removed and
  some hot water rapidly poured into the dish, care being taken that
  none splashed over into the tub.        Sometimes the lid was immediately
  replaced and left on during the whole of the experiment ; on other
 occasions the water was after a certain interval removed        by a siphon,
  ready filled for the purpose.       This always left a small quantity of
  water sufficient to cover the base of the dish without separating into
  drops.
     The battery was connected with a key, and there was another in the
  galvanometer circuit. In the earlier experiments these were depressed
 in close succession at intervals of one minute, and the consequent
 kick or deflection of the needle observed.        Subsequently it was found
 more convenient to use a constant battery, and to keep both keys
 down during the whole course of the experiment and for some time
 previously.       Both methods were employed for most of the liquids
 examined, and no difference was detected in the results.           The tem
 perature    of  the  platinum   wire  was  seldom  raised as much   as 2° C.
 during the experiment, and consequently the disturbance of the
 balance in the Wheatstone's bridge was small.             Thus the current
 through the galvanometer could be taken as directly proportional to
 the change in the resistance of the platinum, and so to the rise in its
 temperature.
     Immediately subsequent       to the application of the hot water there
 was   a decided     increase   of the galvanometer reading which ceased
 very shortly.        The reading then remained almost stationary for
 several minutes.       It then began to increase rapidly and continued to
 rise for a considerable time, though the rate of change began com
paratively soon to decrease. At first with the larger tub it was
attempted to determine the interval that elapsed before the reading
 ceased to increase.        This was, however, found impracticable, as it
required several hours to reach this epoch ; and after an hour and a
half the rate of change was so slow that the least variation in the
temperature of the laboratory was sufficient to upset the experiment.
 Even with the smaller apparatus this was not a quantity to be con
veniently observed.         It was found much easier to determine the
much shorter interval that elapsed before the platinum wire was
being most rapidly heated. This interval could also be expressed
conveniently by means of the mathematical theory in terms of the
conductivity and other properties of the liquid, and so its determina
tion was sufficient for the purpose in view.

 small cell a deflection exceeding 300 divisions of a millimetre
 scale could be obtained for a rise of one degree in the tempera
ture of the platinum.           When so sensitive as this, however, the
 galvanometer was too much exposed to the disturbing influences
of adjacent currents or the movement of magnets in neighbouring
 rooms.     From eighty to a hundred scale divisions to a degree usually
 gave   the  best results, and had the advantage of keeping the spot of
 light near the centre of the scale during the whole experiment, with
 out any movement of the sliding-piece.         The sensitiveness was most
 easily determined by finding how far the sliding-piece on the bridge
had to be moved, when the battery was on, to produce a given change
in the galvanometer reading. This test was usually applied at the
beginning and end of each experiment, as a change in the sensitive
ness during the observations might lead to erroneous conclusions.            A
slight displacement of the controlling magnet of the galvanometer
may occur without affecting to any noticeable extent the position of
the zero, and so without some such test as the above a chauge in the
sensitiveness    might escape detection.

    Let  v denote the temperature,     p the density, c the specific heat, and
k the conductivity of a given liquid.         Suppose the liquid to extend
to infinity in every direction, and over the entire plane x = 0 a
uniform supply of heat to be distributed at a rate given at the time t,
counted from the first application of the heat, by the function /(f)
per unit area ; then at the distance x from the plane of application
the temperature at time t is given by

    In  the present experiment the base of the dish answers to the plane
x  =   0, and f(J) is to be regarded as proportional to the rate at which
heat is conveyed from the dish to the liquid.            It is true of course
that the liquid exists only on one side of the plane x = 0, and does
not extend to infinity in any direction. Doubtless the base of the tub
tends     to reflect the heat    that has passed downwards through the
liquid, but in the apparatus actually used any such reflected heat
would be extremely small, and only the most trifling part of even this
effect would show itself within the time of the experiment.              Since
the length of the platinum wire was much less than the diameter of
the dish, which was in turn considerably less than that of the tub,
the limitation in the horizontal direction would appear of small conse
quence. In fact when a larger quantity of hot water than was usually
employed was poured into the dish, a delicate thermometer indicated

                        Conduction  of Heat in Liquids.                      35
a  temperature in the liquid that was sensibly constant at a constant
depth except close to the sides of the tub.         The absence of liquid on
the negative side of the plane x — 0 might appear a radical defect.          It
is clear, however, that in the supposed infinite liquid if(<) will pass
into the liquid on each side of this plane, and the existence of the
liquid on the one side merely ensures that                      is the precise
amount passing into the liquid on the other side. But the law of
diffusion on either side of the plane can depend only on the heat
supplied to that plane, and must be independent of the precise
mechanism by which the supply is regulated. For our present
purpose it is sufficient to know that f(t) is proportional to the rate at
which heat passes into the liquid from the dish, which may be de
termined by a double observation as follows.
    The tub being filled with liquid up to the level of the dish, a certain
quantity of water heated to a definite temperature is suddenly poured
into the dish. By means of a watch, and a delicate thermometer,
raised initially to the temperature of the heated water and with it
transferred to the dish, the law of cooling of the water is determined.
The quantity of heat lost by the dish per unit of time at any required
temperature       can be easily deduced.    If now the dish be placed on a
non-conducting material, and the law of cooling be observed when
 the other circumstances are the same as before, the quantity of heat
 which leaves the dish per unit time in the first experiment without
 passing into the tub is at once obtained for the whole range of tem
  perature.    From these two experiments it is not difficult to calculate
  the amount of heat passing into the liquid in the tub at every
  instant in that form of the experiment in which the water poured
  into the dish was left there.       When a siphon was employed the
  capacity for heat of the water left in the dish and the dish itself was
  so small that the heat subsequently transferred to the liquid was
  negligible.
     To a clear understanding of the use of (1) some knowledge of
  the expression fi6-*ilCl*kt is desirable.     This is proportional to the
  temperature existing     at a depth x in  an  infinite  liquid, originally at
   zero temperature, at a time t subsequent to the application over the
   entire plane * = 0 of a unit of heat per unit of area.         The first and
   second   differential coefficients of the above expression           are re
  spectively  — -

   Thus the temperature at depth x,        counted    from   the   plane x —  0,
   gradually   commences     to rise and continues to do        so  for a time

 t =  *3/,c/2fc,  after which it steadily falls. The times at which the
 increase and decrease are fastest are respectively the smaller and the
 greater root of the quadratic equation
 and are approximately          '0917  —                               (3)

    Supposing it were possible suddenly to supply a quantity of heat
 to the surface of the liquid in the tub and to ensure that no com
 mensurable quantity was subsequently gained or lost, an observation
of the time at which the tomperature at a given depth was rising
fastest, or was stationary, would enable A; to be determined at once.
    In the actual case the problem is more complex as /(x)> though
diminishing rapidly as x increases, is different from zero ; the
principle however is practically unchanged. By differentiation we
obtain from (1)
                 2,
                             + terms at the limits                     (5)
 Now when t is moderately large the terms at the limits may be
neglected. This follows from a consideration either of the mathematical
form or the physical meaning of those terms.        They are proportional,
one to the temperature instantaneously produced at the depth x at the
time t by the heat at that instant passing into the liquid from the
dish, and the other to the rate of change of this instantaneous effect.
Now even when heat is being very rapidly communicated to the
liquid, as at the commencement of the experiment, the rise in tem
perature due to conduction at a moderate depth is for a minute or
two insignificant.       Thus when the heat is being communicated very
slowly, as is the case at the time at which we shall employ (5), the
terms at the limits are for all practical purposes negligible.
    When the temperature of the liquid at depth x is rising most
rapidly, dvjdt is a maximum, and so cPvjdt2 = 0. From the above
reasoning it follows that the time in question must satisfy the
equation    —
                 ¦u

                       Conduction  of Heat in Liquids.                   37
  This equation cannot be exactly solved, but an approximate solution
 of   sufficient accuracy can be obtained.   This gives t as a function of
 x, p, e, and k ; but t is determined from the galvanometer readings,
 and x, pt and c can be otherwise determined, thus A; is at once
obtainable.
     With the smaller apparatus, when the dish remained unemptied,
 the value of t, when water was in the tub, exceeded ten minutes, and
 for nearly all other liquids it is greater.       The integral can be
replaced by      the summation —
                                                            ....
                                                                     = 0,
 2(i-x)-^e-V/-(i-x){|(<-x)2-3^C(<-x)+^JjQT
                                                                        (7)
 where Qt is proportional to the heat transmitted to the liquid during
 the interval t, and t — x is the time between the middle of this
 interval and the epoch of swiftest rise of temperature. It is not
 necessary to take t the same throughout ; thus at the beginning of
 the experiment when /(f) varies rapidly, t must be taken smaller
 than subsequently.       The terms in the summation answering to the
 last few minutes of the experiment are always very small.
    When the water was siphoned from the dish, any gain or loss of
 heat through the dish subsequent to the operation was very small
 compared to that given up to the liquid previously.      Thus no serious
 error will be introduced by supposing j\t) = 0 after the siphoning.
    It will be observed that what the galvanometer readings give is
 the time when the platinum wire is heating fastest, while the equa
tion gives this epoch for the liquid at the same depth as the wire.
Since the temperatures       of the media are changing very slowly, it is
scarcely conceivable that they could differ by a finite quantity, or
that their rates of change should not bo practically alike.            The
assumption made in the present method is of a totally different order
from that made by previous observers dealing with thin layers of
liquid.       Their assumptions would be equalled only by supposing
the dish and the liquid touching it to be always identical in
temperature.
   Theoretically the absolute quantity of heat initially given to the
dish is of no importance, except in so far as it modifies the rate at
which heat is subsequently communicated to the liquid.             Experi
mentally it was found that both the quantity and the temperature of
the water poured into the dish could be varied to a considerable
extent without sensibly altering the epoch of quickest rise of tempe
rature.      When the water was siphoned the initial quantity of heat
was of still less importance.      With most liquids, however, the water
was heated to        a fixed temperature, viz., 75° C, and a measured

38                              Mr. C. Chree.
quantity was poured into the dish. With bisulphide of carbon of
course a much lower temperature was employed, but even then its
heated top layer evaporated so fast as to affect the contact of the
liquid with the dish. For these reasons in all experiments on the
bisulphide the water was siphoned out of the dish.
    In the earlier part of each experiment the heat was of course con
centrated chiefly in the upper layers.        Still as about an inch inter
vened between the dish and the platinum, the variation of tempera
ture in by far the greater portion of the liquid layer was comparatively
small.      Thus the error due to treating the conductivity as inde
pendent of the temperature cairaot be great.
    There are two possible disturbing agencies which require comment.
Any difference of temperature between the two copper-platinum
junctions in the liquid would produce a thermoelectric current. Care
was taken, however, that the junctions should be as nearly as
possible in the same horizontal plane.       At the depth in question the
greatest possible difference between the temperatures at two points
differing a few millimetres in depth could not exceed a small fraction
of one degree.       Thus the thermoelectric current, if existing, roast
have been very small, and necessarily its variation, from which alone
any error could arise, must have been very trifling.          Further, the
neutral point of copper and platinum is only about 70°, so they would
under the circumstances form a very weak couple.
    An attempt was in fact made to employ a thermoelectric couple of
iron and lead, whose neutral point is over 350°, one junction being in
the liquid and the other maintained at a constant temperature.        This,
however, failed completely, owing to want of sensitiveness.           Thus
 there are various d priori grounds for neglecting the thermoelectric
 effect in the actual experiment.      This view was further justified by
 actual trial, first by finding the deflection that followed when one of
 the junctions was suddenly heated to a considerable temperature,
 second by cutting out the battery during the usual experiment, and
 observing whether shunting the platinum wire affected the galvano
 meter.     Finally, in the various experiments on any one liquid the
 battery current traversed the platinum wire sometimes in one direc
 tion sometimes in the other; and thus any possible thermoelectric
 effect must have tended sometimes to increase and sometimes to
  diminish the rate of variation of the galvanometer reading.           The
  small variation in the observed times of most rapid variation is thus
  sufficient proof of the small disturbing action of the thermoelectric
  effect, and the variation in the direction of the battery current would
  further tend to eliminate any such small effect if existent.
     Another disturbing cause existed in the case of the sulphuric acid
  solutions.    These conducted electrolytically, and also attacked the
  copper wires. By covering these wires with shellac varnish this was

                        Conduction   of Heat in Liquids.                  39
    prevented.   With the weaker solutions a slight coating wus sufficient,
    but with the stronger  it had to be frequently renewed.
      In the cooling experiments, if we suppose the mass of water in
   the dish to remain constant, the rate at which the thermometer falls
   at any  instant is directly proportional to the rate at which heat is
   leaving the dish.    Of this heat some passes into the material below
   the dish, and some is lost by radiation from the water and the sides
  of the dish.     The material on which the cooling was slowest was
  packing,   and  the heat given up to it seemed very small. Of this by
  far the greater part occurred in the first minute, and this is precisely
  the time when a small error in calculating the heat given to the liquid
  in the experiments on conductivity is of least importance.         Thus in
  default of more accurate knowledge, the loss     of  heat by the dish when
  on packing was taken as representing the loss by radiation when on
  a liquid.    Since the absolute amount of heat given to the liquid is
  not required, but only the ratio of the quantities given up for each
  minute or half minnte of the experiment, absolutely no error would
  be introduced by neglecting the conductivity of the packing, pro
 vided the heat passing into the packing followed the same law as that
 passing into the liquid.
     The liquids whose conductivities were determined are water, sul
 phuric acid solutions of various strengths, bisulphide of carbon, one
 solution of methylated spirit, paraffin, and turpentine oils. For water,
 methylated spirit, and paraffin two series of observations were made,
 the water being siphoned from the dish in one case, and left in the
 other.     In the case of turpentine no observations were made with the
 water siphoned. For the sulphuric acid solutions and the bisulphide
of carbon the siphon was always used.           It was found that the con
ductivity     and the rate of  cooling of the dish were nearly independent
of the strength of the sulphuric acid solution, and differed little from
the corresponding quantities for water.        The law of cooling on bisul
phide of carbon also closely resembled that on water. The relative
conductivities of these liquids would thus in all probability be most
correctly obtained by referring them to the value obtained for water
by the method employing the siphon.           The following table gives the
quantity of heat given up to the liquids in consecutive minutes or
half minutes of the experiment, so far as is required in calculating
the conductivity.      The unit employed is arbitrary, but is the same
throughout: —

    The times required for the dish to cool from 75° to 30° on water
and on the sulphuric acid solution were almost identical.              Excluding
the first half minute, the cooling on the solution was slightly but
decidedly faster for the first half of the period. In the bisulphide of
carbon the experiment was made at a much lower temperature, which
accounts for the comparatively small quantity of heat given to the
liquid in the third half minute.                  In fact, considering the small
temperature     excess  the     rate  at     which    the dish lost heat on the
bisulphide was initially extremely rapid. On turpentine for the first
few minutes the loss of heat was much faster than on packing ; the
rates then began to approach, and after the first nine minutes could
not with certainty be said to differ.            This coincidence lasted for the
next five minutes or more, during which the observations were con
tinued. Excluding the first minute, the cooling on turpentine was
very decidedly slower than on any other liquid.               This is due to the
low conducting power and small specific heat of the liquid, in virtue
 of which the top layer soon became a sort of barrier to the penetra
 tion of the heat.

    In   each case the       density was taken with a hydrometer at or near
the temperature of the experiment, and the specific heats are taken
                    '
directly from Watts' Dictionary of Chemistry,' or obtained by inter
polation from tables given there.            In the case of the last three liquids
the specific heat was also obtained experimentally, as these liquids
vary somewhat in composition.              The results so obtained were some
what rough, but were sufficiently good to act as a check on the
values taken.         Small errors in the specific heat are not of much im
portance, as the       probable error in the experiments on the conductivity
amounts to at least several per cent. of the numbers taken.                   Further,
the mean temperature to which the conductivity should be referred is
also a somewhat doubtful matter.
    The introduction of small impurities in the liquids did not appre
ciably alter t.       For instance, small quantities of salt were put into
the methylated spirit, and small quantities of the latter into water
 without producing any apparent effect.               It would thus appear that
 the   absolute     purity of the liquids used is not of much consequence.
 Care    was,  however,     taken to keep them as pure as possible, the bisul
 phide of carbon in particular being redistilled before use.
    In every case the value t is the mean of a good many experiments,
 and, as a rule, the individual experiments agreed well together.                   Thus,
 when the siphon was not used the values obtained for t varied from
 10-3 to 11 for water, from 1275 to 14 for methylated                spirit, and from
  14-25 to 15 for turpentine.         When the siphon was used the extreme
 differences in the numbers obtained for t were about as large as in the
 other method, and thus the agreement               between the experiments was
  really  not  quite   so  good.    This   was only to be expected, as there was
  necessarily some slight variation in the time taken to siphon, and in
  the result of the operation.
     In obtaining a mean value for t the following method was adopted :

 42                                 Mr. C. Chree.
—A     table was formed giving the increase in the galvanometer read
 ings for each minute of each experiment. If there had been much
 variation in the sensitiveness of the galvanometer, the numbers obtained
 from each experiment were multiplied by a number varying inversely
 as the total increase in the readings during the fifteen minutes of that
 experiment subsequent to the application of the heat.              The numbers
 for each minute were then added together, and the sum gave the
 mean rate of heating for the minute in question.               From these rates
 the time of fastest heating could be easily calculated, or could be
 obtained graphically by constructing the curve whose abscissae were
 the times elapsed since the heating, and whose ordinates were propor
 tional to the rates of heating.
    It will be best to consider first the experiments in which the water
 was siphoned from the dish, as the arithmetic required to obtain the
 conductivity from the equation (7) is then comparatively simple. It
 is assumed that the heat passed into the liquid for the first three half-
 minutes according to the law given in Table I, and that subsequently
 no heat at all was either given or lost through the dish. As it took
 some time to perform the siphoning, and there were no doubt slight
 variations in the small quantity of water left in the dish, the above is
 only approximately true, but the multiplication of the observations
 would tend to eliminate the errors.
    If x'/tcj^c be denoted by X, then from (7) and Table I, since t = 9,
 we have for water—
                 606(8-75)        e-**"{X2-f X(8-75) +f (8-75)2}

    From this equation X must be obtained by trial.               If U stand for
the left-hand       side  of  the equation, it will be found that the corre
sponding values of X and U are as follows : —
                       X.                               V.

several    lines in succession.       The following are the values of these

    From the values       of U a very close approximation to X may be
obtained by Maclaurin's theorem, which gives X = 22-79.                      This is a
mnch closer degree of approximation than is at all necessary, con
sidering the possible size of the experimental errors.
   Since                %  = depth of wire = 2-61 cm.,

This corresponds to a temperature of about 18° C.
   The law of cooling of the dish on sulphuric acid solutions so nearly
resembled that on water, that it will be sufficient to take the results
given in Table I for a solution of density 1*2, and combine them with
the corresponding results for water in a ratio proportionate to the
strength of the intermediate solution. We thus obtain as propor

the  following values :—

    Neither the method nor the theory is so exfremely accurate that
any value can be attached to the third significant figure in the valne
for h in assigning absolute values for the conductivity.               In assigning
relative values, the third figure would have some weight in liquids in
which the heat was applied so similarly as in the case of water and
the above solutions.           Since, however, the temperatures of the experi
ments were not            identical,  and the conductivity unquestionably in
creases with the temperature, it would probably be unsafe to deduce
from the above numbers any more precise conclusion than that the
presence of a very considerable quantity of sulphuric acid produces
an extremely small change in the conductivity for heat of water.
    It might also be considered almost certain that the time at which
the temperature was rising fastest diminished as the density of the
solution increased.           This signifies that the velocity with which heat
 waves travel, or the temperature conductivity of Weber, is greater the
stronger the solution. The liquid in the tub in these experiments
whs in general stirred up fifteen minutes after the heat had been
applied.       It is pretty obvious that the ratio of the galvanometer
 reading after the stirring to that before should diminish as the
 temperature conductivity increases.               The ratios so obtained for water
 and the above solutions were in order, 136, 134, 132, l-28 and 123.
    No very great accuracy can be claimed for these numbers as the
 determination was somewhat rough, but as independent evidence of
 the truth of the above statement as to the temperature conductivity
 they are of considerable weight.

   The solution must of course be obtained by trial, bnt it is compara
tively easy to form a pretty accurate idea of its value from considering
the  value of the coefficients     in square brackets.     Further, when a
solution has been obtained for one equation, its magnitude enables an
idea of the magnitude of the solutions of the other similar equations
to be readily obtained.      The necessary arithmetic is best performed
by finding the value of     each   line of the left-hand side separately by
means of logarithms.       The first four or five lines will in each case be
negative, and the rest positive.       The last two lines at least will be
found extremely small.         The following table, in which the letters

   Taking into consideration the nature of the investigation,                         the
agreement between the results obtained by the two methods seems on
the whole satisfactory.          In the case of methylated spirit and paraffin
oil, the agreement        could   hardly be closer, and the fact that it is so
good     must indeed in considerable               measure    be a    pure matter       of

                        Conduction     of Heat in Liquids.                         47
chance.       In  the case of water, there is a decided though not very
serions discrepancy.         The difference in the mean temperature of the
two experiments         could   account for only a small part of this.            The
experiments on water were the earliest in which the siphon was used,
 and the operation took slightly longer and its results were not quite
 so  uniform as in later experiments. Further, when no siphoning
 took place, the heat passing into the liquid at the end of the expe
 riment was much larger in the case of water than for the other
 liquids, and the terms at the limits in (5) wonld thus be of slightly
 greater importance for water than for the others.               Also an error of
 given amount in the experimental determination of the time of most
 rapid heating would produce the greater effect the shorter the time,
and would thus modify the results for water more than for any other
of the liquids, except bisulphide of carbon.              Thus it was only to be
expected     that   the  greatest    discrepancy    between    the results of the
two methods should occur in water.
    With the larger apparatus results were obtained for water and
methylated spirit, of the same constitution as in the experiments
already described, which, though not pretending to great accuracy,
may be of interest as independent evidence of the correctness in the
main of the theory.         For the intervals in minutes that elapsed after
the application of the heat before the temperature of the wire was
rising fastest, the mean of several experiments gave 52^ for water, 67£
for the spirit. The water was left undisturbed in the dish, and no
accurate observations of the rate of cooling were made. It was noticed,
however, that the dish parted rapidly with its heat, and being only
slightly deeper than the dish in the small apparatus, it is pretty clear
that by far the greater part of the heat was given to the liquid in the
tub in the first few minutes. Thus the experiment would be pretty
much akin to the case when the water was siphoned in the smaller
apparatus. Though ignorant of the law of cooling, we can thus obtain
an inferior limit to the conductivity, of a moderately close kind, by
supposing the heat to have been instantaneously communicated.                    This
gives from expression (3), viz.,        k =  0-0917a:2/,c/^ for water k    = 0-0730,
and for methylated spirit k = 0-0324, corresponding to temperatures
of about     18° C.     These    results  as  being essentially inferior      limits,
agree    fairly with those of the smaller apparatus.
    On the whole, the results of this series             of experiments resemble
those    obtained    by Herr Weber.*         The values obtained for the con
ductivity of water agree fairly well with his.                The smaller value
obtained by Weber for bisulphide of carbon, viz., 0"0250, would be
partly accounted for by the very considerably lower temperature of
his experiment.         As this liquid boils at a very low temperature, the

 rate of variation with the temperature of its thermal conductivity          is
 very probably much above the average.
    To reduce the results of the present paper to the G.G.S.         system  of
 units, it is only necessary to divide them by 60.

   Numerous       as are the    communications upon the subject of rabies,
the paucity of experimental investigation is remarkable ; the disease
has remained for upwards of 2000 years, since the first recorded
mention of it by Aristotle, exceedingly obscure in many essential
points.     The unparalleled and variable length of its incubation period
has offered      the greatest obstacle to systematic examination ; in the
words of John Hunter in the last century, " It has defied alike
scientific investigation as to its intimate nature, and all remedial
measures for its successful treatment."
   Lately, however, the results announced to have been attained by
M. Pasteur, have promised to remove these obstacles, and encouraged
research by new methods and with fresh views.
   This investigation was commenced early in 1885, during the preva
lence   of rabies in and around London.              Two well-marked cases iu
dogs were obtained, and inoculations with their saliva, taken both
during life and shortly after death, were made into the subcutaneous
tissue of other animals, but failed to produce infection.
   At that time I was not sufficiently conversant with the results of
M. Pasteur's investigations to place reliance upon his methods of
intracranial inoculation with the cerebro- spinal substance
                                                                     of a rabid
animal, and I must admit that his statements seemed to
                                                                 me    to be im

probable       and inconsistent with the facts which were previously well
established in this disease.
    The outbreak of the epizooty shortly afterwards subsiding,           I was
unable to resume experiments till the summer of 1886, when it had
become necessary to examine the results said to have been attained
by M. Pasteur. His statements, now widely known, communicated to
the Academy of Sciences, Paris, from time to time, and published in
their ' Comptes Rend us,' are essentially these : (1) That the virus of
rabies and hydrophobia resides in the cerebro-spinal tissues, and is
not confined to the salivary glands as hitherto supposed.            (2) That
by inoculation of this substance upon the brain of another animal by
trephining, or by intravenous injection, infection follows infallibly
and much more quickly than by subcutaneous inoculation.               (3) That
the virus from a rabid dog by passing through a series of animals of
a different species is modified in virulence; in monkeys it is attenuated
and ultimately lost, in rabbits 'on the contrary, it is intensified, and
after a certain number of inoculations in these animals reaches a
maximum, which it maintains nnaltered ; these modifications of
activity being shown by the duration of the incubation period follow
ing inoculation.        (4) That by successive inoculations with virus, the
activity    of   which is progressively diminished either by passing through
a series of monkeys, or by the action of dry air upon the spinal cords
which contain it, it is possible to confer upon dogs and other animals,
 together with man, immunity against subsequent infection with the
most active lyssic virns.
    In reference to these statements, the first points for investigation
 were now, the effects produced by inoculation with the cerebro-spinal
substance of a rabid animal upon the brain of another, and whether
 the symptoms stated to be produced thereby were those of infective
 rabies — lyssa — or, as some contended, merely a neurosis resulting from
 the injection of foreign matter.
    In the methods adopted in these experiments,        I have followed those
 described by M. Pasteur in his published statements, but for im
 parting to me many details of manipulation, I am greatly indebted to
 Professor Horsley, F.R.S.,who learned them from M. Pasteur himself
 in Paris.
             II.  Methods  of Preparation and Inocidation with Virus.
    The animal from which it is desired to inoculate having died or
 been     killed, a part of the spinal cord is exposed, and the portion
 desired removed,      with precautions against contamination, the requisite
 instruments, vessels, and other apparatus having been previously
  sterilised by the recognised methods; the medulla is then carefully
  (found up to a homogeneous pulp in a glass mortar, and triturated
  with the proper proportion of sterilised beef-bouillon, as prescribed by
     vol.  xliii.                                                     E

M. Pasteur.       Salt solution or any other indifferent fluid would no
doubt answer as well, but bouillon has the great advantage of showing
at once the occurrence of any septic change in the fluid, by th»
turbidity which it occasions.
   In order that the conditions of experiment might be strictly similar,
I  have myself always used definite proportions of cord and bouillon ;
as 1 inch of the former, of an average-sized          rabbit, weighs abont

was anaesthetised by aether     was soon found, however, that this was

writers from the time of Caelius Aarelianus,* nevertheless considerable
misapprehension    still generally prevails upon some points.       The

symptomB will vary in some respects in an animal kept quietly in
confinement from those found in the mad dog of the streets that has
lost its home and been hunted about.
     In most           first change observed is a dulness and sullenness,
                 cases the
with an indisposition to move, the animal lying crouched up in a corner;
probably this is invariably the first symptom, though, especially in
dogs at large, it may be overlooked, and the symptoms, or as some
times termed, stage, next following may be the first to attract notice.
In this, a shy and suspicious or threatening look is a most charac
teristic feature ; the previous dulness is succeeded by irritability and
constant restlessuess, with, usually, a disposition to fly at any strange
object and bite.    A depraved appetite is frequently noticeable in the
early stages, natural food being most usually rejected, hay and straw,
bits of cloth, wood or cinder frequently being eaten. This is one of the
most constant and best recognised symptoms, though not absolutely
invariable.
  Hydrophobia, or dread of water, is never present in the dog ; there
is sometimes   increased thirst, but in dogs in confinement this is not
generally marked: there is often inability to swallow from paralysis of
the muscles of deglutition and those of the lower jaw, which in an early
stage is usually observed drooping, with inability to close       though                it,

depressed    between the legs, as is described by some of the earlier
writers as a character of this disease, if it occurs in a street dog it is
the result of exhaustion.
    It has been usual to describe rabies in the dog as of two forms, the
furious and the dumb, or paralytic.         Fleming, however, and others
of the best authorities recognise that there is no real distinction
between the two, every case of rabies probably, if permitted to run its
course and terminate naturally in death, develops symptoms, more or
less marked, of paresis; there is no constant distinction between the
two forms, the difference consists merely in one or the other class of
symptoms, rage or paresis, being the more preponderant, according to
the part of the cerebro-spinal system which is principally affected.
    Whatever the disposition of the animal may be, it almost invariably
recognises its master or attendant, and is in some degree amenable to
his control until completely paralysed and unconscious.         There is a
danger in this feature that not being well known it may occasion the
presence of a virulent disease to be overlooked or mistaken, as
indeed frequently does happen.
    The post-mortem appearances of rabies in tbe dog bave frequently
been described as mainly negative, characterised by the absence of any
distinct lesions ; this, however, is only very exceptionally correct. In
animals which die naturally at the termination of the disease, tbe
appearances are in the majority of cases sufficiently diagnostic ; in
those killed at an earlier stage, as necessarily occurs in the large
                        "
majority of cases of street rabies," the condition of the stomach as
to its contents may be the only diagnostic character.
    The general condition is frequently wasted, to an extent dependent
upon the duration of the symptoms and the inability to feed.
    The brain and spinal cord being now recognised as the essential
seat of the virus, it is to the appearances they present that attention
is first directed.   In most cases the dura mater of both is distinctly
congested,   occasionally  intensely so ; I have seen one case at least of a
street dog killed in an advanced stage of the disease, where this
 membrane in a portion of the spinal cord received, was most intensely
 congested and livid in colour. This, however, is exceptional.      The pia
 mater of the hemispheres is likewise most frequently injected, and in the
 greater number of cases, capillary congestion is apparent in the cortex
 in microscopical sections, with extravasation of lymph cells through
 the walls of the vessels and perivascular lymph spaces into the sur
 rounding tissues. In the cerebellum this occurs to a more limited
 extent.   It is by no means confined to the floor of the 4th ventricle as
 has been sometimes stated.      Throughout the medulla oblongata it is
 constant, and often occurs in the spinal cord. In the latter, extravasa
 tion of red corpuscles or minute haemorrhages are frequent ; in some
 cases these are of large size and quite apparent to the unaided eye. In

                                    On Babies.                             5b
one case    of street rabies, in a part of the cervical portion of the cord
I found this so extensive as to obliterate nearly the whole of the gray
substance for some length of the cord, the haemorrhage becoming dis
tinctly organised, with the formation of vessels or channels ;        I have
found similar appearances in other parts of the cord in different cases,
but none so extensive as this.         These seem to originate in the vessels
running     in the   anterior  fissure,  iu which clots forming thrombi are
often apparent, presenting the appearances               figured by Gowers
(' Pathol. Soc.    Trans.,' vol. 28, 1876-77,  p. 10, 4c), though frequently
of greater extent proportionately to the size of the vessel. Extensive
extravasation and, in stained preparations, much granular matter is
always apparent, the formation presenting every appearance of being
caused by microparasites : in the majority of cases 1 have been unable
to demonstrate their presence, from causes mentioned below, but in
some few sections, as described, I have clearly found the microbes in
the pericellular and perivascular           lymph spaces, accompanied      by
appearances of embolism, and extravasation in the capillaries of their
 immediate neighbourhood.          The occurrence of these haemorrhages in
different situations, involving the roots of different sets of spinal
 nerves, will obviously affect the symptoms of paralysis according to
 the muscles supplied by the nerves involved.
    In the alimentary canal and respiratory organs conspicuous changes
are constantly present.       The tongue is generally dry and discoloured,
 often brown ; the epiglottis is frequently conspicuously injected,
 the lower part of the larynx so deeply congested as to appear crimson.
 This often involves the greater portion of the trachea and extends to
 the bronchi,     the lungs are generally congested, though to a variable
 extent, most usually they are bright red, with portions deeply injected,
 very frequently on the margins of the lower lobes ; parts of them
 sometimes are consolidated and livid.        Though some of these changes
 may be due to causes independent of rabies, congestion however is
 most usually present: oedema I have not found.
    The pharynx and oesophagus less frequently show congestion than
 the trachea, but the stomach, as generally remarked, shows very con
 stant and typical changes ; in every case, excepting one, in the dog, I
  have found it devoid of solid food ; in that case, as in every other
  excepting one, it has contained some hay ; in the greater number of
  the cases of street rabies there have also been found other foreign
  substances — cinders, coal, wood, cloth, &c.      In cases, however, of ex
  perimental inoculation, a dog confined in a cage throughout the course
  of the disease can have but little opportunity of eating any indigestible
  substances, excepting hay and straw.
     The stomach frequently contains a thick, dark-brown fluid, which
  is also found in the duodenum ; the mucous membrane if not dis
   coloured by the fluid present, is usually redder than normally ; con

pathognomonic.
    I  have found these present in nearly all the dogs I have examined
in which the disease has run its course ; in those that are killed during
its progress they are necessarily less developed.
    Their appearance is very diagnostic ; they occur in some few other
cases,f but then only, I believe, of small size ; when large or well
defined, as above described, in conjunction with the presence of foreign
 bodies, cinders, wood, cloth, &c., in the stomach, no doubt of the
 nature of the case can exist.
    The presence of hay alone, though suspicious, is not of itself con
 clusive, for in the
                       " Brown Institution " it has lately been found in dogs
 not rabid and apparently healthy, in some cases entirely filling the
 stomach ; this may be accounted for by the inability of these dogs in
 confinement to get grass, which when at large they constantly eat.                   I
 may add that the pylorus is invariably hyperaemic, sometimes intensely
 so  ; this is best observed in the serous coats.
     The appearance of the liver is variable, usually it is very dark and
 congested ; the spleen I have found normal in all cases except one,
 when it was somewhat enlarged, but unchanged in other respects.
     The salivary glands have hitherto been regarded as the seat of the
  virus, and received much attention, but they do not present any con
 stant pathognomonic           appearances ; in one case         I  found the sub
  maxillary gland somewhat hypertrophied and vascular, with the

not these glands are normal both to the eye and in microscopical
sections.
    The kidneys are frequently but not invariably congested; the
urinary bladder is generally so, and in the dog is frequently empty or
contains a small quantity of urine.
    The blood is always very dark coloured ; in about half the cases it
is fluid without any, or with very little clot ; its reaction very shortly
after death and within the vessels is neutral. No changes are apparent
in the tissues of the heart ; it is generally moderately distended with
blood, whether fluid or clotted. In the morphological elements of the
blood no alteration can be detected by the microscope, excepting in
some cases an increase in the number of leucocytes.                    In the micro
scopical appearances of the other organs or tissues the changes which
may occur, as has been described by some writers {e.g., the granular
appearance of the liver cells, by Bollinger), are to my observation by
no means constant, nor can they be regarded as pathognomonic.
     2. In the Babbit. — The occurrence of rabies in this animal has till
 recently been a matter of some doubt. The first authentically recorded
 case of the successful transmission of rabies to the rabbit is where
 Mr. Simonds (22nd April, 1838) at the Royal Veterinary College*
 inoculated two rabbits subcutaneously behind the ears with the saliva
 of a rabid sheep. After an incubation period of fonr days, they
 showed symptoms of infection, being found dull, hanging their heads
 and inclining them to one side ; one shortly afterwards showed ex
 citement; they then became comatose and died.                    The occurrence of
 paraplegia is not recorded. The incubation period is unusually short,
 but there appears no doubt that it was true rabies that was developed.
     In the rabbit, as in the dog, infection is very uncertainly produced
 by inoculation even with active cerebro-spinal substance into the
 subcutaneous tissues, and, when it does occur in the former animal,
 the symptoms are materially different from those previously regarded
 as typical in the dog, and nothing can be less appropriate than the
 application of the term rabies or lyssa to them.

 his work, before mentioned.        Youatt also (op. cit., p. 149) refers to cases of
 asserted rabies in the rabbit, mentioned in evidence before a Royal     Commission on
 that subject, but considers them doubtful.
    In 1879 M. Qaltier (' Paris, Acad. Med. Bull.,' vol. 8, p. 1114) inoculated a rabbit
 with the saliva of a case of hydrophobia in man, producing rabies with great excite
 ment.    From its submaxillary gland two other rabbits were inoculated, and became
 paraplegic.     In the same year (' Comptes Rendus,' vol. 89, p. 444) in twenty-fl re
  cases he transmitted rabies from a dog to rabbits, the incubation period being from
  four to forty-three days, the average in twenty-five cases being eighteen.

56                       Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
   The results of intracranial inoculation with virulent medulla, or
with the secretion of the salivary glands, of either rabid dog or rabbit,
are, as before stated, in all essential respects identical with those that
follow subcutaneous inoculation of the same matter — in the small
proportion of instances where this is successful — or with those
induced experimentally by the bite of a rabid dog, though in these,
as described below, the incubation period is of very variable and
uncertain duration and much prolonged.
   The first symptom of infection in rabbits is usually, as in the dog,
dulness; the animal sits up with its eyes closed, its head frequently
thrown back and inclined to one side. In some few cases, though
exceptionally, and not exceeding 3 or 4 per cent., the animal is rest
less and excitable, running round and round its cage, and altogether
hyperaesthetic ; still more rarely is it aggressive, in one case and one
only out of upwards of 200, have      I  seen a disposition to bite, and in
two or three others an inclination to butt. This as in dogs depends no
doubt on the disposition of the animal ; tame rabbits are usually
quiet and familiar enough, but those used to the care of them state
that occasionally a normal rabbit in confinement will attempt to bits
a hand put into its cage.
   Concurrently with this change, there is a rise of the rectal tempe
rature of about 1° C. from 39-2 — 39"8°, the normal, to between 40"
and 41° C., seldom exceeding the latter.            This rise is, I believe,
invariable, in the regular course of the disease, that                   if not
influenced by the action of drugs or other circumstances;           it is, very
                                                                             is
transient, and may occur during the night and easily be unobserved.
Usually  it  lasts about twenty-four hours and then begins to fall more
or less quickly, pari passu with the progress of paresis, which             the
                                                                              is
essential  feature  of this disease in the rabbit.       At  first the animal
moves slowly and with reluctance, its gait becomes unsteady, the
loss of power usually commencing in the hind limbs         ;   it then entirely
loses the use of them    ;  they are dragged after    itif it    moves, scram
bling along by its fore-legs ;   lies on its side with its hind- legs stretched
                                 it
 out respiration which was at first accelerated becomes slow and feeble,
     ;
the muscles of the trunk and those of the fore limbs are successively
paralysed, lastly those of the head and neck, the animal continuing
to feed to the very last, frequently dying with hay in its mouth and
between its teeth.     The motor nerves alone appear to be affected in
the rabbit, the reflexes remaining unimpaired to the last. A comatose
state always precedes death, which         very gradual and imperceptible,
                                          is
the temperature continuously falling to a very low point. The im
mediate cause of death appears to be paralysis of the respiration, in
those animals of which  I    have witnessed the death.     I    have found the

nearly half an hour.

    The post-mortem appearances in the rabbit are better marked and
more constant than in the dog.                The brain and medulla are more
frequently hyperaBmic ; in the majority of cases they are materially
softened, which is not altogether dependent upon the duration of the
symptoms       ;  sometimes     the spinal cord especially is so soft that       it is
difficult to detach a portion of it entire. The microscopical appear,
ances are        similar to those described in the case of the dog, but
haemorrhages in the substance of the cord, so frequent in the latter
animal, are not found in the rabbit.
    Continuing to feed till the very last, the stomach is usually full of
partially digested food, as is frequently the gullet, in this differing
markedly from the dog. The stomach constantly shows congestion,
with haamorrhagic spots in almost every case ; they may be minute and
very few in number, only two or three, but are always present unless
in those exceptional cases where death has followed very shortly after
the appearance of the first symptoms.                  These hemorrhages are
similar to those in the dog, occurring in the same' situation, viz.,
 chiefly towards the cardia and on the greater curvature, but are
 usually more conspicuous,            attaining a larger size and sometimes
 becoming confluent, covering a large portion of the wall of the
stomach.*
     The small and large intestines are generally normal, the fasces in
 the lower bowel being firm ; in summer, however, diarrhoea is some
 times present, though this is probably due to other concurrent causes,
 and not to the specific action of the virus.            I have never observed
 its occurrence during the winter months.             The same remark as to its
 cause applies also to the loss of condition and emaciation that is
 sometimes found.
     The subcutaneous tissue is generally very vascular, and small
 patches of congestion are found, which to superficial observation
  appear as red spots of variable extent.
     The larynx and trachea are almost invariably hypersemie, frequently
  intensely so ; the lungs are as frequently congested to a variable
  extent, the margin of the lower lobe being usually the seat of the
  greatest changes ; sometimes portions may be found consolidated or
  cyanotic, though this not unfrequently occurs in tame rabbits kept
  in confinement, and independently of experiment.
     The liver is frequently enlarged, almost invariably congested, and
  often engorged with dark blood ; in only two cases out of upwards of
  100 noted have      I  observed it perfectly unchanged and healthy.
     The spleen in nearly one-third of the cases is small.          I  have never
  observed it materially enlarged or softened.
     The kidneys are frequently congested, and the urinary bladder is
     •
        These are correctly represented in the accompanying drawing, fig. 3, of a very
   well marked  case.

always very vascular, generally distended with urine, frequently to an
enormous extent.     In one case I observed it of nearly the size of an
ordinary soda-water bottle, filling and distending the abdominal
cavity ; the urine is strongly acid, and in other respects normal.
  The blood, as in the dog, is always dark coloured, sometimes fluid,
but as often clotted, and I have observed in several instances that the
clot in the cavities of the heart was colourless and hyaline.               Its
morphological characters are unchanged, and as in the dog                   ita
reaction is neutral.
             IV.   Seat of the Virus and Results of Inoculation.
     In July last, having obtained   a rabid     " street dog," upon its death
another dog and a rabbit were inoculated by intracranial injection of
a portion of its medulla, prepared as above described.
   The dog was unaffected till the seventh day, when it was found
dull, lying crouched up in a corner of the cage ; the next day evident
symptoms of rabies were apparent, the animal being restless and
irritable, flying at and biting anything presented to       with com
                                                                it,
mencing paresis of the hind limbs       ;was never heard to bark, and
                                            it
died on the following day, the 9th.    As this was Sunday no further
changes had been noted.
  Examined the next day, the stomach and small intestine were             found
 devoid of solid contents,
                         containing only    dark-brown fluid conges
                                                 a                    ;
tion was apparent in the outer wall of the stomach    the appearances
                                                           ;
of the other organs were characteristic of rabies, as hereiubefore de
scribed, but less marked than in many other cases, owing to the very
rapid course of the disease, of the nature of which there could be no
 doubt.
    To prove this further, from its medulla a rabbit was inoculated
 intracranially, this animal showed an incubation period of only four
 days, when with a scarcely appreciable rise of temperature paresis
 commenced, and was complete on the sixth day, the animal being
 found dead on the morning of the seventh.
    The brain and spinal cord were found much softened, and with
 their membranes distinctly congested      the lungs presented typical
                                             ;
 appearances  ;  the stomach was highly vascular but showed no haemor
  rhages, in accordance with the rapid course of the disease, which, with
  the remarkably short incubation period, confirmed the view of the
  very active character of the virus, which the previous cases had
 suggested.
   From the medulla of the first above-mentioned    case of street rabies,
 the rabbit (narcotised by chloral hydrate) whioh was inoculated intra
 cranially, similarly to the dog, on the fifth day showed commencing
 paraplegia; this continued for the next two or three days the animal
                                                                  ;

then      partially recovered.        It   however ultimately relapsed and died on
the      23rd day.
     On post-mortem examination the appearances were found to be very
distinctly marked and diagnostic, the brain and spinal cord con
gested   and softened, the stomach showing moderately large and
distinct haemorrhagic spots (ecchymoses) ; the condition of the other
organs, too, was       typical.
  In this case, as in the dog, the incubation period was remarkably
short. The temporary recovery is uuparalleled in my observations, but
is recorded by M. Pasteur as sometimes occurring.            Other inocula
tions were made in the same manner intracranially           with virus from
different        sources, all with similar results as to infection and the
symptoms          produced, varying only in the length of the incubation
period.
              in dogs and rabbits proved sufficiently that by cerebral
     These cases

a    rabid street dog, or an animal infected from               it,

produced, -which in the dog does not differ in its essential characters
from ordinary street rabies       in the rabbit, however, its occurrence
                                       ;
was not so well recognised previous to M. Pasteur's experiments, and
the symptoms are different from those in the dog.
   In order, therefore, to meet the objection that these symptoms are
not those of infective rabies or lyssa, subcutaneous     inoculations with
infective medulla were practised.
   With this object a young healthy dog was injected under the skin
of  the back with half a c.o. of the mashed cord of        rabbit that had
                                                                      a
just died with the usual symptoms of paralytic rabies.
   The dog, beyond at times an apparently increased irritability and
disposition to bite, which may have been merely the result of confine
ment, showed no appreciable       change until the thirty-ninth day after
inoculation,    when      was observed to be markedly suappish and

 experiments failed to produce infection, as did also one in another

dog. In some cases the rabbits died of saprasmia (septic intoxication               y,
to which these animals are extremely liable.
    One rabbit, however, inoculated October 18th, 1886, subeutanepusly
with virulent medulla, on the twelfth day showed symptoms of
infection, with weakness of the hind limbs, the temperature being
below the normal and falling.         On the fifteenth day it was completely
paralysed and died in the afternoon, the post-mortem appearances
being highly characteristic, the stomach showing numerous large
well-defined haemorrhages, before described, conspicuous from the
serous surface as well as on the mucous membrane.
    In another rabbit inoculated in similar manner subentaneously, tho
result was precisely the same, excepting that the incubation period
was shorter.
    The results of   these inoculations in both dogs and rabbits showed
conclusively that     rabies is produced in both animals, alike by sub
cutaneous and by     intracranial inoculation of infective medulla of both
dogs and rabbits,    confirming M. Pasteur's statements in this respect.
    It  was   subsequently   found that in the rabbits and dogs thus
inoculated subentaneously without producing infection, no protection
 was afforded against the effect of subsequent intracranial inocula
 tion, which in every instance produced fatal infection.
    Still further to dispose of the objection that the symptoms follow
ing intracranial inoculation are not due to specific infection, a rabbit
was inoculated sub-durally by trephining with the usual quantity
 (0"l c.c.) of mashed spinal cord of a healthy rabbit.                 The animal
remained perfectly unaffected in any way for upwards of a month ; it
was then again inoculated intracranially with virulent medulla, by
which it was infected, and died after a short incubation period with
the usual symptoms and post-mortem appearances.
    I  have also made several other inoculations intracranially in rabbits,
 employing two or three animals at the same time, with medulla of
 suspected cases of rabies in different animals.              In many of these
 specific infection and death, with typical symptoms and appearances,
 have followed, but in those cases where the material used has not been
 specifically infective, the injections have been perfectly innocuous, the
 animals being in no wise affected by the operation.
    I have used for intracranial and sub-dural inoculation quantities of
 medulla, mashed and diluted in bouillon, of from 1 to 10 minims,*
 with the same results, without, in the large majority of cases, any dis
turbance, previous to or beyond the regular symptoms of infection,
following the operation, and without any perceptible difference in the
incubation period.        Some few animals, especially during the hot
 weather of August and September, died from accidental causes,
   * The latter quantity, however, is much greater than it is  necessary or desirable
to use.

 parasitica], lung disease, or other ailments, such as diarrhcea, and an
 epizootic form of nasal catarrh, invariably and rapidly fatal, to which
rabbits    in confinement seem to    be  very liable.
     For the sake of uniformity I have latterly always used in these
intracranial inoculations 0°1 CO., or one minim and a half of the
mashed medulla.
     Another experiment was as follows : — Two dogs were inoculated,
18/9/86, from the medulla of a rabbit of short incubation period.
The one a rough terrier, D 8, intracranially by trephining, the other
a smooth terrier,      D 9, by injecting half a c.c. of mashed medulla
into the tibial vein.
     Two rabbits were inoculated intracranially from the same cord;
they both died infected, with typical symptoms and appearances, after
an incubation period of seven days.
     Both the dogs, however, D 8 and D 9, remained unaffected.            The
 one,   D 8, after the lapse   of four   months  was  then  bitten sharply by
 a rabid dog in several places on the fore-leg, which had been previously
 shaved; but again in upwards of two months more has shown no
 symptoms of infection, though some rabbits bitten by the same dog
 were infected and died in the usual manner.            The other dog, D 9,
 after the lapse of some months was again injected in the tibial vein
 with half a syringeful of virulent rabbit's medulla, but it also up to
 the present time (five months after inoculation) has shown no dis
 turbance, though two rabbits inoculated intracranially from the same
 virna died infected in the usual course.
     This result was quite unexpected, both from my own experiments
 with rabbits and from the statements of others ; it shows how very
 much more strongly refractory to the infection with the virus of
 rabbit rabies dogs are than are rabbits themselves, in which, by
 intracranial inoculation, infection is produced almost invariably.
     All immunity from, or refractoriness to, infection is relative, as in
 the original case of vaccination against variola, and also in rabies, as
 shown conclusively long ago by Hertwig (loc. cit., infra), also by
 Chanveau       in the refractoriness of Algerian sheep to anthrax
 (' Comptes Rendas,' vol. 90, 1880, p. 1525), and stated in express terms
  by Pasteur himself in reference       to the general theory of protection,
  (ibid., vol. 90, 1880, p. 953).   Its bearing upon testing the results of
  inoculation in dogs, with the object of prophylaxis, is referred to
  below.
     To examine the infectivity of the peripheral nerves, I took a portion
  of the  sciatic nerve of a rabbit recently dead, one of a series of six or
  seven days'    incubation period, and triturated it with bouillon in the
   usual  manner, but as   it was more viscid or tenacious than the medul
   lary substance, I was obliged to dilute it more than in the usual pro
   portion, in order to render it sufficiently fluid to inject.

  62                          Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
     With it    I inoculated three rabbits intracranially by trephining ; all
  three showed a rise of temperature towards the end of the sixth day,
  and died with typical symptoms and appearances of infection shortly
  afterwards.
     As I had diluted the nerve substance about twice as much as I
  usually did medulla, and only injected the same quantities, producing'
  infection without any variation in the incubation period, it is shown
  to be fully as virulent as the cerebro-spinal substance ; and we may
  conclude that the tissues both of the central and peripheral nervous
  systems are equally the seat of the virus.*
                                                  I
     At an early stage of the investigation made a series of experiments
  upon the relative activity of the virus of the spinal cord and medulla
  oblongata of the same animals, and I found that as shown by the
  duration of the incubation period, there was no appreciable difference
 whatever in the infective virulence of the two.
     I have tried the infectivity of the tissues of the salivary glands of a
 rabid dog, or the secretion expressed from them, taking portions of
 the parotid and submaxillary, crushing each in a mortar, adding a
 small portion of bouillon, with which it was macerated for a time, the
 fluid then being injected intracranially in rabbits.
     Of two rabbits inoculated from the submaxillary gland one died
 on the 2nd day apparently from an accidental cause, the other was
 found dead in the morning of the 4th day, no symptoms of
 infection having been apparent nor any pathognomonic appearances
 on post-mortem examination.              Two other animals were inoculated
 intracranially from its medulla and both remained unaffected.                     The
 two rabbits inoculated from the parotid both developed symptoms of
 infection on the 17th day, and died during the 20th with typical
 appearances, showing apparently that the tissues or secretion of the
 parotid gland are infective, but much less actively so than the
 medulla.
    * Hertwig (op. eit., infra, vide p. 65} failed to produce infection in six dogs
inoculated with the crural and sympathetic nerves of other rabid animals.
    Rossi, of Turin ('Torino, Accad. Sci. Mem.,' 1805-1808, p. 94) asserts that lie
produced rabies in a dog after an incubation period of eighteen days by inoculating
it ir the tail with a portion of the crural nerve of a rabid cat just killed. This cat,
however, was one of " several " which he states that he rendered rabid          by con
fining in a room without food or drink ; then killing them, he inoculated the
different fluids of the body to ascertain which besides the saliva most readily
induced rabies, and found that only that secretion and the nerret while warm, did
so. In a subsequent communication (' Memorie,' &c., vol. 80, 1826, p. 22) he further
states that two dogs became rabid by being bitten by a cat confined as described,
but that by similar means he was unable to excite rabies in dogs.
    His experiments appear to have been numerous, but his statements on this point
are difficult to understand if his own conclusion be rejected, that rabies in the cat is
spontaneous and may be produced experimentally.

  The infeotivity of the blood of rabid animals has been a moot
question, some accounts having asserted infection to have been pro
duced   by inoculation with     it,
                                 the experiments having, of course, been
made by subcutaneous inoculation.
I     have taken blood from the heart of        rabbit recently dead of

being unaffected in any way.
 It   seems probable that, as in other analogous cases, this fluid   but

exceptionally infective, or only so in large quantities, as     it   not
the primary seat of the virus, which we now know to be principally
in  the tissues of the central nervous system.
     The value of these methods of intracranial inoculation with rabbits,
from the     greatly curtailed incubation period and practically certain
resulting infection, for the purpose of determining whether a suspected
case   is one of true rabies or not,  isobvious.
    In one instance a dog was destroyed at Caterham in a state,
apparently, of furious rabies, after having bitten several persons and
other dogs  ;   as
                 it   was very desirable to ascertain positively the nature
of   the case,
            I    inoculated from a portion of its medulla a rabbit, which
after sixteen days developed symptoms of infection, and died shortly
afterwards of paralytic rabies.
    In another instance received a portion of the spinal cord of a dog
                       I
that had bitten several persons at Grantham, but which, as was stated,
 showed no symptoms of rabies         ;from the cord   inoculated a rabbit
                                                        I
 by   trephining, and after nineteen days symptoms of infection appeared,
 the animal dying in the usual manner, leaving no doubt as to the dog
 having been rabid.
     The duration of the incubation period, too, being proportionate to
 the activity    of the virus, which varies from different sources, may
 in   case of death from hydrophobia, afford a means of determining the
 source whether, e.g., infection arose from the bite of a rabid street
 dog, or was caused by inoculation with rabbit virus.
     This must, however, be received with some reservation, the incuba
  tion period resulting from inoculation with the virus of street rabies in
  some cases, though very exceptionally, being even shorter than that
 of    the Pasteurian or constant rabbit virus, as shown in two of my
  experiments (supra, p. 58) where in      dog and rabbit inoculated sub-
                                           a
  durally from the cord of a street dog, this period was respectively
   seven and five days, and in another rabbit similarly inoculated from
   the lasUnientioned dog, it  was only four days.

    V. On     the Occurrence   of Infectivity in  the Tissues after Inoculation.
     The period at which the tissues of an animal inoculated may
  become virulent, or the bite of a dog be infective, is of importance,
 and as yet there are no observations on record to enable us to form an
 opinion on this point.
     I had found in numerous experiments that if a rabbit was killed
 upon the termination of the incubation period, on the appearance of
 the first appreciable symptoms, its medulla was as actively infective
 as that of an animal which had died after the disease had run its foil
 course.
    To determine at what period this infectivity is developed I inocu
 lated five rabbits, A, B, C, D, and E, intracranially in the usual
 manner from a medulla of six to seven days' incubation period.
     Of these A was killed towards the termination of the 2nd day,
 about 44 hours after inoculation, and from its cord two otheri, A
 2 and 3, were also inoculated intracranial ly.           Another animal, B, was
 killed   at  the  expiration  of  the  4th day, and   B   2 and 3 were similarly
 inoculated.       A third, C, first showed symptoms of infection towards
 the close     of  the 7th day, about 164 hours after inoculation ; it was
 thereupon killed, and C 2 and 3 were inoculated intracranially. D
and E, which developed symptoms during the same day as C, were
allowed to die in the regular course of the disease ; the one was fonnd
 dead on the 10th, the other died during, the 11th day, with typical
symptoms and appearances. From the medulla of this latter two other
animals,     E   2 and 3, were inoculated.
    Of    these rabbits,   A  2 and 3 as    well as  B  2   and 3 were altogether
unaffected, with the exception of a slight and transient rise of tempe
rature on the 5th day in A 2, which was probably accidental.
    C 2 and 3 developed symptoms by the 7th day, which took their
usual course.        No. 2 was found dead on the morning of the 12th day,
No. 3 dying during the same day.
    D 2 and 3 showed an incubation period of six to seven days, and
died shortly afterwards.
    From this it appears that the spinal cord of an infected animal is
not itself in anywise virulent till towards the close of the incubation
period, concurrently with the appearance of the first symptoms of
constitutional disturbance.          I think we may conclude from this that
the virus is latent at the site of inoculation till this period, when,
somewhat suddenly, it bursts forth and pervades the tissues.               In the
case   of   bites   from  rabid   animals   this seems    to suggest the possible
utility of excising or deeply cauterising the wound, even at a subse
quent period, and throws great doubt upon the authenticity of those
cases where hydrophobia has been said to have been occasioned by
the bite of an animal, which itself remained unaffected for a consider

 able time        afterwards ; and             I  should be disposed to conclude that if
 such an        animal developed no symptoms of rabies for some days after
 having bitten a person or other animal, the latter would be safe from
 any danger of infection.*
     * The most extensive and important observations and experiments upon this
 subject ever recorded before M. Pasteur's                    are those of Hertwig, made in the
 Veterinary School of Berlin between the years 1823 and 1827.                    They are published
 in Hufeland        and   E. Osann's       ' Journal, f. prakt. Heilkunde,' Berlin, vol. 67, 1828,
 (Beit.    z.   nahern Kentniss         d.   Wuthkrankheit, oder Tollheit d. Hunde, von Dr.
 Hertwig). They have been but little noticed by English writers, important as they
 are.     Their chief results are :—
     (1.) Of 16 dogs inoculated          with the saliva of others rabid, by puncturing the skin
of the head, 6 died infected.
     (2.)  Of   7 similarly   inoculated         with the secretion   expressed   from   the parotid
glands, 1 was       infected.
     (3.) Of 2 inoculated with the crural and 4             with the sympathetic nerve, no infec
tion resulted.
     (i.) Saliva put in the mouth of more than 20 dogs in no case produced infection.
    (5.) Of 11 dogs inoculated with the blood of others rabid, taken during life and
ihortly after death, no specific infection occurred.
    (6.) Of 15 caused to be bitten by others rabid, 5 died infected l but of 137 appa
rently brought to the infirmary bitten by others rabid or (qy.) supposed to be so,
only 6 died infected.
    His own pug was inoculated nine times during three years and resisted infection,
but succumbed         to a subsequent trial. He remarks (op. evt., p. 172) that of the other
dogs    that died after inoculation, some withstood infection two, three, or four times,
and one died at first, clearly showing how variable is the degree of refraoloriness
possessed by different animals.
    His observations upon the symptoms and? appearances in upwards of 200 cases
that he    examined are carefully recorded, and his statement that he compared the
latter with those of healthy animals shows the scrupulous care with which they were
made.        Their description is fully given in his later work ' Die Krankheiten d.
                                  '
Hunde u. deren Heilung               (Berlin, 1853) .
    A series of observations made upon even a larger number — 375 cases of street
rabies, in the Veterinary              Institute of Vienna, during twenty years — is that of
Brackmuller, recorded in his ' Lehrbuch d. Pathol. Anatomie der Hausthiere '
 (Wien 1869). He found a morbid appearance in the stomach in 254 cases, or nearly
70 per cent., with the presence of foreign substances in it in 199 cases, or 55 per
tent, l it was " inflamed
                               " in 125, or 33 per cent.
    It appeare probable, however, that some at least of these cases may have been
destroyed during the progress of the disease, and not improbably some of them may
not have been cases of true rabies, which circumstance would materially affect the
proportions of pathognomonic              appearances    observable.
    The best work        extant on       this subject, of both literary merit and scientific
 accuracy,    is the well-known       '
                                        Rabies and Hydrophobia,' by George Fleming, LL.D.,
 Principal Veterinary       Surgeon to the Army (London, 1872) , which gives a complete
 and excellent      account of the disease in all its relations, with a notice of the prin
 cipal publications up to that time.               Of these the best in the English language are

                     VI.    Duration of      the  Incubation Period.
     The great variability of the incubation period and the extreme
 length to which it may extend after the bite of a rabid animal, is
well known, and constitutes the most unaccountable feature of this
 disease.     It is well established that both in man and the lower
 animals it may extend to at least several months, and even periods of
 some years have been recorded upon apparently good evidence.                        Sub
 cutaneous inoculation with saliva taken from the mouth in all the
 experiments which          I made failed.        In intracranial inoculations with
 the secretion expressed from the parotid gland, as previously described,
 the incubation period was seventeen days.
     By subcutaneous inoculation with the medulla of street rabies, it is
 uncertain and generally prolonged, both in dogs and rabbits, but by
 intracranial inoculation it is much shortened and more regular. I
have had two cases above recorded in rabbits, where the first symptoms
appeared on the fourth and seventh days respectively, after intracranial
 inoculation, but this is most unusual with virus from this source, i.e..
    The most important recent work upon the subject in English is the article by
Bollinger, in the American translation of Ziemssen's ' Cyclopaedia of the Medical
 Sciences,' which gives a good account of the aetiology of the disease, its symptoms,
and other features, both in man and the lower animals, with a notice of the previous
literature.
    A                                                   '
       copious bibliography is contained in the Dictionnaire Encyclope-diquc des
Sciences M^dicales,' ed. by A. Dechambre, Paris, 1874, article " Rage."            The list
is brought up to the date of the commencement of Pasteur's investigation and
the inauguration of the present views upon the subject in the ' Nouveau Diction
 naire de Meclecine et de Chirurgie Pratique,' by Dr. Jaccoud, vol. 30, Paris, 1881.
    The most complete account of the literature of the subject, however, is that given
 in the invaluable ' Index Catalogue of the Surgeon-General's Office U.S. Army.'
 Washington, 1885, vol. 6. Art.
                                     " Hydrophobia."
    The communications to the Royal Society upon rabies or hydrophobia have not
been    numerous or important ; they are mainly records of cases in man and report*
of asserted cures.    One of these by Dr. James has been above referred to.
    Amongst    the more recent publications upon this subject may be mentioned         that
of M. Bourrel, a veterinary surgeon, formerly in the French Army, and director of
the Institution for the Study of Canine Pathology in Paris.              His observations
 (' Traite  complet de  la Rage, chez  le Chien  et chez  le Chat, Moyen de s'en preserver,
Ac.,' Paris-, 1874) are important on account of the very large number of cases in the
 dog which he had the opportunity of observing.
    Between the years 1859 and 1872, as he states, out of 18,531 dogs admitted to the
establishment 1219 were rabid.          He advocates the prompt application of caustic
to the bite of a rabid animal, and admits that the enforced muzzling of dogs had
been beneficial ; but his specific to abolish all risk to man from this disease is by
filing down the points and sharp edges of the canine teeth and incisors of all dogs.
    Since the publication of M. Pasteur's results the only independent investigations
as yet recorded are those, before referred to, of Professor Frisch, in Vienna ; and,
more recently, in the ' Annales de l'lnstitut       Pasteur,' Paris, March, 1887, those of
Dr. Bardach, of Odessa, noticed below.

                                     On Rabies.                                 67
  rabid street dogs.     In other cases the period has been from seventeen
  to nineteen days, which appears to be about the average, and agrees
 nearly with that given by M. Pasteur and Prof. Prisch.
     When the virus of street rabies is passed through               a sufficient
 number    of rabbits the period is further rednced to six or seven days,
 and becomes     markedly constant.       In a period of about six months I
 have carried this virus, originally obtained from M. Pasteur's Labora
 tory, through a series of twenty rabbits, inoculating two or more of
 each series.    In the large majority of cases the first symptoms of in
 fection have appeared between the sixth and seventh days, exception,
 ally not till the eighth day, in a few instances till the ninth. Latterly I
 have observed two cases in which the latent period was only four days.
     In one case quite recently, two rabbits were inoculated intracranially
from one of a Pasteurian series, that had died after a very unusually
short incubation period, with characteristic symptoms, but of only
some hours' duration, on the fourth day after inoculation.                 One of
these so inoculated died on the third day, apparently from accidental
causes, the other remained unaffected           and healthy till the fortieth
day, when it was observed to be paralysed, and was found dead the
following morning, with post-mortem appearances that were very
well marked and characteristic ; the haemorrhages in the stomach,
though not perceptible on the serous coats, were larger on the mucous
surface, though few in number, than any other I have observed,
almost resembling, as has been described, "crushed currants."                 This
duration of the incubation period is quite exceptional.
    From the medulla of this case two other rabbits were inoculated
by trephining ; they both showed an incubation period of the usual
length — six to seven days — with well-marked symptoms, thus proving
that the remarkably protracted incubation period in the above case
was due to some accidental cause, and that the virus had undergone
no permanent modification.
    I have had the opportunity of inoculating intracranially from the
medulla of a rabid horse, in this case with an incubation period of
seventeen days, and from a rabid ox, as also from a case in man, in
all of which it was about the same, and the symptoms of infection and
post-mortem appearances were identically similar to those following
inoculation from the dog or rabbit.
    I have also inoculated rabbits from the medulla of a furiously rabid
cat,* which had been itself inoculated from a street dog. In this case
the incubation period — in the rabbits — was between seventeen and
eighteen days, with the regular symptoms and post-mortem appear
ances.
    That in inoculating rabbits intracranially, the duration of the in
cubation period is usually determined by the activity of the virus,
      * The same animal that bit the man, Joseph Smith, hereinafter mentioned.
                                                                      F 2

and only very exceptionally by any reaction of the animal inoculated,
 is shown by the circumstance that, however many animals, of the
same species, are inoculated from the same source, this period gene
rally shows no variation at all in them, though the duration of the
disease, and consequent occurrence of death, is evidently dependent
mainly upon the age, condition, and vigour of the subject.
       VII.   Preservation     of the Virus and Methods of Modification.
    On the occurrence of septic decomposition in the medulla the vims
is destroyed, but M. Pasteur has stated that by removing portions of
virulent medulla with precautions against contamination, and sus
pending them in an atmosphere of pure carbonic acid, their infectivity
is retained unimpaired for some weeks.
   I have not, however, found this to be the case ; I have in several
experiments carefully removed a portion of the cord of a rabid
rabbit, passing it and the ligature to which it was attached through
the flame of a spirit-lamp and suspended it in a vessel, previouly
disinfected, plugged with sterilised cotton-wool, and kept saturated by
a constant current of CO2, filtered through cotton-wool.
   In every case       I found that within a few days the virus was mate
rially modified, and soon completely destroyed, the rapidity of the
change probably depending upon the temperature. In summer on
the third day this diminution in virulence is apparent in the results of
inoculating rabbits with it. Septic microbes, however, do not develop
in the medullas, as long as kept in this manner.
   I consequently find this method unsuitable for preservation of the
virus for even the shortest period.
   The basis of M. Pasteur's present methods of protective inoculation
consists in the asserted progressive modification and ultimate extinc
tion of the virus which is produced by suspending a portion of infective
medulla in a current of dry air. The methods adopted are to take
out a portion of the spinal cord of a rabid rabbit soon after death,
then passing it lightly through the flame of a spirit-lamp,* in order to
destroy any septic germs which may have fallen upon its surface, to
suspend it by a ligature similarly flamed, in a previously sterilised
bottle, with tubulature at top and bottom, plugged with cotton-wool,
and containing a quantity of caustic potash.
    Thus prepared the cords are gradually dried ; the potash, absorbing
all moisture, prevents any development of septic organisms quite
effectually. A portion of a cord dried for the length of time required
for inoculation is then triturated with bouillon, strained as befoi*
described, and injected subcutaneously.
   • The  sterilisation   however is superfluous, inasmuch                do not
                                                           as saprophytes
develop in dry air.

                                 On Rabies.                             69
     Pasteur states (' Comptes Rendus,' vol. 101, 1885, p. J70) that the
  progressive modification of virulence in cords thus preserved          is
 attested by the increasing length of the incubation period in rabbits
 inoculated intracranially with them, and that the duration of this
 period increases regularly with those dried up to seven days, but
 that from and after that period they are not virulent.
    I have myself in several experiments invariably found the latter
 part of this statement correct, and that cords dried for seven days or
 more are absolutely inert, as are frequently those of six and of five
 days.
    But  I have not  by any means found the progressive prolongation
 of the incubation period, with cords dried for a shorter time, as regu
 lar as he records, but on the contrary I have found it usually the same
 as with fresh cords, unaltered up to and including the fourth day ; in
 one case only when inoculating from one dried four days, did the first
 symptoms of infection, which were not well marked, appear to be
 deferred till between the ninth and tenth day, the animal dying on
 the thirteenth.
    As in cords thus treated the virus certainly becomes altogether
 extinguished, teste Pasteur, and, as I have myself found, somewhat
 suddenly, by the seventh day, it appears doubtful what benefit can
 result by inoculating   subcutaneously with those of a longer period,
 with the object of prophylaxis.
    The preservation of cords by this method, in an atmosphere kept
perfectly dry by caustic potash, entirely prevents the occurrence of
microbial putrefaction ; its absence is plainly evinced by no fetor being
perceptible in them, as saprophytes are unable to develop in a per
fectly dry atmosphere, as well as in one of carbonic acid.
   I have too examined with the microscope portions of cords thus
preserved for different periods, but have never recognised any micro
phytes ; if they had been present in any numbers they could not have
escaped observation.
   To prove their absence certainly, I took part of a cord preserved as
described for five days, and suipping the outer surface, which was
dry and firm,  I plunged a sterilised platinum needle into its substance,
which was moist and viscid, adhering in very appreciable quantities
to the needle.    With this I inoculated a tube of agar-agar bouillon
peptone, and performed this operation three times ; the tubes thus
inoculated were placed in the incubator at 38° C., no organisms de
veloped,   and their contents remained altogether unchanged until
they ultimately dried up, showing the total absence of septic microbes.
   I may add that in a room of any ordinary laboratory it would,         I
believe, be practically impossible to remove any number of cords and
transfer them to the requisite vessels, without some germs of septic
 organisms falling upon them during the operation ; and that con

 70                       Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
sequently the only reliable means of preserving them from septic
 changes is by keeping them under conditions where saprophytes cannot
 develop, such as that adopted by M. Pasteur and here followed.
 Another method would be to keep them at a very low. temperature.
    The result of attempting to protect rabbits by subcutaneous injec
tions with medullas treated as above, is in accordance with these obser
vations. Here, as recorded below, in the first series of experiments,
where large quantities were injected, death shortly followed from
sapraemia in every one of the animals inoculated ; in the second series,
using smaller quantities for injection, fewer deaths from the same cause
occurred, illustrating the distinction between infection with a specific
bacterial virus and intoxication by a chemical poison, viz., that in the
former cuse within certain limits, the result is independent of the
quantity inoculated, one viable germ producing the same effect as an
immeasurably greater number ; but in the other case — the action of a
soluble or chemical ferment or poison — the effect is directly and
obviously proportionate to the quantity used for inoculation.
                        VIII.  Protective Inoculation.
   In the first series of experiments upon rabbits, five were taken and
inoculated daily after M. Pasteur's original methods with half a
Pravaz syringeful — about 0-7 c.c. — of mashed spinal cord, commencing
with that dried as just described for 15 days ; on the third day with
one of 13 days ; on the fifth with one of 11 days ; the sixth with one
of 10 ; and so on daily, or as often as a cord of the requisite age was
available, till the thirteenth and last inoculation was made with a
cord dried one day only, and as several previous experiments had
shown, of unmitigated virulence, at least for rabbits.
   Three of the rabbits, however, had died during the course of the
inoculations ; one, the youngest of the batch, which died first, appa
rently from accidental causes, the two others from sapraemia ; but two
remained for the concluding inoculation, and these both died a few
days after it was made. None of them, however, showed any symptoms
of infection with rabies, they were those of sapraemia or septic in
toxication. The series of experiments was inconclusive therefore in
its results, and it seemed possible that the quantity of matter injected
was too large.
   In a subsequent      communication (' Comptes Rendus,' 2nd Nov.,
1886) M. Pasteur, objecting to the results of similar experiments pub
lished by Prof essor Frisch, of Vienna (' Wiener Med. Wochenschr.,' re
                                                    or " intensive " method

ferred to below), promulgated a new " rapid
of treatment, which appeared likely to be more successful with rabbits,
liable as these animals are to septic poisoning by inoculation with any
foreign matter.      Accordingly six rabbits were taken, all apparently

healthy, and were inoculated in the following manner, with medullas
of progressively increasing virulence, 0-15 c.c. of the mash prepared

  Of   the rabbits thus inoculated,     one was found much wasted      and
partially paralysed     behind, with a falling temperature, on the 6th
day after the concluding inoculation, it died on the 9th day with well
marked and unmistakable post-mortem appearances.
    A second animal died on the 11th day after the last inoculation
with symptoms and appearances that clearly showed infection. A
third was first affected on the 19th day, and died on the 22nd, clearly
of paralytic rabies.
    Two others died some days after the completion of the inoculations
with appearances of saproemia. One remained in good condition and
unaffected ; this on the 24th day after the last inoculation, was
injected intracranially with 0-l c.c. of mashed medulla of a rabid
rabbit just dead. On the 6th day following, the temperature, pre
viously normal, rose to 40° C, and the following day was the same,
 with commencing paresis. The symptoms followed the usual course,
 and the rabbit was found dead on the morning of the 11th day ;
 the duration of the disease —between four and five days — showed the
 animal to be very robust and healthy, consequently a most favourable
 subject for protection, but the shortness of the incubation period —
 the test rightly applied by M. Pasteur to the activity of the virus —
 proves that it was not in any wise modified by any refractoriness in
  duced in the animal by the previous inoculation ; and    I  think it must
 be concluded from these experiments that the method followed, essen
  tially in accordance with M. Pasteur's last published rapid method,
 is,  as far as rabbits are concerned, inefficient to confer any immunity
  against subsequent infection, and dangerous as likely to produce it.
     It must, however, be understood that M. Pasteur has not asserted
 in   his communications to the Parisian Academy, that rabbits are
  capable of being protected.    He has confined his statement to dogs.

  subject for these experiments than the rabbit, being far more re-

accidental    affections, parasitical and others, by which the latter animal
is constantly attacked ; moreover, it is rightly regarded as the typical
subject, the fons et origo of the malady here under investigation.
   Two dogs were taken for this trial, the one a mongrel hound of
medium size, Pr. No. 1, the other a rough white terrier, Pr. No. 2,

    These dogs both remained unaffected in any way whatever, and on
the 6th November the first, Pr. No. 1, had the fore-leg shaved, and
 was bitten by a rabid street dog, the teeth of which penetrated the
 skin in several places, drawing blood, the saliva also was evident upon
 the leg, and was spread with a scalpel over the marks of the teeth,
and where the skin had been cut in shaving.
    This dog remained perfectly unaffected, lively, and good-tempered
for more than four months after being bitten ; it was then again
 inoculated by injection into the tibial vein of half a c.c. of active
 virus, again without showing any symptoms of infection up to this
 present time (twenty days after inoculation).*
    At the same time a fresh dog, a rough white terrier, D 10, was
 similarly inoculated in the tibial vein with the same virus ; this
 animal also remains unaffected, though rabbits inoculated intra-
 cranially from the same cord died infected in the usual course.             This
 animal is obviously strongly refractory to infection.
    The second dog inoculated for protection, the rough terrier, Pr.
 No. 2, was kept under observation without showing any disturbance
till the 24th January, 1887, when it was inoculated intracranially
 under aether, with a full quantity of the mashed spinal cord of a
rabbit of the Pasteurian series recently dead.
    Two rabbits were similarly inoculated with the same virus, they
                * P.S.— And for three months subsequently.
                                                              29/7/87.

                                   On Rabies.                            73
both    died with usual symptoms of infection, after an incubation
period of 6 — 7 days.
    The dog, however, after recovering from the effects of the
anaesthetic, remained perfectly well and unaffected in any way, and
appears, as the first, to be completely refractory to infection by the
most active method of inoculation.
                            I
    From these two cases should have concluded that the methods of
protective inoculation introduced by M. Pasteur were successful and
efficient in dogs, but the cases of the three unprotected animals
described (viz., D 8 and D 9 supra, and D 10), which are equally re
fractory to infection, do not support this conclusion as a result of the
limited number of my experiments upon this point. The virus of
rabbit rabies, almost invariably infective by intracranial inoculation to
animals of that species, would appear to be less certain in its action
upon dogs, and it is only by the results of a series of numerous com
parative experiments that a final conclusion can bo formed, whether
these methods have or have not any effect in increasing the constitu
tional refractoriness of the dog to infection with rabies. I would add,
however, that it appears to me from the more numerous recorded expe
 riments of others upon dogs, viz., those of Professor Frisch, of Vienna,
 and those of Professor Horsley at the " Brown Institution," exclusive
 of those on an extended scale by M. Pasteur himself, in all of which
 infection seems to have been invariably produced by intracranial in
 oculation, that the principle of protection is established, and that in
 some cases at least, judged by the results of comparative experiments,
 increased refractoriness to infection in the dog is produced by the
 methods indicated, which is as much as could be expected or hoped
 for, immunity, as above remarked, being always merely relative.
    With regard to the protective inoculation of man, the end and
 object of M. Pasteur's work, this cannot be conclusively judged by
 the result of experiments upon the lower animals of widely different
 constitution; for in the rabbit and the dog its effect is very dissimilar;
 all that this can do is to establish or disprove the principle of the
 method.     It is by the statistics of the treatment in man that it must
 be judged.     These will no doubt be examined exhaustively by the
  Parliamentary Commission now sitting.
     Taking, however, the accounts last published (' Comptes Rendus,'
  24th January, 1887) in which the number of patients treated is stated
  at 2682, and the deaths amongst them from all causes 31, or only
  1*15 per cent., it appears probable that the treatment has been suc
  cessful in at least somo cases, since all published statistics, widely as
  they vary, give a mortality from the bites of rabid dogs much in
  excess of this.
     But beyond this, inasmuch as the last injection in each course is
  made by Pasteur with virus dried for one day only and not materially

74                              Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
or at all modified, this would presumably be infective in a considerable
proportion of oases unless the patients were protected by the pre
ceding inoculations.
     I  cannot, however, as above stated, avoid the conclusion that the
rapid method of inoculation is dangerous.                 This opinion is confirmed
by the experiments of Professor Frisch, of Vienna, the only inde
pendent investigation of these methods yet recorded.*
     The statistics of his treatment must very shortly show whether
the mortality amongst his patients has or has not increased since the
practice of his intensive methods.
     Within the last few days, too, since the above was written, this
opinion of the danger of infection from the intensive or rapid
method of treatment is strengthened, by a report published in the
current number of the ' Annales ' of the Pasteur Institute, by Dr.
    * His first report
                         (' Wiener Med. Wochenschr.,' 1886, April 24th, No. 17) in the
main confirmed the results of M. Pasteur ; twelve dogs protected by the original
method resisted intravenous injection of acute virus, while three out of six control
animals were infected.
    In a second report (ib., 7th August, 1886, No. 32), of sixteen rabbits inoculated
by trephining, with fifteen of which preventive inoculations were commenced imme
diately afterwards, and continued daily for eighteen days, all save two died infected.
    M. Pasteur having attributed this unfavourable result to the inoculations      having
followed one another too slowly, and recommended his rapid or intensive           method
 (' Comptes Rendus,' 2nd November, 1886), Professor Frisch repeated his            experi
ments on a larger scale, following the new method of inoculation, with             almost
uniform failure, and consequently concludes decidedly that this is dangerous.
              I
    Nor can overlook a case in man, all the stages of which, both before and after
his treatment by the rapid method of M. Pasteur, were within my own observation.
It   is that of Joseph Smith, or Goffi, of this Institution, already noticed in different
journals.     He was bitten sharply on the hand by the furiously rabid cat above
mentioned ; within a few minutes the wounds were woll washed under the tap,
sucked by himself, and then, together with his mouth, washed with a strong solu
tion of permanganate of potash, again with water, and then thoroughly treated
 with anhydrous carbolic acid — absolute phenol. Shortly afterwards the pans bitten
 were excised under chloroform.          The same night he was taken to Paris, and the
 following day his treatment by M. Pasteur's intensive method commenced.
    Shortly after the completion of the course and his return home, he developed
 symptoms of spinal paralysis and died under circumstances which suggested the
 probability of his having been infected by rabbit virus. A report of the case will, I
believe, shortly be published by those who had charge of it.
    The wounds caused by the bite were thoroughly cauterised so shortly afterwards,
that there was certainly every prospect of his escaping infection from that source.
The symptoms developed and other circumstances seem to point clearly to the cir
 cumstance of his having been infected by subsequent inoculation, and not by the
 original bite. The incubation period in the rabbits which were,    I believe, inoculated
from     his medulla,    will settle this conclusively. It must, however, be remarked
that he was      debilitated during the treatment in Paris by the effects of intemper
ance, and consequently, no        doubt, rendered more susceptible to infection by the
inoculations    to which he was subjected there.

                                   On Rabies.                              75
 Bardach, Director of the Bacteriological       Institute at Odessa, where
 of 15 dogs inoculated intracranially with lyssic vims from different
 sources, and immediately afterwards subjected to protective inocula
 tion by M. Pasteur's intensive method, 6 developed rabies, 9 surviving.
  Of 6 control animals, similarly infected, all died.     Of the 6 protected
 animals that died, 3, as is shown, were infected with paralytic rabbit
 rabies, the result of the subcutaneous inoculations ; again showing the
 dangers of this method.      The proportion, too, of the survivors, 9 out
 of 15, or 60 per  cent,  is not favourable.
               IX.   The Action of some Drugs upon Infection.
    The various    substances     and measures    that have   been  tried  as
remedies    for rabies are innumerable, from viper's venom          to  plain
 water; from time to time certain cases of cure have been announced,
but a large proportion of these may obviously be accounted for by the
absence of infection ; others in which distinct symptoms               of the
disease are recorded     are more difficult to dispose   of, though some of
them     in man      probably were not true hydrophobia            or lyssa,
but a nervous or hysterical affection simulating its symptoms, —
lyssophobia.
    In investigating the action of drugs upon animals infected with
this virus,  it appeared to me that two methods of treatment might be
followed, the one to endeavour       to destroy the virus, almost certainly
a micro-parasite,    by the  administration   of a germicide ; the other, to
treat the symptoms developed with appropriate remedies, and by the
use of tonics and stimulants to enable the animal to survive the
attack, when, as in other cases, the virus would have exhausted itself
and died out.       The explicit statement of M. Pasteur (vide infra),
that spontaneous recoveiy in dogs does sometimes occur, seemed to
offer some prospect of success by this method.
   I naturally commenced with bichloride of mercury, as being not
only the most powerful germicide known, but also almost equally
active as an antizymotic, in the combination of these two qualities
standing quite alone ; it has, too, lately been stated that Dr. Theodore
Cash had found it a prophylactic against infection with anthrax
inoculated subsequently to its use.         I had thus some hopes of its
efficacy in rabies.
   I found that G to 7 tenths of a milligram was about the maximum
dose that could be safely given to a medium-sized rabbit ; con
sequently I inoculated one, 26/9/86,            intracranially with active
virus, and three hours afterwards injected subcutaneously 2 minims of
i   per cent. solution of bichloride of mercury; this was continued
daily, with the interval of one Sunday.         The animal was unaffected
 in any way till the 9th day, when the temperature rose to 41-2° C.,

76                       Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
paresis with the usual symptoms of infection was observed, and it
died on the 12th day with characteristic appearances.
   In the control animal, infected in similar manner, the incubation
period was of exactly the same length, and it died on the same day
as the one treated  with sublimate, which had been therefore obviously
inoperative in this case to destroy or in any wise modify the action of
the virus.    Had it only prolonged the incubation for a few hours it
would have encouraged         further trial, but with the result here
 obtained I saw no object  in  this.
   Benzoic acid is recognised as a powerful germicide : Graham
Brown (' Archiv Exper. Pathol.,' vol. 8, p. 144) found its soda-salt
remarkably destructive to the virus of diphtheria.      Babbits will take
considerable                         —
                quantities of this benzoate of soda — continued for
several days, without any ill effects.
   A rabbit inoculated intracranially with rabies, 15/9/86, one
hour afterwards received by subcutaneous          injection 1 c.c. of a
saturated solution of the salt, which was repeated daily ; on the
seventh day the animal, much wasted, showed symptoms of infection,
 with paresis and rise of temperature ; it died on the afternoon of the
9th day with well -marked characteristic appearances.       In a control
rabbit similarly inoculated the incubation period was one day longer
than in the animal treated with the benzoate, and it died about twelve
hours later. Here, too, the drug obviously had no beneficial action,
and even seemed to tend to shorten the incubation period, and assist
the activity of the virus.
   I next tried iodine, as an active germicide, dissolving it in a solu
tion of potassic iodide.    I found subcutaneous injections of 2 cgrms.
of iodine were borne well, which is a materially larger quantity rela
tively to their weight than the established dose for man. Accordingly
a rabbit was inoculated with active lyssic virus, 25/10/86, and an
hour afterwards 1 cgrm. of iodine in solution was injected subcu-
taueously ; this was repeated on the three following days, when the
quantity was increased to 2 cgrms.     On the afternoon of the 7th day,
however, paresis appeared, and the temperature rose to 40,7° C., and
on the morning of the 10th day the animal was found dead, with
post-mortem appearances that were quite characteristic. In a control
animal inoculated at the same time the incubation period was similar,
and it died about eighteen hours after the first.
   Thus iodine appeared as inert as the substances previously tried in
its action on the virus.
   The next remedy that suggested itself was chloral hydrate. This
is not only a powerful germicide but has been often recommended as
having a specific action upon the symptoms in rabies, acting directly
upon the brain and spinal cord. Babbits will take enormous doses
of this ; 4 grammes even, in an average rabbit, frequently producing

                                  On Babies.                            77
bat    partial narcosis, and after a few hours no disturbance what
ever.
    A rabbit infected in the usual manner, 30/10/86, one hour after
wards was injected with 1 grm. chloral hydrate ; this quantity was
repeated daily till, on the 7th day, the animal was found to be para
lysed, bat most unusually, the fore limbs were affected more strongly
than the hind ; the usual rise of temperature was absent or escaped
observation    ; it was found dead on the following morning, the 9th day.
A control rabbit similarly inoculated, after an incubation period of
between eight or nine days, died on the 12th day ; another with an
incubation period of eight days died on the 11th.
    This result, though not favourable to the protective action of chloral
hydrate, yet seemed to point to a modifying action on the virus in
some respects.        I had also observed the results of previous experi
ments which seemed to lead to the same conclusion.             On the 31st
July, 1886, a strong gray rabbit that had been partially narcotised by
the subcutaneous injection of about 3 grms. chloral hydrate, was
inoculated     intracranially with infective medulla; this animal re
mained quite unaffected till the 28th October, when it was found to
be partially paralysed with a falling temperature ; it died on the 30th
 October ; the post-mortem appearances were well marked and unmis
 takable.
    Again,  in  an experiment previously referred to, a large rabbit was
 narcotised    by the injection of 3 grms. of the same salt, and then
 inoculated intracranially from the medulla of a rabid street dog.     On
 the 5th day partial paraplegia was apparent, hut no rise in tempera-
 tare, which, however, may have occurred previously and fallen again ;
 the animal continued to feed well, and towards the 10th day appeared
 to be recovering, which it gradually did, and remained well till the
 22nd day, when it was found dead — any previous recurrence of
 symptoms not being observed.         The post-mortem appearances were
 remarkably distinct and diagnostic ; there could be no doubt that it
 died of paralytic rabies.
    As these were the only anomalous cases with intracranial inocula
 tions of intensified rabbit virus, as regards the incubation period, that
 I had had up to this time out of upwards of sixty cases, it appeared
 to me that the results described in two instances could not be due to
 mere chance, and must be owing to the action of the drug previously
 administered.      I therefore continned experiments with it.
    To another rabbit inoculated intracranially with active virus,
  1 gramme of chloral hydrate in solution was injected daily for seven
  days ; general paralysis was then observed, but again the rise of tem
  perature, usually one of the first symptoms, was not noticed, being
  probably inhibited by the action of the drug ; the animal died on the
  following, the 8 th day.

 78                       Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
    Two other rabbits similarly inoculated for control showed incuba-
tion periods of rather longer duration — eight to nine days, living till
the 12th and 15th days respectively ; the drug in this case had no
effect in prolonging the incubation period or in modifying the symp
toms. Again, to another rabbit infected in the usual manner, a smaller
quantity of chloral — half a gramme — was given by injection daily till
the 9th day, when, as in former cases, incipient paresis appeared,
but not as usual, commencing in the hind limbs, the fore limbs being
first strongly affected, in marked contrast to the regular course of the
symptoms ; there was again no rise of temperature ; the animal
gradually wasted, general paresis became complete, and it died on the
11th day.
    Two control rabbits similarly inoculated showed incubation periods
respectively of between four and five and seven and eight days, dying
on the 6th and 11th days.
    In this case the action of the drug certainly modified the symptoms
and possibly delayed their development and fatal termination :
another rabbit, therefore, inoculated intracranially from a rabid dog
was, from the second day after inoculation, treated daily with chloral
hydrate in quantities of from half a gramme up to 3 grammes till the
 7th day ; on the 9th day the animal was weak and losing condition, but
without any symptoms of specific infection, and there was no rise of
temperature.     It now received l'S grm. bisulphate of quinine without
any obvious effect. On the following day, morning and evening,
02 mgrm. bisulphate of strychnia, and subsequently 0-3 mgrm. was
given till the 12th day, when paresis commenced, and the animal was
obviously sinking, but without showing the usual course of tempera
ture; it died on the 17th day with very well-marked post-mortem
appearances.      The control animals similarly inoculated showed incu
bation periods of 17 and 20 days, dying both on the 21st day ; so
that here again the action of the drug was unfavourable, and I was
forced to conclude that, whatever effect it may have when admini
stered previously to inoculation, when given subsequently it has no
beneficial action at all.
   Terebine is highly extolled as an antiseptic and as a remedy in
many virulent diseases.     Mixed 1 part with 4 of olive oil, it may be
given to rabbits by subcutaneous injection of even 1 c.c. without
disturbance. Accordingly after infection I gave a rabbit daily, morn
ing and evening, 0-5 c.c. of terebine in olive oil. On the 10th day,
however, it was found paralysed, with a fall in temperature, and died
during the 11th day.
   A control animal showed no symptoms       till the 12th day, and lived
till the 15th.
   I  tried this drug again with another rabbit, using larger doses, but
with a similarly unsatisfactory result.

                                   On Rabies.                               79
    I next tried curari. The action of this on healthy rabbits is some
what   uncertain, a quantity of the same solution that at one time is
borne without disturbance, at another being rapidly fatal.         I
                                                                  found
that about 0-3 mgrm. of the sample I had and of the solution as I
made it was the maximum quantity that could be safely employed.      To
a rabbit inoculated sub-durally with infective medulla I injected sub-
cutaneously 0-2 mgrm. on the 5th day, and subsequently 03 mgrm.
daily ; the animal was unaffected till the morning of the 14th day,
when it was found weak in the hind limbs, the bodily temperature
having fallen to 35-4° C.  It died on the same day shortly after injec
tion of 0"3 mgrm. curari.    A control animal showed an incubation
period of only nine days, and was found dead on the morning of the
12th.
  In this case the curari appeared to protract the incubation period
and prolong the life of the animal ;      I
                                      therefore repeated the experi
ment with the drug, giving smaller quantities administered more
frequently.
   To a rabbit inoculated 4th December,        1886, 0"l mgrm. curari was
injected on the 4th day.       On the 5th morning and evening, 0-15 mgrm.,
and subsequently  0T5 mgrm. till the 10th day, when the temperature
had fallen to 38° C. and paresis was apparent, but confined to the fore
limbs. Injection of the same quantity of curari — 0-15 mgrm. — which
hitherto had been without any appreciable effect on the animal, now
greatly depressed it, within a few minutes of administration ; the
next day it was completely paralysed and died towards the middle of
the 12th day.
   In two control animals similarly inoculated the incubation period
was in each 9 days ; the one was then killed for another experiment,
the other died on the 11th day.       In this case the drug given more
frequently, but in the same aggregate quantity daily, had, if any, but
a very slight effect on the action of the virus in prolonging            the
incubation period or its fatal termination, and did not appear to
warrant further experiments with          it,
                                           the more especially as I   found
that even smaller quantities of curari than those      I  had given were
dangerous,   two  rabbits of average  size having  been killed,  the one by
injections twice in the day of 0*13 mgrm., the other by a single injec
tion of 0100 mgrm.
I    used the drug in      1per cent. solution, freshly made by carefully
triturating  itwith cold water only.
   Salol, salicylate of phenol,      a drug recently introduced, which
                                     is
from its constitution should be a powerful germicide.          Dissolved in
olive oil,   1part in 5,  and injected subcutaneously,     1 found      was
                                                                       it
borne very well in moderate quantities by rabbits.        I   consequently
treated  a  rabbit, inoculated with the virus of rabies, by giving          it
0   2grm. of salol twice daily during the incubation period, but as

80                        Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
compared with a control animal      I  found no benefit resulting from   iti
use.    I tried it again in another case in much increased quantities,
 but with no better results.
    I had thus tried divers agents, and the most powerful germicides
with which     I am acquainted, without the effects of infection being;
counteracted    or modified, and could see no prospect of protection by
their use. The other method proposed above to counteract or enable
the animal to resist the result of infection, was by the administration
of general tonics, or specific therapeutical agents.
   I found that quinine in comparatively large doses (0"3 grm.)
frequently repeated, had no appreciable tonic action, and in fact, was
inert upon rabbits. Strychnia does seem so to act to some extent, in
minute doses, which, however, must be continued for several days to
produce any beneficial effect ; its stimulating action upon the spinal
cord, and its specific effect in spinal paralysis, is well established, and
recommended it for the treatment of rabies in the rabbit, iu which the
stage of excitement is very slight and transient.
   I found that cocaine acts very markedly and quickly as a general
tonic in the rabbit; an animal to which the hydrochlorate is given
frequently, in quantities of from £ grain to 1 grain or more, within a
few days improves much in condition, with an increase of several per
cent, of body weight, and an apparently increased appetite; even
the smaller quantity, however, sometimes, but uncertainly, produced
temporary excitement and general hyperesthesia.
                              I
   After preliminary trials gave a rabbit, on the 4th day after infec
tion, 5 minims of a 10 per cent. aqueous solution of cocaine hydro-
chlorate, equal to about 0-04 grm. of the salt, and subsequently the
same quantity morning and evening ; between the 9th and the 10th
days symptoms of infection appeared, and the animal was found
dead on the 11th day, the length of the incubation period and the
time of death being precisely the same as in two control animals
inoculated at the same time.
   To another rabbit similarly inoculated,     I also gave ou the 4th day
about the same quantity (0-04 grm.) of this salt, repeating it sub
sequently twice daily till the 10th day, when in the control animals
similarly infected the first symptoms had appeared ; the cocaine was
then alternated with 0"2 mgrm. of strychnia bisulphate, but without
effect, and #the animal died at the same time as its companion.
Another case in which       I gave strychnia for a longer period was as
follows : a rabbit inoculated intracranially from the medulla of a
rabid dog, 9th November, 1887, received daily from the 7th day, ^ to
3 grammes chloral hydrate ; on the 9th day 0-l mgrm. quinine bisul
phate, and from the following day, twice daily, 0-05 to 0-075 mgrm.
strychnia bisulphate. The access of the first symptoms was not well
marked either in this animal or in two others similarly inoculated,

                                      On Rabies.                                  81
 but the former died on the morning of the 18th day, and both the
others oit the 21st, so that here again there was no benefit from the
action     of  the drng, bnt apparently the reverse.
     AUyl alcohol has been suggested        as a powerful germicide ;       I there
fore tried its action upon rabbits, but         I found it so rapidly and fatally
toxical, even in the most minute quantities, that no benefit could be
expected from its action.
     Urethan (carbamate of ethyl) has been recommended for its action
on the spinal cord ; I therefore tried it, giving it subsequently to
infection, but the result was equally negative.
     Rabbits are singularly tolerant of atropine, even 1 gramme of the
sulphate gfiven subcutaneously often having no apparent action upon
them.        It could not therefore be expected to modify the symptoms.
Moreover, Youatt* had tried the effect of belladonna extensively upon
dogs infected with rabies, and though at first he had hopes of its
 efficacy, these were disappointed, and he ultimately found it useless.
     I have also tried the action of arsenic upon rabbits. In the dog, given
 as arsenite of potash, it is a well-known and active tonic alterative.
 In man, too, and the horse it is used in some countries, with the result
 of increasing strength and endurance.            In the rabbit, however, I could
 perceive no beneficial result from its administration, though the
 animal is very tolerant of it, and it takes large quantities propor
 tionately to its weight without showing any symptoms of disturbance ;
 I have not consequently tried its effect upon the virus of rabies.
     In order to ascertain conclusivelyi whether the bichloride of mercury,
  chloral, benzoate of soda or iodine had any toxical or inhibitory action
  upon the virus itRelf, though not modifying the symptoms it produces,
  other rabbits were inoculated intracranially from the medullas of the
  animals that had been subjected to their influence ; in every instance
  they died infected, without any modification of the symptoms or the
 length of the incubation period, showing that these drugs had no
  action at all upon the virus.
      Thus germicides, the most active tonics that           I  could find for the
  animal experimented upon, together with drugs acting specifically
  upon the spinal cord, were one and all inert materially to inhibit or
  modify the result of infection ; but though none may be found that
  can do so in the rabbit, this, however, may not apply to other species
  very differently constituted, and it appears to me that of the many
  asserted cases of cure or recovery from this disease both in man and
  the dog, many of which rest apparently upon the best authority, some
  at least are authentic.

82                              Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
October, 1877), where a country girl, 21 years of age, bitten by a dog
 suspected of rabies 28th July, 1874, admitted into the hospital at
 Wickrath in Ehenish Prussia, on the 80th day developed symptoms
 of hydrophobia, spasms in attempting to drink, followed by the usual
 course of symptoms.             She was excited by light, with hyperesthesia of
 the senses of smell and touch. Morphia and chloroform were without
 effect    ; she was then treated       with frequent subcutaneous       injections of
 curari, to the point of commencing general paralysis of the voluntary
 muscles ; after being for two hours under the influence of the drug the
 symptoms of hydrophobia gradually disappeared                     and the patient
 ultimately recovered.
      It is not probable that in this case the symptoms were merely
  simulative or hysterical (lyssophobic) . The photophobia and hyper-
  aesthesia of the sense of smell and touch do not favour that view ; the
  patient, a peasant girl, was very unlikely to have heard of the
  occurrence of these symptoms, or to have been apprehensive of
  them.
      This is one     case out of several     in which it does not seem to me that
  there is reason to doubt the fact of recovery, though it may well be
  that a method of treatment successful in one case would fail in
  another,       or very possibly even aggravate the symptoms, owing to
  their great diversity.
      With regard to dogs, the records of cure or recovery are very
  numerous.          To take one instance;* rabies having broken out in a
  pack of honnds, Dr. James, relying on the action of mercury, treated
  two hounds which had both developed symptoms of infection, with
  turpeth mineral (the yellow subsulphate of mercury).                        The one
  recovered, the other died. It was also, he states, successfully em ployed
  in other cases, both in man and dogs.
       Here it was improbable that the symptoms and nature of the
   outbreak could have been mistaken ; misrepresentation, too, is pre
   cluded by the fact that in a pack of hounds all the circumstances
   affecting them would be perfectly well known.
       The statements of M. Pasteur, too, which in a matter of fact may
   be implicitly relied upon, appear to me conclusive upon this point.
   He states distinctly (' Comptes Rendus,' vol. 95, p. 1187) that he has
   seen some cases of "spontaneous" recovery in dogs, after the first
   symptoms have appeared, f though never after the severe symptoms,
   and (loe. oit., 25th February, 1884) that recovery is frequent in
   fowls.
        From this it appears to me that this disease is not necessarilv
    incurable in man and the dog, though the symptoms are so different
       • '  Phil. Tram.,' vol. 89 (No. 441, 1736), p. 244.
       t  He adds that he has also seen cases of partial recovery and subsequent  relapst
   after some months, followed by death.

                                        On Rabies.                                   83
 in   different cases that it may ¦well be that treatment which in one is
 successful would         fail in, or even aggravate another; and it seems to
 me very desirable that the effect of various therapeutical agents upon
 the dog should be investigated by those who have the opportunity
and inducement to do so, though with this animal it obviously requires
special methods,        appliances, and precautions.
    I cannot conclude this portion of the subject without expressing my
strong opinion that for us in our insular position, remedial measures
ought       to  be  entirely unnecessary ; to stamp out rabies and hydro
phobia throughout England nothing more is required than an order
by the Privy Council, rigorously enforced, for the muzzling of all
dogs throughout the country for a sufficient period.                   Of the efficacy
of this there can be no doubt.
    In the Metropolitan district we see its effects in the disappearance
from the streets of rabies, and of the cases of hydrophobia from the
hospitals, lately so prevalent and calamitous ; unfortunately, however,
this can only be temporary, as, under existing conditions, the disease
will, sooner or later, be again introduced from other parts where these
regulations have not been enforced.*
                                 X. Nature of the Virus.
    Though nothing can be said to be positively known of the intimate
nature of the virus of rabies, it has been considered by many observers!
that it must be a micro-organism.                   Its evident powers of multi
plication and reproduction, with the extreme length of its incubation
period, alone go far to prove this.             It is impossible to conceive that a
soluble or chemical poison, or ferment, should remain latent and
unaltered in the animal body for so long a period, then at once
becoming active should multiply itself throughout the tissues,
rendering         them infective to other animals in the most minute
quantities.
    In the supposed discoveries of a specific microbe in the saliva of
rabid animals, it has merely been one of the many saprophytes always
present therein, but which was not familiar to the observer ; and it is
probable,      from the uncertain result of inoculation with this secretion,
that     the virus is present        in it in very small quantities, and conse
quently, though particulate, would be exceedingly difficult of observa
tion with the microscope.
    •
       P.S. — Already eTen — 7/5/87 — since the above was written this apprehension is
realised ; the police reports for April, just issued, showing a recrudescence of
street   rabies in the district.
                        '

84                          Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell.
   In the asserted discoveries of a microbe in the tissues of the
cerebro-spinal system, since the publication of M. Pasteur's statement
that this is the seat of the virus, in some instances these have obviously
resulted from mistaking the morphological elements of these tissues
for micro-organisms. In the case of the statements of M. Fol," that
he has found a microbe in the ganglion cells, and within Schwann's
sheath of the nerve fibres, of the encephalon and spinal cord, though
these have received the qualified support of M. Pasteur, I have no
doubt that the appearances which he describes as microbes are dne
to alterations in the cells and nerve fibres, produced by the strange
modifications of the method of Weigert which he has adopted for
preservation and staining. The appearances of stained granules which
he describes, can always be produced by methods similar to those he
has employed.       I may add, that in very numerous experiments, by
inoculating   from   infective medulla the material in which he asserted
that he cultivated the microbe, viz., infusion of sheep's brain,           I have
never obtained the development of any form of vegetation whatever.
   I have myself, as previously stated ('Lancet,' 1886, vol. 1, p. 1112),
found a micrococcus in the cerebro-spinal tissues in some cases of
rabies.   It occurs chiefly in and around the central canal of the
medulla spinalis and oblongata, and in the perivascular and peri
cellular lymph channels, but it is exceedingly difficult to stain, and           I
have not discovered any reagent by which this can be done with
certainty, for I found in sections in which it was undoubtedly present
— from their being portions contiguous to others in which it was
demonstrated in vast numbers — that it was impossible to recogniie it
by any means whatever, with the best microscopical appliances, and
though mounted in media of widely different refractive indices.
   I  have not been able to cultivate it constantly, but I did obtain
some growths in agar-agar bouillon peptone, though never in any fluid
medium, and from the second series of cultivations of these, with a
minute portion of its scanty development,               I  inoculated one rabbit
subcutaneously.      The   animal   was  unaffected    for  three months. It was
then re-inoculated intracranial ly with a portion of medulla of intensi
fied virulence ; here also it remained unaffected for upwards of two
months, when, being again inoculated, it died on the second or third
day from accidental causes.
   This, which up to that time was the only case                I  had had of the
failure of infection after intracranial inoculation in upwards of sixty
cases, could not have been merely accidental, and was presumably due
to a protective or inhibitory action of the cultivation ; but, as          I have
not been able to demonstrate the presence of or cultivate the microbe
constantly, a final conclusion upon its functions must await further
observations.

                                XI.  Conclusions.
    By these experiments    it is shown : —
    (1.) That the vims of rabies in the lower animals, and of hydro
phobia in man, resides principally in the cerebro-spinal substance and
in the peripheral nerves, as well as in the salivary glands, in accord
ance with the fundamental statement of M. Pasteur.
    (2.) That inoculation of this substance upon the brain of an animal,
by trephining, produces infective rabies in rabbits almost infallibly,
and    with a much shorter and less variable incubation period than
after subcutaneous inoculation.
    (3.) That in an infected animal, the tissues do not become virulent
till towards the close of the incubation period.
    (4.) That rabies, however produced, in both dogs and rabbits, is
essentially a paralytic affection, the same disease in both animals, and
that there is no constant distinction between the so-termed dumb and
furious rabies in the dog.
     (5.) That the activity of the virus of street rabies generally is
 increased,    and becomes remarkably       constant, by passing through a
 series   of rabbits.
     (6.) That the activity of the virus is shown by the duration of the
 incubation period, to which it is inversely proportionate, and that this
 circumstance may afford a means of determining the source of infec
 tion   in case of death from rabies or hydrophobia.
     (7.) That of numerous drugs of different classes tried on the rabbit,
 none have any constant effect upon the result of infection.
     (8.) That by subcutaneous        inoculations with modified virus, as
 practised by 31. Pasteur, it is not practicable to confer immunity, even
 against subsequent      infection, upon rabbits ; and that with these
 animals the intensive or rapid method of inoculation is very liable
 itself to produce infection ; that the constitutional refractoriness
 of the dog to infection with rabies by any method of inoculation,
  renders it extremely difficult to judge of the results of remedial or
  prophylactic measures with this animal, from a limited number of
  experiments; and that it is by the statistics of the treatment that
  the results in man must be judged.
     Finally,   I must state that my experiments were not undertaken
  with primary reference to M. Pasteur's statements, but that the
  fundamental importance of these so greatly modified and subverted
  previous views upon this disease, that it necessitated my investigat
  ing them, with the result of confirming the conclusions of their author
  in many essential points ; and that it is to his notable discovery of the
   chief seat of the virus, with the constant and rapid effects, in the

we are indebted for the means of investigating with ease and certainty
the phenomena of this disease, which previously had been most

Medicine by Research.

    Mode of Subdivision bf4h^Oortical~- Surf -ace.— As before, we have
again arbitrarily divided the cortical surface into minute areas 2 mm.
sqaare, and thus 73 centres were formed and subjected to excitation.
Altogether 23 experiments have been made, the animals being in
variably anaesthetised with ether.
    Anatomy. — The region explored comprised the gyrus coursing in
front of the whole leugth of the precentral sulcus ; the posterior third
of the middle frontal convolution ; the posterior half of the superior
frontal convolution; the upper end of the ascending frontal convolu
tion, and the whole of the asceudiug parietal, except the lower half of
its anterior border.
                           Topography of Representation.
    The parts    of the body which are represented            in the region thus
defined   are as follows, viz. : —
    (a.) The   head and eyes.
    (b.) The lower limb,
    (c.) The upper limb.
    (a.) Head and Eyes. — The representation of            the important move
ment of turning the head and eyes to the opposite sido is situated
in a broad zone extending up along the whole length of the precentral
salens and over the posterior half of the middle and superior frontal
convolutions respectively as far as the margin of the hemisphere.
    (6.) Lower Limb. — The movements of the lower limb are repre
sented in the posterior fifth of the superior frontal, the upper third of
the ascending frontal,          and the upper third of the ascending parietal
convolutions.
                         —
   (c.) Upper Limb. In our former paper the account of the repre
sentation of the upper limb was necessarily incomplete, owing to its
fusion with that of neighbouring centres.              This we have now accom
plished,   and  the  area    for the movement     of the upper limb may conse
quently be defined as being centralised in the middle of the ascending
frontal convolution, from which point it reaches into the middle
frontal.     Upwards      it  extends   slightly into the superior frontal con
volution    and backwards over the lower two-thirds             of the ascending
parietal convolution       as  far as the  intra-parietal sulcus.
                                 General Conclusions.
    By  exploring the above-mentioned areas with minimal stimulation

   We owe to Wertheim* a series of carefully executed experiments on
the longitudinal elasticity of metals both by statical extension and by
longitudinal and transverse vibrations.                From these researches it
would appear that the values of the moduli of longitudinal elasticity
as determined for several metals by the first of these three methods
are, as might be expected, less than those obtained by the other two.
The differences, however, are very much greater than can be accounted
for by the heating and cooling effects of contraction and elongation,
and the author has already pointed out what he believes to have been
in a great measure the cause of these discrepancies. f As a few
observations made with two or three different metals had seemed to
him to show the possibility of obtaining more concordant results, he
was encouraged to extend his investigations to other metals, and
moreover to institute a comparison between the values of torsional
elasticity which could be obtained by statical and kinetical methods.
It had originally been the author's intention to use the same
specimens of the various metals as were employed in his previous
experiments on moduli of elasticity and electrical conductivity, bnt              J
on applying to Messrs. Johnson, Matthey and Co. to have these
specimens fused and redrawn, he was informed that what was desired
would be almost if not quite impossible, inasmuch as several of the
metals if fused in small quantities would be rendered too brittle for the

process  of wire drawing. Accordingly by request, Messrs. Johnson
and Matthey with their usual courtesy prepared specimens of platinum,
silver, copper, aluminium, lead, platinum-silver and German silver in
the same manner and of the same degree of purity as before.        The
wire-drawers had received special instructions to avoid kinks and to
secure uniformity   in the diameters of the wires throughout their
lengths.   Experiment I, which may be taken as representative of the
degree of uniformity obtained in the diameter of the various wires,
shows that in this last respect the instructions had been well carried
out; nor could any kinks be detected in the wires.   The results given
in   Experiment       I were  obtained by means of a gauge reading to xJ^th
of   a millimetre     ;   by estimation it was easy to measure to Tlnnith of
a    millimetre.

  The mean value of the gauge-readings is 0-10918, and                in no case
does a gauge-reading differ from this mean by more than               -J-   per cent.
After the  diameter had been determined for each of the wires in                   a
similar manner  by means of the gauge, they were made into coils of
more than oue foot diameter, and the diameter again determined from
the apparent loss of mass in water at 4° C. and from the length.
The values for the diameters obtained by the last method agreed very
closely with those got by means of the gauge.

                                      Extension.
   The mode of experimenting by statical extension has already been
described,* and the precautions which were used then were used now ;
but in these fresh trials the author availed himself of a device
                                    "
whereby the departure from Hooke's law," which had been formerly
observed more or less with all the wires, can be done away with.                     This
device the author owes to a perusal of the investigations of Professor
G. Wiedemann on statical torsion.f                  Wiedemann has proved that
though     on  first  applying    the   loads    used   for twisting the wire the
torsional strain increases in greater proportion than the stress, the
frequent repetition of these loads gradually diminishes this want of
proportionality.       He has further shown that the process may be much
facilitated by repeatedly putting the wire into torsional oscillations
whilst under the influence of the torsional stress.                     In a similar
manner the author now found that if the wire when under the
influence of a load causing longitudinal stress were set oscillating
longitudinally, by alternately pressing with the hand on the scale-pan
and removing the pressure, the range for which " Hooke's law
                                                                                  " held
good was sensibly increased,        J  so that he was able to use larger loads
than could otherwise have been used without passing beyond the
boundaries of perfect elasticity. The following experiment will serve
to show the degree of accuracy attainable.

   % It should be mentioned here that in all eases it is advisable  to allow a rest after
oscillating the wire in this way for the first time, and afterwards  to oscillate it again
just before testing.

 92                 Mr.  ll. Tomlin8on.         The Influence    of
    The mean value of         AS/AP for       the four series is P1969 and the
 probable error is 0"l0 per cent.         The values of AS/AP obtained with
 the temporary stresses of 2 kilos., 4 kilos., 6 kilos., and 8 kilos, are,
 within the limits of errors of observation,             equal, and moreover are
 independent of the permanent load on the wire.
    The results recorded above were not got without the exercise of
 very great precaution both in adjusting the scale and vernier, and in
 preventing either the wire under examination or the comparison-wire
 from twisting after the adjustment had been completed.                 Should such
 twisting take place the vernier will not move with sufficient freedom
up and down the scale.*           Indeed in this experiment there are here
and there slight traces of the vernier sticking in the scale, and in
most of the other experiments it was considered advisable to nnclamp
 both scale and vernier and completely readjust them, so that slightly
 different lengths of the wire might be under examination.              f  The next
 experiment furnishes an example of this mode of treatment.

    The mean of the numbers in the third column is 0-0006938, with a
 probable error of 0-09 per cent.            It is evident therefore that with
care considerable accuracy can be obtained. The elasticity of piano-
 steel within the limits of the loading here employed had been pre
 viously proved to be quite perfect, provided the precautions adopted
 in this and the other experiments were taken, so that it was considered
unnecessary to try the effect of lesser loads, but with all the other
metals at least two loads were used, and for these loads Hooke's law,
 " ut extensio sic vis," could
                                   by proper treatment of the wire be made
to hold good within the limits of errors of observation.
   * The author may mention here that he found it to be a groat convenience to
place four blocks of well-planed wood on the ground close to the four sides of the
scale-pan, and to anchor the bar fastened to the comparison- wire by fine wires
attached to the ends of the former and secured in a horizontal position. .
   t The different lengths were not measured until the series of temporary altera
tions of length produced by the various changes      of load was  completed, so as to
avoid prejudice on the part of the observer.

The   Longitudinal Elasticity    as determined by the Method     of Longitudinal
                                    Vibrations.
                              Preliminary    Trials.
    As it  was found necessary to use the syren more or less throughout
this part of the investigation, some experiments were made with a
view of ascertaining how far this instrument could be relied on for
determining the number of vibrations made in a given time. First,
attention was directed to the registering apparatus, with the object of
determining how far the putting of this in, or the taking of it out of
action, wonld introduce error.        Any error of the kind would be more
manifest when the      number of vibrations was determined for a short
space of time than for a long one, and in the following experiment it
will be seen that there is no appreciable error due to the inertia of the
register.
                                Experiment    IV.
   The number of vibrations recorded in one minute by the syren in
each of three trials, when the syren was kept in unison with a mono-
chord, were: —
                     Number of trial.      Number of vibrations.
                            1                    813 e 20
                            2                    812 e 20
                            3                    811e20
                                                 812 e 20
    The number of vibrations recorded        in five minutes was next ascer
tained   by one trial to be 4064 x 20, which would give 812-8 X 20 per
minute, or only 0-1 per cent. higher than before.            The pitch of the
 nionochord was then altered, and several fresh experiments similar to
 the above ended in showing that sometimes the number of vibratious
 per minute registered in the shorter-timed trials appeared to be
 greater, and sometimes less, than the number registered in the longer-
 timed trials, the difference being in all cases equally slight with the
 above.
    Again, the syren was employed to determine the pitch of several of
 Koenig's forks ; thus in a single trial, in each case of three minutes'
 duration, the instrument       registered 256- 7 and 513"8 vibrations per
 second   respectively  for two forks, which were marked with the num
  bers 256 and 512.    Several other trials of similar accuracy, sometimes
  giving slightly greater, and sometimes slightly less vibration-fre

94                 Mr. H. Tomlinson.            The Influence     of
quencies than those marked on the forks, rendered it evident that it
was possible to determine with great accuracy the vibration-number
of a tuning-fork by means of the syren, when the notes of these two
instruments are compared directly with one another.* The case, how
ever, was different when a monochord was tuned to the note of a fork,
and the former then compared with the syren.                  Thus the monochord
was tuned to unison with a Koenig's fork marked 384, and afterwards
the vibration-frequency of the former was determined by the syren.
Two trials resulted in giving the number of vibrations per second as
387 and 386. In a similar manner, using a fork marked 512, six trials
with the syren gave the vibration-frequency as follows : — 515*8, 51G*8,
514*3, 515"8, 516"8, 515*4, with a mean value of 515*8.                 The experi
ments with both forks therefore                gave   values    for  the  vibration-
frequencies which were about f per            cent, too high, and yet the mono-
chord after these trials was in each case still in perfect unison with
the fork with which it had been compared.                        As the assistant
(Mr. Furse)     seemed    to  think    that  the  error   arose  from drawing the
bow too strongly across the wire of the monochord, in the endeavour
to make the sound of this instrument of sufficient intensity to be heard
at the same time as that of the syren, a screen was placed so as partly
to shield the sound of the latter from the manipulator of the mono-
chord, and this plan proved to be successful, for now the syren
recorded the same vibration-frequency                for both monochord and
tuning-fork, and several experiments of the same kind with forks of
different pitch manifested that with the precaution mentioned above
the syren could be made to determine the pitch of the monochord as
accurately as the pitch of the tuning-fork.
   Matters having been so far satisfactorily arranged, a considerable
number of trials were made, for the purpose of deciding on the best
mode of arranging the wire which it was desired to throw into longi
tudinal vibrations. In the first instance the wire to be examined
was stretched horizontally, and clamped at one end to a block of iron
secured to a window-sill.           Towards its other extremity the wire
passed over a fixed pulley, so that by placing weights on a scale-pan
attached to this extremity any required degree of stress could be put
upon the wire.      Before going over the pulley the wire passed through
the jaws of a strong vice, so that when stretched sufficiently it could
be firmly clamped by means of the latter, and was protected from
injury by placing pieces of hard wood between it and the jaws of the
vice.   Both the vice and pulley were firmly clamped to a very stout
table.    When fixed for examination the wire was thrown into longi-

tudinal vibrations by rubbing it as lightly as possible with a resined
glove ; a monochord was tuned in unison with the wire, and the pitch
of the    former then determined by means of the syren.               In this way
copper, platinum,        silver, and  platinum-silver  were examined,    each with
two different lengths, one length being about half that of the other.
In all cases the shorter length gave a greater number of vibrations in
proportion to the inverse of the length than the longer one.                  The
average extent of the deviation is exhibited in Experiment V.

     Here in the case of the shorter length the product             I X n is about
 0*4  per  cent. higher than the same product for the longer length. As
 much greater      accuracy than this was to be aimed at for the purpose
 in view, several days were spent in endeavouring to ascertain what
 flaws there might be in this mode of experimenting.                   In the first
 place the permanent loads placed on the scale-pan                were gradually
 increased in amount, and as the wires were hard drawn, this could be
 done to a considerable        extent without causing any sensible permanent
 elongation.      Evidently, however, the source of error was not to be
 detected in this way, for though a slight change in the pitch of the
 note could be detected when the note was reduced                below a certain
 comparatively small amount, yet after this amount of stress had been
 exceeded, no further addition of load seemed to produce any appre
 ciable effect.     Secondly, the clamp and vice were shifted and more
  firmly secured, but still with no good result.
     After this it was decided to place the wire vertically, and as the
  room was very lofty a considerable         length could be tested in this new
 position.    The rest of the arrangement was the same as before,
 except that now the pulley was dispensed              with and the wire was
 damped at its upper extremity to a very massive iron plate, and
 hung freely down through the jaws of the vice before clamping with
 the latter.    The following table gives the mean values of the products

    The results shown in this table are far from being satisfactory, and
the numbers in the third column differ from those in the second
column by amounts which are in all cases considerably larger than tbe
differences in the values of I X n, as determined for different lengths
of the same metal, either in the vertical or the horizontal position.
                           Final Method of Experimenting.
    Though      the notes obtained by rubbing the wires longitudinally
were   fairly clear and well defined when the wire was arranged accord
ing to either of the above methods, yet the divergence of the results
given above was such as to induce the author to try a third method,
which, when certain corrections have been applied for want of rigidity
of the masses to which the ends of the wire are clamped, seems to be
capable of considerable accuracy.             In fig. 1, Plate 2, AB is a hollow
box,* made of wooden planks half an inch thick.                  The length of the
box is 600      cm.,   the  breadth  10  cm.,   and    the  depth 10 cm.       At one
end of tho box is a pulley C, round which the wire passes to tho
scale-pan S.        D and E are two pairs of stout blocks of wood, each of
which can be firmly clamped to any part of the box by a pair of very
stout wooden screws.f The stout blocks of wood carry each an iron
clamp, by which the wire can be secured, and the blocks of wood
together with the screws are all well insulated from the box by means
of thick layers of baize M, so that the vibrations of the wire cannot
be imparted to the box.J            The wire is first clamped to the wooden
   * There is no advantage in having a Aoilow box ; a solid piece of wood or metal
of sufficient stoutness would answer the purpose equally well.
   + Only one of each pair of screws is shown in the figure.
   J  This the author found to be a matter of some considerable importance, as the
note was very much clearer and purer when the blocks were insulated from the box
than when they were not. A rather curious case of synchronism occurred in one of
the earlier experiments where the blocks were not insulated from the box. An iron
 wire had been arranged to give, as far as could be judged by the note, 512 vibrations
 per second.     The note was, however, very far from elear; but by shortening or

block      at D, and is then passed over the pulley at C, so as to be
stretched to any required extent by placing weights on the scale-pan S.
When the required stress is attained the wire is clamped at E, and
the part to the right of E having been detached from the pulley and
scale-pan, is drawn on one side and rested on some non-conductor of
sound, such as baize or flannel.           In several cases, before the last- men
tioned adjustment had been completed, the blocks of wood at E were
shifted backwards or forwards, until the note given out by the longi
tudinally rubbed wire was in unison with a Koenig's tuning-fork, but
in others the pitch of the note was determined with the syren.                    If
the clamps at D and E had been secured to perfectly rigid supports,
the number of vibrations obtained when the wire was clipped in the
centre would have been exactly double the number when the wire was
free, except at both ends, but in consequence of lack of rigidity of
the supports at D and E, the note given out in the former case had
less than double the number of vibrations of the note in the latter.
Now Lord Rayleigh has proved for transverse vibrations* that when,
as in the present instance, the mass at each end is large compared with
the force of the spring which urges the extremity attached to tho
mass towards the position of equilibrium, any slight yielding of the
supports will cause a rise in pitch, and will produce the same effect
 as if the wire had been shortened in the ratio of 1 : 1—lc/n3, where h
is a constant, if we experiment with the same length of the same wire
under the same conditions as regards the nature of the supports, and
» is the tone of the wire.            Lord Rayleigh's mathematical reasoning
can be equally applied to longitudinal vibrations, and it is obvious
that by obtaining the number of vibrations of the wire when free,
except at both ends, and then when clipped in the centre, we may
determine the amount by which tho yielding of the supports heightens
the pitch of the note.          For the sake of greater accuracy the number
of vibrations yielded when the wire was clipped one-third of its whole
length from one end was in some cases also ascertained. The next
 experiments will sufficiently illustrate the mode of proceeding.
 lengthening    the wire slightly it was very much improved, though of course of a
 different  pitch.   The very marked want of clearness was presently found to arise
 from synchronism between the time taken by a pulse to pass from one block to the
 other through the wood and the time taken to pass from end to end of tho wire and
 back again.     When the blocks were insulated from the box the want of  clearness
 vanished and the pitch of the note rose 6 or 7 per cent.

velocity of sound           in centimetres per second as deduced from the

three series of trials the same, namely, 280,100.               Experiments VI and

departure of each individual value of the velocity of sound from the
mean value, but still the agreement seemed to be very good in the
case of the other metals.            Thus with annealed iron wire of the same

    It will  be seen  from Table       II   that the values of Young's modulus, as
determined by the statical and kinetical methods, agree with each other
within less than 1 per cent., and that on the whole the values obtained
by the former of the two methods are slightly greater than those
obtained by the latter method.*
   * The author is inclined to attribute this to the fact that with hard-drawn metals
loading always produces a slight amount of temporary twisting.                This (see Experi
ment   II) tends to produce a slight degree of sticking between the scale and vernier
used in the statical method.      With well annealed wires this temporary twisting
does not result from loading.

    It  is evident from the above that except for the lightest load, the
 velocity of sound is entirely independent of the temporary load, and
 even   with the load of        6 kilos, there is not a departure from the mean
 value obtained with the other three loads of more than 0'2 per cent.f
     Similarly with a pianoforte steel wire of 0'08 cm. diameter, not the
 slightest difference in the pitch of the note could be discerned with
 loads which varied from 16 kilos, up to SO kilos.
     The temporary alteration of density which was produced in either
 of these two experiments would be too small to cause of itself a
 perceptible alteration of pitch.                 Thus in the case of the piano-steel
 wire, the temporary change of density resulting from the increase of
 the load from 16 kilos, to 30 kilos, would only cause a change in the
  pitch of the note of 0'03 per cent.

                   Mr. H. Tomlinson.         The Influence    of
 statical method is decidedly less than when rest has been allowed after
 the permanent extension.       The effect of rest in increasing the elasticity
 appeared to be less the less the temporary load nsed in testing the
 elasticity, and it seemed of some interest to ascertain in the first place
 the effect of permanent extension on the velocity of sound, and in the
 second whether rest would appreciably alter the velocity.           The follow
 ing experiment was therefore tried.
                                Experiment     IX.
    A  well-annealed iron wire was stretched sufficiently by a temporary
 load to give a clear note when rubbed longitudinally.             The   pitch of
 the note was then taken on a monochord, and again after the             wire had
 suffered more and more permanent extension, the same temporary load
 being nsed throughout, and the wire being shortened to its original
 length after each permanent extension.

    It will be seen from the above that the pitch of the note remained,
as   far as conld be judged, absolutely unaltered by the permanent
extension.     After one hour's rest, however, it seemed to be appreci
ably sharper, the frequency as determined by the syren being 458-5
as   against 458-1, the frequency before stretching and before rest,
though after recent permanent extension.            It would thus appear that
rest after permanent     extension  does  very slightly increase the velocity
of sonnd in the case of iron.
   The permanent increase of velocity of sound can, however, be
almost, if not entirely, accounted for by the diminution of density.
The latter amounted altogether to 0-17 per cent., and this diminution
would cause an increase in the velocity of sound of O085 per cent.,
whereas the actual increase observed was only O087 per cent.                 We
must    therefore   conclude   that   the   elasticity   was  not   appreciably
affected permanently by the permanent extension, though rest did

apparently       very slightly increase the elasticity after recent permanent
extension.
           other experiments of alike nature were made with annealed
     Several
iron, but all seemed to show that the elasticity as-tested by the method
of longitudinal vibrations was not appreciably altered permanently by
permanent extension.
  Similar experiments to the above were made -with annealed copper

A Comparison         of Moduli of Torsional   Elhsticity as determined              by the
                         Statical and Kinetical Methods.

     Thewire to be tested, about 28 feet in length, was fastened at its
upper extremity to a clamp -secured1 to a stout iron bracket. The lower
extremity of "the wire was clamped at 0, fig. 2, Plate 2, the extremity
of a brass rod £inch fn< diameter, and 1| feet in length ; the rod passed
vertically through the centre of a horizontal brass plate P, 8 inches in
diameter, so that half of the rod was above and the other half below
the plate ;¦ the lower half of the rod terminated in a hook to which
¦was suspended a scale-pan,       S, weighing 2 kilos. The torsion was
effected by placing weights* in two scale-pans, T, made of cardboard,
and weighing ID grami each ; the scale-pans, T, were fastened each to
one extremity of a light silk thread, which passed over a pulley, W,
and was wrapped a few times round the rod; the two threads were
wrapped round- the rod in opposite directions, so that when equal
weights were placed in the scale-pans, T, a torsional couple was pro-
dnced.    The plate P was divided at its circumference into degrees,
and by using a- fine steel pointer (fig. 3), placed above the rim of the
plate, and nearly but not quite touching             it,
                                                   was possible to estimate
                                                           it
to one-tenth of      adegree.   The stands carrying the pullies, W, were
capable  of   being moved   either vertically or horizontally in any direc
tion, and great care was taken to ensure that the parts of the silk
threads between the rod and the pullies were parallel to each other.
In order to accomplish this last the adjustments were made in the first
instance as nearly correct as the eye could judge          torsion was now
                                                                   ;
imparted    in  the  manner    described,   and  after the   plate had been
twisted through about 360 degrees, the position of the end of the
pointer, as regards its distance from the rim of the circular plate, was
noted.    If this distance was not the same as before the application of
the torsion, one or both of the pulley stands were shifted in          hon      a        •
zontal plane until there was no perceptible difference in the distance
 *
      These weights were of   thin strips of German silver and wore      each   made very
accurately equal to 10 grams.

of the end of the pointer from the rim of the plate before and after
torsion.
   When the horizontal adjustment was satisfactorily completed, the
silk threads could be made perpendicular to the axis of the rod by
shifting the pulley stands up or down in a vertical plane, until any
given load in each pan produced a maximum twisting effect.            The
pullies, W,.were large and light, and so delicately balanced that the
loss from friction was very slight.   This loss from friction, small as it
was, could bo eliminated in the following manner : — Suppose that the
torsional stress has twisted the plate through a certain number of
degrees, the plate is now twisted very carefully by hand a little further,
and this stress then very gradually relaxed ; let Di be the present
position of the pointer. Again, let the original torsional stress be
carefully relaxed a little, and then very gradually restored, the pointer
will now take up a new position, D2. The true position of the pointer,
if there were no friction, would be Di + D2/2. At least ten trials were
made with each of the torsional stresses employed, and the mean of
the different readings, which accorded very well with each other, was
taken.
   In order to apply the torsional stress with sufficient gentleness, the
following plan was adopted: — Two smooth blocks of wood were placed
with a face of each in contact with two opposite sides of the scale-pan,
S, so that neither the pan nor the plate, P, would move when weights
were put in the smaller pans, T. As soon as the latter were loaded,
the blocks of wood were gradually and gently removed from the side",
so as to permit of the torsional stress producing its effect by slow
degrees.*
  Prof. G. Wiedemann has already shown in his experiments               on
torsion by the statical method, that the torsional elasticity is inde
pendent of the amount of longitudinal stress which may be acting
on the wire at the same time as the torsional stress.f and the author
has also proved that this is the case when the kinetical method is
adopted.];   However, it was considered advisable to make a few pre
liminary experiments, to ascertain whether temporary loading would
affect the torsional rigidity. It is unnecessary to enter into the results
of these preliminary trials further than to say that they fully verified
Prof. G. Wiedemann's previous observations for all the metals which
were examined.
   Before commencing               the actual testing the wire was frequently set
  •   This plan       was found to answer the purpose very well.Professor Q. Wiedemann,
has adopted a much more elaborate arrangement          for effecting the same object, but
the author cannot help thinking that with care such a device as that mentioned
above is quite sufficient to prevent the stress from being applied too suddenly.

    The value of the modulus of torsional elasticity in grams per square
centimetre can be found from the formula —
                                  - LxDxP        x 360
where   L is the   length of the wire in centimetres,       S the section in square
centimetres,    P the number of grams in      each pan, n the number of degrees
of torsion, r, the modulus of torsional elasticity determined by the
statical method, and D is the arm of the couple P X D in centimetres.
The valneof D was determined very carefully by a wire gauge reading
to-l-J^th of a millimetre, due allowance being made for the thickness of
the silk thread, and proved to be 0-96t58 cm.               The value of L varied
ia the different experiments from 650 to 800 cm., and within the
limits of errors of observations the strain, as in the above experiment,
was exactly proportional to the stress.           The diameter of each of the
wires was very nearly 1 mm., and in only one instance* was the value
of « carried beyond 200°. As far as could be ascertained the torsional
stress never exceeded the limit of elasticity, the recovery being in all
instances apparently perfect.f
    As soon as the determination of the modulus              of torsional elasticity
by the statical method had been satisfactorily concluded,                the modulus
 was redetermined by the method of torsional vibrations.                  The time of
 vibration was in the case of each wire taken from the mean of a large
 number of observations, first with only the graduated plate attached
 to the wire, and again when the moment of inertia of the plate had
 been supplemented with a hollow ring of copper, turned true inside
 and outside, and of which the moment of inertia could be calculated
 with considerable accuracy.           The error likely to arise in the determi
 nation of the modulus of torsional elasticity by the kinetical method
  would not in any case be greater than 0-l per cent. In the next table
 will be found the results obtained by both methods : —
    • That of platinum in which the ralue of n was 210.
    t This does not neceisarily imply perfect elasticity, as for this the reooTery of the
 wire on the removal of the stress should be instantaneous.       Whether this was so
 could not, of coursO, be ascertained.

   It will be seen that for the hard-drawn metals the values of r, onci
n agree with each other within the limits of errors of observation, and
that for these metals the mean value of r,/r,t is 1-0043.                    It is impos
sible in this case to make an exact comparison of the values of r, and
n, when for tbe former allowance is made for the effects of loss and
gain of heat, since the times of vibration in the kinetical method
were too long* to avoid gain and loss of heat in using the method,
but if the correction could be accurately applied, it would evidently
on the whole bring still greater accordance between the values of rt
and r,.
   For the annealed iron the value of r, exceeds that of rt by an
amount which is greater than can be attributed either to heating and
cooling effects or to errors of observation.

       the Nitrogen of Vegetation, with some new Results, and

       LL.D., F.R.S. Preliminary Notice.* Received and read
       June    16, 1887.
   For many years past the question of the sources of the nitrogen of
our crops has been the subject of much experimental enquiry both at
Rothamsted and elsewhere.            Until quite recently, the controversy
has chiefly been as to whether plants directly assimilate the free
nitrogen of the atmosphere; but, during the last few years, the
discussion has assumed a somewhat different aspect.                 The question
still is whether the free nitrogen of the air is an important source
of the nitrogen of vegetation ; but whilst few now adhere to the view
that chlorophyllous plants directly assimilate free nitrogen, it is
 nevertheless assumed to be brought under contribution in various
 ways, coming into combination within the soil, under the influence of
 electricity, or of micro-organisms, or of other low forms which thns
 indirectly serve as an important source of the nitrogen of plants
 of a higher order. Several of the more important of the investigations
 in the lines here indicated seem to have been instigated by the
 assumption that natural compensation must be found for the losses of
 combined nitrogen which the soil sustains by the removal of crops,
 and for those which result from the liberation of nitrogen from its
 combinations under various circumstances.
    We propose to summarise some of our own more recently published
 results bearing on various aspects of the subject, to put on record
 additional results, to give a preliminary notice of new lines of enquiry,
 and to discuss the evidence so adduced with reference to the results
   * This Preliminary Notice was originally intended to have served as the Abstract
of a fuller paper, and is so referred to in the account of the meeting of June 16
(vol. 42, p. 483).

              On the Sources    of the Nitrogen of Vegetation.        109
and conclusions      of others which have recently been put forwar.l,   as
above  alluded to.
   In our earlier papers we had concluded that, excepting the small
amount of combined nitrogen annually coming down in rain and the
minor aqueous       deposits   from the atmosphere, the source of the
nitrogen of our crops was, substantially, the stores within the soil
aud subsoil, whether derived from previous accumulations, or from
recent supplies    by manure.
   More recently we have shown that the amount of nitrogen, as nitric
acid in the soil, was much less after the growth of a crop than under
comparable     conditions without a crop. In the c»se of gramineous
crops  the    evidence   pointed to the conclusion that most, if not the
whole, of their nitrogen was taken up as nitric acid.       In the experi
ments with leguminous crops the evidence was in favour of the suppo
sition that, in some cases, the whole of the nitrogen had been taken
np as nitric acid, whilst in others that source            seemed to be
inadequate.
   It was    further shown that, under otherwise parallel conditions,
there   was    much more      nitrogen as nitrio acid in soils and sub-
soils down to a depth of 108 inches where leguminous than where
gramineous crops had for some time been grown.              The indication
was that nitrification      had been more active under the influence of
leguminous      than  of  gramineous growth and crop residue.      At the
same time, comparing the amounts of nitrogen as nitric acid in the
soil where the shallow rooting Trifolium repens had previously been
grown, with those where the deeper rooting Vicia sativa had yielded
fair crops, it was found that, at every depth of 9 inches down to a
total depth of 108 inches, the Vicia soil contained much less nitric
acid than the Trifolium repens soil ; and it was concluded that much
if not the whole, of the nitrogen of the Vicia crops had been taken up
as nitric acid.
   New results of the same kind, which related to experiments
with Trifolium repens as a shallow rooting and meagrely yielding
plant, to Melilotus leucantha as a deeper rooting and freer growing
one, and to Medieago sativa as a still deeper rooting and still freer
growing plant, very strikingly illustrated and confirmed the result of
the exhaustion of the nitric acid of the subsoil by the strong, deep-
rooting, and high nitrogen-yielding Leguminosae.          For example, at
each of the twelve depths of the Medieago soil there remained very
much     less nitrogen as nitric acid than where very much less
nitrogen had been removed in the Trifolium repens crops ; there being
on the average not one-twelfth          as much in the lower ten depths
of the Medieago soil as in the corresponding depths of the Tri
folium repens soil.      Still, the figures did not justify the conclusion
 that the whole of the large amount of nitrogen taken up by the

 110            Sir  J.  B. Lawes and Prof.     J.  H. Gilbert.
 Medicago crops, could have had its source in nitric acid. It is obvious
 that much nitrification takes place near the surface, but as the
 surface-soil became even somewhat richer in nitrogen, it was clear
 that the surface-soil has not been the primary source of the large
 amounts of nitrogen taken up by the plants.           That source must in
 fact be either the atmosphere, or the subsoil ; and if the subsoil, and
 yet not wholly as nitric acid, the question arises in what other form
 of combination ?
    In another experiment, one leguminous crop, beans, had been grown
 for many years in succession, and finally yielded very small crops,
 containing less than 30 lbs. of -nitrogen per acre. The land was then
 left fallow for several years; barley and clover were sown in 1883,
 and in that year, 1884, and 1€85, about 300 lbs. of nitrogen per acre
 were removed, chiefly in the clover crops.        This result was obtained
 where another leguminous crop had practically failed, where the
surface-soil had become very poor in total nitrogen, where there
existed a very small amount of ready-formed nitric acid to a con
siderable depth, and where the surface was unusually poor in nitro
genous crop residue for nitrification.         Further, not only had this
large amount     of  nitrogen   been  removed in the clover crops, but the
 surface-soil became determinably richer in nitrogen.           Here again,
 then, the primary source-of the nitrogen, of the crop could not hare
 been the sutface-soil itself. It must have been either the atmosphere,
 or the subsoil ; and assuming it to be the subsoil, the question arises
 whether it whs taken up as nitric acid, as ammonia, or as organic
 nitrogen ?
    The results adduced could leave no doubt that nitric acid was an
 import ant source of the nitrogen of the Leguminosae.      Indeed, existing
 experimental   evidence   relating to nitric acid carries us quantitatively
 further than any other line of explanation. But it is obviously quite
 inadequate to account for the facts of growth, either in the case of the
 Medicago sativa -experiments, or in that of the clover on the bean-
 exhausted land.
    Direct experiments were made to determine whether the nitrogen
of the Rothamsted raw clay subsoils, from which it is assumed
 much nitrogen has been derived in some way, was susceptible of
nitrification, provided the nitrifying organisms, and other necessary
conditions, were present.        It was found that the nitrogen of such
subsoils, containing only about 0-04 or 0-05 per cent. of nitrogen,
and not more than 6 or 8 parts of carbon to 1 part of nitrogen, was
susceptible of nitrification.     It was also found that nitrification was
more active in leguminous than in gramineous crop subsoils.              Ob
viously, however, the conditions of nitrification in which samples are
exposed in the laboratory, are very different from those of the subsoil
in si.'u.

               On   the Sources   of the  Nitrogen   of Vegetation.       Ill
   Although the evidence is c' ear that the nitrogen of raw clay sub
soils, which constitutes anr enormous           store of already combined
nitrogen, is susceptible of nitrification, provided the organisms are
present and the supply of oxygen is sufficient, the data at command
do not indicate that these conditions conld be adequately available in
such cases as those of the very large accumulations of nitrogen by
the Medicago sativa for a number of years in succession, or by the
red clover on the bean- exhausted land.
   The question arose — whether roots, by virtue of their acid sap, might
not, either directly take up, or at any rate attack and liberate for
further change, the otherwise insoluble organic nitrogen of the sub
soil.   Accordingly, in the autumn of 1885 specimens of the deep,
strong, fleshy root of the Medicago              sativa were collected     and
examined, when it was found that the sap was very strongly acid.
The degree of acidity was determined, and attempts were made so to
free the extract from nitrogenous bodies as to render it available for
determining whether or not it would attack and take up the nitrogen
of the raw clay subsoil.       Hitherto, however, these attempts have been
unsuccessful.
   Also in the autumn of 1885, when this difficulty first arose, it was
decided, in the mean time, to examine the action on soils and subsoils
of various     organic acids, in solutions of a degree of acidity either
approximately the same as that of the lucerne root-juice, or having a
known relation to it.        The acids used were the malic, citric, tavtario,
 oxalic, acetic, and formic.
   It was found that the weak organic acid solutions did <ake up some
nitrogen from the raw clay subsoil, and more from the poor lucerne
 surface-soil.    But when solutions of only approximately the acidity
 of the root-sap were agitated with an amount of soil which it was
 thought would be sufficient to yield 60 much nitrogen as to insure
 accurate determination, it was found that the acid frequently became
 neutralised by the bases of the soil, and that less nitrogen remained
 dissolved after a contact of twenty-four hours, or more, than after
 only one hour.       The strength of the acid liquids was therefore in-
 cieased,  and   the   relation of soil to acid diminished. More nitrogen
 wag then taken up, and more after the longer than the shorter period
 of contact.     Still, on adding fresh acid solution to the already once
 extracted soil, a limit to the amount of nitrogen rendered soluble was
 soon  reached.
   Hero again,     the conditions of experiment      in the laboratory are not
 comparable with those of the action of living roots on the soil, and
the results obtained do not justify any very definite conclusions as to
whether the     action of the roots on the soil by virtue of their acid sap
ia quantitatively an important source of the nitrogen of plants having
an extended development         of roots, of which the sap is strongly acid.

112             Sir  J. B. Lawes and Prof.     J.  H. Gilbert.
Provided this were clearly established to be the case, the question
would still remain, whether the complea nitrogenous body is merely
rendered soluble, and taken up as such, as is probably the case with
the fungi, or whether, after being attacked, it is subjected to further
change before entering the plant ?
    In the autumn of 1885, Dr. G. Loges published the results of
experiments in which he acted upon soils by pretty strong hydro
chloric acid, and determined         the amount of nitrogen taken up
(' Versuchs-Stationen,' vol. 32, p. 201). One of his soils contained 0-804,
and the other 0-367 per cent. of nitrogen ; whilst the surface soil of
the lucerne plot at Rothamsted contained only about 0-122, and the
subsoil, which is assumed to have yielded large quantities of nitrogen
to the crops, little more than 0-04 per cent. Again, in the one case,
Loges found 40 per cent., and in the other 22-6 per cent., of the
total nitrogen taken up.      It is obvious, therefore, that such an action
is not directly comparable with that of root-sap on a poor subsoil.
   Loges states that in experimenting with a great variety of soils he
has always found the hydrochloric acid extract gave the phospho-
tungstic precipitate, from which it is concluded that the 6ubstance
 taken up is an amide or peptone body.
    Still more recently, MM. Berthelot and Andre (' Compt. Rend.,' vol.
 103, 1886, p. 1101) have published the results of experiments to de
termine the character of the insoluble nitrogenous compounds in soils,
and of the changes they undergo when acted upon by hydrochloric acid
of various strengths, for shorter or longer periods, and at different
temperatures.       They found the nitrogen in the extract existed partly
as ammonia, but in much larger proportion as soluble amides, and
that the amounts obtained for both increased with the strength of acid,
the time of contact, and the temperature.        They also call attention to
the fact that when the clear filtered acid extract is exactly neutralised
by potash, one portion of the amide still remains soluble, whilst
another is precipitated, showing that the amides rendered soluble
constitute two groups.      Such re-precipitation is quite in accordance
with the results obtained in our own experiments, in which less
nitrogen remained dissolved after twenty-four hours, than after only
one hour's contact, when, with the longer period, the acidity of the
extract became neutralised.
    As in Loges' experiments, so in those of MM. Berthelot and Andre,
the strength of acid used was in all cases much greater than in that
of the Rothamsted experiments, and very much greater than is likely
to occur in any root-sap.       Further, the soil they operated upon was
about four times as rich in nitrogen as the Rothamsted subsoils, whilst,
with the strongest acid, and a temperature of 100° C, abont one-
 fourth of the total nitrogen of the soil was dissolved.
    Still, the results of Loges, and of Berthelot and Andre, are of much

              On  the Sources  of  the Nitrogen  of   Vegetation.         113
interest as confirming the supposition that the insoluble nitrogenous
compounds in soils are amide bodies, and as indicating the changes to
which they are subject when acted upon by acids.              Supposing the
acid root-sap so to act on the insoluble organic nitrogen of the soil,
and especially of the subsoil, as already said, the question still remains,
whether the amide rendered soluble is taken up as such, or undergoes
farther change before serving as food for the plant ?         It is seen that
ammonia is an essential result of the reaction      ;  and as, so far as our
experiments go, nitric acid seems to be a more prominent constituent
of the root-sap than ammonia, the question arises whether the liberated
ammonia is not oxidated into nitric acid before being taken up ?
Then, again, is the soluble amide subjected to further change — perhaps
first yielding ammonia, and this again nitric acid ?        On this supposi
tion we are again met with the difficulty as to the sufficient aeration
of the subsoil.
    Supposing any considerable amount of the amide rendered soluble
may be taken up by the plant as such, it is obviously of interest to
consider what is the evidence bearing on the question whether plants
can take tip such bodies and assimilate their nitrogen ?          The condi
tions of experiment and the results obtained by various experimenters,
have therefore been considered.         The substances which have been
experimented upon are     — urea, uric acid, hippuric acid, guanine, phos
phate of   ammonia,   glycocoll, creatine, and tyrosin. In some cases the
experiments have been made in soil, but in most by the water-culture
method.
    In the majority of cases there could be little doubt that the complex
nitrogenous body contributed nitrogen to the plant, either directly or
indirectly.    In the case of the experiments with soil as a matrix, there
was no direct evidence that the plant took up. the complex organic
body, as such; and the probability is that it suffered change before
becoming     available.   In some of the water-culture experiments,
especially  when   urea was  used, that substance was found within the
plant, and it was concluded that it contributed directly as a source of
nitrogen to it.    Hampe also concluded that glycocoll was as available
as nitric acid as nitrogenous food to plants.
    Upon the whole it seems probable, that green-leaved plants can take
np soluble complex nitrogenous organic bodies, when these are pre
sented to them under such conditions as in water-culture experiments,
and that they can transform them, and appropriate their nitrogen.
If this be the case, it would seem not improbable that they could take
up directly, and utilise, amide bodies rendered soluble within the soil
by the action of their acid root-sap.
   In connexion with the subject of the conditions under which the
insoluble organic nitrogen of soils and subsoils may become available
to chlorophyllous plants, some results of Frank may be briefly con

114              Sir  J. B. Lawes and Prof.   J. H. Gilbert.
sidered.     He observed that the feeding roots of certain trees were
covered with a f ungna, the threads of which forced themselves between
the epidermal cells into the root itRelf, which in such cases had no
hairs, but similar bodies were found external to the fungus-mantle,
which prolonged into threads among the particles of soil. In the case
of the Cupuliferae the occurrence seemed to be universal, and it was
to a great extent limited to them, though it has been observed on
willows, and on some conifers. The development was the greatest in
the first few inches or richer layers of soil.     Frank considered the
action to be one of true symbiosis, and concluded that the chlorophyl-
lous tree acquires its soil nutriment through the agency of the
fungus.
    Here, then, is a mode of accumulation by some green-leaved plants
which allies them very closely to fungi themselves ; indeed, it is by
an action on the soil which characterises non-chlorophyllous plants,
that the chlorophyllous plant acquires its soil supplies of nutriment.
But inasmuch as the action is the most marked in the surface layers
of soil rich in humus, and it is stated that the development has not
been observed on the roots of any herbaceous plants, the facts so far
recorded do not aid us in the explanation of the acquirement of
nitrogen by deep and strong rooted Leguminosae from raw clay sub
 soils.   Still, in view of the office within the soil which is by some
attributed to micro-organisms, and other low forms, the observations
are not without interest.
    Only very brief reference can be here made to the numerous experi
ments which have been conducted in recent years, the results of which
are held to afford evidence that free nitrogen contributes to the yield
in our crops —either through the agency of the plant itself, or of the
soil under the influence of micro-organisms, or of other non-chloro
phyllous forms.
    Some years ago, Berthelot called in question the validity of the con
clusions from the experiments of Boussinganlt, ourselves, and others,
in which it was sought to determine whether plants assimilated the
free nitrogen of the atmosphere, by growing them in enclosed vessels
which excluded the possibility of electrical action within the plant or
the soil. It is at any rate coincident with the pretty general acceptance
of this objection, which obviously puts out of court more exact
methods, and exposes the experimenter to many more possible sources
of error, that there has been a great accession of experimental evi
dence adduced, which is held to show the participation of the free
nitrogen of the atmosphere in the results of growth. Had the results
so obtained by various experimenters been at all accordant one with
another, the fact might have been considered proof that the objection
was     fully justified.   They are, however, in a quantitative point of
view,    so conflicting, without any adequate explanation in the methods

               On the Sources     of  the   Nitrogen   of Vegetation.         115
   described, that it is impossible to accept the whole as they stand, and
  for   the present it seems necessary to hold judgment on them in
  abeyance.
      The various results alluded to       will  be discussed  in some detail in
  our full paper, but we can only briefly refer here to some of the
  various modes of explanation which have been suggested.
      In the experiments of M. Berthelot, in all of which the gains of
  nitrogen are comparatively small, they havo in some cases been attri
  buted to electrical action, and in others to the action of micro-organ
  isms within the soil.
      Frank, experimenting with a soil very rich in nitrogen, found a loss
 of combined nitrogen ; but, in the case of vegetation experiments, with
 a less rich soil, he generally found a gain.           He concluded that two
 opposite actions are at work within the soil —one by which nitrogen
 is set free, and another by which it is brought into combination ; the
 latter being favoured by the presence of living plants. He admits
 that there is no decisive evidence how this takes place; but he seems
 to assume that it is under the influence of micro-organisms.
     Hellriegel, again, found that lupins did not grow well in an ex
 perimental soil, until he added to it the watery extract of a soil from
 a field where lupins were growing luxuriantly.              After this, his ex
 perimental plants      also  grew  well,   developed   the well-known nodules
 on their roots, and showed a gain of nitrogen.              This, he suggested,
 was probably    due  to  the  action of  the  nodules  within the soil, bringing
 the free nitrogen of the air into combination, and thus rendering it
 available to the growing lupins.          The results of Tschirch and those of
 Brunchorst have, however, been held to be conclusive against such a
view. According to their experiments, the nodules have no external
communication with the soil, but receive their nutriment from the
plant itself. On this point it is of interest to observe that, according
to the recent experiments of Mr. Marshall Ward, on the death of the
nodules the spores become distributed in the soil, and, if this be the
case, the possibility of some action, whatever that may be, is not yet
disproved.
     "Whatever may be the exact facts in the cases cited, it is at any rate
clear that recent lines of explanation of the mode in which some of
the higher plants derive their nitrogen involve the supposition of the
intervention of lower organisms in some way. It must, however, be
admitted on a review of the conflicting results at present at command,
that they do not justify any confident conclusion that the compensa
tions supposed do take place in any important degree, or that free
nitrogen is to any important extent brought into combination under
the influence of the lower organisms. In the meantime it seems not
inappropriate to devote attention to some other aspects of the subject.
     We would submit that a careful consideration of the history of

116          On the Sources   of  the Nitrogen  of  Vegetation.
agriculture, both ancient and modern, fails to afford evidence of com
pensation such as is now sought for.         Indeed we would say, as we
have done before, that — " The history of agriculture throughout the
world, so far as it is known, clearly shows that a fertile soil is one
which has accumulated within it the residue of ages of previous
vegetation, and thnt it becomes infertile as this residue is exhausted."
   In conclusion, we would call attention to the fact, that in the
Rothamsted soil and subsoil, down to the depth at which the aotion of
roots has been proved, there exists a store of about 20,000 1 bs. per
acre of already combined nitrogen.        It is true that many soils will
contain much less, but many much more.           There is then obviously
still a wide field for inquiry as to whether or not, or in what way, the
very large store of already existing combined nitrogen may become
available to growing vegetation.     We have indicated some of the lines
of investigation which we are ourselves following up; and we would
submit that, whether or not the lower organisms may be proved to
have the power of bringing free nitrogen into combination, it would
at any rate be not inconsistent with well-established facts, were it
found that the lower serve the higher by bringing into an available
condition the large stores of combined nitrogen already existing, but
in a comparatively inert state, in our soils and subsoils.

             Preliminary Note.          Received October 4, 1887.
    Some    years   ago   I  commenced     a   research on the spectra of carbon
in connexion       with certain lines      I   had detected in my early photo
graphs    of  the   solar  spectrum.     I have    been going on with this work
at intervals ever since, and certain conclusions              to which it leads,
 emphasising the vast difference between the chemical constitution of
 the sun and of some stars, recently suggested the desirability of
 obtaining observations of the spectra of meteorites and of the metallic
 elements at as low a temperature as possible.
    1 have latterly, therefore, been engaged on the last-named inquiries.
 The   work already done, read in conjunction with that on carbon,
 seems to afford evidence which amounts               to demonstration on several
 important points.
    I think, therefore, that      it may be of use to state some of the con
 clusions    at once, though the researches are still very far from com
 plete,   and though they must be given with great reserve, as the
 astronomical      observations     with which      I  have  had    to compare my
 laboratory work have         been frequently made under conditions of very
  great   difficulty.    The evidence before me suggests the following
  conclusions : —

       The main conclusions which may be stated here are that there are
   two systems of flutings which depend upon temperature only. At low
   temperatures all compounds of carbon give a set of simple flutings,
   the brightest of which are at wave-lengths 4510, 4830, 5185, and
    5610.    At higher temperatures there is a series of compound flutings,
    the brightest edges of which are at wave-lengths 4380, 4738, 5165,
   and 5640.      In the case of compounds of carbon with hydrogen, there
   is an additional fluting at wave-length 4310, and this is the only
    criterion for the presence of hydrocarbons among the flutings shown on
    the map (see Map 3).

              C. Experiments upon Mg at low Temperatures.
   I have   again gone over the experiments already communicated to
the Royal Society (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 30, p. 27), and in addition
have observed the Bpectrum of the metal burning in the centre of a
large bunsen burner, in which case we get the line at 5201, and the
fluting in the position of b without the fluting at 500.    In the bunsen
as ordinarily employed the fluting at 500 far eclipses the other parts
of the spectrum in brilliancy, and at this temperature, as already
observed by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 32,
p. 202), the ultra-violet line visible is that at 373.     Lecoq de Bois-
baudran has observed the lines in the chloride at 4705 and 4483
(' Spectres Lumineux,' p. 85).
     D. Experiments upon     the Glow  of Na and Mg in Vacuum Tubes.
   A  small piece of sodium, free from hydrocarbon, was placed in the
lower limb of an end-on spectrum tube, and arrangements made for
observing the spectrum of the gas evolved when the sodium was
heated.    Having first obtained as perfect a vacuum as possible, the
sodium was gently heated, and the spectrum of the gas then gave
nothing but the C and F lines of hydrogen. The pump being stopped
and the sodium heated, a point was reached when C and F became
very dim and were replaced by the structural spectrum of hydrogen.
   In another experiment the sodium was replaced by a piece of
magnesium along the end-on tube.           The same process being gone
through, similar phenomena were observed, but in the latter case
there was a line at 500, in addition to the lines seen in the case of
sodium.
    The important point, then, is the existence of a line at 500 in the
spectrum when magnesium is heated, and the absence of such a line
in the gas evolved by sodium under the conditions stated.
 E. Experiments upon     the Conditions  under which the C and   F Lines of
                  Hydrogen    disappear from the Spectrum.
    The   association of the bright lines of hydrogen with nebulae,
 many of the stars with bright lines, and the so-called new stars, points
 out at once that it is important to consider the various changes which
 hydrogen can undergo under various conditions of temperature and
 pressure.   I pointed out many years ago that, when under certain con
 ditions the spectrum of hydrogen is examined at the lowest possible
 temperature, the F line retains its brilliancy long after C disappears ;
 and the fact that, after the chief lines of hydrogen have been made
 to disappear from the spectral tube, the spectrum which remains
 visible, and is sometimes very brightly visible, is also due to hydrogen,
 has always been a matter of thorough belief in my mind, although so

many observers, down even to M. Cornu not so very long ago, have
been inclined to attribute it to the existence of " impurities."
     I  began to map the so-called structural spectrum at the College of
Chemistry in 1869, but other matters supervened which prevented
the accomplishment of this work.                    This, however, is a matter of
small importance, because quite recently Dr. Hasselberg has com
municated to the St. Petersburg Academy an admirable memoir on
the subject, accompanied            by a map (' Memoires de l'Academie Impe-
riale,' Series vii,      vol. 30, No. 7, Hasselberg).        The brightest portions
of the structure-spectrum are shown in Map 2.
     The most convenient way of obtaining a supply of hydrogen for
investigations of this kind is to use a little sodium which has never
been in contact with hydrocarbon, or a piece of magnesium wire ; to
place them in the low end of a glass tube, one part of which can be
used as an end-on tube, and then, after getting a vacuum so perfect
that the spark will not pass, to slightly heat the metal.                  After a time
the spectrum of hydrogen, sometimes accompanied by the low-tem
perature flutings of carbon, begins to be visible alike from the sodium
and the magnesium.
     If the vacnum has been very perfect to start with, at first the
bright lines C and F will be visible without any trace of structure,
and the hydrogen will be of a magnificent red colour.                       If now the
action of the pump be stopped, and the sodium be still more heated,
 a point will be reached at which the conductibility of the gas is at its
 maximum, and then, the jar not being in circuit, the structure-
 spectrum of the gas will be seen absolutely alone, without any trace
 of either C or F.          The gradual disappearance of the F line is very
 striking, and when the bright line is out of the field the lines due to
 the structure seem to be enhanced in brilliancy.
      The brightest part of the spectrum is then that near D ; in the blue-
 green we have a line at 464 more refrangible than F, and then a
 double line at 4930 and 4935 ; other less refrangible                        lines are
 seen. These are phenomena seen associated with sodium, but if we
  use the hydrogen produced from a piece of magnesium wire or from
  a crystal of olivine, under the same circumstances we find that so far
  as the lines of hydrogen go the phenomenon                 remains the same, but
  that there is then visible in the spectrum a line at 500, which has
  been recorded in the spectrum of magnesium under other conditions,
  not only by myself but by Dr. Copeland.*
      * " To this table moat be added 500 6 mmm. as the ware-length of the first line in
  the great  band of magnesium as determined by M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran from the
  (park spectrum of the chloride of that metal, which eyidently agrees with the flame
   spectrum, in this region at least.    It is worthy of note that this line almost abso
   lutely coincides with the brightest line in the spectra of planetary ncbulee."

   F. Experiments upon     the Spectra   of Meteorites at low Temperatures.

placed at my disposal.

and two flutings, one of manganese, and one of iron.

mium, zinc, bismuth, and nickel, and four lines of unknown origin.
     III.  When heated   in a Vacuum Tube when a Current is passing
                                       along it.
   A  small piece of iron meteorite was enclosed in the middle of a
horizontal tube, so that the spark might be made to pass through the
tube and over the meteorite.       After complete exhaustion has been ob
tained, the first spectrum obtained when the tube, end on, is placed in
front of the spectroscope, is a spectrum of hydrogen. The carbon
flutings are only visible occasionally. If the meteorite then be very
gently warmed by placing a bunsen burner at some distance below
the tube, the glow over the meteorite is seen to change its colour, and
the line at 500 is constantly, and another line at 495, apparently
exactly in the position of the second line of the spectrum of the
nebute, is occasionally, seen.       This line is less refrangible than the
structure line of hydrogen in this region, which occupies the same
position as the barium line.         This, however, if the heating is con
tinued, especially in the case of stony meteorites, is soon succeeded
by a much more brilliant green glow, in which magnesium                6 and
many other lines appear, now accompanied by the carbon flutings.
The observations made under all the above conditions are shown in
Maps 2 and 2a.
   In these observations if a line in the meteoric spectrum were
coincident with a metallic line, with the dispersion employed, in the
absence of the brightest line of that metal, the line was regarded as
originating from some other substance.           Thus a line was sometimes
seen at 5480, apparently coincident, with the dispersion employed,
with the green lines of Sr and Ni ; sometimes the brightest line of
Sr at 4607 was absent, and it was then, fair to assume that the
presence of 5480 was due to Ni, but in the presence of 4607 it might
be due to Sr.

Comparisons of the foregoing Observations among themselves,                      and with
           those made on various Orders of Celestial Bodies.
   The discussions have taken, in the first instance, the form of com
parisons of the different phenomena observed, and for this purpose
all recorded observations of flutings and bright lines and dark lines
in stars, comets, nebulae, &c., have been carefully mapped in addition,
all records having, when necessary, been brought to a common scale.
Having these maps,      I could then compare the totality of celestial
observations with the laboratory work to which reference has already
been made.
  The following are among the comparisons already dealt with                            :   —
  I. The spectra of   meteorites        observed under the various conditions,
         chiefly considering magnesium, iron, and manganese, with the
         bright lines observed at low temperatures.
   The main conclusions are : —
   (1.) That only the lowest temperature lines of Mg, Na, Fe, Cr, Mn,
Sr, Ca, Ba, K, Zn, Bi, and Ni are seen in the meteorites under the
various conditions.    They are not all seen in one meteorite or under
one particular condition ; the details of individual observations are
fully recorded in Maps 2 and 2a.
   (2.) That in the case of Mg the line most frequently seen is the
remnant of the fluting at 500, while in a photograph the main ultra
violet line recorded is the one at 373, previously recorded under these
conditions by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar. In the quantity spark
other lines are seen, notably 6^ 0%,    and 5201. The line at 500 was
                                             64,
considerably brightened when the number of cells was reduced, thus
showing    itto be due to some molecule which can exist best at     low                 a
temperature.
   (3.) That in the case of Mn the only line visible at the temperature
of the Bunsen burner, 5395,      the only line seen in the meteorites.

                             a.   Luminous Meteors.
  With regard     to the records of luminous meteors,                it   may be remarked
that the observations, so far as they have gone, have given decided
indications of magnesium, sodium, lithium, potassium, and of the
carbon flutings seen in comets.      The following quotations from

 128                          Mr.    J. N. Lockyer.                  [Nov. 17,
 Konkoly and Professor Herschel are among the authorities which
 may be cited for the above statement.
    " On August 12, 13, and 14 I observed a number of meteors
 with the spectroscope; amongst others, on the 12th, a yellow fireball
 with a fine train, which came directly from the Perseid radiant. In
 the head of this meteor the lines of lithium were clearly seen by the
 side of the sodium line. On August 13, at l0h. 46m. 10s., I observed
 in the north-east a magnificent fireball of emerald-green colour, as
 bright as Jupiter, with a very slow motion. The nucleus at the first
 moment only showed a very bright continuous spectrum with the
sodium line ; but a second after I perceived the magnesium line, and
 I  think  I am not mistaken in saying those of copper also.           Besides
that, the spectrum showed two very faint red lines."*
    " A few of the             '          '
                                  Leonid streaks were noticed in November
                      green
 (1866) to be, to all appearances, monochromatic, or quite nndispersed
 by vision through the refracting prisms ; from which we may at least
 very probably infer (by later discoveries with the meteor-spectroscope)
that the prominent green line of magnesium forms the principal con
stituent element of their greenish light."t
    Again, later on in the same letter, Professor Herschel mentions
Konkoly's observations of the bright b line of magnesium, in addition
to the yellow sodium line in a meteor on July 26, 1873.
    I again quote from Professor Herschel : —
   " On the morning of October 13 in the same year, Herr von Konkoly
again observed with Browning's meteor-spectroscope the long-enduring
streak of a large fireball, which was visible to the north-east of
O'Gyalla.     It exhibited the yellow sodium line and the green line of
magnesium very finely, besides other spectral lines in the red and
green.    Examining these latter lines closely with a star-spectroscope
attached to an equatorial telescope, Herr von Konkoly succeeded in
identifying them by direct comparison with the lines in an electric
Geissler-tube of marsh-gas. They were visible in the star-spectro
scope for eleven minutes, after which the sodium and magnesium
lines still continued to be very brightly observable through the meteor-
spectroscope."   J
    The green line " b " of magnesium occurring as a bright line in
luminous meteors indicates that their temperature when passing
through our atmosphere is higher than that of the bnnsen, and we
may add of comets as generally observed, although some exhibit the
b lines of magnesium and those of iron when at perihelion, as shown
later on.
   The two lines which Konkoly supposes are probably due to copper

        expect, be found to be iron lines when other observations are
  made of the spectra of meteors.
    The main conclusions from this comparison are then: (1) that the
 temperature of luminous meteors is higher than that of the Bunsen
 flame ; (2) that the meteorites which produce the phenomena we are
 now discussing are hotter than those in the experimental glow taken
 generally      ;   and (3) that in both cases flutings of carbon may                 be seen.

     When a meteor-Rwarm approaches the sun, the whole region of
  space occupied by the meteorites,    estimated by Professor Newton in
  the case of Biela's comet to have been thirty miles apart, gives us the
  same spectrum, and further        given by at all events part of the tail,

 that most of the lines which have been observed at perihelion are
 coincident with lines seen in experiments with meteorites, while the
 low temperature lines of Mg are absent.      In the great comet of 1882,
 to which particular attention has been given on account of the com
 plete record of its spectrum by Copeland,* the lines recorded were
  the D lines of sodium, the low temperature iron lines at 5268, 5327,
 5371, 5790, and 6024, the line seen in the manganese spectrum at
 the temperature of the bunsen burner at 5395, and            line near          a                  b

 not likely to be the green line of strontium.       There were also four
other lines less refrangible than D, the origin of which has not yet
 been determined. As the comet got further from perihelion the lines
gradually died out, those which remained longest being the iron line
at 5268 and the line near        The absence of D before the disappear

   It  is fair to myself to say that       I  was   not aware of these observa
                I
tions when began to write this paper.                The fact of the line at 50O
remaining alone in Nova Cygni made it               clear that if my views were
correct, the same thing should happen                with comets.      It now turns
out that the crucial observation which            I intended to make was made
twenty years ago.
   In   Comets b, 1881, and c, 1882, the only lines recorded were mag
nesium     b ; but, as before, the apparent absence of other lines might
be due to continuous spectrum.
   Of the five bands shown in Huggins's photograph of the spectrum
of Comet Wells, taken with a wide slit, no less than three agree fairly
in position with three lines seen in the spectra of meteorites. The
wave-lengths of these are 4253, 4412, and 4769, and it is interesting
to note that, so far, the origin of these lines is undetermined.                 The
two remaining bands are at wave-lengths 4507 and 4634.
   It is seen, then, that the spectra of comets — when their internal
motions are relatively either slow or fast, and when therefore the
number of collisions, and with it the heat of the stones in collision,
will vary extremely — resemble the spectra of meteorites seen in glow
tubes.
     " Stars " with Flutings which have been observed in              the Laboratory
7.
                     and in Luminous Meteors and Comets.
    The most prominent bright flutings of carbon are not only
observed      in luminous meteors and comets, but in stars of Class Ilia,
and in some
                   " Novas,"
                                notably Nova Orionis.           So far, then, these
bodies may in a certain measure be classed with luminous meteors
and comets.        But there is an important difference in the phenomena,
for we have absorption as well as radiation. The discussion shows
that the dark (or absorbing) flutings in these bodies are partly due
to the absorption of light by the most prominent flutings of Mn and
Zn, seen at low temperatures. This inquiry is being continued.
    We have, then, in these bodies a spectrum integrating the radiation,
of carbon and the absorption of Mn and Zn vapour.
    The law of parsimony compels us to ascribe the bright fluting of
carbon in these stars to the same cause as that at work in comets,
where we know it is produced by the vapours between the individual
meteorites or repelled from them.
    Hence we are led to conclude that the absorption phenomena are
1867.    The spectra of these objects, as far as their feeble light permitted them to
be observed, appeared to be very similar.     In  the case of each of these comets the
 spectrum of the minute nucleus appeared to consist of a bright line between b and
 F, about the position of the double line of the spectrum of nitrogen, while the nebu
 losity surrounding the nucleus and forming the coma gave a spectrum which was
 apparently continuous" (Huggins, 'Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 16, p. 887).

  produced by the incandescent vapour surrounding the individual
  meteorites which have been rendered intensely hot by collisions.
    These stars, therefore, are not masses    of vapour like our sun, but
 clouds  of incandescent stones.
    We have here probably the first stage of meteoritic condensation.
               The  Cases of Nova Orionis and B. Geminorum.
    The stars with bright carbon flutings, the same as those seen in
 comets, are not limited to first-magnitude stars, such as « Orionis,
 but include at least one new star, Nova Orionis.     Because the latter
 star lasted but a short time we might expect the phenomena pre
 sented to be different from those found in the first-magnitude star,
 which is a variable, like others with similar composite spectra.
 Practically there is a little difference, for in a. Orionis, a. Herculis,
and others of that type, we find well-marked dark absorption flutings
of manganese, as well as lino-absorption of sodium and magnesium.
The manganese absorptions agree with some of the Mn flutings seen
in the Bessemer flame by Marshall Watts (' Phil. Mag.,' February,
1873).     The absorptions are not so well developed in the Nova, for
the reason, perhaps, that condensation due to gravity had not taken
place to such a great extent, so that the heat of the stones them
selves was not so great, and further because the local absorption
around each meteorite would be cloaked by the bright radiation of
the interspaces, which gives, as in comets, the maximum intensity to
the bright fluting, wave-length 517. In R. Geminorum the demon
stration of the same meteoric constitution, but without the strong
absorption, is given by the fact that in that star so much of the light
proceeds from the vapour produced by the meteorites, and from the
carbon in the interspaces, that the carbon flutings and the bright
lines of barium and strontium, and other substances present in
meteorites, are visible at the same time, exactly as they are seen in
the glow over a meteorite in an experimental tube, in which, as the
pressure is reduced, the edges alone of the carbon flutings are visible,
and pnt on the appearance of bright lines, almost exactly resembling
the bright lines of the heated meteorites.
    The spectra of these two stars   I give on a map (Map 3) side by side
with the bright flutings of carbon and the bright flutings of man
ganese with a view of showing that, both in the temporary Nova
and the first magnitude star in the same constellation, many of the
phenomena are the same and are therefore probably produced by the
same cause.      Some time after Dr. Copeland's original observations of
this star    were  published, it was pointed out by Duner, Vogel, and
others, that some of the bright parts of the spectrum observed by him
were really coincident with the bright parts of the spectrum of
a Orionis ; this, of course, is beyond question.     But in addition to

 these  bright spaces Dr. Copeland gives some bright regions which, I
 think, have not been touched by the arguments of Vogel and Duner
above referred to.       It will be observed that in the case of R. Gemi-
nornm, given on the same map as Nova and a Orionis, the bright lines
correspond almost exactly with the bright spaces shown in the above-
named stars and certain lines seen in meteorites — that is to say, a
meteorite glow, when the carbon spectrum is bright, gives us all the
lines recorded in the spectrum of the star, showing that some of the
lines correspond with the brightest flutings of carbon.
   There can be no question,         I think, that in R Geminorum we have
another stage, doubtless a prior stage, of the life-history not only of
the Nova, but of « Orionis itself.

   Only seven lines in all have been recorded up to the present in the
spectra of nebuli, three of which coincide with lines in the spectrum
of hydrogen and three correspond to lines in magnesium.                       The
magnesium lines represented          are  the ultra-violet low-temperature line
at 373, the line at 470, and the remnant of the magnesium fluting at
500, the brightest part of the spectrum at the temperature of the
bnnsen burner.        The hydrogen lines are h, F, and H7 (434). Some
times the 500 line is seen alone, but it is generally associated with F
and a line at 495.         The remaining lines do not all appear in one
nebula, but are associated one by one with the other three lines.             The
lines at    500  and    495  and   F    have  been    seen in the   glow   of  the
Dhunnsala meteorite when heated, but the origin of 495 has not yet
been determined.
   The result of this comparison then is that the nebula spectrum is
as closely associated with a meteorite glowing very gently in a very
tenuous atmosphere given off by itself as is the spectrum of a comet
near the sun with a meteorite glowing in a denser one also given off
by itself when more highly heated.
   Further, it has been seen that the nebula spectrum was exactly
reproduced in the comets of 1866 and 1867, when away from the sun.
As the collision of meteorites is accepted for the explanation of the
phenomena in one case, it must, faute de mieux, be accepted for the
other.     The well-known constituents of meteorites, especially olivine,

  On reference to the map which           I exhibit to the Society, though
they and the discussion      of  them  are  yet incomplete, it will be seen
that the principal lines which are seen bright in star spectra are, if
we make due allowance for the discrepancies likely to occur in obser

observed in the vapours and gases given off by meteorites in vacuum-
tubes, or which we might expect to see in a combined series of

Discussion      of   the       Maps showing      the   bright Lines visible in Stars and
                                               Nebuhe.
  It   results from the discussion of the bright lines seen, whether
associated with the bright lines C and F of hydrogen or not, that,
while on the one hand we have a class of bodies — the nebulae — which
give us the lines visible at the lowest temperature of chemical
elements known to exist in meteorites, we have in the other class — the
"stars" with bright lines — those lines visible at somewhat higher
temperatures in meteorites.      In the stars with bright lines the two
most important lines, which have been separately mapped by Vogel,*
occur at 540 and 582. The mean readings of all the observations
give the positions of these lines as 540 and 580. In an experiment
on the glow of a meteorite rich in manganese, the line of Mn at 5395,
easily seen at the temperature of the bunsen, is distinctly seen
in addition to the structure-spectrum of hydrogen.             There is
reasonable ground therefore for supposing that the line, this only one
of the iron-group of metals visible at the temperature of the bunsen,
may be the origin of one of the two lines seen alone in the spectrum
of these "stars." It will be seen that in the map it has been easy to
arrange all the bright lines hitherto seen in stars into one order, in
which we begin with this line of manganese, and a line of iron seen at
the temperature of the oxy-coal-gas flame, the wave-length of which
is 579. As other lines indicating other substances are added to these
fundamental ones, we pass from those stars in which C and F are not
visible to those in which they make their appearance. Here, however,
it is necessary to move with caution, because it may be that we are
in presence of some of the lines visible in the structure-spectrum of
hydrogen. The chief lines of hydrogen, as seen in the end-on tube
when the conditions are such that C and F are not visible, have
been already stated.    Some of the lines observed in these stars, even
 the one at 540, have been found to be very nearly coincident with
bright lines seen in the structure-spectrum, as well as with lines seen
 in the spectra of meteorites.
    The suggestion, therefore, that some of the lines seen in bright-line
 stars are lines of cool hydrogen must be noted, although there are
grounds for rejecting        as will shortly appear.

    that  strong lines of the H structure at 607 — 610 and 574 have not
    been recorded in star spectra with those at 540 and 580.
       In the nebulae we deal chiefly with lines seen in the spectrum of
   magnesium at the lowest temperature ; and these, as far as observa
   tions go, have not yet been associated with the lines at 540 and 580
   to which reference has j ust been made, although they may or may not
   be associated with the bright lines C and F of hydrogen.           In the
   nebulae, however, no lines coincident with the lines of cool hydrogen
   have been observed.       It will be seen, therefore, that we have here
   again strong grounds for rejecting the view that the lines seen in
   " stars " at
                  540 and 580 are due to cool H, for since hydrogen is
   common to both nebulae and stars, there is no reason why structure-
   lines should occur in "stars
                                  "
                                     any more than in nebulae.
      Another ground for rejecting cool hydrogen as the origin of any of
  the lines in "stars" is that the structure-spectrum of hydrogen is
  only seen in confined glows, which is just the condition which cannot
  occur    in space.
      At  the same time, the apparent coincidences    of so many meteorite
  lines with structure-lines of hydrogen greatly increases the difficulties
 of laboratory work ; in fact, the structure spectrum of hydrogen is to
 observations of meteorite glows in the laboratory what continuous
 spectrum is to observations of bright lines in stars.
      If it be agreed that we are not dealing with cool hydrogen, then it
 will follow that the only difference between celestial bodies with
 bright lines in their spectra comes from no difference of origin or
 chemical constitution, but from a difference of temperature.
      At one point in these researches I was under the impression that
 the differences in the systems of bright lines seen in the nebulae and
 the bright-line stars might arise from a preponderance          of irons or
 stones in the swarms.            I
                              But was led to abandon this idea, not only
 by the observation of the meteoritic glows, but by the consideration
that even telescopically the "stars" in question are more condensed
than the nebulae.
      The spectrum of the nebulae, except in some cases, is associated with
a certain amount of continuous spectrum, and meteorites glowing at a
low temperature would be competent to give the continuous spectrum
with its highest intensity in the yellow part of the spectrum ; so that
in this way we should understand that lines due to any gas or vapour
in that part would be very much more likely to escape record than
those in the part of the spectrum which the continuous spectrum
hardly reaches.        The general absence, however, of bright lines of
metallic vapours, except 495 and 500, and of the bright lines of
hydrogen, evidently justifies the conclusion that vfe are here in
presence of those bodies in celestial space, connected with which the
temperature and the electrical excitation are at the minimum, and it
                                                                 l  2

   138                        Mr.   J.  N. Lockyer.                      [Nov. 17,
  is very remarkable how the lines seen in a Geissler tube under the
   conditions stated, when either magnesium, or olivine, or other
   meteoric constituents are made to glow, should appear, one may
   almost say, indiscriminately among the orders of bodies in the heavens
  which up to the present time have been regarded as so utterly different
   in plan and structure as stars and nebulae.
      The records of purely continuous spectra in the case of many nebulae,
   as for example the Great Nebula in Andromeda, is in all probability
  an indication of our inability to observe them properly.             For a nebula
  to give a perfectly continuous spectrum, it is evident that the compo
  nent meteorites must be incandescent, but still at a lower temperature
  than that required to give bright lines.          Now the Mg line 500 is seen
  in some of the faintest nebulae where there is little or no continuous
  spectrum, and it therefore seems likely that these are at a lower
  temperature than the nebulae said to give perfectly continuous spectra.
  This being so, it is difficult to believe that other lines, which require
  a somewhat higher temperature for their existence than the line at
  500, do not become visible at this increased temperature.
     There can be little doubt that when our instrumental appliancei
 and observing conditions become more perfeet, it will be found that
 the so-called continuous spectra are really discontinuous.               There is,
 indeed, an element of doubt as regards some of the existing observa
 tions ; thus, the spectrum of the companion to the Great Nebula in
 Andromeda appears to end abruptly in the orange, and throughout
 its length is not uniform, but is evidently crossed by lines of absorp
 tion, or by bright lines.*
     Again, the Great Nebula in Andromeda is generally regarded as
 having a continuous spectrum pure and simple, but an observer at
  Yale College (name not stated), has observed three bright lines in its
 spectrum (' Observatory,' vol. 8, p. 385). The lines are the F line of
 hydrogen, and two other lines at wave-lengths 5312 5 and 5594-0.
  The latter two lines are mentioned by the same observer as bright
  lines in 7 Cassiopeiae and /? Lyrae, and are recorded by Sherman
  (' Astr. Nachr.' No. 2691) as bright lines in these stars and in Nova
  Andromedae.     No other observations with which                 I am acquainted
 give these two lines in 7 Cassiopeiae and /3 Lyrae, but Maunder
  (' Monthly Notices,' vol. 46, p. 20) gives them as two of the lines seen
 in Nova Andromedae. It is possible, therefore, that the two lines iB
 question, in the Tale College observations, had their origin in Nova
 Andromedae ; at all events there is no evidence to show that they are
visible in the Great Nebula of Andromeda under normal conditions.
     It is not impossible that the lines at 540 and 580 may be eventually
traced in some\)f the brightest nebulae, since these are apparently the
lines next in order, as regards temperature, to the Mg line 500.

     It  is  right that I should here point out that some observers of
  bright lines in these so-called stars have recorded a line in the yellow
  which they affirm to be in the position of D3 ; while on the other
 hand, in my experiments on meteorites, whether in the glow or in
  the air,  I  have seen no line occupying this position.
     I trust   that some observer with greater optical means             will think
 it worth his time to make a special inquiry on this point. The argu
  ments against this line indicating             the spectrum of the so-called
 helium are absolutely overwhelming.                 The helium line so far, has
 only   been     seen   in   the  very hottest  part  of the sun which we can get
 at. It is there associated with b, and with lines of iron which require
 the largest coil and the largest jar to bring them out, whereas it is
 stated to have been observed in stars, where the absence of iron lines
 and of 6 shows that the temperature is very low.               Further no trace of
 it was seen in Nova Cygni, and it has even been recorded in a
 spectrum in which C was absent, and once as the edge of a Anting.*
    It is even possible that the line in question merely occupies the
 position of D3 by reason of the displacement of D by motion of the
 "stars " in the line of sight. On this point no information is at hand
regarding any reference spectrum employed.                   If, however, it should
 eventually be established that the line is really D3, which probably
represents a fine form of hydrogen, it can only be suggested that the
degree of fineness which is brought about by temperature in the case
of the sun, is brought about in the spaces between meteorites by
 extreme tenuity.
                                 The Case of Nova Cygni.
    The case of Nova Cygni is being discussed, and it appears likely
that     this " star " passed through all the stages of temperature
                        " stars " with bright lines, comets, and nebula?. In
represented by
the initial stage, the principal lines recorded were those of hydrogen,
cool magnesium, and sodium.               At a later date, in addition to these,
lines apparently indicating             hotter   magnesium and carbon were
observed.          On the date of its highest temperature (December 8,
1876) the       lines  observed by Vogel indicate H, Na, Mg, C, Fe, Mn, and
            "        "
Ba, the star having then, it would appear from the discussion so
far as it has yet gone, approached the condition of the great comet of
1882 at perihelion.             The Fe, Ba, C, and Na gradually disappeared,
then the hydrogen followed, and the last stage of all was that in
which Mg (500) appeared alone, as in the comets of 1866-67 and in
nebulae.        The complete discussion, however, must be reserved for a
future communication. It is sufficient to say here that it is very

 probable that all the spectroscopic phenomena of Nova Cygni will
 admit of explanation on the supposition that it was produced by the
 collision of two swarms of meteorites.              The outliers were firit
 engaged,   and  at the  maximum      the denser  parts of the swarm.
                   Difficulties connected  with the Discussion.
    An inspection of the maps, on which are shown all the observations
 already made upon bright lines recorded in the spectra of celestial
bodies,   will indicate at first sight  an apparent variation of the positions
of the lines greater than might have been expected.             This, however,
I  think will vanish on the consideration of the whole question ; and
for my part certainly all the examinations which I have been able to
make have led me to the conclusion that the various observations have
been far better than it was almost possible to hope for when the great
difficulties of the observations themselves are considered.
    When it is remembered that, in order to get a determination of the
position of a bright line, comparison-spectra and prisms are needed,
and that, from mechanical considerations alone, the application of
these aids to research is very frequently attended with difficulties and
uncertainties ; and further, when we consider that many of the
observations have been necessarily made without these aids ; the
striking coincidences on the maps become of very much greater
importance than the slight variations seen between the positions of
the same line recorded by different observers in the same star.
    It will be observed, too, that the information in some cases is fuller
in the blue part of the spectrum. Here again a reference to what the
maps are really intended to show is necessary.               The maps do not
show the complete spectrum observed, but only the bright lines
recorded in it. The actual observations have really consisted in
picking out these bright lines from the background of continuous
spectrum, whether in stars, nebulae, or comets ; and, as the continuous
spectrum will be generally brightest in the yellow and green, so in
this part of the spectrum we must expect, first of all, to get the least
information, and then, when the information is obtained, to get the
greatest uncertainty, on account of the difficulty brought about
by the greater luminosity of the background on which the line
appears.
    The discussion by Hasselberg and others of the various observa
tions of comets which have been made from time to time indicates that
under certain circumstances, where men of the highest skill and with
the greatest care have determined the wave-lengths of the carbon
bands, discrepancies exist too great to admit of their being attributed
to errors inherent in this branch of observation.
   If for a moment we consider alone the two bright flu tings visible in
the spectrum of carbon, one with its bright edge just more refrangi

the low-temperature spectrum — with a fluting just less refrangible

carbon vapour to the other, so that on this account apparent discre
pancies in the measurements      of the same comet at different times
may present real facts.   Then again we have the motion of the swarm
along its orbit, which in some cases we know          comparable to the                  is
velocity of light, so that variations of wave-length are produced as
indicated in comet 1882.       We also have the possibility that the
velocity of the vapours in the jets, and that due to the electric repul
sion — which, according to Zollner's view,         the origin of comets'            is
tails — may also produce changes of refrangibility.
   Although as a rule the bright fluting seen in comets appears to be
that due to high temperature, this       apparently not always the case.

         On the Absorption Phenomena of Stars with bright Lines.
    In addition to tbe map showing the bright lines visible in those
stars the    spectra of which contain them,               I  have prepared another
map showing           the  absorptions which         also   occur.     The two maps
present a remarkable agreement             —  that is to say, there is the same
progression in the absorption phenomena as there is in the bright line
phenomena.          In those stars in which bright lines are seen without
the lines of hydrogen (in- which stars the meteorite swarm is probably
at a slightly higher temperature than that observed in the nebula
when only the line at 500 is visible) we have no marked absorption-
lines, but rather bands.          When the hydrogen lines are added, as in
7 Cassiopeiae, then wo get the absorption of sodium and b of mag
nesium, as we should expect.              The individual meteorites therefore
are much cooler in these stars than in the Novas, seeing that the
absorption is so little developed.            Speaking generally, therefore, we
may say that there are two causes of minimum absorption phenomena
in stars. In the first place, as in the bright-line stars, only a little
vapour surrounds each meteorite, and that vapour consists of the
substances      visible at the lowest temperature ; while, on the other
hand, in stars like Sirius, in consequence of the absolute state of
 vapour, we only get practically the absorption of hydrogen, or at all
 events the absorption of hydrogen in great excess, due,                  I  have very
 little doubt, in part, to the fact that most other substances have been
 dissociated by the intense heat resulting from the condensation of the
 meteorites.
                  Notes on the Provisional Temperature            Curve.
    In order to bring the various results referred to in this communi
 cation   in a definite form before my own mind,                  I  have prepared a
 diagram which         I have called a temperature curve, so that on one side
 of it we may consider those stages in the various heavenly bodies in

144 Mr. J. N. Lockyer. [Nov. 17,
 1887.]           Researches    on the Spectra of Meteorites.           145
 which in each case the temperature is increasing, while on the other
arm of the curve we have that other condition in which we get first
vaporous combination, and then ultimately the formation of a crust
due to the gradual cooling of the mass.         At the top of such a curve
we shall of course have that condition in which the highest tempera
ture must be assumed to exist. In a letter to M. Dumas in the year
1872, 1 suggested that possibly the simplification of the spectrum of
a star might be associated with the highest temperature of the vapour,
and that idea seems to have been accepted by other observers since
that time.     We shall have then stars of the first class at the top of
the temperature       curve. On the one arm of the curve representing
increasing temperature we shall have at various heights those aggre
gations which give us indications of a gradually increasing tempera
ture brought about by collisions, beginning with meteorites as widely
separated as they can be to keep up any luminosity at all, and finally
vaporous condensations due to gravity.
   On the arm of the curve descending from stars of the first class to
dart bodies like, say, the companion to Sirius, we must place those
bodies where absorption of compound molecules           is indicated. This
we find in stars of Class III6 of Vogel.       But here a very interesting
question arises.      Between stars of the first class and that of 1116 we
are bound to insert stars of Class II, already located naturally on the
ascending arm.
        The Case   of equal  Temperatures on either Side of the Curve.
    Speaking roughly, it may be said that the construction of such a
curve as this suggests that similar or nearly similar temperatures
will be found on either side. This in the main, of course, is true ;
but it must be pointed out that, on the rising curve, the temperature
will be that, as a rule, of individual meteorites and the vapours given
out by them, while on the descending arm it will be the temperature
of the consolidated mass, whether vaporous or becoming solid.           But
it is obvious that if we take two points near the top of the curve we
shall have very nearly the same temperature          of the atmosphere, by
 which I mean the temperature of the layers in either case which are
 most effective in producing the phenomena of absorption.          To take a
 concrete   case, stars of the second class are obviously, by the consent
 of all, of a lower temperature than stars of the first class : on which
 side, therefore, of the curve must they be placed ?          Or, to take a
 more    concrete   case still, our sun is a star of the second class : on
 which arm    of the curve must we place the sun ? Here we find our
 selves in a position of some difficulty, but it would appear that future
 work may enable us really to divide stars of the second class into two
 series, and if we can do so there is very little doubt that one series
  will represent the phenomenon of decreasing temperature of the ab

sorbing layers, while the other series will represent the phenomenon
of increasing temperature.
   What considerations are likely to help us in such an inquiry as
this ?    The atmosphere of a star built up by meteorites shonld
resemble in its constitution    the totality of the chemical constitution
of meteorites,   and therefore it might be inferred that the spectro
scopic phenomena presented by such an atmosphere would not be
widely different from the spectroscopic phenomena presented by the
vapours of many meteorites volatilised together.
   To investigate this question       I   have obtained composite photo
graphs   of the spectra of several   meteorites,  with a solar spectrum for
purposes of comparison.       I  find that, while, on the one hand, the
composite photograph giving us the spectrum of the meteorites
greatly resembles that of the sun, as it should do, there are some
variations which suggest the line of separation to which I have
before alluded.     From Dr. Huggins's magnificent photographs of the
stars we have learned that, as         I  had predicted years before the
photographs were taken, the thickness of H and K varies very
greatly in different stellar spectra.       In those stars, presumably the
hottest ones, in which we get the series of hydrogen lines almost
alone as great absorbers, K is almost absent ; it finally comes in,
however, and after a certain stage has been reached it is the most
important line in the spectrum. But there are stars in which the
lines h and Gr of hydrogen are not very much more developed than
they are in the case of our own sun, in which K is much thinner than
in the solar spectrum ; and associated with this condition of K there
is the absorption of a hydrogen line more refrangible than K at wave
length 3800, which is not represented in the solar spectrum with
anything like the intensity.       The question arises, therefore, whether
the enormous thickening of K observed in the sun and some other
stars may not be limited to those stars which, like our sun, are
reducing their temperature ; for we certainly are justified in assum
ing that the temperature of the sun now is not so high as it was in an
earlier stage of the development of the system.         Such a difference as
that, if it is subsequently established, can only come from the atmo
sphere, as an effect of cooling, becoming richer in those substances
the lines of which get broader as the star cools down. We can easily
 imagine that during the process of cooling the relative quantities of
 the vapours should not always remain constant, although it is im
 possible in the present state of our knowledge to give any particular
 reason why such and such vapours should disappear from the
 spectrum in consequence of chemical combinations, while others
 should develop apparently in consequence of their retirement.

               Hydrogen plus Carbon indicates mixed Swarms.
   If  we assume a brightening of the meteor-swarm due to collision
as the cause of the so-called          new stars, we have good grounds for
supposing     that    in these   bodies    the phenomena should be mixed,
for the reason that we should have in one part of the swarm a
number of collisions probably of close meteorites, while among the
outliers the collisions would be few. We shall in fact have in one
part the conditions represented in Class Ilia, and in the other such a
condition as we get in 7 Cassiopeiae.             I  have in another part of this
paper discussed the flutings observed in Nova Orionis, and have
shown that so far as they were concerned we have the radiation of
carbon and the absorption of manganese ; but there is evidence to
show that with these fluted appearances bright lines were observed

   We have here, there is little doubt, the vera causa of stellar long-
period variability.       12 per cent. 6f stars of Class Ilia, are variable,
and 9 per cent, of Class III6.           In the one case, meteor-swarms pro-
dace the increased        brightness by colliding with those of the con
densing one.       In the other, they do so by their periastron passage
round the dim condensed one.             There is no variability, in the usual
sense of the word, in stars like the sun and a Lyrae, and the reason is
now obvious.

                   I. The Numbers of Meteorites in Space.
   It is well known that observations of falling-stars have been used to
determine roughly the average number of meteorites which fall on the
earth each twenty-four hours ; and having this datum to determine
the average distance apart between the meteorites in those parts of
space which are traversed by the earth as a member of the solar
system, Dr. Schmidt, of Athens, from observations made during
seventeen years, found that the mean hourly number of luminous
meteors visible on a clear moonless night by one observer was four
teen,  taking the time of observation from midnight to     1 a.m.
   It  has  been further    experimentally shown that a large group of
observers who might include the whole hemisphere in their observa
tions would see about six times as many as are visible to one eye.
Professor H. A. Newton and others have calculated that making all
proper corrections the number which might be visible over the whole
earth would be a little greater than 10,000 times as many as could
be seen at one place.     From this we gather that not less than twenty
millions of luminous meteors fall upon our planet daily, each of which
in a dark clear night would present us with the well-known pheno
menon of a shooting star.
   This number, however, by no means represents the total number of
minute meteorites that enter our atmosphere, because many entirely
invisible to the naked eye are often seen in telescopes.       It has been
suggested    that the number   of meteorites if these were included would

                  Researches     on the Spectra     of  Meteorites.               149
1887.]
be   increased at least twenty-fold : this would give us 400 millions of
meteorites falling on the earth's surface daily.             If  we consider, how
ever,   only those visible to the naked eye, and if we assume that the
absolute velocity of the        meteors in space is equal to that of comets
moving in parabolic orbits, Professor H. A. Newton has shown that
the average number of meteorites in the space that the earth traverses
is in each volume equal to the earth about 30,000.                  This gives us a
result in     round    numbers     that   the meteorites     are  distributed    each
250 miles away from its neighbours.*
    If, then, these observations may be accepted to be good for any
part of space, we may, and indeed must, expect celestial phenomena
which can be traced to meteorites in all parts of space.
    Further, we have the experience of our own system that these
meteors are apt to collect in groups.
    A comet, it is now generally accepted, is a swarm of meteors in
 company.       Such a swarm finally makes a continuous orbit by virtne
 of arrested velocities ; impacts will break up large stones and will
 produce new vapours in some cases, which will condense into small
 meteoroids.
     A  meteorite  in space under any of the conditions indicated by the
 comets,    new stars, and such first-magnitude stars as a Orionis, will
 evidently be subject to collisions, but only to a greater number of
 collisions than those which must ordinarily occur if space is as              full of
 meteorites as Professor Newton's calculations, from observations                made
 on the    earth, would naturally seem to indicate.
                        The Velocity of Luminous Meteors.
     In spite of the difficulties which attend the observations necessary
 to determine the velocity of meteors            entering our atmosphere, many
 observations have been made from which it may be gathered that the
 velocity is rarely under 10 miles a second or over 40 or 50. It is
 known that the velocities of some meteor-swarms are very different
 from those of others.         Professor Newton, our highest authority on
 this subject, is prepared to consider that the average velocity may be
 taken to be 30 miles a second.
                                 Result of Collisions.
     If  we take these velocities as representing what happens in other
  regions of space, and assume the specific heat of the meteorites to be
  O-lO, the increase in their temperature when their motions are arrested
  by impacts    will be   roughly   as follows   : —

more frequently dealing with grazes than collisions.
                     Comets due to   Collisions of Meteorites.
   The fact that comets are due to swarms of meteorites was first
established by Schiaparelli in 1866, when he demonstrated that the
orbit of the August meteors was identical with that of the bright
comet of 1862*
                     Nebulce due  to  Collisions of Meteorites.
   So far as    I   know the first suggestion that nebulae were really in
some manner associated with meteorites and not with masses of gas
was made by Professor Tait in 1871.          f I     have used the suggestion in
my lectures ever since, and it is now some years ago since                   I put it to
an experimental test by showing that both the spectra of comets and
nebulae, so far as carbon and hydrogen were concerned, could be pro
duced from a vessel containing the vapours produced by meteorites.
More recently, M. Faye has stated in his works on the nebular hypo
thesis that the solar nebula may as probably have consisted of a cloud
of stones as of a mass of gas. This view, however, has not been
favoured by Dr. Huggins, who in his observations both on nebulae and
comets has inferred from the near coincidence of the line of 500 with
the strong air line that we are probably in presence of nitrogen, or of
a form of matter more elementary than nitrogen ; the line at 373 being
attributed by him also to some unknown form of hydrogen on account
of its coincidence with one of the series of hydrogen lines in the ultra
violet observed in the spectra of stars of the first class.

   The idea that the Novas which appear from time to time are due to
collisions of meteorites was,      I think, first advanced by myself in 1877,

    "The very rapid reduction of light in the case of tin new star in
Cygnus was so striking that I at once wrote to Mr. Hind to ask if
any change of place was observable, because it seemed obvious that,
if the body which thus put on so suddenly the chromospheric spectrum
were single, it might only weigh a few tons, or even hundredweights,
and, being so small, might be very near us.               Mr. Hind's telescope was
dismounted, and        I have not yet got any information as to the change
of position     ;  and as  I am now writing in the Highlands, away from
all books,    1   have no opportunity of comparing the position now given
by   Lord Lindsay in R.A. 2lh. 36m. 52s., Decl. + 42° 16' 53", with
those given on its first appearance by Winnecke and others.
    " We seem driven, then, from the idea that these
                                                                    phenomena are
produced by the incandescence of large masses of matter, because if
they were so produced, the running down of brilliancy would be
exceeding slow.
    " Let us consider the case, then, on the
                                                       supposition of small masses
 of matter.       Where are we to find them ? The answer is easy : — in
 those small meteoric masses which, an erer- increasing mass, of evi
 dence tends to show, occupy all the realms of space."*
                              The "Effect* of Collisions.
     The question of what must happen to the meteorites themselves in
 "¦onsequenee of this system of collisions is worth going into thoroughly.
 A very cursory examination seems to indicate that much light is
 thrown on the        condition of meteorites as we know them, and their
 division into iron and stony.
     As 30 miles per second is a very frequent value obtained for the
 velocity of meteorites when they enter our atmosphere, it is possible
 to compare temperatures          brought about by collisions with those pro
 duced by passage through our atmosphere.                   Two masses of meteoric
 iron meeting each other in space would probably, if moving with a
 certain velocity, be formed into a pasty conjoined mass, and this
 process might go on until an iron of large dimensions was formed,
 and the various meteorites thus welded together would present in time
 a very fragmentary appearance.             While irons were thus increasing in
 size, collisions with smaller meteorites would be attended with very
 local increases of temperature,           perhaps sufficient to volatilise the
 snrface or allow it to be indented, and in this manner the well-known
 "                   " receive
   thumb-marks                  explanation.
    The masses of iron, when in a state of fusion, whatever their size,
 would be able to include stony meteorites               in their vicinity. In the
 case of stones it is easy to see that the result would be very different.
 Their collisions would have, most probably, the effect of reducing
 large pre-existing masses to smaller ones, and the collision of a large

stone with a large iron would probably effect the driving of the stone
into fragments, while the iron would be liquefied so as to inclose some
of the fragments in its mass.
     These operations of Nature might go on either in free space, or in
the head of a comet, or in meteor-swarms.        They probably cause the
appearance of the so-called new stars, and in these various circum
stances the rate of subsequent cooling would of course be very different,
so that the results would be very different indeed.
     Large masses on collision probably destroy each other, prodnce
 fragments and vapour, which again condense.           The heterogeneous
 structure is thus to a certain extent explained.    On collision the part
 of the substance of the meteorite given up will depend on the tempe
 rature, and thus a mass of metallic iron mixed with silicates at low-
 temperature will get rid of the iron at once, which must then perforce
 condense in a separate swarm; therefore under low temperature con
 ditions, say at aphelion, irons alone will be formed and the stones will
 become spongy.       The stones will absorb the carbon and hydrogen
 vapours.
                           General Conclusions.
     The general conclusions to which the foregoing investigations lead
 may thus be stated : —
     I. All self-luminous bodies in the celestial spaces are composed of
 meteorites, or masses of meteoritic vapour produced by heat brought
 about by condensation of meteor-swarms due to gravity.
     II. The spectra of all such bodies depend upon the heat of the
 meteorites, produced by collisions, and the average space between the
 meteorites in the swarm, or in the case of consolidated swarms, upon
 the time which has elapsed since complete vaporisation.
      III. The temperature of the vapours produced by collisions in
  nebulae, stars without C and F but with other bright lines, and in
 comets away from perihelion, is about that of the bnnsen burner.
      IV. The temperature of the vapours produced by collision in
  a. Orionis and similar stars is about that of the Bessemer flame.
     V. The line of increase of temperatures of the swarms of meteorites
 and subsequent cooling of the mass of vapour produced, and the
 accompanying phenomena, may be provisionally stated as follows : —

   VI.   The brilliancy of these aggregations, at each increasing tem
perature, depends on the number of meteorites in the swarm, i.e., the
difference depends upon the quantity, and not the intensity, of the
light.
    VII. The existing distinction between stars, comets, and nebulae
rests on no physical basis.
    VIII. The main factor in the various spectra produced is the ratio
 of the interspaces between the meteorites to their incandescent sur
face.
    IX. When     the interspace is very great,         the tenuity of the gaies
 given off by collisions will be so great that no luminous spectrum will
                           " and " stars" without F
be produced ("nebulae                                       bright). When the
interspace    is less, the tenuity of the gas will be reduced, and the
vapours occupying the interspaces will give us bright lines or fluting-s
            "       "      "
 (" nebulae and stars with P bright). When the interspace is rela
tively small, and the temperature of the individual meteorites there
fore higher, the preponderance of the bright lines or flutings in the
spectrum of the interspaces will diminish, and the incandescent
vapour surrounding each meteorite will indicate its presence by
absorbing the continuous spectrum-giving light of the meteorites
themselves.
   X. The brighter lines in spiral         nebulae, and in those in which a
rotation has been set up, are         in  all  probability due to streams of
meteorites, with irregular motions out of the main streams, in w hich
the collisions would be almost nil.        It has already been suggested by
Professor   G.  H. Darwin*  —  using   the  gaseous hypothesis — that in such
nebulae   "the great mass of the gas is non-luminous, the luminosity
being an evidence of condensation along lines of low velocity, accord
ing to a well-known hydrodynamical law.                From this point of view
tie visible  nebula   may  be  regarded    as  a luminous    diagram of its own
stream-lines."
   XI. New stars, whether seen in connexion with nebulae or not, are
produced by the clash of meteor-swarms, the bright lines seen being
low-temperature lines of elements the spectra of which are most
brilliant at a low stage of heat.
   XII. Most of the variable stars which have been observed belongo
to those classes of bodies which I now suggest are uncondensed meteor-
swarms, or condensed stars in which a central more or less solid con
densed mass exists.       In some of those having regular periods the
variation would seem to be partly due to swarms of meteorites moving
around a bright or dark body, the maximum light occurring at peri-
astro n.
   XIII. The spectrum of hydrogen seen in the case of the nebulae
seems to be due to low electrical excitation, as happens with the
                           * '

spectrum        of carbon in the case of comets.       Sudden changes from one
spectrum        to the other are seen      in the glow of meteorites in vacuum
tubes when a   current is passing, and the change from H to C can
always be  hrought about by increased heating of the meteoriie.
   XIV. Meteorites are formed by the condensation of vapours thrown
off by collisions. The small particles increase by fusion brought
about again hy collisions, and this increase     may go on until the
meteorites may be large enough to be smashed by collisions, when the
heat of impact is not sufficient to produce volatilisation of the whole
mass.
   XV. Beginning with meteorites of average composition, the extreme
forms, iron and stony, would in time be produced as a result of colli
sions.
        XVI. In
             recorded time there has been no such thing as a world on
fire, or thecollision of masses of matter as large as the earth, to say
nothing of masses as large as the sun ; but the known distribution of
meteorites  throughout space indicates that such collisions form an
integral part of the economy of nature.    The number of bodies, how
ever, subject to such collisions is extremely small, and must, it would
appear, form but a small percentage of the etlestial bodies, seeing
that they must be dark and cold.
                        XVII.    Special    Solar Applications.
       The solar spectrum can be very fairly reproduced (in some parts
        a.
of the  spectrum almost line for line) by taking a composite photo
graph of the arc spectrum of several        stony meteorites, chostn at
random, between iron meteoric poles.
       The carbon which origina.lly formed part of the swarm the con
        /J.
densation of which produced the solar system-, has been dissociated
 by the high temperature brought about by that condensation.

until a stage    reached when, owing to the reduction of temperature
                   is
    the most effective absorbing layer, the chief absorption will be that
of of
    carbon — a stage in which we now find the stars of Class 1116 of
Vogel's classification.
  e. At the present     time    seems probable that among the chief
                                  it
changes going on in the solar spectrum are the widening of K and the
thinning of the hydrogen lines.
I   have finally to express my great obligations to Messrs. Fowler,
Taylor, and Richards, who have helped me in various ways in the
researches       embodied   in this paper.     Mr. Fowler, the assistant   to the
Solar         Physics Committee, has made most of the observations on
meteorites,       and low-temperature spectra generally, which have been

recorded   on the maps, and he has carried out this work with a care,
skill, and patience beyond all praise.    The observations have in nearly
every case been checked also by myself. Mr. Taylor, the Demon
strator of Astronomy, has been chiefly responsible for looking up the
literature and mapping the results, in which he has been aided by
Mr. Richards.
II.   " Specific Inductive Capacity."        By J. HOPKINeSON,     M.A.,
            D.Sc., F.R.S. Received October 14, 1887.
   The experiments which are the subject of the present communica
tion were originally undertaken with a view to ascertain whether or
not various methods of determination would give the same values to
the specifio inductive capacities of dielectrics.    The programme was
subsequently narrowed, as there appeared to be no evidence of serious
discrepancy by existing methods.
   In most cases the method of experiment has been a modification of
the method proposed by Professor Maxwell, and employed by Mr.
Gordon. The only vice in Mr. Gordon's employment of that method
was that plates of dielectrics of dimensions comparable with their
thickness were regarded as of infinite area, and thus an error of
unexpectedly great magnitude was introduced.
   For determining the capacity of liquids, the apparatus consisted of
a combination of four air condensers, with a fifth for containing the
liquid arranged as in a Wheatstone's bridge, tig. 1. Two, E, F, weic
                                  Fio. 1.

of determinate and    approximately equal capacity ; the other two, J, I,
were adjustable slides, the capacity of either condenser being varied
by the sliding part.     The outer coatings of the condensers E, F, were
connected to the case of the quadrant electrometer, and to one pole of
the induction coil ; the outer coatings of the other pair, J, I, were
connected to the needle of the electrometer and to the other pole of
the induction coil.      The inner coatings of the condensers J, P, were
connected to one quadrant, and I, E, to the other quadrant of the
electrometer.     The slide of one or both condensers J, I, was adjusted
till upon exciting the induction coil no deflection was observed on the
electrometer.     A dummy was provided with the fluid condenser, as
in my former experiments, to represent the necessary supports and
connexions outside of the liquid.           Let now x be the reading of the
sliding condenser when no condenser for fluid is introduced, and a
balance is obtained.      Let y be its reading when the condenser is
introduced fitted with its dummy, z when the.full condenser is charged
with air.     Let «l be the reading when the condenser charged with
fluid is introdaced, then will K, the specific inductive capacity of the
 liquid, be equal  to (z/—          «)•
    Three fluid condensers    were employed, one was the same as in my
former experiments.*        Another was a smaller one of the same type
arranged simply to contain a smaller quantity of fluid.          The third
 was  of a different type designed to prove that by no chance did any
 thing depend on the type     of condenser; this done it was laid aside as
 more   complicated in use.

my previous experiments* was used. Advantage was taken of the
fact that at the time when there is a balance the potentials of the
interiors of all the condensers are the same. Let the ring O of the
guard-ring condenser be in all cases connected to J, let the inner
plate of the guard-ring be connected to               J  as in fig. 2, and let a
bulance be obtained.      Let the inner plate be now transferred to I as
in fig. 3, and again let a balance be obtained ; the difference of the

two readings on the slide represents on a certain arbitrary scale the
capacity of the guard-ring condenser at its then distance.
   In  some cases   it was necessary to adjust both condense^ to obtain
a balance, then the value of a movement of the scale pf one con
denser in terms of the other was known              from   previous ^xperiment.
In some    cases it was found most convenient to introduce           .» condenser
of capacity known in divisions of the scale of the sliding^ condenser
coupled as forming part of the condenser J.                 The old ,method of
adding the opposite charges of two condensers then connecting to the
electrometer and adjusting until the electrometer remained undis
turbed was occasionally used as a check; it was found to give
substantially the same results as the method here described when the
substance insulated sufficiently well to give any results at all.

     The method employed by Palaz is very similar to that employed by
  myself in these experiments ; but, so far as I can ascertain from his
  paper, he fails to take account of the induction between the case of

his fluid condenser and his connecting wire; he also supports the
inner coating of his fluid condenser on ebonite; and, so far as L can
liiscover, fails to take account of the fact that this also would have
flie effect of diminishing to a small extent the apparent specific in
ductive capacity of the fluid. Possibly this may explain why his
results    are in all cases lower than mine.       Determinations have also
been made by Negreano (' Comptes Rcndus,' vol. 104, 1887, p. 4'2'S)
by a method the same as that employed by myself.
    Three substances have been tried with the guard-ring condenser
— double extra dense flint-glass, paraffin wax, and rock salt.             The
first two were not determined           with any very great care, as they
 were only intended to test the convenience of the method.          For double
extra dense flint-glass a value 9'5 was found ; the value I found by
my old method was 9'896.           For paraffin wax 2'31 was obtained —my
 previous value being 2 29.        In the case of rock salt the sample was
 very rough, and too small ; the result was a specific inductive capacity
 of about 18, a higher value than has yet been observed for any sub
 stance.     It must, however, be received with great reserve, as the
 sample was very unfavourable, and I am not quite sure that conduc
 tion in the sample had not something to do with the result.             In the
 experiments with the guavd-ring condenser the disturbing effect of
 the connecting wire was not eliminated.           My thanks are due to my
 pupil, Mr. Wordingham, for his valued help in carrying out the
 experiments.

 I. "  On the Classification of the Fossil Animals commonly named
       Dinosauria." By H. G-. Seeley, F.R.S., Professor of Geo
       graphy in King's College, London.             Received August 31,
       1887.
     Three classifications    of the Dinosauria have been proposed, which
  differ from each other in the principles on which their authors
  proposed to make the divisions.
     First in time is Professor Cope's classification (' Philadelphia, Acad.
     VOL. XLI 11.                                                    o

166            Prof. H. G. Seeley.     On  the Classification   [Nov. 24,
Nat. Sci. Proc.,' November 13th, 1866, and December 31st, 1867;
'
   Amer. Phil. Soc. Trans.,' vol. 14, Part I). He relied upon the
characters of the tarsus and the ilium ; and on their varied condition
divided Dinosaurs into three orders named Orthopoda, Goniopoda.
and Symphopoda. In the Orthopoda, the generic types associated are
Scelidosaurus, Hylaeosaurus, Iguanodon, and Hadrosaurus.           And in
this group the relations of the tibia and fibula are compared to those
of modern Lizards, the proximal tarsals being distinct from each
other and from the tibia.         The ilium has a narrowed anterior
prolongation.
     The Goniopoda is so named from the abrupt flexure of the tarsus
in the middle, which prevented the foot being extended in a line with
 the leg, so that the animals are plantigrade.   The astragalus is distinct
from the tibia, but embraces its distal end. The anterior portion of
the ilium is dilated and plate-like. The genera in this group comprise
Megalosaurus, Laelaps, Ccelosaurus, &c.
     The Symphopoda comprises animals having the first series of tarsal
bones confluent with each other and with the tibia.           The anterior
part of the ilium is dilated and plate-like. The type genera are
 Ornithotarsus and Compsognathus.
     Professor Huxley rejected Professor Cope's groups because he
 considered that the relations of the tarsal bones to the tibia and fibula,
which were supposed to characterise the Goniopoda, are also found in
the Orthopoda.      I am not concerned to inquire how far this criticism
 invalidates Cope's nomenclature, which does not rest wholly upon
tarsal characters for definition ; but it maybe remarked that Professor
 Marsh subsequently obtained specimens which proved that there are
 many Dinosaurs in which the astragalus does not embrace the tibia.
 In place of Cope's three orders Professor Huxley offered a classifica
 tion founded upon characters of the teeth, mandible, ilium, femur, and
  the absence or presence of dermal armour.         He divided the order
  Dinosauria into three groups or families, named Megalosaurid<v.,
  Scelidosauridce, and Iguanoduntidce.   And it was f urther proposed to
  unite these families with Compsognathus into an order, Ornithoscelida
  ('Geol. Soc. Quart. Journ.,' vol. 26, February, 1870). The characters
  used for its definition are different from those relied upon by
  Cope.    The Megalosauridae is co-extensive with the Goniopoda. The
  Orthopoda is subdivided, chiefly on details of tooth character and the
  presence of dermal armour in the Scelidosauridae, and its supposed
  absence in the Iguanodontidae ; but the grounds for the division
   became less evident when Mr. Hulke found -dermal armour well
  developed in his Iguanodon Seelyi (' Geol. Soc. Quart. Journ.,' vol. 38,
  p. 144, May, 1882).
     Subsequently Professor Marsh, in a series of memoirs dating from
  1878 to 1884, proposed to divide the Dinosauria into four orders and

   1887.]         of Animals       commonly named Dinosauria.                  167
   t hree sub-orders.      The characters    used in the classification are drawn
  from all parts of the skeleton.           The chief orders are the Sauropoda,
  comprising    the   allies  of  CetiosaurnR  ; the Stegosauria, which includes
  the allies of Scelidosaurus ; the Ornithopoda, formed for the allies of
  I<ruanodon ; and the Theropoda, which includes genera related to
  Megalosaurus.        The sub-orders grouped under the Theropoda are
  named from their typical genera Caduria and Compsognatha.                   The
  chief difference of Marsh's system from that of Huxley is that he
  separated the allies of Cetiosaurus from the Iguanodontidte to form
  the type of a primary division of the group, as I had suggested (' Geol.
  Soc. Qnart. Journ.,' vol. 30, 1874, p. 690), and named it Sauropoda.
  Otherwise the Theropoda is identical with the Megalosauridas ; the
  Oinithopoda is the Iguanodontidae            similarly re-named ; while the
 Stegosauria     is   the    Scelidosauridae    of Huxley, enlarged like the
 other groups by Professor Marsh's admirable discoveries, and re
 named.
      The characters on which these animals should be classified are,            I
 submit, those which pervade the several parts of the skeleton, and
  exhibit some diversity among the associated animal types. The pelvis
 is perhaps more typical of these animals than any other part of
 the skeleton, and should be a prime element in classification.               The
 presence or absence of the pneumatic condition of the vertebrae is an
 important structural difference.          Differences in the construction of the
 base of the skull are indicative of affinities.       The presence or absence
 of armour is less important, since it may show all grades of develop
 ment from the perfect shield of Polacanthus to small granules in the
 skin ; and the condition of the tarsus seems to me likely to be
 influenced by the habits of life of the animals.         Yet the more general
of these characters       are morphologically preferable to slight differences
 in dental character, or digitigrade or plantigrado progression, or
number of digits, or relative size of limbs. Many of the characters
hitherto regarded as ordinal seem to me rather of a nature to
distinguish families.
     The ilium at first sight has the aspect of a distinctive character of
the whole group, and has been regarded as Avian, because it extends
both in front of the acetabulum and behind it.                 This character is
common to birds ; but it is also shared by the Ornithosauria, and to
some extent by the Anomodontia.               Hence this condition of the ilium
does not necessarily imply that the Dinosauria is a homogeneous
group.       Professor Cope pointed out two distinct types of ilium
which he regarded as ordinal.              First, there is the ilium which is
prolonged forward as a more or less narrow process which is typically
seen in Iguanodon and less typically in Scelidosaurus.                  Secondly,
there is the ilium which has its anterior process developed into a
vertical plate.     The bone varies a little in shape in every genus, but        I
                                                                       o 2

see no reason    to doubt that these two types of iliac bones are available
for purposes of classification.
    The pubes also present two types. First there are genera in which
the bones are directed anteriorly and meet by a median symphysis,
and have no posterior extension except for the proximal symphysis
with the ischium.         This type is represented by Cetiosaurus,
Ornithopsis, Megalosaurus, and many genera figured by Professor
Marsh. The second form of pubis has one limb which is directed
backward parallel to the ischium, and another limb directed forward.
It is typically seen in Omosaurns and in Ignanodon. There are many
variations in stoutness and details of form of the bones, but so
far as   I  am aware these two plans comprise all the Dinosaurian
genera.

there is no    important difference of plan in the pelvis between the
animals which have been referred to the order Stegosauria and those
referred to the order Ornithopoda ; and similarly,                the plan of
construction of the pelvis is essentially the same in the animals on
which have been founded the orders Sauropoda and Theropoda.                 But
there is as marked a difference between these two pelvic types as can
be found in any part of the animal kingdom.               These resemblances
and differences are shown in the figures, which are copied from type
genera of Professor Marsh's four orders.
   The evidence concerning the penetration of air cells into the
vertebra has been less fully brought forward.             But in the known
genera   which   have  been  referred   to the Stegosauria,   the vertebras are
solid, and the like condition obtains in all the genera of Ornithopoda.
The genera in Professor Marsh's list which are thus united are
Stegosaurud,     Diracodon, Omosaunis, Scelidosaurus, Acauthopholis,
Cratseomus,     Hylaeosanrus,      and Polacanthns,      with Camptonotns,
Laosaurus, Nanosaurns, Hypsilophodon, Iguanodon,                   Vectisaurns,
Hadrosaurns, Agathaumus and Cionodon.
   On the other hand, the precaudal vertebras of Sanropoda are more
or less hollow.     This hollowness may amount to perfect excavation
which leaves only an external investing film with a longitudinal
median septum, or it may include a multitude of internal cells, or it
may be limited to a pair of shallow impressed pits on the sides of the
centrum.     One of the characters by which Professor Marsh defines
the Theropoda is : "vertebras more or less cavernous."             The animals
included in the group appear to differ greatly in this condition.              I
have    no evidence     of presacral vertebras of Megalosaurus being
chambered,    and  the  chambered    condition of the caudal vertebras rests
upon a few specimens such as the types of Poikilopleuron.             Professor
Cope mentions     that the  tissue  of the  sacral vertebras   of Loslaps is so
coarse as to resemble a mass of borings of the Teredo, but still the
demonstration of the pneumatic condition has not been made.              Nor is
the evidence clearer with regard to Zanclodon.               Professor Marsh
Hgures deep pits in the sides of the dorsal vertebras of Creosaurus.         In
Ceratosaurus, Marsh observes that all the presacral vertebras are very
hollow, and this is also true of the anterior caudals.               The same
condition is described in the cervical vertebras of Labrosaurus, though
the external foramina are small, while the Coeluria,            if included in
the order, would show a vertebral condition more perfectly pneumatic
than in any of the Sauropoda.         Hence, as the chambered condition of
vertebras is developed in most of the types of the group, it is possible
that its absence in genera in which it is unrecorded may be due to the
small size of the foramina having failed to indicate its existence, or to
 the air-cells having been so slightly developed          that they did not
 penetrate the bones, as is the case with penguins among birds.             But

  170          Prof. H. (i. Seeley.          On   the  Classification       [Nov. 24,
  the development       of the pneumatic condition is sufficiently general
 among     Sauropoda and Theropoda, to show that these groups are
 united together by a character which separates them from Stegosauria
 and Ornithopoda.         It is not possible to form an opinion as to the
 inference which should be drawn from this character concerning the
 vital organisation of the animals in which it is found. For, mauy
 of the armoured genera have the neural arch much extended verti
 cally, in the dorsal region, showing that the lungs were greatly
 developed.     But since the difference in height between the carapaces
 of flat-shelled Emydian Chelonians and Tortoises, is chiefly due to
 differences in the volume of the lungs, it is quite possible that
 considerable variations in osteological           character may occur in the
vertebra, without mnch difference in the vital organ which producei
 the change.      On the other hand it must be remembered that among
existing   animals,    the pneumatic skeleton is only found in birds.
     Of late years the Dinosaurian skull has .become well known.
Mr. J. W. Hulke, P.R.S., described the brain-case of Iguanodon in 1871
 (' Geol. Soc. Quart. Journ.,' vol. 27, p. 199), and in 1874 I described the
base of a cranium (' Geol. Soc. Quart. Journ.,' vol. 30, p. 690) which
was named Craterosaurus Pottonensis.             In the former the brain-case is
closed in front, and the basi-sphenoid              has a comparatively slight
downward development, while in the latter the base of the skull is
much more like that of Hatteria than it is like Iguanodon.                      These
types   include  so  far  as the  evidence  goes   all the  forms    of skull hitherto
discovered.     On the plan of Iguanodon are shaped the skulls of
Hypsilophodon         and apparently Diclonius,             while the skulls        of
Diplodocus and Ceratosaurus have much in common with Cratero
saurus in having the deep pituitary depression, the anterior part of
the brain-case open, &c.          The evidence concerning the skull is very
imperfectly known, but, so far as it goes, points in the same direction
as the other characters in indicating that there are probably only two
types in the group. Any classification must necessarily be provisional
until the skulls and skeletons which exist are adequately described.
The considerations adduced appear, however, to show that the
Dinosauria has no existence as a natural group of animals, but includes
two distinct types of animal structure with technical characters in
common, which show their descent from a common ancestry rather
than their close affinity.           These two orders of animals may be
conveniently named the Ornithischia* and the Saurischia, and defined
by the following characters.
                                     Ornithischia.
    In this order   the ventral border of the pubic bone is divided, so that
one limb is directed backward parallel to the ischium as among birds,
                   • " Isohia " is used by Aristotle for the pelvis.

and the       other limb is directed forward.                            Neither of these limbs of the
pubis appears             to   form      a  median         symphysis.             The ilium is prolonged
in front of the acetabulum as a more or less slender process or bar.
The vertebrae are solid, and the skeleton is not pneumatic.                                                           The
basi-cranial structure is distinctive, differing from that of Crocodiles
and Lizards.               The body and limbs are frequently covered with scutes
which may form a complete shield or be reduced so as to be unrecognis
able.     The digits vary from three to five.
                                                      Saurischia.
    In this order the pubis is directed forward from its symphysis with
the ischium, and no posterior limb of the bone is developed.                                                         Both
pubis    and       ischium         appear      to   meet      by    a  median        symphysis,           so    that    the
arrangement and relations of the bones are Lacertilian.                                               The anterior
prolongation             of   the   ilium     has     a  vertical       expansion.            The     vertebras are
 more or less pneumatic or cavernous ; and in the dorsal region the
 neural arch is commonly elevated.                               The basi-cranial structure is sub-
 lacertilian.            No armour has been found. The digits vary in number
 from three to five.
     I  see    no        ground for associating these two orders in one group,
 unless that group includes Birds, Crocodiles, Anomodonts, and Orni-
 thosaurs; for differences of pelvic structure have been as persistently
 inherited as any condition of the vertebrate skeleton.

   The author describes a slab showing impressions of the fore-limb
and some other bones of the skeleton,         which indicate a plantigrade
animal as large as a wolverine.       Its general affinities are with flesh-
eating types.    The  humerus    approximates to that of Thylacinus. The
ulna and radius at their proximal ends are like those of Lemuroids

    § 3. Bismuth : its Separation from Copper.
interesting metal, which      I   had the honour of bringing under the
notice of the Royal    Society in February last, I referred to the diffi
culties with which the treatment of bismuth is surrounded when
associated with other metals — by any very rapid or comprehensive
process.
    During the conduct of my operations in the reduction of bismuth
 from its ores, and its subsequent refining, I have frequently found
 this metal to contain a small proportion of copper, an element most
 detrimental even in small traces, and hitherto I believe, only elimi
nated by a wet process, costly in practice and tedious in operation.
It is necessary by such method to dissolve up the whole of the alloy
 and precipitate the bismuth in the usual manner — a bulky operation,
 and one requiring a considerable amount of time. It became therefore
advisable, in order to treat cupreous bismuth rapidly and upon a
commercial scale, to effect this separation, if possible, by means of
a dry process.
    In this I have succeeded.

1887.]         Contributions to the Metallurgy   of Bismuth.         173
   Having observed, in conducting experiments with bismuth and its
sulphides, that sulphide of bismuth becomes very easily impregnated
with copper, I made the simple experiment of fusing the cupreous
bismuth with bismuth sulphide, and found it possible by this means
to remove every trace of copper, the sulphur readily combining with
the metallic copper.
   In this absorption a proportion of bismuth is reduced equivalent
to the amount of copper taken up in the operation.
   The residual bismuth and copper sulphides thus produced amount
to but a small proportion in comparison with the quantity of alloy
treated, and the bismuth is readily recovered by subsequent reduction
and refusion.
   Large quantities of alloy can be treated at one operation, and
the bismuth so freed from copper is available for commercial
purposes.    I  have found it better, when bismuth is associated with
other metals, such as arsenic, antimony, lead, tellurium, &c., as well
as with copper, to separate all these metals (see former papers)
before attempting to remove the copper by the foregoing method.
   The operation has been conducted successfully upon many
thousands of pounds of similar alloy, and the following figures will
show the results obtained in one case, as an example : —
   Weight of cupreous bismuth treated = 314 lbs. containing 0-10 per
cent. of copper, equal to approximately 0-3 lb.
      From the operation described      I obtained  of bismuth  lhe.
        free from copper                                        282

   Thus the whole of the copper and of the bismuth, within a small
fraction, is accounted for, the latter being obtained as commercially
                                                                        *
pure bismuth and wholly free from copper.
   As the above operation shows, the first separation frees 90 per cent.
of the bismuth at once from the copper associated with it.
   It may be as well to state that I have effected complete separation
with bismuth containing proportions of copper varying from one-
tenth of 1 per cent, to 1 per cent. by the above process.

                                        (Abstract.)
  The determination of the small oscillations and steady motion of a
sphere which is immersed in a viscous liquid, and which is moving in
a straight line, was first effected by Professor Stokes in his well-
known memoir " On the Effect of the Internal Friction of Fluids on
the Motion of Pendulums;"* and in the appendix he also determines
the steady motion of a sphere which is rotating about a fixed diameter.
The same subject has also been subsequently considered by Helmholtz
and other German writers ; but, so far as I have been able to discover,
very little appears to have been effected with respect to the solution of
problems in which a solid body is set in motion in a viscous liquid in
any given manner, and then left to itself.
   In the present paper I have endeavoured to determine the motion
of a sphere which is projected vertically upwards or downwards with
given velocity, and allowed to ascend or descend under the action of
gravity (or any constant force), and which is surrounded by a viscous
liquid of unlimited extent, which is initially at rest excepting so far as
it is disturbed by the initial motion of the sphere.
   In solving this problem, mathematical difficulties have compelled
me to neglect the squares and products of velocities, and quantities
depending thereon, which iuvolves the assumption that the velocity of
the sphere is always small throughout the motion ; and I have also
assumed that no slipping takes place at the surface of the sphere.
The problem is thus reduced to obtaining a suitable solution of the
differential equation

hollow spaces being formed in the liquid ; (iii) if the velocity of the
sphere became large, the amount of heat developed would be sufficient
to vaporise the liquid in the immediate neighbourhood of the sphere,
and the circumstances of the problem would be materially changed.

sphere, surrounded by a viscous liquid, which is set in rotation with
given angular velocity, Q, about a fixed diameter, and similar results
are obtained. To a first approximation the angular velocity is equal
to Qe~Kt, where X is a positive constant, which shows that the motiou

176       On  the Theory  of Partial Differential Equations.         [Nov. 24,
V. " On the Direct Application of First Principles in the Theory
       of Partial Differential Equations." By J. Larmor, M.A.,
       Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge. Communicated
       by Lord Rayleigh, D.C.L., Sec. R.S. Received November
        8, 1887.
                                 (Abstract.)
    If an equation involving total differentials of any number                of
variables can be expressed in the form —
                                Sn + a Sv    = 0,
where     u, v are any functions      of the variables, then the only simjle
integral algebraic relations that are consistent with it are included
under the form —
                                   ii  = 0(f).
When the form of a is assigned,           the functional    symbol 0 is to be
chosen, if possible,   so as to agree      with   that form ; and if this is not
possible, then the equation has no integral expressible as a single rela
tion. This statement holds because the equation expresses a particu
lar case of the proposition that if 3«=0, then £t-=0, and conversely,
 i.e., that u remains constant (does not vary) when v is constant, and
only then, whatever be the particular values assigned to the variables :
 but this is simply the definition of the algebraic idea of function
ality.
    If, however, a involve differentials, the alternative Su=0 when <r=0
may lead to integrals of a new type.
    In the same way, an equation of the form —
must have all its single integrals included under the form —
                                 u  =   <t,(v, uj),
 where the form of      0 is to be chosen so as to agree       with the expres
sions for ai, a2, when these are assigned.
    When no single integral exists, equations of this type may he satis
 fied by two simultaneous integral relations, one of which may be
 arbitrarily assumed, as originally pointed out by Monge. This kind
 of exception, however, need not trouble us when partial differential
 coefficients are concerned ; for these implicitly assume the existence of
 a single relation connecting the dependent variable with the inde-              .
 pendent ones.
    Traces of this idea are to be found throughout the writings of Boole

  1887.]      Contractility  of the Protoplasm    of Plant Cells.         Ill
 — and of Monge long previously.         In this paper it is applied, first to
 the non-analytical exposition of the differential criteria of algebraic
 functionality given by Jacobi, and then to the discussion in a similar
  manner of the theory of partial differential equations of the first and
 second order, particularly those named after Lagrange, Monge, and
 Ampere.
 VI.  "   On the Power of Contractility exhibited by the Proto
       plasm of certain Plant Cells."            (Preliminary Communi
       cation.) By Walter           Gardiner,     M.A., Fellow of Clare
       College, Cambridge, Demonstrator of Botany in the Uni
       versity.      Communicated by Prof. M. Foster, Sec. R.S.
       Received November 21, 1887.
    In a former communication (' Roy.         Soc.  Proc.,' No. 240, 1886),
 some account was given of the principal changes which take place
 in the gland cells and stalk cells of Drosera dichotoma during secre
 tion. The present paper deals with certain experiments and observa
 tions which were undertaken in order to attempt to ascertain by
 what mechanism the bending of the tentacles is made possible in
 Drosera, and what changes occur in the tentacle cells.
    During actual movement no obvious histological changes can be
 detected in the cells of the bending portion, but when the tentacle
 has become well inflected, it becomes apparent that the cells of the
 convex side become more, and those of the concave less turgid than
 before.    Some time after stimulation, and when the period of aggre
 gation has set in, it can be observed that the cells of the convex side
are less aggregated than those of the concave.          Having ascertained
 that of the dye solutions, eosin, and of salts, the salts of ammonia,
are readily sucked up into the tissue, it was further noticed that in
 stimulated tentacles the cells of the convex side readily allow the
solutions to penetrate, while those of the concave are only penetrated
with great difficulty.       Thus in the case of a stimulated tentacle
treated with eosin, the convex cells are stained long before the con
cave, and with amnionic carbonate the tannin of the convex cells may
be precipitated while the concave cells remain normal, or the convex
cells may even be killed while the concave cells remain alive.          Thus
after    stimulation  certain  changes  have  occurred  in the concave   cells
of the bending portion, and one result of this change is an increased
impenetrability of the primordial utricle.         In my former paper I
have shown that the tentacle cells of Drosera are very sensitive to
contact, for if the gland cells be slightly crushed, all movement of the
stalk cells ceases for a time, and the spindle-shaped rhabdoid contracts
and tends to become spherical. Bearing in mind also the very pro

178           Mr. W. Gardiner.      On  the. Contractility of   [Nov. 24,
nounced     inflection which is occasioned by the stimulus of contact or
food, by electrical stimulus or, as Darwin has shown, by the stimulus
of temperature, one is led to ask whether these phenomena are not
associated with true contractility, and whether the increased impene
trability of the protoplasm of the concave cells is not occasioned by
a definite contraction of the primordial utricle and a consequent
decrease in the size of the molecular pores.
    Experiments were then made upon the pulvinus of Mimosa pudica.
Small pieces of stem (bearing leaves) were cut under a watery solution
of eosin, and the pulvini were maintained in a state of stimulation.
When the eosin had sufficiently penetrated, transverse and longi
tudinal sections of the pulvinus were made and examined.            It was
 then seen that the dye had readily penetrated into and stained the
 protoplasm of the outer cells of the convex side of the pulvinns,
 while on the concave side no staining whatever, of that tract of cells
 situated towards the more external portion, which especially play an
 active part in movement, had taken place.      The more indifferent cells
 immediately surrounding the vascular bundle also show some contrast
in coloration, for in the upper half this tissue remains unstained,
 while in the lower half some staining occurs. Thus by the process of
 staining the seat of the especially irritable tissue was clearly brought
 into view. The author now commenced electrical experiments with
 the pulvini.     Two small pins (which were found not to injure the
 tissue to any appreciable extent) were inserted into the irritable tissue
 —one at each end, and fine wires from these pins communicated to
 the various electrical apparatus as required. When suitably stimulated
with either a constant current, an induction shock, or a tetanising
 shock, the leaf fell immediately contact was made.        With the single
induction shock the breaking shock was found to be a stronger stimulus
 than the making. A small piece of stem with the pulvinus attached —
 the lamina and a portion of the petiole of the leaf having been pre
 viously removed — was attached to a lever which wrote upon a revolving
 drum. On throwing in the electrical stimulus the pulvinus contracted
 and a curve was obtained. The pulvinns was then turned upside down
 and, after recovery, was again stimulated and a second curve obtained.
 In both instances the pulvinus raised a weight greater than that of the
 leaf and leaf stalk. These experiments for the most part only con
 firmed those of Cohn and Kabsch, except that they were carried out
 in further detail ; but one new and important observation was made,
 viz., that under the influence of a feeble tetanising current the period
 of recovery of the pulvinus could be materially shortened, and the
 leaf could be induced to assume the position before stimulation in
 less time than it would have taken under ordinary circumstances.
 The wonderful delicacy with which the irritable cells of the pulvinus
 at once reply to stimulation, the fact that in their reaction to the

 1887.]           the  Protoplasm    of certain Plant Cells.           179
stimulus of electricity they obey the same laws as animal muscle, and,
like certain mnscles, may also be relaxed by a feeble tetanising current,
go   far to suggest that in dealing with the movements of the pul-
vinus of Mimosa we have essentially to do with the phenomenon of
contractility.
    Althongh the foregoing results may be said to favour the idea that
in irritable organs, movements          are brought abont by a definite
contraction of the protoplasm of the cells of the irritable side, yet the
author felt that the matter could only be set at rest by still further
strengthening the evidence, and if it were possible, by the actual
observation of a cell contracting under the influence of electrical or
other stimulation:       He therefore turned his attention to the simple
filamentous Algae,      and    among them to an organism which he
believed would be peculiarly sensitive to stimulation, viz., Mesocarpus
pleurrocarpus.    The filaments consisting of rows of cells were first
experimented       upon, electrically.      A single induction shock of
moderate strength was found to cause a splitting apart of the
previously united transverse walls of the contiguous cells along the
middle lamella;.      In each cell, the two end walls now project inwards
towards the centre of the cell in a concave manner, so that between
each pair of cells of the filament there arise a series of double convex
lenticular spaces. The rupture does not extend to the free surface.
    With a stronger shock so much contraction is prodnced that the
cells actually fly apart and a complete rupture is effected.      The end
walls of each cell are now observed to be slightly convex instead of
concave.      This is a result of the contraction of the freed edges of
the external walls, which in consequence of the rupture no longer
maintain their cylindrical form.        Each cell now resembles a cylinder
with its two ends somewhat convex, and its sides very slightly
contracted in the immediate neighbourhood of their lines of union
with the ends. As in Mimosa the breaking is a stronger stimulus
than the making shock.           Similar contraction is obtained with the
tetanising    shock and   with  the constant current.
    Sudden illumination, sudden rise of temperature (45 — 50° C.), and
 the stimulus of certain poisons,        bring about the contraction and
 breaking apart in the most marked manner. Of the poisons, camphor,
 quinine, strychnine, physostigmine and strong alcohol were found to be
 exceedingly powerful, with very dilute alcohol no obvious change
 occurred.     The strongest plasmolysing reagents did not bring about
 the rupture of the cells, but only the partial separation of the end wall,
 and if the cells are killed by boiling water, by iodine, or by very
 dilute chromic acid (0-25 per cent.), similar results follow.        With
  1 per cent,  osmic acid or 1 per cent. chromic acid the cells may be
 killed and fixed with little or no contraction.
    The results with plasmolysis entirely agree with those previously

180       Contractility  of  the Protoplasm   of Plant Cells.   [Nov. 24,
obtained   in the case of Drosera (loc. cit.) : the protoplasm seeming
to be partially paralysed, the whole of its energy apparently expended
in endeavouring to protect itself from the abnormally rapid with
drawal of water.      The passive shrinking produced by strong dehy-
dratiug reagents is essentially different from the active contraction
arising from normal stimulation, and one may well inquire whether
the effects produced by plasmolysis at all tally with those vital
processes which actually take place under ordinary circumstances in
plant cells.
   The results obtained with Mesocarpus demonstrate that we have
here a plant cell which reacts in a most powerful manner to the
stimulus of temperature, of light, of electricity, and of poisons, and
that this reaction, which may be watched under the microscope, is
attended by a diminution in size.       In the opinion of the author such
a series of reactions can only point to one property of the protoplasm,
viz., that of contractility, and taking into consideration the whole of
the observations, there appears to be no doubt that the protoplasm of
plant cells, like that of animal cells, is capable of active contraction.
The author believes that in all irritable organs the movements are
brought about in consequence of a definite contraction of the proto
plasm of the irritable cells, and that during such contraction some of
the cell sap escapes to the exterior.     At the same time the elastic cell
wall contracts pari passu with the protoplasm.           The author has
already  drawn   attention  to the intimate  connexion between  the proto
plasm and the wall (' Phil. Trans.,' 1883, Part 3), and has shown that
even after pronounced plasmolysis, the ectoplasm of the primordial
utricle is always connected to the cell membrane by very numerous
and delicate strands of protoplasm. The protoplasm may be with
drawn from the wall by a very strong electric shock, but the normal
effect of a moderate stimulus is <o cause the protoplasm to con
tract, and in certain cases pull upon its wall, while in very turgid
cells where the cell wall is in a state of great tension, the wall for the
most part simply contracts upon the protoplasm.            The escape of
liquid from the interior of the cell is regarded as being due to filtra
tion under pressure.     The author is unable to uphold Pfeffer's theory
that the sudden abolition of turgidity is dependent upon the destruc
tion of a certain quantity of an osmotically active substance.      In his
opinion there is in every cell a sufficient quantity of osmotically
active substance to ensure turgidity, but the increase or decrease
of turgidity essentially depends on the contraction or relaxation
of the primordial utricle.      His experiments all tend to show that
it is the ectoplasm which mainly determines the state of turgidity of
the cells. Thus in the tentacle cells of Drosera the endoplasm may
actually be withdrawn from the ectoplasm by the lengthy action of
strong solutions of magnesium sulphate, and although it is almost

 entirely collected around the nucleus at the centre of the cell, the
 latter still remains turgid.
•
    The author is also of opinion that de Vries' view, that the turgidity
 of the cell is mainly dependent on the presence of certain osmotically
 active substances in the sap, of an acid nature, requires some further
qualification, for his own results agree rather with those of Schwartz,
since he finds that turgid cells may possess either an acid or an
alkaline sap. Thus, in Drosera itself, the cells of the tentacles have
an acid, and those of the petals of the flower an alkaline reaction.
    Finally, the author believes that the property of contractility,
 which he claims to have established for the irritable cells of Drosem
and Mimosa, and for the less specialised cells of Mesocarpus, is a pro
perty which is possessed in a greater or less degree by all the actively
living cells which constitute the tissues of plants. The important
 bearing of these results on all phenomena of movement and growth is
 sufficiently obvious. The author hopes to deal with the matter in
 fuller detail in a future paper.

   The Report of the Auditors of the Treasurer's Accounts on the
part of the Council was presented, by which it appears that tho total
receipts during the past year, including balances carried from the
preceding year, amount to £7,691 13s. &\d. on the General Account,
and £14,673 18s. 3d. on account of Trust Funds, and that the total
expenditure in the same period, including purchase of stock, amounts
to £7,441 7s. 2d. on the General Account, and £12,937 7s. 48. on
account of Trust Funds, leaving a balance on the General Account of
£232 0s. hd. at the Bankers', and £18 5s. 11£<J. in the hands of
the Treasurer, and on account of Trust Funds a balance at the
Bankers' of £1,736 10s. lid.

    The President then addressed the Society as follows       : —
 During     the  past year death has removed from us fifteen of our
 Fellows and one Foreign Member. It is remarkable that no less than
 six of these had reached the age which the Psalmist takes for the
 extreme     duration of human life, while the average of the whole
 number exceeds seventy-five years.          Within two months after our
 last anniversary, Sir Joseph Whitworth died at the age of eighty-four.
 Starting from an humble beginning, he attained through his talent
 and steady application a commanding position among constructors of
 machinery and heavy ordnance, and the truth of surface and accuracy
 of dimensions of what came from his workshop are probably uurivalled.
 Sir Walter Elliot, who was still older, combined a high official position
in India with the pursuit of natural history, and was the author of
several papers in scientific serials. John Hymers and Thomas Gaskin
were mathematicians well known to Cambridge men of some standing,
and were both elected Fellows of our Society nearly half a century ago.
The former was the author of various mathematical text-books, which
for a long time were those chiefly used in their respective subjects by
Cambridge students for mathematical honours. The latter, once a
colleague of my own in a mathematical honour examination, was
famed for his skill in the solution of problems, though he has not
left much behind him in the way of mathematical writings, beyond a

186                       A nniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
book continuing the solution of a variety of problems.         In Robert
Hunt we have lost an aged Fellow whose name is well known in
connexion with the study of the action of light in producing chemical
changes, and on vegetation.        In Joseph Baxendell we had a man
who during a long life was a diligent observer of astronomical and
meteorological phenomena.        John Arthur Phillips, a geologist who
attended more particularly to the chemical origin of mineralogical
and geological phenomena, was the author of several papers, some of
which appear in our own Proceedings.           It is not long since Sir
Julius von Haast was among us, apparently in full vigour, having
come to England in connexion with the Colonial Exhibition, and
now this distinguished geologist and naturalist is no more. The
Earl of Iddesleigh was suddenly carried off in the midst of the
duties belonging to an important office in the State, while Beresford-
•Hope has succumbed to an illness of some duration.            These two
joined us under the statute which enables the Council to recom
mend to the Society for election, in addition to the fifteen who
are selected in the ordinary way, and nearly always on account
of their scientific claims, persons who are members of Her Majesty's
Most Honourable Privy Council, and whose ability is thus attested,
though they are not usually men of science.           From the list of
foreign    Members,   one  name   has disappeared   which  has become a
household word among the physicists of all civilized nations.         The
name of Kirchhoff will ever be remembered as that of the      introducer,
conjointly with Bunsen, of spectral analysis into the regular work
of the chemical laboratory, a step which has been so fertile in results.
 To him too we owe the reference of the dark lines of the solar
 spectrum to the absorption of portions of light coming from deeper
 jKlrtions of the sun by the vapours of substances which in the con
 dition of incandescent vnpour themselves emit bright lines in corre
sponding positions, and to him therefore we are indebted for the
 detection of chemical elements in the sun and stars, though partial
 anticipations of these discoveries had been made by others. The
fertility of these researches, and the attention which they consequently
 excited, should not make us forget the many important investigations
 in mathematical physics of which Kirchhoff was the author.
    The present year is memorable as the Jubilee of the reign of Her
 Most Gracious Majesty our beloved Sovereign, and the Patron of our
 Society.    An address of congratulation on this auspicions event was
 prepared by the Council, and was graciously received by Her Majesty
 in Windsor Castle at the hands of your President, who was accom
 panied on that occasion by the senior Secretary.
    It happens that this same year is also the Jubilee of the Electric
 Telegraph, if we date from the first construction of a telegraph on an
 actually working scale, as distinguished from preparatory experiments

1887.]                       Presidents Address.                          187
made      only in the laboratory.       The Jubilee was duly celebrated by
the Society of Telegraph Engineers.           The name of our former Fellow
Wheatstone will go down to posterity as having occupied a foremost
place in this great practical application of Oersted's fertile discovery.
    I will just briefly allude to another outcome of scientific research.
The last half-century was well advanced when our Fellow Dr. Perkin,
by utilising a colour reaction which had been employed by chemists
as a test for aniline, laid the foundation of the industry of the coal-
tar colours, which has now attained snch great proportions, and the
investigation of the chemical theory of which has occupied the atten
tion of so many eminent chemists from our own Fellow Dr. Hofmann
onwards.
     There is yet another Jnbilee connected with this same year in which
our Society is if possible still more closely connected: it is now just
200 years since the publication of the first edition of that immortal
work, the "Principia" of Newton.              Some of the important results
embodied in the       "            "   had previously been communicated to
                        Principia
the   Royal Society.
    But restricting our view to the last half-century alone, we can
hardly help casting a glance at the progress of science, and of the
practical applications of science, within that period. In electricity,
 I have already referred to the electric telegraph, now passed into the
 management of a department of the State, and inwoven in our daily
life, with its wires stretching all round the earth like the nerves in
 the body, and placing us in immediate connexion with distant
 countries. Much more recent than the invention of the electric
 telegraph is that, in some respects, still more wonderful apparatus
 for communication at a distance afforded by the telephone.               The
 application    of electricity  to   lighting purposes,    of which we   have
 availed ourselves for the lighting of the apartments of our own
 Society, is an industrial outcome of Faraday's discovery of magneto-
 electric induction which could not have been thought of when the
 account of that discovery first appeared in our Transactions.           It is
 true that what I have just been mentioning with respect to electricity
  consists of industrial applications rather than the discovery of new
  scientific principles ; but these industrial applications react upon
  abstract science beneficially in more ways than one.         The possibility
  of useful applications induces theorists to engage in investigations
  which they might not otherwise have thought of, the result of which
  is oftentimes to lead them to a clearer apprehension of fundamental
  principles, and to induce them to undertake exact quantitative deter
  minations of fundamental constants.          Moreover, the grand scale on
  which apparatus for actual commercial use has to be constructed,
   renders it possible for scientific men, through the courtesy of those
   who direct the construction, to make         interesting experiments on a

 188                       Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
 scale the cost of which would be quite prohibitory    if it were a matter
of science pure and simple.      Take for example the experiments mads
 by Faraday on 100 miles of submerged covered wire at the Works of
 the Electric Telegraph Company.
    When we think of the progress of science, both abstract and applied,
during the last half-century, we can hardly help speculating as to the
possible increase of scientific knowledge half a century hence.        Per
haps we might be tempted to think that the mine must have been so
far worked that no great quantity of precious ore can still be left,
except what lies too deep for human power to extract. Yet surely
the progress of knowledge in the past warns us against any hasty
conclusion of the kind.     How often have accessions to our knowledge
been made which were quite nnforeseen and quite unexpected, and
how can we say what great discovery may not be made at any
moment, and what a flood of light may not result from it ?
   In what direction such discoveries may be made, it would be rash
indeed to attempt to predict.     Yet one cannot help thinking of one or
two cases in which we seem almost in touch of what if we could reach
it would probably give us an insight into the processes of nature of
which we have little idea at present.     Take for example the theory of
electricity as contrasted with the theory of light.  In the lat ter we have
the laws of reflection and refraction, which have long been known, the
remarkable phenomenon of interference, the curious appearances which
we designate by phenomena of diffraction. But all these fall in the most
simple and natural way into their places when we have arrived at the
answer to the question, What is light ? which is furnished by the state
ment, — Light consists in the undulations of an elastic medium.      But we
are not at present able to give a similar answer to the question, What
is electricity P The appropriate idea has yet to be found.       We know
a great deal about its laws, and its connexion with magnetism and
chemical action ; we are able to measure accurately physical constants
relating to it ; we make it subservient to the wants of daily life ; and
yet we are unable to answer the question, What is it ? Could we
only give a definite answer to this question, it seems likely that the
production of electricity by friction, electrostatic attractions and
repulsions, the laws of electrodynamics, those of thermodynamics, the
nature of magnetism, and magneto-electric phenomena would prove to
be all simple deductions from the one fundamental idea.         Nay more :
so closely is electricity related to chemical action, that could we only
clearly apprehend the nature of electricity, it seems not unlikely
that an unexpected flood of light might be shed on chemical com
bination.
   Let me refer to one other instance in which a large accession to our
present knowledge seems not altogether hopeless.           We know that
when an electric discharge is passed through a given gas, or between

1887.]                        Presidents     A ddress.                             180
electrodes formed of a given             substance,   an   analysis of the spark
reveals a usually complicated spectrum of bright lines, characteristic
of the chemical substances present.            The arrangement of the lines in
most cases seems capricious, while in other instances we have repeti
tions of lines, or else rhythmical flutings, indicative of law, though
one of no simple character.         There can be no reasonable doubt that the
periodic times indicated by the bright lines seen in the spectrum are
those belonging to the component vibrations of the chemical mole
cules themselves ; and the appearance is just such as would be pro
duced by a tolerably complex dynamical system vibrating under the
action of internal forces of restitution.             Now such a system may
really be composed of          two  or   more simpler systems, held together
less firmly than the parte of one of the simpler systems ; and the
complex       vibrations of the whole may be made up of those of
the several simpler systems, modified,              however, by their mutual
connexion, together it may be with others due to the mutual con
nexion of the simpler systems regarded each as a whole.                     It is con
ceivable that relations of chemical composition may thus be pointed
out even between substances which we deem elementary, and which
 from their great stability we may, perhaps, never be able actually to
decompose.
    But  I  must apologise for having taken up your time with specula
tions as to the future ;     I  will turn now to some mention of the action
of your Council during the past year, and of the progress                    made by
committees appointed by the Council.
    In response to an invitation received from the Academy of Sciences
of Paris, that the Society should be represented at the International
Conference of Astronomers, which it was proposed should assemble in
Paris, in the spring, for the purpose of deliberating about concerted
action for obtaining a complete map of the starry heavens by means
of photography, your Council requested the Astronomer Royal to
represent the Society on that occasion.             The conference met, as it
was proposed, last spring, and I believe that the English astrono
mers at least think that a good foundation has been laid for concerted
action in that great undertaking.
    As the Fellows are already aware from a circular which has been
issued, the Council have decided to make a change in the mode of
publication of the 'Philosophical          Transactions.'      The average yearly
volume     is a  good  deal more     bulky  now   than   it was    at the beginning
of the century, and its size is such as not unfrequently to make it
desirable to bind one volume in two. The sciences, moreover, which
are represented        in the ' Philosophical Transactions,' divide them
selves very naturally into two groups : mathematics,                    physics, and
chemistry forming        one,   and   the  biological  sciences     tho  other.   The

two   series^, corresponding to these two divisions, and a yearly volume
will appear in each series.      It is hoped that this arrangement will be
conducive to an earlier publication, as the numeration of the pages in
the two series can go on independently.          The individual papers will
also be issued separately, so that Fellows who prefer receiving them in
this way can have them as soon as they are printed. Moreover, the

    I  am happy to be able to announce that the publication of the
" Challenger " report is now nearly finished.          Twenty -¦eight volumes,
some in two parts, have now been published, and these are all in           the
 Society's library.
    The Krakatoa Committee have now all but completed their labours.
A vast amount of information on the phenomena related to that
most remarkable volcanic explosion has been collected and digested,
different branches of the inquiry having been taken up by differenr
 members of the Committee.          An estimate has been made of the cost
of publication of the report, and the Council has dccided that it
 should be published as a separate work, and has voted the sum re
 quired for publication.        The printing of the volume is now far
 advanced, and in a very few weeks it will in all probability be in the
 hands of the public.
    The reports of the observers of the total solar eclipse of August la>t
year are now coming in. From inquiries I have made I am in hopes
 that they will all be in by the end of the year. It is obviously con
 venient that they should all be dealt with together, rather than
 appear in a scattered form for the sake of a slightly earlier publica
 tion of those which happen to be ready first.
    I mentioned in my last address that with respect to this eclipse the
 Council, acting in accordance with the recommendations of the Eclipse
 Committee, had decided to confine themselves to an expedition to
 Grenada, without attempting another to Benguela on the Western
 Coast of Africa, which if sent out from this country would have been
 a good deal more costly, and of which the success, judging by such
 accounts of the climate of Benguela and its neighbourhood as we could
 procure, seemed very doubtful. The Committee guaranteed, however,
 £100 towards the expense of a small expedition from the,Cape in case
 Her Majesty's Astronomer at that place should be in a condition to
organise one. Sir W. J. Hunt-Grubbe, the Admiral in command at
that station, was prepared to render every assistance in his power.
 Ultimately, however, it was not found practicable to organise an
 expedition from the Cape, and so the English observations of the

 1887.]                      Presidents  A ddress.                      191
eclipse were confined to those taken at Grenada.         I have heard that
the day of the eclipse was fine at Benguela, but there were no astro
nomers of      any nation there to take advantage of it. It may be
doubted, however, whether, in spite of the fineness, the haze which is
said to prevail so much on that coast at that time of year, might not
materially have interfered with the observations.
    The boring in the Delta of the Nile has been continued, by the
favour of the War Office, under the able and zealous superintendence
of Captain Dickinson, R.E.        As I mentioned last year, the Committee
thought it best to concentrate their efforts on a single boring until
rock should be reached, or else a stratum of such a character as to
show that the alluvial or drifted deposit had been got through.        This
result has not at present been obtained.           The boring at Zagazig
reached    the  depth  of 324 feet, when  the tnbe  broke, and stopped for
the time further progress.      It is, however, a matter of interest and
importance to know that the drift or deposit extends to so great a
depth.      Geologists attach so much importance to the prosecution of
the inqniry that at the suggestion of the Delta Committee an appli
cation was made to the Government Grant Committee for a grant of
£500, which was acceded to by the Committee.               This sum would
not suffice for the prosecution of the inquiry to the extent contem
plated; bat it was thought that with such a sum as a nucleus ex
traneous pecuniary assistance might be obtained from Societies or
individuals specially interested in the inquiry, and the Council have
authorised the Delta Committee to avail themselves of such aid.
    The meetings of Council and Committees continue to be very
numerous, and no less than twenty-two               Committees and Sub
 committees have been at work during the session.
    The number of papers communicated to the Society continues to
 increase.    In 1884-5 the number was 93 ; in 1885-6 it was 113 ; and
 in the  past session, 129.
                                                             '
    Since the last Anniversary one complete part of the        Philosophical
 Transactions,' and thirty-two separate papers towards the new volume
 have been published ; the whole comprising no less than 1482 pages
 of letterpress    and seventy-six plates. In the same period twelve
                    '
 numbers of the       Proceedings,' containing 984 pageR, have appeared.
     The task of preparing the MS. of the Catalogue of Scientific
  Papers, decade 1874 to 1883, has proved far heavier than was antici
  pated, and the matter very far exceeds in bulk that of the previous
  decade. The cataloguing of papers from the volumes in our own library
  has long been finished, but the work of gleaning stray papers from
  works in other libraries which we do not possess has proved more
  arduous than was expected, and even now is not quite completed.          It
  is confidently hoped, however, that the MS. will be completed for the
  press during the coming session.

 192                        Anniversary Meeting.               [Nov. 30,
   The distribution and exchange of duplicates from our library,
commenced last session, has been continued, and several defective
series among the periodicals on our shelves have been made good.
The general work of the library has received careful attention at the
hands of Mr. Alfred White, who shortly before the last Anniversary
 was appointed to the office of Assistant Librarian.
   The Copley Medal for the year has been awarded to the eminent
 botanist, your former President, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker.         It is
impossible, within the limits to which    I must confine myself on the
present occasion, to do more than briefly refer to some of the more
salient features of his scientific career, extending as it does over
nearly half a century of unceasing intellectual activity ; and I need
hardly say that in attempting to give some idea of important labours
which lie outside my own studies, I am dependent on the kindness of
 scientific friends.
   As a traveller, he can perhaps only compare with Humboldt in the
extent to which he has used travel as an instrument of research.       To
quote   a remark by Professor Asa Gray,     " No botanist of the present
century, perhaps of any time, has seen more of the earth's vegetation
under natural conditions." His Antarctic voyage in 1839-43 supplied
the material for a series of well-known works of first-rate import
ance on the vegetation of the southern hemisphere ; and these in
 their turn formed the basis of important general discussions. The
journey to India in 1847-51 yielded, in the Himalayan journals, as
 Humboldt has remarked, " a perfect treasure of important observa
tions."     The maps made of the passes into Thibet are even still
unsuperseded.       The fine work on the " Sikkim Rhododendrons " was
at once a revelation to the botanist and to the horticulturist.       His
account of the glacial phenomena of the Himalayas supplied facts
 both to Darwin and to Lyell.      A journey to Morocco in 1871 and a
later visit to North America led to important conclusions on plant
distribution.
   Perhaps Sir Joseph Hooker's most important place in scientific
history will be found in the rational basis upon which he placed
geographical botany.        De Candolle, while admitting the continuity
of existing floras with those preceding them in time, still adhered in
principle to the multiple origin of species.     To quote a remark by
                          "
Professor Asa Gray— De Candolle's great work closed one epoch in
the history of the subject, and Hooker's name is the first that appears
in the ensuing one." According to Lyell, " the abandoument of the
old received doctrine of the 'immutability of species ' was accelerated
in England by the appearance in 1859 of Dr. Hooker's ' Essay on the
Flora of Anstralia.'"        This Essay effected a revolution.    It was
quickly followed in 1860 by the classical essay on the    " Distribution
of Arctic Plants," and in 180G by the Nottingham Lecture on Insular

1887,]                     President's Address.                     193
Floras.     The fact of widely dissevered localities for species, -which
De Candolle    found an insuperable obstacle to abandoning the doctrine
of multiple origin, has, in the hands of Hooker and A. Gray (as stated
by Bentham), afforded the most convincing proof of the genetic
relationship of the floras of which such species are components.
   In systematic botany, Hooker has perhaps had no rival since
Robert Brown.       The "Genera Plantarum," the joint work of himself
and   his friend Bentham,  and the " Flora Indica," to the completion of
which our colleague is devoting the leisure of a well-earned retire
ment, form only as it were the head of an immense body of taxonomic
 memoirs.
   Nor have his services to botanical science been confined to geo
graphical botany and to taxonomy.      His researches on various groups,
such as Welwitschia and others, deal in a masterly way with morpho
logical problems of the highest interest and of extreme difficulty.
   While no one would attempt to minimise the commanding            and
unique position of Mr. Darwin, the scientific historian of the future
 will recognise how much the development of the modern theory of
evolution, from its first conception in the mind of Mr. Darwin, was
facilitated by the interaction upon one another of the work and minds
of Darwin, Hooker, and Lyell. It was due to the earnest efforts of his
 two friends that Mr. Darwin was induced to publish the first sketch
of the origin of species at all.   And no one, had he been alive, would
have more cordially recognised than Mr. Darwin how vast au armoury
of facts the wide botanical experience of Hooker constantly placed at
his disposal in fortifying and supporting his main position.
   Of the two Royal Medals, it is customary, though it is not an in
variable rule, to award one for mathematics or physics, and the other
for biological science.
   The medal which, in accordance with the usual rule, has been de
voted to mathematics and physics, has this year been awarded to
Colonel A. Clarke for his comparison of standards of length, and
determination of the figure of the earth.
   Colonel Clarke was for some twenty-five years the scientific and
mathematical     adviser for the Ordnance Survey, and whilst acting in
that capacity he became known to the whole scientific world as
possessing a unique knowledge and power in dealing with the complex
questions which arise in the science of geodesy.
   His laborious comparison ot the standards of length, carried out
under General Sir Heury James, R.E., are universally regarded as
models of scientific precision.
   His determination of the ellipticity and dimensions of the earth
from the great arcs of meridian and longitude involved a very high
mathematical ability and an enormous amount cf labour.          The con
clusion at which he arrived removed an apparent discrepancy between

194                       Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
the results of pendulum experiments find those derived from geodesy,
and is generally accepted as the best approximation hitherto attained
as to the figure of the earth.
   The accounts of these invesfigations have been published in a
number of memoirs, several of which have been communicated to the
Royal Society.
   In 1880 he published a book on Geodesy, which, besides giving an
accurate account of that science, embodies the main results of the
work of his life.
   In the biological division of the sciences the Royal Medal has this
year been awarded to Professor Heury N. Moseley for his numerous
researches in animal morphology, and especially his investigations on
Corals and on Peripatus.
   The result of his elaborate investigations on corals, an account of
which has been published in the ' Philosophical Transactions,' was to
show that the Milleporidas and the Stylasteridae were not, as had been
thought, Anthozoan in nature, but were composite coral-forming
hydroids. Many new genera and species were described by him in
these memoirs, and in fact not merely was a new group of organisms,
the Hydrocorallinae, indicated, but the complete morphology and
systematic subdivisions of that order were worked out.
   Moseley's memoir on Peripatus is not less remarkable. He was
the first to point out the true nature of this remarkable animal, and
to demonstrate that it was in reality an archaic Arthropod.      The sub
sequent investigations of Balfour and Sedgwick have further increased
the importance of Moseley's discovery.
   Moseley's memoir on the Land Planarians of Ceylon (' Phil.
Trans.,' 1872) is an important contribution to the anatomy of the
Turbellaria.    He was the first to apply the method of section-cutting
to the Planarians, and his paper is full of new facts of great import
ance, which have stood the test of subsequent work over the same
ground.
                                                          '
   Besides these three   great memoirs published in the     Philosophical
Transactions,'   Moseley has published numerous minor discoveries,
and his spectroscopic observations on the colouring matters of marine
organisms have proved the starting-point of valuable investigations.
   Mention must not be omitted of Moseley's admirable book, 'Notes
of a Naturalist on the " Challenger," ' which has been justly com
pared, for the varied ability, interest, and activity which it evinces on
the part of the author, to Darwin's
                                       '               "           '
                                         Voyage of the Beagle."
   Since the date of the works above referred to, Moseley has been
chiefly active in the discharge of his duties as Linacre Professor, and
the success with which he has directed the work of his pupils is
evinced by the important memoirs on zoological subjects which several
of them have produced whilst working under his direction.          He has

 1887.]                Election  of Council and  Officers.              195
 himself  also published a remarkable discovery with regard to the
Chitons.     In the shells of many genera and species of these molluscs
 he has detected highly developed eyes, of which he has described the
minute structure.
   The Davy Medal for the year 1832 was awarded by the Council to
Professors Mendelejeff and Lothar Meyer conjointly,
                                                                " For their
 Discovery of the Periodic Relations of the Atomic Weights."           This
relation, now known as the          " Periodic Law," has attracted great
attention on the part of chemists, and has even enabled Professor
Mendelejeff to predict the properties of elements at the time un
known, but since discovered, such as Gallium for instance.
   But while recognising the merits of chemists of other nations we
are not to forget our own countrymen ; and accordingly the Davy
Medal for the present year has been awarded to Mr. John A. R.
Newlands for his discovery of the Periodic Law of the Chemical
Elements.      Though in the somewhat less complete form in which
the law was enunciated by him, it did not at the time attract the
attention of chemists, still in so far as the work of the two foreign
chemists above mentioned was anticipated, the priority belongs to
Mr. Newlands.
   The Statutes relating to the election      of Council and Officers were
then read, and      Professor Clifton and General Walker having been,
with the consent of the Society, nominated Scrutators, the votes of

                             October 31, 1887.
   The    operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park.
Richmond,     Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
constituted as follows :
                       Mr. Warren de la Rue, Chairman.
   Captain   W. de W. Abney, R.E.        Admiral Sir G. H.           Richards,
   Prof. W. G. Adams.                       K.C.B.
   Staff-Commander E.        W. Creak,   The Earl of Rosse.

   Mr. P. Galton.                        General J. T. Walker, C.B.
   The Committee regret to announce            the   death,   in July last, of
their late member, Lieut.-General       W.  J. Smythe,   R.A.     He had held
a seat  upon the Committee since 1871, but for some years past, owing
to his residence    in Ireland, he had not been able to take part in their
meetings.
   The work      at the Observatory may be considered           under the fol
lowing heads    :—
   1st.  Magnetic observations.
   2nd. Meteorological observations.
   3rd. Solar observations.
   4th. Experimental, in connexion with any of the above                depart
           ments.
   5th. Verification    of instruments.
   6th.  Rating   of  Watches   and Marine Chronometers.
   7th. Miscellaneous.
                          I. Magnetic Observations.
   Throughout the past year the magnetographs have worked in a
 satisfactory manner, and the usual determinations of the scale values
 of all the instruments were made in January last.
    Owing to the gradual secular change of Declination the distance
 between the dote of light upon the cylinder of the magnetometer had
 become too   small   ior satisfactory registration,  and   in consequence    it

  212                     Report    of the Kew    Committee.
  was found necessary to re-adjust the instrument by altering slightly
  the inclination of the mirror attached to the magnet.
     The values of the ordinates of the different photographic curvei
  determined     then were  as  follows   : —
                Declination  : 1  inch=0o 22'-04.     1 cm.=0o 8'7.
     Bifilar, January 10, 1887, for      1  inch 2H=0-0255 foot grain unit.
                                      „  1  cm. „ =0-00046 C.G.S. unit.
     Balance,   January 11, 1887 „       1  inch eV=0-0281 foot grain unit.
                                      „  1   cm. „ =0-00051 C.G.S. unit.
     In  the case  of the bifilar magnetometer it was also found necessary
  to re-adjust the instrument, at the same time its sensibility was
. slightly altered, after which the scale value was again determined
  with the following result : —
      Bifilar, January 18, 1887, for      1  inch «H=0-0280 foot grain unit.
                                      „   1  cm.   „ =0-00051 C.G.S. unit.
     With regard to magnetic          disturbances, no very exceptional move
   ments have been registered during the year.
      The principal oscillations, however, were recorded on the following
   date3 : November 2 to 6, 1886 ; February 13 and 14, April 5 to 7,
   August 2, and September 26 and 27, 1887.                  Much interest was
   evinced in the curve for February 23, which registered the occurrence
   of an earthquake.
      In February last new adjusting screws were fitted to one of the
   microscopes attached to the Kew dip-circle No. 33.
      Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and
   various data have been supplied to Professor Mascart, Professor
   Adams, Dr. Atkinson, Professor Schering, Dr. Rijckevorsel, and
   Messrs. Archbutt and Stanley.
      Professors Riicker and Thorpe visited the Observatory in January
   last, and made a series of base observations, prior to their departure
   for Ireland to finish their magnetic survey of the British Isles, which
   was commenced in 1883.           On returning to England a further series
   of observations    were  made    at  Kew in October in order to complete
   the survey.
       The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
   made as usual, and the results are given in the tables forming
   Appendix     I of this Report.
       The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations
    made during the year : —
            Determinations of Horizontal Intensity                   28
                    „              Inclination                      110

                        Report   of the Kew Committee.                   213
   Several additional sets of observations     of Absolute Declination have
been    made with the view        of investigating certain changes in the
values of the torsional effect of the suspending thread upon the deter
mination of the true position of the magnet employed.
    The magnetograph       curves made use of in the preparation of the
tables   of diurnal range of Declination (see Appendix, Table      III) have
been drawn from the original photographs by means of an eidograph
kindly lent by Captain W.        J. L. Wharton, F.R.S., the Hydrographer.
    Magnetic Reductions.    — At  the request of Professor  Balfour Stewart,
 F.R.S., copies of the       Kew declination disturbances for the years
 1858-1865, together with the daily wind values for the years 1858 to
1869, have been made and forwarded to him; the Rev. S. J. Perry has
also received copies     of the records of certain selected days of magnetic
disturbance for 1886.
    Krakatoa Eruption. — In May last, at the request of the Krakatoa
Committee of the Royal Society, a memorandum was prepared for
that body on the magnetic effects recorded at the various observatories
over the globe which occurred at the time of the great explosion of
 August 27, 1883, in the Straits of Sunda.
    Magnetic Stations.   — A list of all known magnetic stations has been
prepared jointly by General Sir J. H. Lefroy and the Superintendent
for publication by the Committee of the British Association on
 magnetic reductions, and will be published in the Annual Report for
the current year.
    It contains references to all localities on the surface of the globe
 where    continuous observations of terrestrial magnetism have been
 made   for periods of at least one month in duration, and gives, together
with the geographical position of the stations, references to the publi
 cations where the results of such observations are to be found, as well
 as the names of the authorities, whenever these could be ascertained.
    Falmouth Magnetographs. — At the request of the Secretary of tho
 Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, the specifications for the magneto-
 graphs supplied to the Falmouth Observatory last year, which were
 drawn up by Mr. Whipple, have been revised and printed with illus
 trations in the Annual Report of that Society for 188G.
    Sectional Lines. — In addition to the sectional lines obtained for the
 purpose of plotting down magnetic observations on the international
 scale, as suggested by General Sir J. H. Lefroy, and as mentioned in
 last report, the Committee have had a number of copies struck off
 from the stone on tracing paper for the use of observers who may
 desire to make tracings of existing curves on the same scale.

wind (direction and velocity), bright sunshine, and rain, have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year.
   The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic
records have been duly registered during the year, together with the
daily observations in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service
synchronous system.            A summary of these observations is given in
Appendix    II.
   The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly
carried on, and copies of these, as well as of the eye observations,
with notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine have been transmitted
to the Meteorological Office.
   The following is a summary of the number of meteorological obser
vations made during the past year : —

   In  compliance       with a request made by the Meteorological Council
to the    Committee,       Mr. "Whipple visited and inspected during his
vacation the Observatories at Falmouth and Valencia, and the Anemo
graph at Mountjoy Barracks, Dublin.
   Mr. Baker also visited the Aberdeen and Stony hurst Observatories
for the purpose of inspection.
   With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to, and
published by
                     '
                       The Times ' and ' The Torquay Directory.'            Data
have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological
                             '
 Society, the editor of        Symons's Mouthly Meteorological Magazine,'
the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers, Captain Ab-ey,
Messrs. Gwilliam, Rowland, and others.              The cost of these abstracts
is borne by the recipienta.
   The standard barometer (Adie 657) was fixed in the magnetograpb
room adjacent to the barograph, and read five times daily at observa
tion hours, in order to compare its indications with those of the
standard barometer in another part of the building.

                      Report    of the Kew Committee.                 215
    Readings were continuously made from January 1 to July last, and
are now under discussion.
    Turf has been laid down under the screen of the thermograph with
a view to avoiding effects of radiation as much as possible.
    The use of meteorological self-recording instruments having been
partially discontinued at Armagh, Mr. Whipple dismounted and
packed the barograph and thermograph, and they have been returned
for storage to the Observatory.
    Electrograph. — The new quadrant electrometer, constructed on Mr.
de la Rue's principle, with Professor Clifton's improvements, together
with a chloride of silver battery of 60 cells, for the purpose of main
taining the potential of the quadrants at a certain point, gave great
satisfaction during the year, and was found to bo a marked improve
ment upon the older form of the instrument.
    On September 2, during a high wind, a part of the instrument was
accidentally set on fire by the gas-burner, and the apparatus narrowly
escaped destruction.
    Before re-starting the instrument it is proposed to make some
 minor alterations, suggested by experience, in the recording appara
 tus, &c.
    The portable Thomson electrometer (White No. 53) having been
 put in thorough order, lias been lent, in accordance with instructions
 received    from the Meteorological Council, to the Hon. Ralph
 Abercromby, for the purpose of making observations on the Peak of
 Teneriffe.
    Mr. Abercromby visited the Observatory for the purpose of fami
 liarising himself with the use of the instrument, the scale value
 having previously been redetermined, by the kindness of the Chair
 man, at his laboratory in Portland Place.
                           III. Solar Observations.
    The sketches of Sun-spots, as seen projected on the photoholiograph
 screen, have been made on 180 days, in order to continue Schwabe's
  enumeration, the results being given in Appendix II, Table IV.
     Transit Observations.  — 347 observations of solar and 80 of sidereal
  transits have been taken, for the purpose of keeping correct local time
  at the  Observatory, and the clocks and chronometers have been com
  pared daily.
     The following clocks, French, Shelton K. O., Slielton 35, and the
  chronometers, Molyneux No. 2125, Breguet No. 3140, and Arnold 80,
  are kept carefully rated as time-keepers at the Observatory.
     The meau-time clock, Dent 2011, was bolted to the wall of the
  chronometer-room for use in daily comparisons with the chronometers
  on trial.
                                                                r 2

   Old   Solar  Observations. — The library of    the Observatory has
received a present from Wm. J. Davies, Esq.,    of a MS. volume of sun-
spot observations made at Edmonton, Middlesex, from August, 1819,
to March, 1823. It is intended to enumerate the spots after the
 Schwabe method, so as to carry the Observatory catalogue of the new
groups of sun-spots back to 1819.
   Kew Solar Photographs. — At the request of the Chairman, the MS.
sun-spot measurements and reductions from February, 1862, to
December, 1863, together with the tables for computing the spotted
positions, as well as the Kew working catalogues from 1864 to 1872.
have been forwarded to Mr. A. L. Soper for the purpose of further
discussion.
                       IV.   Experimental   Work.
   Photo-nephograph. — The cameras used in cloud photography having
been put in order, and had new adjustable rapid shutters fitted, were
again brought into use, and by request of the Meteorological Council
24 sets of photographs comprising 90 negatives were taken on 14
days, chief attention being directed to the photographing of high cirrus
clouds.
   Prints of all the pictures have been made on cyanotype paper,
which together with the observational data have been transferred to
the Meteorological Office for the reduction and computation of cloud
heights and velocities, Professor Stokes's cloud projection apparatus
having also been transferred there for the purpose.
   Solar Radiation. — The observations of the black bulb thermometers
in vacuo made during 1886 were reduced and discussed, and the
results found to be no more satisfactory than those obtained in pre
vious years, the vacua in all of the instruments having deteriorated,
and their readings having become lowered during the time they were
under observation, whilst the readings differed considerably amongst
themselves.
   The Chairman having undertaken to submit the tubes to a lengthy
exhaustion, three instruments were fitted with new jackets and sealed
on to the air-pump in his laboratory.
   They were there exhausted almost daily, the atmospheric pressure
being reduced to and maintained at about 0-06 |\/| from April to the end
of September.    On October 1st they were removed from the laboratory
and replaced on the stand at the Observatory, having been read daily
ever since.
   Large differences are still found to exist in the readings of the
similar and similarly placed instruments.
   Pendulum Experiments. — The Indian Pendulum Apparatus, returned
from the United States by Professor Peirce, was put up in the pen
dulum room specially erected for its accommodation in the South Hall

                      Report  of the  Kew Committee.                  217
of the  Observatory, and certain preliminary swings made in the pre
sence of both General Walker and Colonel Heaviside, R.E., which
sufficed to show that the apparatus had not undergone any material
changes since it left Kew in 1881.
   It was, however, found that the vacuum chamber had received such
structural damage in transit as to render it incapable of exhaustion to
a sufficiently high degree to make the observations comparable with
those previously made by Captains Basevi and Heaviside.            It was
accordingly returned to the maker, Mr. Adie, of London, for thorough
repair, and has recently been again erected in its place, and found in
a very satisfactory condition, so that the required preliminary obser
vations may now be re-commenced.
   By the kindness of Mr. W. H. Preece, F.R.S., the Committee were
favoured with the loan of a recording chronograph for use in register
ing the coincidences.      Experience proved that it was unnecessary,
and the apparatus has since been returned to the General Post Office.
   At the suggestion of Colonel Heaviside, photographs of the invaria
ble pendulums were obtained on their removal from their cases after
travelling, in order that a memorandum might be preserved of their
figure and shape on their return to the Kew Observatory.
                      V. Verification of Instruments.
    The following magnetic instruments have been purchased on com
mission and their constants determined : —
        An Inclinometer for the Tokio University, Japan.
        An Inclinometer for the Mauritius Observatory.
        1 Collimating Magnet for Professor F. Brioschi, Rome.
        2   Collimating Magnets and an Inclinometer for Professor
           Naccori, Turin University, Italy.
        1  Magnet for declination and a pair of Inclinometer needles
           for Lisbon Observatory.
    The total  number of other instruments compared in the past year
 was as  follows : —

   Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 75 cases.
   The number of instruments rejected on account of excessive
 error, or which from other causes did not record with sufficient
 accuracy, was as follows : —
         Thermometers, clinical                                  64
                 „        ordinary meteorological                50
         Various                                                232
     5  Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated, and supplied
 to 4 societies and individuals during the year.
    There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification,
 21 Barometers, 462 Thermometers, 2 Hydrometers, and 10 Sextants.
    The Committee, after considering the question of certifying the
 various and numerous classes of instruments on the hydrometer prin
 ciple, have authorised the Superintendent of the Observatory to refuse
 to verify any instruments except such as either indicate specific
 gravities directly or whose indications bear a known and well-defined
 relation to specific gravities.
    Several patterns of range-finders, for use both at sea and on shore,
 have also been tested ; two additional movable adjustable collimators
 with scales having been fitted to the sextant testing apparatus, to
 enable it to be used for this purpose.

                     Report  of  the Kew Committee.                   219
   Aneroid Altitude Scales. — The Committee have also had their atten
tion called to the fact that several scales are in use for graduating the
scales of heights upon the dials of aneroids.     Upon consideration tho
Committee recommend as desirable the employment of Sir G. B. Airy's
scale, published in 1867, and the equivalent metric scale, in all cases
where possible.
   Two highly sensitive aneroids with Bourdon tubes substituted for
the ordinary corrugated vacuum boxes, constructed by MM. Richard,
Freres, of Paris, have been examined for constancy at the request of
the Meteorological Council.     It was found, however, that the metal
of the tubes underwent changes similar to those experienced by the
usual aneroid boxes, and the instruments were therefore liable to the
same errors as the common aneroid.
   A Beckley Rain Gauge was obtained, fitted with a Stonyhurst dis
charger, and, after due trial, sent to the Mauritius Observatory, where
an opportunity will be afforded of noting the behaviour of the im
proved instrument during tropical rains.
   Hygrometers. — Dr. Doberck, the Director of the Hong Kong Obser
vatory, having obtained a Royal Society grant for the purpose of
re-calcalaling Hygrometric tables, Mr. Whipple procured and for
warded to him examples of Alluard's, Crova's, and Dines' instruments,
after making preliminary observations at Kew.
   Hot Springs. — Mr. G. J. Symons, F.R.S., having received a grant
from the Goverument Grant Fund of the Royal Society, for the pur
pose of investigating the temperatures of certain hot springs in the
South of France and the Pyrenees, had a number of specially pre
pared thermometers carefully verified at the Observatory, both before
and after he had made use of them abroad.
   Anemometer Constants. — At the request of Colonel Knight, F.R.
Met. Soc., a number of comparisons with the standard Anemometer
were made of a small Robinson's Anemometer he had constructed,
having cups fitted to arms of variable length, and the moving parts
provided with friction rollers.
   Anemographs. — Mr. Whipple has, at the request of the Imperial
 Chinese Customs, superintended the construction of a new Beckley
 Anemograph for use at Formosa, as well as a similar instrument for
 Dr. A. S. Viegas, of the Coimbra Observatory, and two smaller
instruments for the Meteorological Council.
   Navy Telescopes. — By the kindness of the Astronomer Royal the
 Kew Observatory has been favoured with descriptions of the tests
 applied to Navy telescopes supplied by contractors to H.M. Service,
 and also with descriptions of the apparatus employed at the Royal
 Observatory, Greenwich, for applying the tests.
   A standard Admiralty telescope has been purchased, and the neces
 sary appliances are now being constructed, with the view of enabling

220                     Report  of the Kew     Committee.
the Committee to apply similar tests to telescopes submitted          to them
for verification by opticians and others.
                          VI. Rating of      Watches.
   The    arrangements for rating watches mentioned in previous
Reports have been carried on during the year with continued success,
and up to the present 1344 watches have been examined and reported
upon.
   510 entries of watches      were     made as contrasted    with 490 during
the corresponding period of last year.            They were sent for testing,
in the following classes : —
             For class A, 463   ;   class B, 25 ;  and class C, 22.
Of these 1 74 failed to gain any certificate ; 19 passed in C, 21 in B,
296 in A, and 13 of the latter obtained the highest possible form of
certificate, the class  A especially good.
   In Appendix      III  will be found statements       giving the results of
trial of the 26 watches which obtained the highest numbers of marks
during the year, the premier position being attained — with 881 marks
— by a keyless, double-roller, going-barrel watch, submitted by Jos.
White, Earlsdon, Coventry.
   This total exceeds that of last year, and it is also extremely satis
factory to note that a very marked increase has taken place in the
number of watches which have gained more than 80 marks.
   As some inconvenience was caused by the employment of tempo
rary expedients to maintain the large watch-safe at an average of
                 " middle-                 "
65° F. for the              temperature      test, a burner was procured and
fitted up with a shield, and the safe can now be kept at the desired
point, whilst at the same time no deleterious fumes of coal-gas can
penetrate into the interior chamber.
    The three rating safes are therefore now maintained by means of
gas and ice at practically the three constant temperatures of 40°, 65°,
 and 90° F. respectively, all the year round.
    Special attention continues to be given to the examination of pocket
chronographs, in accordance with the request of the Cyclists' Union.
    Hating of Chronometers. — Since the institution of chronometer
trials, as mentioned in last year's Report, 27 movements have been
examined, and certificates        issued giving the mean daily rate and
 variation of rate at each change of temperature.
    The trial occupies 35 days, divided into 5 periods of 6 days each,
 and 5 intermediate days, namely, 1 day at the commencement of each
period of test : —

   Certificates are    granted to chronometers which have undergone
35   days'   test as specified above, and whose performance is such
that :—
   1.   The mean of the differences     in each stage of the examination,
between (a) the average daily rate during that period, and (6) the
several daily rates, does not exceed one second in any one of the
stages.
   2.   The mean daily rate has not been affected by change of tem
perature more than one-sixth of a second per 1° F., which is about
a quarter of a second per 1° C.
   3. The mean daily rate has not exceeded ten seconds in any stage
pf the test.
   A Kullberg's temperature regulator       has been fitted by the maker to
the   chronometer oven, and a Richard         thermograph is also arranged
to work in the case with the chronometers,          affording a continuous
record of the temperatures which they have experienced during the
whole of their trial.
   The range of temperature from 55° to 85° F., to which the marine
chronometers are submitted, has been decided upon after careful
 consideration, as being amply sufficient for determining the behaviour
 of chronometers under conditions to which they are usually exposed
 at sea, and no serious objections have yet been received from makers
 or others to the adoption of the above range.
                              VII. Miscellaneous.
    PJwtographic Paper, Sfc. — This has been supplied to the Observa
 tories at Coimbra, Colaba, Falmouth, Lisbon, Mauritius, Stonyhurst,
 and Toronto.      It has also been supplied to the Meteorological Office,
 the U.S. Navy Department, and others.
    Anemograph sheets have, in addition, been forwarded to Madras,
 and blank forms for the entry of observations to several persons.
    Extension of Building. — The Committee having decided on building
 an additional floor on the east wing of the Observatory, for the pur
 pose of providing increased space for carrying on the Observatory
 work, now very much cramped, have obtained from the Council the
 promise of a loan of £200 if needed.
    Application has therefore been made to the Chief Commissioner of
  Works and Public Buildings for permission to proceed with the work,
  but the  reply granting leave has not yet been received.

222                      Report of the Kew Committee.
   Mr. Whipple has recently designed two new simple forms of maxi
mum pressure anemometers, which he exhibited before the Royal
Meteorological Society, and described in a paper read on April 20th.*
They were also shown at the Falmonth Exhibition of the Royal
Cornwall Polytechnic Society in September.
   Stevenson's Screen. — The Stevenson's screen fixed on the lawn was
blown over during the gale of September 2nd last, but fortunately the
injury done by the accident was very trivial, as the screen was not in
use at the time.
   Exhibitions. — Photographic curves and pictures have been by
request shown at the Exhibition at Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the
Royal Jubilee Exhibition, Manchester.
   Library. — During the year the library has received as presents the
publications of—
   26   Scientific  Societies and Institutions of Great Britain and Ire
         land, and
   98 Foreign      and Colonial Scientific         Establishments,       as well as
         numerous private individuals ;
the   special  thanks of the Committee being due to Dr. Neumayer,
the Director of the Deutsche Seewarte, Hamburg, for a complete
set of the publications of that establishment since 1876.
   Workshop. — The machine tools procured for the use of the Kew
Observatory by grants from the Goverument Grant Fund or the
 Donation Fund, have been kept in thorough order.
   House, Grounds, and Footpath. — These have all been kept in order
during the year.
                            Personal Establishment.
   The Rtaff employed is       as  follows : —
      G. M. Whipple, B.Sc., Superintendent.
      T. W. Baker, Chief Assistant.
      H. McLaughlin, Librarian.
      E. G. Constable, Observations and Rating.

   Long. 0h lm 15'1   W.Jor the year October 1886 to September 1887.
   The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnets 101 B and N E being employed for
the purpose.
   The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33, the
needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3^ inches in length.
   The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
   These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the nnit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0-46108.
   By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure aro also given.
   The value of log itK employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at tem
perature 60" F.
   The induction-coefficient   ft.   is
                                  0*000194.
   The correction of the magnetic power for temperature              to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F.        is
              0-0001194(io-35)    0-000,000,213(^-35)'.

  The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former     placed at the divisions of the deflection-
                               is
bar marked 1-0 foot and 13 feet, are 1-000075 feet and 1-300097 feet
respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from
the mean of 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet           in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
of the suspension-thread    subsequently.
   No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc          of
vibration, these being always very small.
   The value of the constant         P,
                                 employed in the formula of reduction
  In   each observation    of absolute Declination the instrumental   read
ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected
1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the orientation
of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, has been carefully
determined.
   The observations have been made and reduced by Mr. T. W. Baker.

I. " On the Bone in Crocodilia which is commonly regarded as
        the Os Pubis, and its representative among the Extinct
        Reptilia."    By H. G. Seelet, F.R.S., Professor of Geo

    Normally three elements enter into the construction of the pelvic
girdle, each of which unites with the other two, and contributes to the
formation of the acetabulum for the femur. The ilium and ischium
are always more or less ossified, but sometimes the pubis remains
represented by cartilage throughout life. Among the Amphibia the
 pubis is often in this cartilaginous state in its living representatives,
so that only two bones and a cartilage usually contribute to form tho
articular cup for the femur.      Among Urodeles the pubic cartilage is
 perforated by a foramen, which corresponds with the foramen in the
 ossified pubis of a lizard, and appears to carry the obturator nerve ; so
 that its identification with the pubis is established. But the pubis and
 ischium are often connate ; by which term I designate that embryonic
 state in which no division of the primitive cartilage into separate
 elements has occurred.     It is not quite so evident that the similarly
 placed cartilage in certain Anura is homologous with that of Urodeles,
 since it is not perforated in the same way ; and it becomes smaller in
 aged specimens by the ischium encroaching upon it.         It is absent in

 the genus     Hyla  ; such absence, considered        with the presence of    a pubis
 in Dactylethra, would support the conclusion that the puhis and ilium
 are connate     in Anura.
    In the young of Crocodilia the same three elements contribute to
 the formation of the articular cup for the femur, the ilium above, the
 ischium behind, and a cartilage in front.
    Professor Hoffmann* regarded this cartilage as the pubis, and then
 the bone which is anterior to it, and had previously been identified as
 the pubis, became the pre-pubis.
    Professor Huxley questioned this identification, and regarded the
 bone as the ossified part, and the cartilage apparently as the unossified
portion of the pubic element of the pelvis.f                 This cartilage is well
 known to decrease in dimensions with the age of the crocodile, but it
 does not disappear by augmenting the extent of the supposed pubic
bone ; though if it were really a pubic cartilage, its ossification should
 cause the anterior bony element to extend into the acetabulum.                    But
 instead of disappearing in this way, ossification has the effect of contin
 uing to exclude the supposed pubic bone from the acetabulum ; so that
the cartilage in the young animal does not give rise to a separate osseous
 element in the adult, but disappears by so ossifying as to approximate
the ischium and ilium. At first there is a gap between the ischium and
ilium anteriorly, which the cartilage fills, but eventually in old animals
these bones almost meet each other, and the cartilage is ossified.               Thus
in the adult animal the acetabulum is formed by two bones, one being
the ilium, and the other in the position otherwise occupied by the
ischium and pubis. Therefore it follows, either (1) that the pubic
cartilage, if originally distinct in the young, becomes incorporated
by ossification with the ilium and ischium ; or that (2) the pubis in
crocodiles does not enter into the acetabulum, but is a pre-acstabular
ossification.     I am aware of no exception to the law that the pubis
contributes to the os innominatum when it has a separate existence,
and therefore it seems to me more probable to suppose that ischium
and pubis should be connate, like the same elements in some sala
manders, and undivided, than that crocodiles should so differ in plan
of the skeleton, as to have the pubis removed from connexion with
the ilium, and from the acetabulum.              If the former view prevails, then
the acetabular cartilage in crocodiles is never a pubic cartilage, but
only the unossified part of the ilium or ischio-pubic bone which

clear on this point.     He says (p. 398) " It is the osseous portions of the pubes
which are commonly described as the entire bone."        " These apparently anomalous
elements of the pelris are readily moveable upon their fibro-cartilaginous connexions
with the acetabulum.      But in   no   essential respect do they differ from ordinary
pubes."

enters into the acetabulum in crocodiles,       it must be found in the
anterior process of what   is commonly   named    the ischium, which fills
the anterior corner of the pelvic basin.      And since no exception to

Huxley in regarding    Professor  Hoffmann's   identification of the pelvic
acetabular cartilage as the pubis as untenable.
  Professor Hoffmann regards the bone which               commonly identified

as the pubis as being the pre-pubis.*           Professor Huxley, on the other
hand, regards         as being a portion of the pubis, and bases his iden
                         it
tification mainly on the relations of this bony element to the pelvic
muscles.     There        an  ispriori objection to the latter interpretation,

such      condition

bone corresponds   in position with the pre-pubic bone of Ornithosaurs,
which is always developed on the anterior pubic border towards the
acetabulum, at some distance from the pubic symphysis.        The extinct
allies of the Crocodilia may throw some light upon the nature of this
ossification.
   First, in the Teleosauria the bone is mnch more slender and less
expanded at its anterior end, in all the species from the Lias aud
Lower Oolitic rocks. The diminution ia size of the bone in Oxford
clay representatives of the group is more marked, and in some unde-
scribed types in the collection of A. Leeds, Esq., is reduced to a mere
bony style without any expansion at either end, comparable in form
and substance to a lucifer match. One stage more of diminished deve
lopment would obliterate the bone altogether, but no sach condition
has yet been discovered.        It has the same osseous attachment as in
Crocodilia, and the ischio-pubic bone is of the same type in Teleo
sauria as in Crocodiles.
   In the Ornithosauria the plan of the pelvis is different. First,
there is the complete ossification of the three constituent bones, with
the ilium prolonged in front of the acetabulum as well as behind it,
the ischium and pubis united by symphysis, and all three bones contri
buting to form the imperforate acetabulum. Secondly, there is a pre-
pubic ossification in front of the pubis, with a narrow attachment below
the acetabulum. These pre-pubic bones vary in form in the different
genera.    In Dimorphodon they are triangular; in Cycuorhamphus
they are shaped like a capital ^f, and so expanded anteriorly that

bones of the two sides are united together into a transverse bow-
shaped bar.     Other modifications are found in the group, bnt the
most common are approximations to the form of the pre-pubic bones
of crocodiles.   Since these bones have the same relations to the
pubes which the pre-pubic bones of crocodiles exhibit, I regard them
as being homologous, and if the distal part of the Ornithosanrian

 pubis were not developed, the homology would be supported by a
similar plan of pelvic construction.
   Finally, there is some evidence that a similar structure is developed
in the abdominal region of the allies of Iguanodon, without being
in direct union with the pelvis.                    As long since as 1841 Dr.
Mantell,   F.R.S., figured in the           '                                 '

fig. 2) an undetermined Wealden bone, which is now in the British
 Museum, registered as No. 2218.               It is not quite perfect, but is sug
gestively similar to the pre-pubic bones of Ornithosaurs.                     A thick
sutural surface shows that it met a similar bone iu the median line.
Subsequently Mr. S. H. Beckles, F.R.S., obtained another specimen
into which two such bones entered as constituents, which was exhi
bited during the British Association Meeting at Brighton, in 1872,
and ultimately described and figured by Mr. J. W. Hulke, F.B.S.*
   Bones, like that figured by Mantell, have long been in the British
Museum.        And Professor Cope has figured a pair of similar bones in
Diclonius mirabilis.f        Mr. Enlke interpreted Mr. Beckles' specimen
as consisting of the clavicles and interclavicle. Mr. W. Davies, F.G.S.,
had interpreted the isolated bones like Mantell's No. 2218, as clavicles,
and his determination had been accepted by Professor 0. C. Marsh ;
so that nntil M. Dollo regarded            them as parts of the sternum they
had been regarded as clavicles. Dr. George Baur, of Yale College, sub
sequently in 1885J suggested that the supposed sternal apparatus of
Iguanodon should be turned round, so that the supposed clavicles
would become posterior processes of the sternum, and this view has
been supported by Cope and adopted by myself.                     I suppose that the
interpretation of the Beckles specimen was a consequence of its con
dition of preservation, by which fractures came to simulate sutures.
Those fractures which are assumed to limit the clavicles, so as to
allow the supposed interclavicle to extend between them, follow very
different courses from the natural limits of the bones.                  If Mantell's
fossil already referred to is superimposed upon Mr. Beckles' spe
cimen, then it is manifest that the broad part of the specimen is made
up of two such bones which meet by median suture, and extend for
two-thirds the length of the specimen.                  Some trace of the trans
verse suture may perhaps be seen which separates these bones from a
thin ossification which extends beyond them.                 Hence there can be no
interclavicle between the supposed clavicles ; and the evidence for the
identification of the clavicles disappears.                 Turning the specimen
so that the supposed clavicles point posteriorly, they will be found
to make a remarkable             approximation in form to the pre-pubic

bo-es of the crocodile. Professor Huxley* figured the ventral aspect
of a Crocodilus acutus at about the close of embryonic life, in
which a considerable fibrous development was found anterior to each
pre-pubic bone. This condition varies with age. In a large adult
crocodile from Abyssinia, in the British Museum, the fibro-cartilages
anterior to the pre-pubic bones are united in the mesial line, ante
riorly, so as to form one mass. A similar condition is seen in
younger specimens.       And if such a structure were sufficiently ossified
to be preserved in a fossil state, it would closely reproduce the form of
the anterior portion of Mr. Beckles' fossil, while the marks of lateral
attachment in this part of the fossil correspond with the grooves for
the last pair of abdominal ribs.        Therefore I regard this specimen as
probably representing in the Iguanodon the pre-pubic bones of
crocodiles, as well as the cartilage connecting them with the ribs,
 which Huxley terms the epi-pubis.             On its mode of attachment to
the pubis    I offer no suggestion, and there is no evidence available.
But since the bone in crocodiles and Ornithosaurs is attached in the
region of the pectineal process, it is probable that it is connected
 with the extension of the pectineal process in Dinosaurs, which Pro
 fessor O. C. Marsh has named the pre-pubis, and I would bring the
pubic bone in the Ornithischia into harmony with the process in
Crocodiles by suggesting that the distal part of the bone, like the
anterior process, is entirely absent, so that only the sub-acetabnlar
part which supports the pre-pubis remains in crocodiles ; and I
suppose that if the pubis had been prolonged distally in the crocodile,
it might have included the foramen for the obturator nerve.
    If this interpretation of Dr. Man tell 'a undetermined bone should be
sustained, it would contribute a new and distinctive element to the
 Iguanodont pelvis, as remarkable as the pubic modification in an
Ornithosaur or Crocodilian, and distinct from either.          The evidence
from the fossil allies of crocodiles by no means demonstrates the
nature of what       I have termed the pre-pubic bones, though it shows
that pre-pubic ossifications exist which cannot be confounded with
the pubis, which may resemble the Crocodilian bone in form and in

being anterior in position to tho acetabulum, and in similar isolation
from the ilium.
   In the current identification of this bone every consideration has
been made subordinate to the embryologieal evidence as stated by
Rathke.      Yet although his excellent description unaccompanied by
figures has been regarded as conclusive that the bone under discus
sion is the pubis, it seems to me necessary to reconsider the evidence
before the matter can be thus settled.      The pelvis of a crocodile in
that stage of development which corresponds with the middle period
of incubation, if    I rightly interpret the author's meaning, is appa
rently more like that of an emu than is the adult animal in so far as
the ischium and pubis are concerned ; while the relative shortness
of the pubis is suggestively Ignanodont.
   Rathke's statement is as follows : the ilium, ischium, and pubis of
each side unite to form a single uubroken cartilaginous mass. The
two ilia are short, rather broad, plates, as in the full-grown animal,
and extend somewhat outward beyond the transverse processes of the
sacral vertebra.      The ischia were also similar to those of the full-
grown      animal,  consisting of tolerably thick plates, somewhat
expanded transversely at their median union, but are not so broad in
proportion to their length as in the full-grown crocodile.       The pubis
was somewhat shorter than the ischium, and in proportion to the
other parts of the pelvis was much shorter than in later life, and not
directed so much forward.       It extended downward nearly parallel to
the ischium, almost along its whole length, only separated from it
by a small interspace, and uniting with it at its upper end.     Ventrally
the pubes are widely separated, and have the hinder small half of the
connexion with the yolk-sac opening between them. They preserved
a similarity in shape to that of the mature crocodile, but the distal
ends were not so wide in proportion to their length, and the other
parts are not so slender as in later life. And on a subsequent page
the author again remarks,
                              " The direction of the pubis in embryonic
life remains different to that of the adult, but in the middle of the
embryonic period there comes to be a division in the cartilaginous
plate which hitherto had represented the ilium, ischium, and pubis."
   The early condition of the pelvic elements is so interesting in its
 parallelism of the ischium and pubis, and in the subsequent change
of direction of the reputed pubis, that I applied to Professor W. K.
 Parker, F.R.S., for help.      He at once sent me three examples of
 Crocodilus paluslris, one about mature in the egg, another with the head
 3 cm. long, the body about 4-5 cm., and the tail about 7 cm., which
 was about half grown, and a smaller specimen about a third grown.
    On examination I found that the pubes in the half-grown specimen
 were developed as in the adult, even to the fibrous extensions in front
 of the bones and behind them, and the only important      difference was

 the presence of the median notch between their anterior corners for
 the hinder half of the yolk sac and a direction rather less anterior.
 In the smallest specimen the element which Rathke terms the pubis
 does not diverge anteriorly from the ischium to the same extent as in
 the adult, but the elements have the usual form and meet in the
 middle line, and the difference is unaccompanied by any divergence

evidence    from the same cartilage divided into elements which become
permanent as ossifications.         And I hold segmentation which occurs
subsequently at a distance from the acetabulum, which isolates a
bone from the pubic region of the pelvis and the ilium, to be evidence
that the structure so separated is pre-pubic; while the only other
segmentation separates tho ilium from the bono which supports the
pre-pubis. From this it follows that the pubis has never been distinct
from tho ischium, and is not developed distally in crocodiles. The
notch which defines the anterior part of the ischio-pubic bone corre
sponds with the great notch in the acetabulum of the mammalian
pelvis, and that notch is situate between the ischium and pubis. The
cartilage which completes the anterior margin of the acetabulum
seems to me to be inseparable from the ilium ; and to be continuous
at its border with the fibrous sheath for the head of the femur. I
should attribute its existence to the absence of distal development of
the pubis, because this would remove the usual pressure of the bone
upon the anterior corner of the acetabulum, which stimulates ossifica
tion of the ilium.
   If the interpretation thus made is morphologically sound, it has an
important bearing upon the affinities and classification of the
Crocodilia.

       By F. G. Heathcotk, M.A.                 Communicated by Adam
       Sedgwick, F.R.S.        Received November 16, 1887.
                                  (Abstract.)
    With   regard to the development of the ccelom and generative
organs, I have obtained the following results.          The somites divide
into two parts, as described for Strongylosoma by Metschnikoff, one
par}, remaining in the body and the other part projecting into the
legs.   The cavities in these two parts together constitute the ccelom.
The part within the legs breaks up and the cells give rise to muscles.
The part within the body passes dorsalwards along the thin sheet of
mesoblast which unites it to its fellow of the other side, so that the
two vesicle-like parts meet above the nerve-cord in the middle line.
They join so as to form a single tube, the generative tube. The young
ova, as well as the follicle cells surrounding them, are formed by cells
proliferated from the walls of this generative tube.         The body parts
of the somites of the antennae and mandibles break up and disappear,
but those of the third pair of appendages give rise to the pair of
salivary glands.     There are two pairs of somites to each double
segment.
   In the development of the nerve-system, T find that there are two
cerebral grooves formed as in Peripatus.         They disappear early in the
development.      The   ventral  nerve-system, which at first consists of
 two separate cords united by a thin median part, undergoes a process
 of concentration which results in the presence of a single stout cord
 showing slight traces    of its former double condition.       At an early
 period of development there is a cavity present          in each ganglion.
 This cavity soon disappears, leaving no trace.            Two ganglia are
 developed to each double segment.
    The tracheae are formed as epiblastic invaginations at the sides of
and rather behind the legs.       These invaginations swell out inside the
body so as to   form two vesicles, and as the development proceeds two
diverticula are given off from each vesicle, one running beneath the
nerve-cord to meet its fellow of the other side, the other running
dorsally, parallel to the body. wall.    Both these diverticula break up
to form the tracheal tubes, the remaining part of the vesicle forming
the tracheal pit.    There are two pairs of these tracheal invaginations
to each double segment.
   The stink glands are formed as invaginations of the epiblast, and a
second coat (muscular) is added later in the development.          There is
only  one  pair to each  double segment.
   The heart is formed from mesoblast cells in tho body-cavity.

244         Post-embryonic Development   of Julus terrestris.    [Dec. 8,
These cells which were directly derived from the hypoblast in the
early stages of development, form a network in the body-cavity. The
heart is the result of a joining together of the meshes of this network,
and thus is formed by the confluence of a series of spaces in the
mesoblast, and has nothing to do with the development of the coelom.
The heart is placed in the middle dorsal line between the gut and the
body- wall. It has two pairs of arteries leading into the spaces of the
fat body in each double segment, and two pairs of ostia.      The part of
the body-cavity in which it lies is shut off from the rest of the body-
cavity by an imperfect pericardial membrane which is continuous
with the fat bodies. The tube of the heart is composed of three
coats, an inner structureless membrane, a median muscular coat, the
fibres of which are disposed circularly in alternate broad and narrow
bands, and an outer connective tissue coat.      The fat bodies are also
formed from the same network of mesoblast cells which in this case
secrete oil globules.
    The body-cavity is a series of spaces between the gut and the body-
wall, and is divided up by the mesoblast cells already referred to. It
is distinct from the ccelomic cavities of the somites, and is therefore a
pseudoccele.
    The eye-spots are all formed in the same manner.           The hypo-
dermis thickens and a cavity appears within it bounded by pigment.
 This cavity becomes a distinct vesicle.    The front wall of the vesicle
 becomes very thin and furnishes the lens, while the cells of the back
[i.e., most internal) wall and sides become elongated and form the
retinal elements of the eye. The nuclei of the front wall become
 very faint and finally disappear, while the rest of the vesicle remains
continuous with the hypodermis of the body-wall.         The cells of the
vesicle    are  at first separate from the ganglion  cells of the nerve-
system, but a connexion takes place very early. A number of very
small cells appear within the walls of the vesicle at a very early period,
 and I believe them to be derived from the mesoblast cells in the body-
cavity, but of this I am not certain.      They eventually become the
 pigment cells described by Grenacher.
    The most striking feature of the development is the reduction of
 the ventral part of the young animal and the increase of the dorsal.
 In the just hatched animal the ventral region is nearly as large as the
 dorsal, and the legs are wide apart, having a distinct space between
them.       As development progresses the dorsal region is increased,
 while the ventral is contracted till the bases of the legs are close
 together.     The corresponding concentration of the nerve-cord I have
already    mentioned.     In a paper on Euphoberia, a Carboniferous
 Myriapod, Mr. Scudder points out that one of the principal points in
 which the genus differs from existing Diplopoda is the development
 of the ventral region. The relations of the dorsal and ventral regions

1887.]           On the Sexual Cells   of Millepora plicata.          245
of the body of the Euphoberia correspond exactly to the condition of
the   yonng Julus.
    With regard to the double segments of Julus, Newport held that
each donble segment corresponded to two segments originally distinct
which had fused together; subsequent writers have held that each
donble segment is a single segment which has developed a second
pair of legs. Now considering the double segments with regard to
the development as well as to the adult condition, we see that the
mesoblastic segmentation is double, so are the tracheal, the nervous,
and circulatory systems.       The only part of these double segments
which is single is the dorsal plate with its stink glands which arise
as invaginations in it ; this dorsal plate being so enlarged as to form
a complete ring round the body of the adult.              Looking at the
palaeontology, we find that in the Archipolypoda, a family including
the Archidesmidae, Euphoberidae and Archijulidae, the dorsal plate did
 show distinct traces of a division.               I
                                         Therefore think that each double
segment represents     two complete segments, the dorsal plates of which
 have fused together to make one plate.

        Cantab., D.Sc. Load., Fellow of Downing College, Cam
        bridge. Communicated by Professor M. Foster, See. R.S.
        Received November 19, 1887.
                                 (Abstract.)
     The investigations were made upon several specimens of Millepora
plicata    I found growing in abundance on the fringing reefs of Talisse
 Island, N. Celebes.
     The young sexual cells, both male and female, are found in the ecto
 derm    of the ccenosarcal canals, between the dactylozooids and the
 g&strozooids.
     At an early  stage they leave the ectoderm, and by perforating the
 mesoglcea take up a position in the endoderm.
     The ova at an early stage become stalked.     The stalk of the ovum,
 which    is simply a modified pseudopodium, serves to keep the ovum
 attached to the mesoglcea.
     The stalk may at times be completely withdrawn, and the ovum by
  amoeboid movements migrate along the lumen of the canal to a more
  favourable locality, where  it becomes again attached   to the mesoglcea
  by a  stalk.
     Before maturation the germinal vesicle disappears, and a spindle-
  shaped body with longitudinal     strias appears, which throws out the
  first polar globule.

 246              On the Sexual Cells  of Millepora plicata.     [Dec. 8.
    A second and larger spindle appears after the first polar globule is
 thrown out, which in its turn discharges the second polar globule.
    The mature ova of M. plicata are very small         mm. in diameter),
 and contain no yolk globules or granules.
    After maturation the ova are impregnated. The heads of two or
 three spermatozoa may be seen within a single ovum, the flagella re
 maining on the surface.
    After fertilisation the germinal vesicle is again apparent, and at a
 later stage it is seen to contain a number of nucleoli.
    The germinal vesicle next fragments, the fragments being scattered
over that pole of the ovum which previously contained the germinal
 vesicle, i.e., the pole nearest to the stalk.
    The fragments at a later stage travel towards the middle of the
ovum, where they form an equatorial zone.
    This equatorial zone of fragments divides into two parties, which
travel towards the poles.
    The fragments during these movements increase in size and in
number, and in the next stage observed they are scattered over the
 whole ovum.
    This stage corresponds with the morula stage of other embryos,
the fragments of the original germinal vesicle being the nuclei of its
constituent cells. Very faint markings in the substance of the
embryo indicate the outlines of the cells. '
    The embryo next assumes the form of a solid blastosphere, in which
stage it migrates into the gastrozooid, and its subsequent history is lost
by its being discharged most probably by the mouth to the exterior.
    No trace of any medusa or medusiform gonophore or sporosac was
found either on the dactylozooids or gastrozooids containing ova or
embryos.
    The young male sexual cells or spermospores are at an early stage
distinguished from the young ova by their large nucleus containing
a coarse protoplasmic meshwork.
    The nucleus fragments and the fragments soon come to occupy the
whole spermospore.
    The spermospore is matured in the canals, and then migrates into the
basal endoderm of the dactylozooids, where its wall disappears, and a
colony of young spermoblasts pass into the cavity of the zooid. These
posh ont the wall of the zooid into the form of sporosacs, which they
occupy until they are mature. The sporosacs do not seem to be
formed before the advent of the spermoblasts.      There is no spadix nor
any other indication of their being degenerate medusiform gono-
phores.     In a very few cases they were found in the gastrozooids.
    The origin of the sexual cells in Millepora support the views of
the Hertwigs and Weismann that the ectoderm is the original seat oi
the sexual cells in the Hydrozoa.

    The absence of segmentation may probably be accounted for by the
migratory habits of the embryo after development has commenced.
The fact that no sperm-morula is formed supports this view. The
evidence before ns does not support the view that the ovum of
Millepora formerly contained much yolk and has subsequently lost it.
    I am inclined to believe that the HydrocorallinK belong to a
separate stock of the Hydrozoa, which probably never possessed
mednsiform gonophores.        Millepora is not related to Hydractinia.
IV. " On Photometry of the Glow Lamp." By Captain Abnet,
       R.E., F.R.S., and Major-General Festing, R.E., F.R.S.
       Received November 21, 1887.
   In a paper which     we read    before the Royal Society (' Roy. Soc.
Proc.,' No. 232, 1884) it was shown when a carbon filament or a
platinum wire in vacuo was gradually raised in temperature, that the
different rays
                 in the visible and invisible regions of the spectrum
followed a law governing their intensity.
    In the dark region of the spectrum (below the red) if the absi-issae
to a curve represented    watts (current x potential), and the ordinates
the intensity of the ray under consideration, the curve so formed
was hyperbolic, approaching more nearly to the parabolic form as
the red was approached.       In the visible spectrum the parabolic curve
was actually reached, the vertices of the parabolas moving along the
axis of abscissae; the shift being greater the more refrangible the
rays under consideration.      This implied that until a certain number
of watts had been expended the ray was absent.            Further, we had
shown in the 'Philosophical Magazine'           for September, 1883, that
 when measured by a thermopile,
                  total radiation  oc
                                      (watts — constant).
    In the visible radiation of an incandescent filament in a glow
 lamp we are only dealing, however, with a small portion of the radia
 tion, and therefore could not expect it to follow such a simple law as
 that which governs total radiation.       It appeared probable, however,
 that as the intensity of any individual         ray in this part of the
 spectrum increased parabolically, the sum of all the visible rays
 onght also to follow very closely the same form of curve, the vertex of
 such parabola lying at some point in the axis of abscissae between the
 vertices of the parabolas of the extreme visible rays.         It likewise
 appeared probable that when the rays of extreme refrangibility were
 absent or in defect, as is the case when the filament is red hot, the
 parabola would fail to represent the intensity of visible radiation.
    In the communication we have already referred to one example of

 248         Captain Abney and Major-General          Festing.    [Dec. 8,
 the applicability of the parabolic formula was given, for white light,
 but by itself it was hardly conclusive. We, therefore, conducted a
 series of experiments to ascertain if our anticipations were correct.
    An incandescence lamp was selected as a standard lamp, through
 which a fixed current was maintained.       This we used instead of a
 standard candle or other variable light.   Wo then selected a second
 similar lamp, of which to measure the light when currents of various
strengths were passed through it.
    The shadow and grease-spot methods were both experimented with,
the former being perhaps the most exact.          Whichever method is,
however, employed, it was inexpedient to move either lamp towards or
from the source, or to vary the distance of the source from the lamp,
as the carbon filaments show more or less illuminating surface to the
screen according as they are close or distant from it.        It therefore
became necessary to adopt some other plan for altering the intensity
of the light falling on the source from the comparison lamp.
   In the Rumford (shadow) method, fig. 1 will give the general idea
of the arrangements.
                                  Fig. 1.
   The shadows     cast by the rod D from the two sources of light, L,
and   Ln, were made just to touch each other, on the white screen SS,

1887.]                 On Photometry    of  the. Glow Lamp.                 249
and to      fall within a rectangle cut out of black paper, which deadened
the light on the rest of the screen.          Each lamp (L^ and Ln) was in
connexion with an ampere-meter and volt-meter (Ai, Au and Vlf Vn).
In front of Li (the comparison lamp) was placed an electromotor
which caused a pair of sectors of variable aperture to rotate between
it and the screen.
    Evidently two methods are open to equalise the illumination of the
screen from each source: —
    1st.    Cutting off more or less light from Lt.
    2nd.     Varying   the eurrent in Ln by    means of the variable resistance
               in the circuit.
    The first plan necessitates the opening and closing of the sectors
whilst rotating, and the second the alteration of the resistance, &c.,
at will.      Whichever method was adopted the lamp hi was brought to
a bright yellow glow, and the lamp Ln had a current passed through
 it which, when the minimum resistance was in circuit in R, produced
 a brilliant white light.       Such intense heat the filament would not be
 able to stand for any considerable time.
     When measurements were to be taken by the first plan the instru
 ment shown in the annexed diagram, fig. 2, was employed.             A pair of

   pair, S|i are carried on a short sleeve, to which are attached two
   horizontal pins, passing through holes in the flange D of another

 250          Captain Abney and Major-General Festing.             [Dec. 8,
sleeve    C.   A stud in this last engages with a screw thread of
long pitch cut on the axis.    A horizontal movement of C thus causes
it, as well as the sectors Sl, to rotate with reference to the axis and
the other sectors (S), and therefore alters the aperture.       This move
ment is given by means of a vertical lever engaging with the groove
 K on C, and which is actuated by the screw B. The aperture can
 thus be varied between 0° and 180°, whether the instrument be in
 motion or at rest. The instrument has been described at length, as
it varies in some particulars from previous ones, having been made
 under our own supervision. The edge of S is graduated into degrees
so that the amount of aperture is at once known.
   A certain current is passed through Lu, which is noted, and the
 sectors opened or closed till the shadows cast by the rod appear
equally luminous. The motor is stopped and the aperture read off.
 Three or four readings for each current passing through Ln are
taken, and then the current is altered, and a new set of three or four
readings made.     The current is altered so that the light from Ln
varies from extreme brightness to a dull red.
   By the other plan the sectors shown in fig. 2 are detached from the
motor, and card disks placed on A.        A resistance, R, fig. 3, has now

to vary to bring the light equal to the standard light diminished by
the disks rotating between the lamp Lt and the screen with known
apertures.    For the resistance at first we used a non-conducting
tube, in which about forty spherical pellets of hard carbon were
inserted.    At one end of the latter was a brass plate to which
one terminal of the battery was attached, and at the other a screw
was inserted, which was attached to the other terminal of the
battery through the lamp.      This screw pressed the pellets together
to any required degree, diminishing         the resistance or increasing
it as occasion required.      This answered fairly well, but not so
well as would be desired, as the response to the screw was some-

what sluggish. Mr. "Varley supplied us with one of his carbonised
cloth resistances, which consists essentially of a series of square pieces
of carbonised cloth more or less in contact.         The figure represents
the one we had made for us.            The carbonised cloth is represented
by    C, fig. 3, which fills the  whole  length from A to D when loosely
packed.       At B is a plate to which T3 is attached, and which can be
separated more or less from a fixed metal plate to which Ti is con
nected by the arm E, which is moved by the screw                  At A is an
insulated block carrying another plate to which T3 is attached, and
A can be carried backwards or forwards by means of the screw S3.
For some purposes the main current can be brought in at T3, and
leads be taken from T2 and Ti, thus forming part of a Wheatstone
bridge.       When only one resistance has to be inserted, Ti and Ts,
Tl   and   T2, or Ti and T3 may be used for connecting on to the leads
with one pole of the battery and the ampere-meter.            It was in this
way the resistance was used in the case in point. The lamp Ln by
the use of this could be raised from black heat to bright white, and
a small turn of the screw altered the resistance very considerably.
We used two sets of sectors ; one pair enabled us to use an aperture
from 135° to 90°, and the other pair from 90° to 0°. The light from
Ll was diminished by the first pair of sectors being placed on A
(fig. 2), the current k potential being noted.         The resistance of the
current passing through Ln was then altered till the illumination of the
two shadows on the screen appeared equal, the screw S (fig. 3) bein<»
turned backwards and forwards, first one shadow and then the other
being made to appear too dark.              By diminishing the oscillations
the neutral point can be very readily arrived at, even though the
colours of the lights may be very different (see Bakerian Lecture,
1886, " Colour Photometry," by the authors).            Tho readings of Vl,
and An were then read and noted.               The apertures of the sectors
were altered, and the same operations gone through.           From observa
tions thus made the curves were constructed, enabling the theory
propounded to be tested.
    The grease-spot plan of photometry was arranged in a somewhat
similar manner, Lu being on the opposite side of the screen SS, and
the rod being abolished.         In this method the room has to be dark
so as to admit of no reflection.         At first we were not prepared for
any great exactitude with              it,
                                     but finally we came to the conclusion
that   it   was very reliable,  a  conclusion  that Mr. W. H. Preece* came
to when he constructed his photometric arrangements.
    Having described the arrangements for taking the measurements,
it  remains to give the conclusions at which we arrived after making a
 large number of experiments.

   From the equations given in the paper already referred        to (' Phil.
Mag.,' September, 1883), where
                                c = ap+bpSl*t
the above equation (i) may      be written —
                         p-(a + bpi) — m — n^/y     ;
when p is fairly large this becomes —
                    (ii)  p* — h = k*/y      approximately.
    Similarly it may be shown that —
                   (iii)  c3 —«   = ti/y    approximately.
    The following tables will show the application of (i). It must be
understood that the measures of current and potential are not given
in amperes and volts, and that as a consequence the watts are only
represented by watts x a constant.         The first three tables show the
exactitude of the method of measurement where the resistance is
altered, and the fourth table the exactitude when the rotating sectors
are altered.

     The foregoing examples will give an idea of the accuracy with
 which measurements may be made by either method, and of the
 exactness with which the parabolic curve is followed.                       It seems that
 the photometry of incandescence lamps may be well carried out by
 measuring the watts.               It may be objected that each observation
 requires readings of the galvanometers, but this is avoided by the use
 of the formula given in the beginning of this paper.                   Two observations
 of current and potential enable the constants to be calculated, and after
 that one galvanometer alone need be used ; by preference that one
 giving comparative volts. The current is calculated from such a
 reading and subsequently the watts.
     Mr. W. H. Preece, in his paperf already alluded to, came to
 the conclusion that the intensity of the light emitted from a glow
 lamp varied as the sixth power of the current.                    This formula is fairly
 exact within limits, bnt it is obviously empyric, since where the
 current is small enough only to cause dark radiation it must fail.
 The example that he gives would require some slight rectification
 before it can be used as in the method given above; since the small
 distances at which the candle he employed was placed from the
 screen make it necessary to apply corrections for the thickness and
 length of flame.

  It  having been shown that the parabolic formula applies to visual
measures of an incandescence        light, it appeared that the same ought to
hold good for the total light which is photographically active. These
rays may be taken to lie between the blue and the extreme ultra-

violet of the spectrum, and consequently the vertex of the parabola
should lie further towards the blue of the spectrum than it does
with the visual rays.     The method of testing was as follows.
    An ordinary dark slide, A, carrying a sensitive plate, was placed in
grooves, CC, attached to a board, D, against which the slide (when its
front B was drawn out) could be raised or lowered as occasion
required by means of a rack and pinion motion working by the
handle D.

    E is a projection in which a slot, H, is cut, and through which a
card having a square aperture, K, can slide.         K  can be covered by
means of a cardboard screen.        The bottom of the plate in A is first
brought opposite the aperture K, which is placed opposite the number
 marked 1 on E.      The lamp is placed 4 feet away, the volts and amperes
 noted, and exposure is given to the small square of the plate seen
 through the square in K for any time which may be fixed upon. The
slide A is lowered, so that a fresh portion of the plate is brought
 opposite to K (K being covered up) a different current passed through
 the lamp, and another exposure given, and so on.         When the top of
 the plate has been arrived at by the motion of A, the card F is moved
 till K  is opposite  2, and the same procedure     repeated.   Six to ten
 exposures   can be made in the same row.
     When the second row is exhausted,      K   is placed opposite  3, and

such a current is passed through the lamp that it emits a medium
light.    A time scale is then made by giving different lengths of erpo-
sure at each movement of the plate in its last half. The plate is then
taken out of the slide, and the images developed. By this means both
a time scale and a measure of intensity for different temperatures are
on the same plate in the shape of squares of different density of
deposit.    When the negative is dry it is placed in an apparatus which
 works on the principle of the optical lantern, and is described in the
                                 "                                           "

 (' Phil. Trans.,' 1887), and the density of each square measured.        The
 "
   intensity
              " measures are then compared with the time scale, and
 the value of the intensity calculated. From these valnes can be deter
 mined if the curve of intensity and watts increases parabolically.         It
 might be objected that increase in intensity is not convertible into
 " time of
            exposure." Careful experiments have been made as to this,
and for the range of time which is comprised in the seconds of
 exposure given no appreciable error ensues.

dimensions) was constructed. Take Nos. 1 and 2, Table VII, the
exposures given to each were the same, viz., 15 seconds.                The light
transmitted through each square was read off, and found to be identical,
viz., 21-5. In the scale diagram the abscissa of the curve having the
ordinate 21"5 is 66, which is the equivalent time exposure, which is
also a measure of the intensity.          If the exposure had been prolonged
to 1 minute it would be equivalent to an intensity of 264 (since the
measured exposure was only 15 seconds).              The other intensities were
calculated in a similar manner. The intensities 21 and 264 were
taken as points on the parabola, and the intermediate intensities
calculated using the formula W — m — nVy.

  N.B. — It will  be noticed that in the above diagram the abscissae are marked as
square or relative exposure. A reference to the time scale table will show that the
exposure = number of square e 5. For simplicity's sake the number of the square
has been taken as the unit  of time.

1887.]      The Detonating Bolide    of November   20, 1887.        263
   The above show that the parabolic form seems to be followed, but
owing to the want of absolute uniformity in all parts of a photographic
plate, and that errors may arise from want of exact exposure, and,
again, from reading the densities, the values obtained are not so
accordant as those taken by the visual method.
V. "On the Detonating Bolide of November 20th, 1887."                By
        G. J. Symons, F.R.S. Received December 8, 1887.
   Shortly after November 20th it was generally reported that an
earthquake shock had been felt in the South Midland counties of
England, and the author began to collect and examine the facts. It
appeared that the records from Oxfordshire, and the western stations
generally, indicated that much louder sounds were heard there than
at the eastern stations, e.g., Essex and Cambridge.         The author
thought that, although the phenomenon had been almost universally
ascribed to an earthquake, it was more probably due to an explosive
bolide, and on receiving from one of the local scientific societies a
request for assistance in tracing the shock, the author suggested the
alternative explanation.    Mr. Fordham has subsequently written to
say that he has already found one person who saw the meteor from
Hertford, which he describes as " a brilliantly luminous body travel
ling across the sky from N.E. to W." It is further stated that a
portion of the meteor was seen to fall from the main body.
   Considering that the morning, as shown by the records of the Royal
Meteorological   Society, was both misty and cloudy, and that at the
hour at which it appeared, Sunday morning, 8.20 a.m., there would
be  hroad daylight, it is improbable that many persons saw it.    Judg
ing by the descriptions of the noise, as well as by the path roughly
indicated by the Hertford observation,      it seems likely that it ex

ploded    over the south of Oxfordshire     —but further details    are much
wanted.
   The meteor must apparently have been very large, as the explosion
was heard or felt over an area of upwards of 2000 square miles — the
area being 84 miles in length, from about S.W. to N.E., i.e., from the
confines of Wiltshire to Newmarket,            Cambridgeshire, and of an
average breadth of about 25 miles.          The sites whence returns have
been received are shown on the annexed map.

    In  the course of a series of further experiments on cells set up with
 " aeration plates " (plates simultaneously in contact with the air    and
 the electrolytic fluid used in the cells — Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol.
                                              '

 p. 212), we have made a large number of determinations of the E.M.Fs.
 developed    with incorrodible aeration plates of various kinds (e.g.,
 platinum    foil, spongy platinum, thin sheet gold, &c.) when opposed to
 the same oxidisable metal, such as copper or zinc, in contact with the
 same electrolytic fluid, e.g., dilute sulphuric acid or caustic soda
 solution. The details of these observations, when completed, will
 form the subject of a future paper; whilst making them we have
  noticed that if two or more different kinds of aeration plates be setup
  on the surface of the fluid contained in a shallow basin in which the
  oxidisable metal is immersed, and sufficient time be allowed to elapse
 to enable the films of air attracted to the aeration plates to attain a

condition      of equilibrium, different constant values are usually ob
tained     for the E.M.Fs. generated by opposing to the oxidisable metal
first one and then the other of any given pair of aeration plates, the
currents generated being rendered throughout of too small density
                           "
for " running down            to take place during the observations by inter
posing a large resistance in the circuit.           If when this state of con
stancy    has   been   attained   the two  aeration  plates be opposed to each
other with a considerable resistance in circuit, a current passes from
the one giving the higher- value when opposed to the oxidisable plate
through the external circnit to the other.             This current at first is of
such   magnitude       as to  correspond exactly with the E.M.F. due to the
difference between the E.M.Fs. exhibited when the two plates respec
tively are opposed to the oxidisable metal, but after some time it
gradually diminishes; even after several days, or even weeks, how
ever, it is usually still measurable.             If a miniature silver volta
meter be included in the circuit, in many cases an appreciable amount
of crystalline silver is found to be slowly deposited on the negative
electrode of the voltameter, which may conveniently be a thin gold
wire immersed to a depth of a few millimetres in silver nitrate solu
tion, a silver plate or wire forming the positive electrode.             Thus, for
example, in various experiments the following figures were obtained,
the aeration plates being arranged on the surface of dilute sulphuric
acid : —

    Analogous       results were obtained in various other cases with dif
 ferent electrolytic fluids, e.g., spongy silver and smooth silver sheet
 with caustic soda solution. In every case the action was greatest at first
 and gradually diminished, but never became absolutely nil.                     The
 larger the surface of the aeration plates, as might be expected, the
 greater was the average current ; thus in experiment No. 1 above,
 plates exposing about 20 sq.c. surface (one side, superficial measure
                                                                        x 2

ment    not reckoning inequalities of sponge) were used, and in No. 2
plates only about one-fifth that size.    •
    It is obvious that during the passage of a current the dilute
sulphuric acid between the two plates must be electrolysed, so that
hydrogen would tend to be liberated on the surface of the plate
acquiring the higher potential, and oxygen on that of the other ; the
hydrogen whilst nascent would necessarily be more or less completely:
oxidised to water by the oxygen of the film of condensed air, so that
on the whole the net chemical action           in the cell itself would    be
either nil (if all hydrogen were so re-oxidised) or one absorbing heat
 (if some of the hydrogen escaped oxidation). The oxygen slowly
evolved would escape as such, being dissolved by the surrounding
 fluid. The effect of this should accordingly be that the efficiency of
the air film on the first plate would be more or less depreciated, and
that on the second exalted ; in point of fact, if the two aeration plates
in such an arrangement, which has been generating a eurrent for
some time, be (by means of an appropriate switch) disconnected
from one another and successively opposed to a given oxidisable plate,
the one does give a considerably lower and the other usually an
appreciably higher value than the constant ones previously obtained
( iefore the two aeration plates were directly opposed to one another)
o i opposing each severally to the oxidisable metal ; whilst on allowing
the cell to stand for some time generating no current, the lower
value gradually rises and the raised one falls until sensibly the old
constant values are again obtained.
    We noticed, moreover,    that when aeration plates of platinum-foil
or sponge are used opposed to silver plates in conjunction with a fluid
capable of dissolving silver oxide (such as dilute sulphuric or acetic
acid or ammonia solution) distinctly larger amounts of current are
usually developed than when opposed to carbon br gold plates,
and that simultaneously silver passes into solution, the silver plate
acquiring the lower potential, diminishing in weight, and, in short,
behaving precisely as though it were an oxidisable metal, such as iinv
or copper.    Obviously this is due to the circumstance that with silver
the oxygen liberated attacks the metal of the plate acquiring the lower
potential ; but the remarkable part of the action is that this attack is
only partial, so that the amount of silver dissolved is invariably less tha*
that equivalent to the current passing, i.e., less than that deposited in a
silver voltameter included in the circuit. Thus the following numbers
were obtained in a series of experiments,          in each of which four
similar cells containing platinum sponge aeration plates arranged in
series were used in order to shorten the time of observation.           The
electrolytic fluids used  in the various cases   were respectively : —

   The difference between the silver dissolved and that deposited by
the current is thus relatively much larger with the weakest currents,
representing 43 — 69 per cent, of the latter in cases A and B ; 26 — 33
per cent. in cases C and D ; and 10 — 20 per cent. in cases E and F.
   It is obvious that if silver will dissolve in acids, &c., under the com
paratively feeble oxidising inBuence of an aeration plate, much more
rapid solution might be anticipated by substituting for such a plate
platinum immersed in a powerfully oxidising fluid such as strong
nitric acid, or sulphuric acid solution of chromic anhydride.                  In point
of fact, we have found that on setting up such cells where the silver
was immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (i.e., Grove's cell with silver
instead of zinc, and so on), electromotors of notable power are
produced,      at any rate until the silver plate becomes coated with
sparingly     soluble     sulphate.     Even in these cases, however, perfect
correspondence between the amount of silver dissolved and that
deposited in a voltameter included in the circuit does not subsist, the
latter being always measurably the grrater.                 Thus in several experi
ments with such cells, when the current was so regulated by interpos

ing suitable resistances that the silver deposition in the voltameter
was brought down to Ol to 0-2 gram of silver per 24 hours, the silvir
deposited always exceeded that dissolved by 0-001 to 0-003 gram.
Similarly two duplicate cells set up with silver plates immersed in
ammonia solution containing sal-ammoniac of strength about

   A similar cell containing ammonia solution without            sal-ammoniac,
and   consequently   having a very large internal resistance, caused
only   0-013  gram of  silver to be dissolved in eighteen hours, whilst
 0-015 gram was deposited ; in this case a visible film of silver
 peroxide was formed on the silver plate (a wire of pure metal).
   Just as silver is capable of being dissolved in an appropriate fluid
when opposed to an aeration plate, so may several other metals not
ordinarily prone to atmospheric oxidation ; thus mercury with dilute
sulphuric -acid as fluid, and an aeration plate of platinum sponge,
generates a measurable continuous current, forming mercurous sulphate
in so doing, so that after some time the liquid becomes turbid through
separation of that sparingly soluble salt, and the filtered fluid precipi
tates calomel on addition of dilute hydrochloric acid. Acetic acid acts
similarly, but far less energetically. Potassium cyanide solution, on
the other hand, causes a much more rapid solution of mercury, form
ing mercuric potassiocyanide ; it is noticeable that in this case only
100 parts of mercury go into solution for 108 of silver deposited iu
the voltameter, whereas when sulphuric acid is used 200 parts of
mercury become sulphate per 108 of silver deposited.
   If gold be substituted for mercury in this latter arrangement, rapid
solution takes place with formation of aurocyanide of potassium, 196
parts of gold being dissolved per 108 of silver thrown down in the
 voltameter ; the rate of action here, as in other analogous eases, can
be notably increased by placing the gold plate and potassium cyanide
solution in one basin and the aeration plate (platinum sponge) in
another with sulphuric acid, uniting the two fluids by a wide siphon,

   Palladium behaves precisely as gold, 52 parts of metal being dis
solved per 108 of silver deposited ; local action sometimes causes in each
case ercess of amount dissolved relatively to the current passing, the
opposite result to that observed with the silver cells above described.
    Of course, if more powerful oxidising agents are used than simple
aeration plates (such as platinum in sulphuric-chromic solution), the
action goes on in all such cases still more rapidly ; thus, for example,
we did not succeed in dissolving gold in dilute hydrochloric alone by
the use of an aeration plate simply ; but on replacing this by a
platinum plate immersed in sulphuric-chromic liquor connected by a
siphon with the dilute hydrochloric acid in which the gold was
immersed, chlorination of the gold was readily effected with the for
mation in the first instance of aurous chloride, which rapidly broke up
iuto particles of spongy gold and auric chloride in solution.

       and Great Veins." By C. B. Lockwood, F.R.C.S., Huuteriau
       Professor of Anatomy in the Royal College of Surgeons of
       England.      Communicated by G. M. Humphry, F.R.S.
       Received November 26, 1887.
                                (Abstract.)
    The history of the development of the pericardium, diaphragm, and
great veins is traced by means of rabbit's embryos ranging from the
eighth to the seventeenth day of intrauterine life.
    The splanchnic origin of the two halves of the heart is briefly
illnstrated, and each separate half is shown to project into the fore
most end     of the ccelom. The approximation of the halves of the
heart, and of the ccelom in which they are contained, and the forma
tion of the mesocardium posterius and anterius, is next narrated.
The course of the omphalomesenteric         veins to the heart along the
splanchnic    wall of the ccelom  is  then  traced, and those vessels are
                                                 "
shown to divide the ccelom into two parts, a cardiac and a

peritoneal."    At the beginning of the ninth day the ccelom consists of
two halves which are some distance apart towards the tail end, but
converge towards the head to open behind the omphalomesenteric
veins, into the cardiac portions of the ccelom.         To adopt a rough
comparison, the ccelom is, at the beginning         of the  ninth day, not
unlike a pair of trousers ; the cardiac portion would correspond to
 that part of the trousers which receives the pelvis, whilst the hinder
 parts of the ccelom would correspond to the places for the legs.        To

  274                  Prof. C. B. Lockwood.         The          [Dec. 15,
  carry the simile a step further, it might be said that the omphalo
  mesenteric veins would ran round the front of the trousers opposite
  the bend of the groins.
     An   adhesion of the omphalomesenteric      veins to the somatopleure.
  at the level of the hinder end of the heart, is next described, and
  identified with the mesocardium laterale, and is shown to be the way
  by which the umbilical veins find a passage to the heart.           Those
  vessels develop in the somatopleure, and are by means of it brought
  in relation with the endometrium in a manner which is described.
  The portions of the omphalomesenteric      veins which cross the ventral
 splanchnic boundary      of the  ccelom   are  held by the mesocardiam
 posterius, and by the mesocardium laterale, close to the dorsal wall
  of the ccelom, and, in consequence, as the cardiac and pleuro- peritoneal
 portions of the ccelom expand, the part bounded by the omphalo
 mesenteric veins remains stationary and narrow.          This narrow part
 of the ccelom is named the "iter venosum," because the great veins
 have so much to do with its formation, and, subsequently, with its
 closure.
     The development of a septum, the septum transversum, between
 the cardiac and pleuro-peritoneal portions of the ccelom, is attributed
 to the fixation of the omphalomesenteric veins.       When, in due course,
 the heart expands and is carried tailwards by the cranial flexure
 and its own growth, those vessels continue to hold the ventral
 nplanchnic wall of the ccelom close against the dorsal wall, and in
 consequence it becomes retroflected behind the heart.          This retro-
 fleeted portion stretches from one mesocardium laterale to the other,
 across the axis of the embryo ; its front surface is in contact with the
 heart, and its hinder surface is covered with hypoblast in which the
 liver originates ; thus a ventral diaphragm is formed between the liver
 and the heart.
    The appearance of other somatic veins, namely, of the anterior
 cardinals and afterwards of the posterior cardinals, is noted.         The
 former develop first and empty into the umbilical veins just as
 they (the umbilical veins) open into the omphalomesenteric ; when
 the posterior cardinal veins appear they join the anterior cardinals,
 so that a portion of each of the latter nearest the heart becomes the
 Cnvierian duct.
    Until the middle of the ninth day the embryo lies with its back to
the uterus.     The way in which it turns its right side and afterwarde
its venter towards the uterus is described, and also the infolding of
the somatopleure and splanchnopleure, and its effect upon the relations
of the great veins and septum transversum.
    The commencement of the umbilical veins and early formation of
the placenta are next illustrated. The allantois of the rabbit is shown
to be exceedingly rudimentary, and to take no part in the formation

1887.]         Early Development of      the Pericardium,  Sfc.         275
of the placenta, which is developed in connexion with somatic         struc
tures.
    The further    development of the ducts of Cuvier is then explained,
and    those vessels are shown to end, as did the jugulars from which
they are formed, by opening into the mouths of the umbilical veins
quite close to the heart. In the next stage of development, owing to
the expansion of the heart, the omphalomesenteric veins, umbilical
veins, and Cuvierian      ducts, acquire separate openings into the heart,
and at the same time the right and left umbilical veins, just before
entering the heart, communicate       with the venous spaces of the liver,
and have through them an alternative route to the heart.             Whilst
these changes are in progress, the left omphalomesenteric       vein, where
it is related to the liver, becomes occluded with liver substance.      The
gradual conversion of the mesocardium late rale and septum traversum
into a dorsal pericardium and ventral diaphragm is then described,
and afterwards the closure of the iter venosum by the apposition of
the Cuvierian ducts and the sides of the trachea and oesophagus ;
whilst this is in progress the subclavian veins appear and empty
themselves    into the Cuvierian ducts, which in this way become the
right and left superior venaa cavro.
                                                              '
    During the twelfth day the umbilical veins lose their direct
opening into the heart, and the left vein, taking advantage of the
alternative route through the liver, passes through the substance of
that organ to end in the right omphalomesenteric          vein close to the
heart.    The channel which unites the left umbilical vein to the right
 omphalomesenteric vein is the ductus venosus Arantii.           When the
 permanent kidneys and hind limbs develop, a vein passes from them
 into the cardiac end of the right omphalomesenteric       vein, so that it
 becomes the terminal end of the inferior vena cava.
    Whilst these changes are in progress numerous mesenteric veins
 develop, and open into the hinder portion of the right omphalomes
 enteric, which then becomes the portal vein, and at first empties into
 the sinus venosus Arantii.      The hepatic portion of the left omphalo
 mesenteric vein is quite obliterated, and that vessel ceases to enter
 the heart ; however, its hinder part may persist and carry blood from
 the mesentery      into the portal vein, with which it acquires com
 munications.
    About the middle of the twelfth day, and when the iter venosum is
 upon the point of closure, the dorsal diaphragm develops as a crescentic
 fold projecting from the side body-wall close to the superior venre
 cava, and uniting the dorsal pericardium to the dorsal body-wall.
 As the thorax develops this dorsal diaphragm travels further tail-
 wards, its bindermost dorsal attachments being united to the fore-
 end of the urogenital ridge, and its ventral attachments with the
  dorsal part of the liver and the mesoblast which covers it.

   The growth and development of the dorsal diaphragm is traced
until, upon the thirteenth day, it unites with the dorsal mesentery,
and forms a complete partition between the thorax and abdomen.
Finally, the development of the crura and other muscular portions of
the diaphragm is mentioned.

  I. " On    the Heating      Effects of Electric       Currents.   No. II."
        By William Henry Preece, F.R.S.                 Received November
        24, 1887.
                             I
     On March 19th, 1884, submitted to the Royal Society a paper on
 the heating effects of electric currents,* showing the strength of
 current necessary to fuse the fine platinum wire employed for pro
 tecting submarine cables from the ill effects of atmospheric electricity.
 The paper proved that the law that regulates the production of heat
 is one which can be expressed by the formula C = ad?13, " a
                                                                     "
                                                                        being
 a constant dependent on the metal used, and
                                                     "  "
                                                       d the diameter of the
 wire. The current observed was that which heated the wire up to
 the point of self-luminosity (525° C.).
    Since " cut-outs " of the same character as the cable lightning pro
 tector have become an essential feature of .all electric lighting
 installations, to act as safety fuses when from accident or design an
 excess of current is allowed to pass through the conductor, it became
most desirable to determine the current that would fuse wires of
 different diameters, and of different materials, so as to determine the
coefficient a for all metals.    The best material to use and the proper
dimensions of the fusible wire to be employed for the protection of the
electric light conductors would thus be easily deduced.
    My source of electricity was a large secondary battery of 52 cells.
I could regulate the current flowing at will by a rheostat of thick
iron wire, and by varying the number of cells.          The current strength
was calculated by measuring the potential difference at the ends of a
thick flat platinoid bar, whose resistance was 0"1822" , inserted in the
circuit, and so large that it would not perceptibly warm up nor have
its resistance appreciably increased with any current used. The sizes
of wire experimented upon were limited by the current. It is not sa/c

1887.]          On the Heating Effects  of Elecli-ic Currents.           281
to draw upon secondary cells for more than 10 amperes per negative
plate of the dimensions at present followed.         The packed plates dis
integrate and become damaged with too great an output of current.
Hence all my experiments were made with currents well within the
range of the battery.      I obtained samples of wire of various metals
and of various diameters from 0"004 inch up to 0'040 inch.              It is
convenient to take these measurements in thousandths of an inch
 (mils), for all our manufacturers and electric light engineers in the
 United    States and the United Kingdom work to this gauge.             The
conversion of the values thus obtained into the metrical and more
 scientific system is very simple.     The wire to be experimented upon
 was clamped between two small brass binding screws fixed upon a
 dry wooden stand.
    I pointed out in my previous paper how the cooling effects of the
 terminals or binding screws might vitiate the results, and how neces
 sary it was to experiment on wires of sufficient length to prevent
 any error occurring from this cause.      I used lengths of 6 inches to
 determine the constants for wires free from the cooling effect, but
 lengths of 1^ inch with massive terminals to determine the constants
 for wires used in practice as " cut-outs."
    The cooling effect of the terminals very seriously affects the
 efficiency of the cut-outs used in actual practice, and the larger the
 fusing wire and the terminals the more serious is the error intro
 duced.      On the other hand, the greater the lengths of wire used as a
 fuse the greater the resistance inserted, and the efficiency of the
 system     itself may be reduced.       Cut-outs, therefore,     shonld be
 employed sparingly and with judgment, and the fusing wire should
 not be so short as to impair the fusing point.
    In the following tables   I have tabulated the results of the numerous
 experiments made.
    When we consider the irregularities     in drawing these fine wires to
 true cylinders, the difficulty in determining the current at the exact
 moment of fusion, and the variation in the specific resistance of the
 metals,   I  think the results muse be considered       very satisfactory in
 support of the law.
    Three points of observation were taken      : —
    1.  The melting point of a small flake of shellac placed on the wire,
 which may be taken at 77* C.
    2. The point of self-luminosity, 525° C.       This was only determined
 roughly in air without the dark chamber       I  employed previously.
    3. The fusing current.

   Note.  — The wire       becomes   red, and then immediately much brighter (a dull
white), owing      probably to oxidation.     To reproduce faint redness without breaking
the   circuit, the current can be considerably reduced,           "a"    is the current which
caused the first visible rays     of light, and so quickly changed the wire to a brighter
state   of incandescence, while " 4 " is the reduced current which reproduced the
first redness.     If the experiment be repeated, the same effects are obtained, although
the   molecular structure of the wire seems to be much changed by the first heating.
After fusing the wire, a white powder, alumina, is found, and sometimes a white
opaque bead.        A  wire 18 mils diameter and 10 inches long was raised to faint red
 with 1122 amperes;        it glowed (dull white) on one side of loop with 1158 amperes,
and when the heat had apparently spread over the whole length uniformly, redness
 reappeared, and the current was found to be again 1122 amperes.                   The wire was
 ueit raised to a moderately white incandescent state with 15-98 amperes, and with
 this current broke     in two minutes.

    The second series of experiments was made to determine the rela
tive effect of the sudden application of powerful currents on wires of
different materials such as would occur if in practice a short circuit
suddenly took place. An electromotive force of 100 volts was used,
and there being no appreciable resistance in the external circuit but
the wire, the latter was subjected to the blow of a momentary current
of immense and immeasurable strength.

   The conclusions derived from these experiments were that the             beit
metal to use for small diameters was platinum, and for large              wirei
tin. Platinum fuses in a wax-like kind of way without explosion               or
scattering of molten particles. Platinum has great advantages over
other materials ; it neither tarnishes nor deteriorates.            It is eaiily
soldered.
   Tin hehaves very much in the same way when its dimensions are
large.    But it is very questionable whether large wires should over
be used for fusible cut-outs.        Owing to radiation the surface keepi
cool and solid, while the centre is molten and liquid.                 It buritR
with an explosion,      and the    incandescent     particles are forced away
radially in all directions with considerable energy.
   Fusible cut-outs are effective but somewhat barbarous, and from
the absence of any scientific enquiry into their character and jndg--
ment in their use, they have in the majority of instances become
rather a source of danger than of safety.

   Since C = cuP    I1 gives the fusing current of any wire of a given

II. "A    Contribution to the Study of the Comparative Anatomy
       of Flowers."    By Rev. G. Henslow, M.A., F.L.S. Com
       municated by Dr. B. W. RICHARDSON, F.R.S.               Received
       December 2, 1887.
                                (Abstract.)
    The author first drew attention to the importance of the class of
observations illustrated in this paper ; for by referring all the floral
organs back to their vascular cords, or
                                              " axial traces," their real
origins could be discovered, whenever their developmental history
was incapable of showing them.
    Taking the cords as
                         " floral units," he showed how they can give
rise to axes as well as all kinds of floral appendages.      The two ele
ments of which a cord is composed are tracheae or spiral vessels and
sieve-tubes, &c or soft bast.     The significance of the relative posi
tions of these two elements was pointed out, and M. Ph. van
Tieghem's distinction between axial, and foliar characters of cords,
I.e., in having the tracheae on the side of the medulla in the former,
and on the outside in the latter, was criticised as being by no means
constant, especially as regards the floral cords ; inasmuch as a more
general rule is for the tracheae of the latter to be exactly central or
scattered irregularly in a groundwork of phloem.
    After describing the arrangements in peduncles and pedicels in
which endogens often have their cords as regularly placed as in
exogens, the author explained the different ways by which pedicels
of umbells are formed in each class respectively, and how they are
supplied with cords from the common peduncle.
    He next pointed out the pnyllotactical origin of the number of
parts in floral whorls, and how the various arrangements of their
members become altered in consequence of the union of their cords
below, so that the proper angular divergences are not maintained,
and parts often become superposed which would otherwise alternate
in position.
    The union, separation, reunion and fusion of cords, as well as the
way in which they may shift their positions, were discussed, and the
effects produced by such processes were explained.
    The results of the multiplication of parts brought about by
 " chorisis " of a cord were illustrated ; whereby a simple cord of a
pedicel could give rise to any number of floral parts, snch as the
members of different whorls, as in the case of Campanula medium, in
which a simple pxial cord supplied a sepaline, a dorsal carpellary, a
staminal and half a petaline cord : or when a repetition of the same
kind occurs, as in double flowers.

    Considerable light is thrown upon the phenomena of cohesion and
adhesion by this method of investigation ; and especially on the un
differentiated    state of organs when in congenital union.        This, if
thoroughly understood, completely clears up the difficulties surround
ing the interpretation of the
                                    " receptacular tube " and the " inferior
ovary."
    The investigation into the character and distribution of the
vascular cords reveals the true nature of the axile and free central
placentations ; in the former case, it shows that with scarcely any
                                                            "
exception the axis takes no part in the structure, all carpophores,"
"
   stylopods," &c., being simply the coherent and hypertrophied
margins of the carpels.
    Similarly the free-central placenta of Primula rem received its in
terpretation as being coherent and ovuliferous bases of five carpels
 which have the upper parts of their margins cohering in a parietal
 manner and without ovules.
    The illustrations are of abont sixty genera, and nearly twenty-
 orders.
    The author proposes continuing his observations.

     The materials for this study were obtained from Naples in the
  wiuter of 1886-87.        In the orientation of the larva, J. Barrois'
  suggestion ('Comptes Rendus,' November 9th, 1886) has been adopted,
  viz., that the stalk of the pentacrinoid represents the praeoral lobe of
  other Echinoderm larvae.

     External Form. — Segmentation is regular, and a gastrula is formed
  by invagination.     The blastopore closes early and the larva gradually
  elongates.    Ciliation is at first uniform, but soon an anterior tuft of
  cilia and five ciliated bands become visible, and the intermediate cilia
  disappear.    The anterior ciliated band is incomplete ventrally, and is
  either absent in the British form or escaped Wyville Thomson's
  notice.   Two ciliated depressions also appear on the ventral surface.

before the rapture  of the vitelline membrane, and are absent from      the
ciliated areas.
    The free larva swims with the terminal tuft of cilia directed for
wards. A white patch on its left side between the third and fourth
ciliated bands marks the position of the " water-pore."
    Internal Anatomy. — The gastrula has at first no mesoderm, but this
soon becomes budded off from the archenteron.       The blastopore closes
near the posterior end, but whether ventrally or dorsally could not be
determined.     The archenteron, which only occupies the posterior half
of the larva, soon divides into two parts ; the posterior of these
(enterocele) assumes the form of a dumb-bell, round the constricted
part of which the anterior half (mesenteron) grows till it forms a
complete ring.     The two swellings of the dumb-bell soon separate to
form the right and left body-cavities respectively. From the anterior
part of the mesenteron are budded off the hydrocele (left and ventral).,
and an unpaired anterior body-cavity.
    By a change in position of the right and left body-cavities (incor-
rected described by Gotte), the left body-cavity becomes posterior
and ventral, while the right becomes anterior and dorsal : the latter
sends a five-chambered     prolongation into the praeoral lobe, to form
the rudiment of the
                        " chambered organ."      The hydrocele forms a
ring, incomplete towards the left, on the ventral side of the mesen
teron, and soon forms five ventral pouches.       Shortly before fixation,
the anterior body-cavity, which extends far into the praeoral lobe,
                                               "
opens to the exterior on the left side by the    water-pore."
    Underneath the anterior tuft of cilia and the prasoral pit, and down
the sides of the larval mouth, run fine fibres, which appear to be
parts of a larval nervous system which disappears when the larva
loses its freedom.
                    Fixation and Subsequent Changes.
    After swimming freely for about twenty-four hours, the larva      fixes
itself by means of the praeoral pit, which forms the disk of attachment.
The ciliated bands then disappear, and the larval mouth invaginates
to form the vestibule, which is rotated to the posterior end, as de
 scribed by Barrois (' Comptes Rendus,' May 24th, 1886).           At the
same time all the tissues undergo histolysis, and the mesenteron
becomes filled with cells budded in from the centre of the hydrocele
ring.
     The right and left body-cavities, which are now both dorsal, grow
 rapidly round to the original ventral side, being separated by a trans
 verse mesentery, and each forms a longitudinal mesentery near the
original ventral radius. The free end of the larva may be called the
oral end, since the mouth now appears as a depression in the floor of
the vestibule.

1887.]       Heat Dilatation of Metals from Low Temperatures.              299
    The anterior body-cavity is now small and lies near the oral end
in the body-wall. Into it opens the water-tube or stone-canal, which
runs from the water-vascular ring in the oral longitudinal mesentery,
and is distinguishable from the anterior body-cavity by its higher
epithelium. It is not, therefore, in direct continuity with the water-
pore.      The anus opens externally in the same interradius as the
water-pore.
    The Skeleton remains to be described.          Shortly after the orals and
basals have appeared, three small plates are developed at the posterior
end of-the stem, which resemble the basals in form but are not
derived from them.          They are so arranged that the most dorsal,
 which is smaller than the other two, lies on the right side opposite
 the interradius of the water-pore. These three plates are the un
doubted homologues         of the under-basals of the dicyclic Crinoids
 (Poteriocrinus, Encrinus, Sec.).    Shortly after the fixation of the larva
they fuse with one another and with the top stem- joint, so as to form
a large plate which has hitherto been mistaken for a simple centro-
dorsal.      The five radial angles of this plate belong to the under-
basals, and it is only at a much later period that these angles are
hidden by the growth of the true centrodorsal (= top stem-joint),
 the angles of which become interradial when its cirri appear.
 IV. "Heat Dilatation of Metals from low Temperatures." By
       Thomas Andrews, F.R.S.E.              Communicated by Professor
       G. G. Stokes, P.R.S. Received November 30, 1887.
   It  is understood that the      coefficients   of heat dilatation increase
 with rise of temperature ; but Professor P. G. Tait, in his recent
 work on ' Heat,' p. 87, remarks that
                                                " we are not aware of any
experiments made with a view of deciding whether, as is probable,
these coefficients become gradually less as the temperature is lowered
below    zero" (0° C.).
   The following experiments were made to investigate the subject in
relation to metals of the iron and steel series.               The varieties
 of modern steels manufactured by recent processes manifest pro
 perties sufficiently diverse as almost to constitute them distinct groups
 of metals, although      for practical purposes they are conveniently
 grouped under the generic name of steel.            Some of these modern
 metals have recently been so largely used for constructive purposes
 that the author considered it desirable to obtain an approximate
 quantitative estimation of their dilatation by heat through varied
 ranges of temperature.       The rolled metals under observation in the
 experiments consisted of round polished bars, 3 inches diameter, and
 13 inches long, planed perfectly square at each end ; they were care-

   The range of temperature         chosen for the observations     was from
 -45° C. to 300° C.
   The   experiments were conducted as follows : — For the measure
ments commencing at the low temperature                of — 45° C, the bars
 (having previously been slowly reduced to the temperature of 0°C,
and then gradually cooled to —18° C.) were placed upright in the
bath A (see fig.), and immersed in a freezing-mixture of three parts
of calcium chloride and two parts of snow, each of these ingredients
previous to mixing being maintained in separate jacketed freezing
      Bath A for Temperature of  -45°   C.    Bath B for Temperature of -18° C.

tanks   at a temperature of — 18° C. The vessel A, containing the
bars and the calcium chloride freezing-mixture, was further sur
rounded by another compartment holding a quantity of a freezing-
mixture of snow and salt at a temperature of — 20J C. By this means
and by constantly renewing the calcium chloride and snow mixture
during the experiments, an uniform temperature of —45° C, as
registered by an alcohol thermometer, was maintained for the experi
ments in the cold bath A.
   Much larger cooling tanks of a snow capacity for each charge of
8 cwts. were used for the large forgings, and a large cast metal oil-
bath having a capacity of about 70 gallons of oil was used for the
highest temperature.
   The bars remained thus immersed in the freezing bath whilst
their internal temperature was regularly ascertained by another
alcohol thermometer placed in a hole in the centre of the test bar C,

wherein was also placed a little alcohol.    When the bars had reached
and remained for some time at the registered temperature of —45° C,
each was in turn removed and placed on a suitable wooden frame,
and its length instantly and carefully measured by telescopic readings
from a delicate micro-vernier gauge (deviations of 201oa of an inch
were perceptible) also supported on a suitable rigid stand. The bars
were then replaced for a short time in the freezing-mixture and again
removed and their diamoter then carefully measured.        No perceptible
alteration in the temperature of the bars occurred during the very
short time occupied in taking the observations, and frequent tests
were made to ascertain this.     The average of about thirty measure
ments in each case, both longitudinal and transverse, was regarded
as fairly accurate.    The dimensions of the bars were taken in a
similar manner for the temperature from — 18° C., substituting in
another cold bath, B, a freezing-mixture of suow and salt to obtain
this temperature, and using powdered ice and suow for the observa
tions at 0° C. The higher temperature observations were obtained by
heating the whole of the bars in a large hot-water bath for the period
necessary to insure that their temperature throughout was as re
quired, and the oil bath was used for the temperature of 300° C.
Liability to temperature errors was, as far as possible, carefully
guarded against by constant reference and comparison between the
bath thermometers and that in the centre of the test bar, and by
keeping the bars immersed during sufficiently long periods.
    The hammered metals under observation were large forgings of the
different metals 7 feet 3 inches long, and 5 inches diameter, planed
perfectly square at the ends and turned" and polished, bright.         The
measurements were taken on the total length of the forgings, as in
the case of the rolled metals, to ensure greater accuracy, the experi
ments being conducted in somewhat similar manner : but owing to
the greater length of the forgings, a modification of the method was
made.     One end of the forging was rigidly secured and the expansion
ascertained    by measuring the diminishing space between the other
end of  the  forging and a fixed point situated a distance from it. The
results are recorded on Table II.

 stance which may be accounted for by a reference to Table I of the
 analyses, from which it will be seen that the percentage of combined
 carbon was much lower in the " soft

                         Heat Dilatation     of Metah.              [Dec  22,
results on Table      II appear also to indicate another circumstance of
metallurgical    interest,  viz., that the dilatation was generally rather
more in the direction of tho length of the metallic cylinders than
when measured across the diameter, numerous repeated experiments
confirmed this.       The result appears more marked in the large round
forgings of hammered steels and wrought iron than in the case of the
rolled bars. It would therefore seem probable that the crystalline
 particles of the metals suffer slight permanent alteration of form in
 the direction of their length during the process of rolling or drawing;
 out, sufficient to very slightly affect their relative longitudinal and
 transverse dilatations.
     Furthermore, the observations of this memoir, conducted at these
 very low temperatures, experimentally confirm the suggestion of
 Professor Tait, inasmuch as the coefficients of dilatation were found
 generally to decrease with the reduced temperatnre below 0°C. The
 author also found such to be the case in his observations on the " Heat
                                                                        '
 Dilatation of pure Ice from very low Temperatures."               (See Roy.
  Soc. Proc.,' June, 1886, No. 245, p. 544.)
     It may be remarked that many tons of the various freezing
  mixtures, snow, &c, were required for the experiments.
                 Appendix. — Received January 12, 1888.
     I  think it would    be   misleading to use the figures, given in the
  second column      (Table   II),  of the dilatation from -18° C. to 100° C.
  for purposes of exact comparison with the other results. The co
  efficients for dilatation between the small margin of — 45° C. and
   — 18° C. could not be accurately inferred from the results recorded in
  Table B, because the series of experiments from — 18° C. to 100° C.
  were not made consecutively with the other observations.           The mole
  cular condition of the metals in that series ( 18° C. to 100° C.) I
                                                          —
  consider was probably somewhat different. Judging from the whole
  of the results over the wider ranges of temperature, I do not think
   that the coefficients for the temperatnre between — 45° C. and
   — 18° C, whenever specially determined,           will be found to be of a
   comparative negative       character,   or vitiate the general conclusions
   arrived at in this paper.       The whole series of observations I believe
   coincide in establishing the reduction of the coefficients of heat
   dilatation with reduced temperature.         I hope to make further investi
   gations at these low temperatures.

        LL.D., F.R.S. Received December 21, 1887.
     The following observations are the result of a study of               a species of
 Perichaeta, which is probably identical with Perrier's P. aopergillum*
 I owe a number of excellently preserved examples to the kindness of
 Mr. Shipley, Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge.
     In transverse sections of the anterior segments the nephridia are
 seen to form numerous tufts of glandular tubules closely related to
 the body-wall and to the septa.               This appearance, which is also seen
 in dissections, is very different from that of most other earthworms,
 and has been commented upon by other observers.                      Perrier, in fact,
 expressed the opinion that these organs in Perichaeta are in a rudi
  mentary condition.            I  shall, however, bring forward reasons for
  believing that they are in a very archaic condition.
     The remarkable appearance of the nephridia led me to infer that
  I should find the external apertures in each segment to be numerons,
  &r  I showed    to be the case     in Acanthodrilus.f     1   may take the oppor
  tunity of stating that in the latter species (A. multiporus) there is
  apparently a very much greater number of nephridiopores in the
  anterior than in the posterior segments ; in certain of the anterior
  segments I counted over one hundred.               I am now able to state that
   this is also the case in Perichaeta (in all probability in other species
   besides P. aspergillum) .        The external pores lie between the setae,
   bat have no regularity in their arrangement ; frequently there were
   three or four between two successive setae, as often there seemed to

be only one or two.   The minute structure of the terminal section of
nephridia is slightly different from that of Acanthodrilus.   I have
also found that Typhceus   and  a new genus, which  I propose shortly
to describe under the name of Dichogaster, have many nephridiopores
in each segment.    Another point, to which         I
                                                wish to direct atten
tion in this communication, is that in Perichaeta there is a connexion
between the nephridia of successive segments.
    Quite recently Ed. Meyer* and Cunninghamt have shown that in
Lanice conchilega the nephridia of each side are connected by a con
tinuous longitudinal duct. This discovery is in accord with the pre
sumed origin of the Annelid from the Platyhelminth                 excretory
system, and also with the development of Polygordius (Hatchek) and
Jiumbricus.%      In Perichaeta the connexion between the nephridial
tufts of successive segments is not brought about by a continuous
longitudinal duct, one on each side of the body, but by numerous
tubules which perforate the intersegmental septum.          Thus it appears
that the nephridial system of Perichaeta consists of a network of tubules.
In this respect Perichaeta agrees with the leech Pontobdella,^ hot
differs in the presence of numerous nephridiopores in each segment.
    These facts appear to lend further support to the view that it is
possible to derive the annelid from the platyhelminth excretory system.
                                                     "
Lang has pointed out that the " secondary              pores by which the
excretory organ of the Platyhelminths communicates with the exterior
have probably given rise to the nephridial pores in the Annelida ; by
a subsequent arrangement of these in a metameric fashion, and by the
breaking up of the nephridial network, the paired nephridia have
originated. The longitudinal canal has disappeared, except in the
cases that I have already mentioned. In some Platyhelminths the longi
tudinal canals are, partly at least, broken up into a network ; and           it.
                                                                              is
this condition which has persisted in Perichaeta and Pontobdella     ;  more
over    in  some    Platyhelminths,  where   the  "
                                                    secondary

condition of the nephridia in Perichaeta as more archaic than
Pontobdella.      The disappearance      of the connexion between the
nephridia   of  successive  segments  leads to the condition which exists      in
Acanthodrilus the reduction of the external pores, already perceptible
                ;
in the posterior segments of A. multiporus, culminates in the disap
pearance of all but two in each segment.            The irregularity     inthe

of the presence of multiple nephridiopores in each segment.

                                        (Abstract.)
     The present memoir deals with the covariantive forms associated
with the general ordinary linear differential equation ; it is strictly
limited to the consideration of those forms, without any discussion of
their critical character.
      The most general transformation, to which such equation can be
 subjected without change of linearity or of order, is one whereby the
 dependent variable y is transformed to « by a relation
                                       V

 and, at the same time, the independent variable x is changed            to   ;

   there are    r relations between the coefficients P and Q      ; and P0 and
   On may      manifestly, without loss       of generality, be taken equal to
   unity.
       It is shown that, from these relations, others can be deduced which
   are of the type
    where    ^-(P) is an algebraical function of the coefficient P and their
    derivatives.     Such a function is called an invariant of index /, ; and
    irreducible invariants are of two classes, fundamental and derived.
       It is convenient to have expressions for the invariants, when the
    differential equation has an implicitly general canonical form. In the
    first place it may be supposed that Pl and Qt are both zero ; otherwise
    both equations       can by substitutions of Y for y e/p,<ir and U for
    uef<**d- be reduced    to forms in which the terms involving the (n — l)th
    differential coefficients     of the dependent variable do not occur. The
     relation between the dependent variables is now

each of the »— 2 invariants of this class is shown to consist of two
parts, one of which is linear in the coefficients and their derivatives,
the other of which is not linear but every term contains as a factor
either P2 or some derivative of P2.
   It is then proved that there is an implicitly general form of the
equation for which both Ql and Q2 vanish ; this form, taken as the
canonical form, is obtainable (as is known from earlier investigations)
by the previous determination of the multiplier of the dependent
variable and by the determination of the independent variable from
the equation

These invariants are called priminvariants.
   The proof of these results occupies the second section of the memoir.
The first section is devoted to a short historical sketch of the growth
of the subject, reference being made to the investigations of Cockle,
Laguerre, Brioschi, Malet, and, especially, of Halphen, all of whom
have, so far as concerns the theory of forms, discussed either semin-
variants only or, with the single exception of 03 for the ntic, in

variants of the cubic and the quartio           in forms which differ from the
canonical form herein adopted.
     In the third section derived invariants are obtained,                 all in their
canonical forms ; they are derived from the priminvariants by one or
other of two processes called the quadriderivative and the Jacobian.
The irreducible invariants are ranged in classes according to their
degrees.       The quadrinvariants consist of n— 2 functions,
                             e„.i = 2<re<re,"-(2<T^-l)e(r'^,
and of n— 3 independent functions of the form
and  every class of invariants of degree higher than the second
contains n— 2 invariants, each in that class associated with one of the
priminvariants in successive derivation according to the law

                     ©<r,f    = ^eV.r-i— r(ff+i)e,'eirir_1.
Propositions relating to the dependence of the derived invariants are
proved in the section ; and simpler equivalent forms are obtained later
in the memoir.
     In the fourth section covariante are discussed.     The transformation
of the dependent         variable in the second section shows that, with the
adopted deGnition of invariance, viz., reproduction save as to a power
of    z',the dependent variable         isa covariant.  A 6et of dependent
variables, associate with the original dependent variable,          obtained
                                                                           is

   In   the fifth section   these dependent variables are treated    in the
same manner as the priminvariants in the third, and give two classes of
functions —identical covariants, which in their canonical form involve
dependent variables only, and mixed covariants, which involve depen
dent variables and coefficients of the original equation.      The former
class includes series      of covariants, each involving only one of      the
dependent variables     ; the law of successive formation is
                VJM    = p(n.—p)v,vr" — (np—p*-l)v,'i,
                Vf.'+i = P(*— P)vfV'r,r— r(np—p*— 2)Vp,rw/,
for each of the associate variables.          But other functions which
involve more than one of the variables, e.g., the Jacobian of two of
them, are omitted, for they can be algebraically compounded by
means of the mixed covariants. The number of independent identical
covariants in the succession is one less than the order of the equation
satisfied by the variable : but a modification of this number is neces
sary when they are considered as covariants of a differential quantic
instead of being considered covariants of a differential equation. For
in this case we must either retain the quantic and all derivatives
from it — when there is no modification of the number of identical
covariants ; or the number is unlimited, and then the quantic and its
derivatives are composite.
   The mixed covariants which are irreducible are proved to consist
only of first Jacobian s of some one of the invariants and all the
dependent variables in turn.
   The aggregate of the concomitants is constituted by the three
classes of functions thus obtained, viz., invariants, identical covariants,
and mixed covariants.
   In the sixth section the results previously derived are applied to
equations of the second, the third, and the fourth orders ; solely,
however, for the sake of illustration and not for purposes of critical
discussion of classes of these equations.
   For the equation of the second order the only result obtained is a
reproduction of Schwarz's theorem ; the equation has no invariant.
   For the equation of the third order, the canonical form of
which is
                                u'" + Bsu = 0,
and    which has a single priminvariant, one or two questions are
solved; in particular, the differential equation satisfied by the
quotient of two solutions of the cubio is obtained, and there is thence
deduced a quotient-derivative, which is the analogue of Schwarz's
derivative for the quadratic.
   For the equation of the fourth order there are two canonical forms,

two solutions of the quartic is obtained ; and in this connexion there
arises a quartic quotient-derivative.   Finally, the assooiate equations
of the quartic are formed ; and it is verified that all their invariants
are expressible in terms of the invariants of the original quartic.
   The seventh section is really a digression from the main subject of
the paper ; it is concerned with the special class of functions which
occur in the preceding section and are called quotient-derivatives.

   Up to this point the results in the memoir which relate to the
derivation of covariantive forms have been synthetically obtained ; the
eighth (and last) section relates to their analytical derivation. It is
shown that, for a homographic transformation of the independent
variable applied concurrently with the proper transformation of the
dependent variable, the canonical form of the differential equation is
maintained.    These transformations are applied to prove, by the
method of infinitesimal variation, that every concomitant <;> in it?

where   \ is  the index of the concomitant.      This is called the index
 equation ; and,  when  the  form of 0 is known, it merely determines X,
 which can be written down from an inspection of the concomitant.
    These equations are applied, (i) to the identical covariants in «,—
 (ii) to the invariants derived from ©3, —for each of which simplified
equivalent functions are obtained for derivatives of order higher than
the third, — and (iii) to verify that the Jacobianof a priminvariant and
any of its derived invariants satisfies the equations. Lastly, by means
of the theory of partial differential equations, it is proved that the
aggregate of concomitants obtained in tho earlier part of the memoir
is complete, that          is,
                         that any concomitant can be expressed as an
algebraical function of tho members of that aggregate.

I. "Notes on the Spectrum of the Aurora."                By J.   NORMAX
            Lockyer, F.R.S. Received January           9, 1888.
   I exhibited to the Society on November   17, 1887, a tabular statement
showing the bright lines seen in the spectra of various celestial bodies,
and  I also gave those recorded in the spectrum of the Aurora showing
many remarkable coincidences.
   I now find that the connexion is closest between the auroral
                                         -
spectrum and that of stars 3a, and in anticipation of a subsequent
communication of details I send on the accompanying table, showing
the origin of Duner's bands, so far as    I have at present made them
out, and their connexion with the spectrum in question.
   The individual observations which 1 have used in the table are
those collected by Mr. Capron and Mr. Backhouse (' Nature,' vol. 7,
pages 182, 463).

II.    " On the Secondary Carpals, Metacarpals, and Digital Rave
        in the Wings of existing Carinate Birds."                          By W. K.
        Parker, F.R.S. Received January 11, 1888.
    In             " On the
         a paper                Morphology of Birds," already sent in to the
 Royal Society, but not yet published, I have described certain addi
 tional parts in the wings of Gallinaceous birds.
     One of these lies on the radial side of the first metacarpal ; the
 other two are on the ulnar side of the second and third metacarpals.
     These parts, which at first caused me considerable surpiise, being
 wholly unexpected by me, are only part of what                 I  have since found
 in other families.
     During the past year I have worked out the development of the
 skeleton in the Duck tribe (" Anatidae "), in the Auk tribe ("Alcid»"),
 and in the Gull tribe (" Laridas "), and to some degree in some other
 families. The subject appears to me to be of great interest, and I
  Lave, through various English and American friends, obtained mam-
  scores of embryos and young birds, &c., that             I   may be able to trace
     * This line is seen as a pretty bright line in the spectrum of the Limerick
  meteorite, but its origin lias not yet been determined, although comparisons h»re
  been made with most of the common elements.       So far, it has not been observed in
  any other meteorite.

1888.J                   Wings    of existing Carinate Birds.                         823
these parts in every main group of the Class.                       Normally, both the
exiiting Carinatae and Ratitae, and such extinct forms as have been
worked out — Archmopteryx, Hesperornis, Ichthyornis —show that the
primary form of the bird's wing is simply tri-digitate. In this I agree
with      Baur, who has helped me greatly in this matter, both by his
valuable papers and also by personal discussion with me.
    The normal " manus             "of    a carinate bird contains two per
manently distinct carpals : three carpals that lose their independence
by ankylosis with the metacarpals, and three digital rays extending
from the three fused metacarpals.
    In some birds, e.ij., the Passerinae, the pollex of the first digit has
only one phalanx attached to its short metacarpal, the second only two,
and the third only one, phalanx. In others, Plovers, Gulls, Cormorants,
&c, an additional or ungual phalanx is found on the first and second
digit ; and in some birds, e.g., Numenius, during their embryonic state,
a small nucleus arm is seen on the end of the aborted phalanx of the
third digit.
     In my as yet uupublished paper I have mentioned a sub-distinct
tract of very solid fibro-cartilage, which evidently corresponds with
 what has been called " prae-pollex " by Kehrer and others.*
     I  am satisfied, now, that this very notable part is the remuant of
the skeleton of the spur, so remarkably developed in the Palamedidae,
 certain Geese, Plovers, and Jacanas.
     This part therefore need not interfere with the consideration of the
 true secondary digital parts.
     Among the last communications received by me from Dr. Baur,
 I find in print what had already learned from him orally.
                            I
     In some " General Notes " published in the ' American Naturalist,'
 September, 1887, p. 839,            I find the following paragraph : " The
 oldest Ichthyopterygia had few phalanges and not more than five
 digits ; [the] radius and ulna were longer than broad, and separated by
 a space.      Later, through the adaptation to the water, more phalanges
 were developed, more digits appeared, mostly by division of the
 former, or by new formation on the ulnar side.                 I   have never found a
 new digit developed on the radial side."
     These are most important facts, some of which, namely, the bifur
 cation of the digital rays, I had received some light upon, before, both
 from Dr. Gadow and from Professor D'Arcy W. Thompson.!
     I find that the carpus, metacarpus, and digital rays are all apt to
 increase in number beyond what is normal.

 324             On the Wings       of existing Carinate Birds.            [Jan. iy,
    Long ago     I  found, in one of the Palamedidae, Chauna ehavarin,
 two ulnar carpals, apparently an
                                            " ulnare " proper, and "centrale."
 More recently in the embryo of a more normal Chenomorph — tbe
 Falkland Island Goose (Chloephaga policephala) I fonnd the ulnare
 nearly divided into two segments.
    On the other side of the carpus in an embryo Kestrel (Falco tinnun-
 cuius) and in a young Sparrow-hawk (Accipiter nisus), I found a
 " radiale " in two pieces, the outer of which in the latter was degene
                           "
 rating into the large os prominens" which is found in the tendon of
                         "
 the " tensor patagii       muscle of rapacious birds.
    In the embryos of Gulls, Auks, Guillemots, &c., the large " distal
         " of the index or second
 carpal                                  digit sends forward a long wedge of
 cartilage  towards     an   additional  metacarpal nucleus.          Evidently this
 is the rudiment of another carpal seeking to be attached to its own
 intercalary metacarpal.
    Further on, on the large second digit, the flat dilated part of the
 proximal phalanx, on its ulnar side, also, is developed from a distinct
 tract of true cartilage, but soon loses its independence ; it forms the
 plate on which some of the primary quills are fixed.
    Further on, on the ulnar side, near the small well-developed
 ungual phalanx of the embryo, but later, after hatching, a small oval
 cartilage appears, and is ossified independently.
    A similar tract of cartilage is formed on tbe pollex or first digit,
also, but is somewhat smaller than that on the second ; it is on the
ulnar side and near the ungual phalanx.
    In the feeble third digit I only find a rudimentary secondary meta
carpal, on the ulnar side; this is very constant throughout the
 Carivatai; and sometimes, as I have already mentioned, there is a
small rudiment of a second phalanx on that digit which, in the Lizard,
has four phalanges.*
    In seeking for evidence of the manner in which these high and
noble hot-blooded feathered forms arose from among the Archaic
Reptilia, I think that something has been gained in what I have
stated above.
    The skull brings evidence of the same sort, during its development,
and it is to ancient long- beaked forms, and not to modern short- faced
types of Reptilia, that we must look for any near relationship of the
Reptiles in the Birds.
                                          I
   In the Guillemot (JJria Iroile) have satisfied myself that there
has been a considerable amount of secular shortening of the beak
(rostrum and fore part of mandibles), and if we look at Dr. Marsh's
figures of Hesperornis and Icldhyornis we shall see what long bills
these toothed birds possessed.
   * The figures of the9e parts. and also of the rest of the developing    skeleton in
these birds — Ducks, Auks, Guillemots,  &c. — are ready for publication.

   But    there  is no part of a developing bird's skeleton that is not
rich with suggestive facts of this kind, as I propose to show in due
time.

    Through the kindness of Professor M'Intosh, to whom my very best
thanks are due, I spent some time last summer at the Marine
Laboratory at Saint Andrews.
    The results given below arose from what were intended to be
control experiments in some observations which aimed at determin
ing, if possible, what organ or system of organs is definitely excretory
in function in the Echiuoderms.
    The common starfish (Asteria-s rubens) was the form used, being
convenient both from its size and from its abundance.
    Indian ink or a precipitated aniline blue was injected into the
coalomic cavity by means of a fine pipette or a hypodermic syringe.
 It was found best to insert the instrument into an arm close to the
 disk, for then the arm is far more rarely thrown off than if the
 puncture is made near its distal end. The specimen was next held
 in different positions so as to distribute the injected fluid.
    The granules that are introduced are ingested by the amceboid
 corpuscles     which float in the ceelomic fluid, as can readily be
 demonstrated      by microscopic examination of that fluid.            The
 granule-laden phagocytes can be seen very plainly, owing to the
 particles they have ingested, in the dermal branchiae of a living
 specimen.      The cilia of the coalomic epithelium cause them to dance
 up   and    down  in the branchia, and to be thrown against its wall.
 Every now and again a corpuscle will adhere, and by repetition of
 this process a small clump may be formed ; this occurs at or near the
 apex of the branchia.
                                                                2 B 2

;528              Mr. H. E. Durham.               The Emigration              of         [Jan.            26,
    The corpuscles after their adhesion to the wall of the branchi*
creep by their amceboid movement through the ccelomic epithelium,
the connective tissue layer, and the epidermis to the exterior (fig.                                       1).
Thus a clump may be formed on the outer side of the branchia, and
the animal   is   freed from some of the irritating particles.
     In these clumps the corpuscles retain their individuality (fig.                                       2),
they do not fuse to form plasmodia such as Geddes* describes in the
so-called clotting of the perivisceral fluid of urchins indeed          ;such            if               i
coalescence did take place the facility for their migration through
tissues would be considerably diminished.
     In cases where the emigration          proceeding exceedingly actively
                                             is
besides the isolated phagocytes that are seen at different depths
                                                                                                  of in

branchial wall on their outward journey, the apices of some                  the
branchke appear to be perforated by an aperture, which                  entirely         is
filled up by a plug of phagocytes (fig.           p). It3,   clear that snch
                                                                        is                                      a
result might be due either to           stretching of the wall by a simulta
                                         a
neous entrance of several phagocytes at a certain point and subsequent
intrusions of others between them, or to an actual rupture or carrying
away of part of the wall by the energy and magnitude of the
 emigration round one patch.          So far as can be made out from serial
 sections the former of these alternatives holds good             there seems, ;
however, to      be no reason why the latter might not also take place.
     Since in preparing Echinoderms for sections              usual to distend
                                                                   it    is
 them with the fixing fluid, should mention that here such treatment
                                 I
 has been avoided.        The specimens were anaesthetisized with chloral
 hydrate, and the gills could then be removed in a distended state,
 while moreover they remained distended after removal.

 corpuscles retain their irregular amceboid shape for a time.              They
 then become spherical and swell up and later they disintegrate, the
 granules they contained being scattered free.
      It was found that besides the corpuscles containing Indian ink
 particles in the extruded material, there occurred amceboid cells
 loaded with refringent granules (fig.             2,moreover

                        A moehoid Corpuscles in            the Starfish.                   329
     In the    slime    these sphaernliferons          corpuscles are seen in various
stages      of disintegration,        held together by a material of slimy
consistency which is, at any rate in part, derived from the swollen-up
stromata of the corpuscles, some doubtless having origin in the
scattered mucous gland cells of the epidermis.                              Besides these
elements a holotrichous infusorian occurred, frequently in consider
able numbers, swimming about and feeding on the freely scattered
granules.         In connexion with this I might also note that on a large
percentage of the specimens of Asterias rubens observed at Saint
Andrews there crawled a species of Caprella. These Caprellae feed on
the above-mentioned             slime ; and those which lived on specimens
treated with aniline blue presented                       particularly gay alimentary
canals.
     As regards the emigration of these sphaeruliferous                 cells,  it is interest
ing to find that Hamann* has recently described and figured the pre
sence of such corpuscles in the wall of the ambulacral gills of Echinids ;
 these are doubtless on their outward journey.                    I might also note here
 that when the dermal branchiae of Asterina gibbosa are slightly, not
 rigidly, distended, they move round and round, more or less circularly,
 so    that their apices rub against the neighbouring ossicles.                            This
 movement might be interpreted as the expression of attempts to
 remove emigrated corpuscles from their surface ; the branchias when
 removed showed sphaeruliferous cells in their wall.
      I hope to make further observations to help to elucidate the mean
 ing of this out-wandering of sphaeruliferous cells, about which at
 present it is impossible to draw up any definite conclusions.                         I desire
  now merely to note its occurrence.
      It seems evident, however, that the starfish has the power of
 removing minute foreign particles introduced into its system ; and
  it is conceivable that in nature such particles might gain admittance
  to the ccelomic cavity when an arm is thrown off.
      It does not seem clear what becomes of insoluble foreign granules
  when they are introduced into other animals, except in the case of
  mammals ; at any rate I have been unable to find any account of an
  actual transportation to the exterior such as has been described
  above.
      Over and above any respiratory function that the dermal branchiae
   may have, they form from their structure convenient places for the
   ont-passage of scavenging amceboid cells.                  Hamannf notes that their
   nerve   supply is very scanty; the well-being of a fine nerve plexus
   would obviously not be added to by amceboid cells traversing it.
      To summarise in a few words — minute foreign bodies introduced
   into the body-cavity of the starfish are removed to the exterior by

conclusion, I       should state that clumps of corpuscles occur, here                        and
there,   in  the   pore    canals    of   the   madreporite         both  of  Asierias     rvbeoi
and Cribrella ocellata as seen in sections.                        The madreporites and
neighbouring        structures      were    removed      from    full-grown specimens and
then placed in hardening fluids : this being so, I think it not impro
bable that these corpuscles came from the cut end of the                            heart," and
arrived at their position by the outward ciliary current, recently
described by Dr. Hartog.*                  It is difficult to conceive that such an
outflow of corpuscles should take place normally ; for then there
must be a continual loss of ordinary as well as of splueruiifertm
corpuscles.

through      the madreporite,          &c., of a full-grown specimen of Cribrelh
ocellata  :   in this series the madreporic canals have a peculiar                      relation
to the stone canal or water-tube.
   Most of the pore canals pass into collecting canals which open into
the stone canal directly : some few, however, lead into the space
below the madreporite, which is the upper extremity of the
"
  schlauchformiger Kanal."                    The stone canal dilates laterally on
each side into an " ampulla," and one of these lateral lobes of the
ampulla has an aperture into the " schlauchformiger Kanal." Now
the " schlauchformiger                Kanal " is derived from the enterocosle
(Hamann),t so that in the specimen described there is a permanent
connexion between the hydroccele cavity and the enteroccele cavity.

      the Saturation Method and the Chemical Method, and

      nicated by R. H. Scott, F.R.S., Secretary to the Meteoro
      logical Council. Received January 17, 1688.
                                  (Abstract.)
    With the exception     of certain " absolute hygrometers," the beha
viour of which has not yet been sufficiently tested, the determination
of the pressure of water- vapour in the air is indirect and requires a
formula of reduction.        The formulae in use are based upon assump
tions which are at present not so completely verified by experiment that
any hygrometric method can be relied upon to give measures of the
pressure of aqueous vapour trustworthy to within 0"1 mm. of mer
cury.     The authority for these statements is given in detail in an
account of the hygrometric work done since 1830.           This account is
appended to the report as Note A.
    In the report, the chemical hygrometric method is provisionally
regarded as a standard.        The formula of reduction applicable in this
case is
                              6
                                 -   760(1 +
                                         \d
                                               ,
                                               h
where    e  is the pressure     of aqueous vapour in millimetres ; /, the
number of grammes of moisture per cubic metre in the air at tempe
rature t°C ; a the coefficient of expansion of air per degree C. ; A the
density of dry air at 0° and 760 mm., i.e., 1293 grammes per cubic
metre ; and d is the specific gravity of the moisture referred to air at
the same temperature      and pressure.
    The assumptions    upon which the formula is based are — (1) That      it
is possi ble to absorb the whole of the moisture from air by passing it over
desiccating substances; and (2) that a numerical value can be assigned
to d. The first assumption has been discussed by Regnault and others,
and is sufficiently nearly accurate for all hygrometric calculations.
With regard to the second, Regnault's direct observations upon steam
 (free from air) and other evidences point to the value 0"622.          The
 assumption can, moreover, be tested, by applying the chemical method
 to air saturated at a known temperature, assuming the value 0°622
 for d, and comparing the results with the table of saturation pressures
 in vacuo.    This, however, assumes Dolton's law to be strictly accurate,
 an open question, upon which opinion is reserved until further experi
 mental investigation is concluded.       Regnault made the comparison in
 sixty-eight experiments, in fifty-nine of which the air was practically
 saturated when it entered the drying tubes.       For these he found that

the     value    0-622 gave results which were less than the tabulated
pressures,      the errors being always of the same sign, but so small in
amount that he neglected them in his subsequent work.
    The ultimate object of the experiments described in the report was
 to examine the behaviour of dew-point instruments in air of known
 state, and for this purpose air was saturated at a known temperature
and drawn by an aspirator through vessels in which the dew-point
instrument could be placed when required, and subsequently through
drying tubes of special pattern.              The vapour-pressure was thus
obtained at the two extremities of the train of apparatus and the
results compared.
    The following questions are raised and discussed : —
    i. Were the drying tubes used as efficient as Begnault's ?
    ii. Does the pressure of vapour in the air become changed by passing
            through the apparatus designed to contain the dew-point
            instruments, or by the mere presence of those instruments
            themselves   ?
   iii. Do the results of the chemical method agree with the tabulated
            vapour-pressures in vacuo when the air is more or less heated
            after being saturated ?
   iv. Can the observed differences between the results be obviated by
            assuming a value for d (other than 0"622), which is com
            patible with values obtained by other methods ?
   v. Can any reason be assigned for the differences observed by Reg-
            nault in the case of saturated air ?
    (i.) The answer to the first question is given in an account of         a
series of twelve experiments          practically repeating Regnanlt's obser
vations with saturated air.          The tabulated results show divergences
in the same direction and of the same order of magnitude as those in
Regnault's paper.         Some incidental points are also discussed namely,
the comparative        efficiency of phosphoric anhydride, sulphuric acid,
and calcium chloride, and the effect of india-rubber and glass con
nexions between drying tubes.            It is shown that the sulphuric acid
and phosphoric anhydride            tubes  are efficient, that as a rule one
tube is all that is strictly necessary, but that two should be used to
provide for the case of exhaustion of the first tube or too rapid flow
of air, and further, that the glass and mercury connexions between
the tubes employed in the second series of experiments cannot be
regarded as producing any effect.
    (ii and iii.) The answers to the second and third questions are fur
nished by the results of eighty-two experiments with the chemical
method upon air saturated at known temperatures by a specially designed
" saturater " in a water bath.           The temperatures of saturation lay
between      1°  C. and 21° C., and, with one exception, were below the tern

1888:]             Report on Hygrometric Methods.                      335
perature of the surrounding air.     Each experiment involved upwards
of thirty readings   of weight, pressure, and temperature.      The tem
perature readings were corrected by means of a special comparison at
Kew. Of the eighty-two observations thirty-two are retained as being
free from any known disturbing causes, and from them it appears
that, with d equal to 0"622, the pressure deduced by the chemical
method is on the average greater by 0 03 mm. than that given in
Regnault's table of vacuum pressures, as recalculated in Landolt and
Bornstein's tables.    This difference is very small compared with the
discrepancies from Dalton's Law observed by Regnault in the. case of
water vapour.
   (iv.) With regard to the fourth question ; if the observations be
employed to determine the value which must be substituted for d, the
specific gravity of saturated steam referred to air at the same tem
perature and pressure, the mean value of d so obtained is 06245,
which agrees very closely with 0"6240, the mean value for the same
range of temperature deduced from Clausius's calculations based on
thermodynamical reasoning.       The value 0-622 is probably correct if the
air is not nearly saturated ; in that case the measure of the pressure of
vapour in the air is 2/622 greater than it would be if the same air were
reduced in temperature (at constant pressure), until it was saturated.
   (v.) The one observation of the second series with saturated air
gives a result 0-18 mm. smaller than the tabulated pressure, and thus
with the twelve experiments of the first series confirms the results of
Regnault's observations. To account for this, it is suggested that
air which is very nearly or quite saturated, would deposit some of its
moisture on the glass tubes used to conduct it from one vessel to
another.    This behaviour of nearly saturated air has been already
noticed, and it is confirmed by the observations on dew-point in
struments, and moreover, by experiments directly intended for the
purpose, quoted in a note.
   Details are given of observations   with Regnault's hygrometer and
Dines's hygrometer when exposed in glass vessels between the satu-
rater and the drying tube.      The two instruments are separately dis
cussed. With Regnault's instrument, after some practice, two different
observers obtained practically identical results.    In ordinary observa
tions, the observed temperatures of the dew-point were below the
temperature of saturation, but seldom by more than 0-1° C. A con
siderable amount of uncertainty was shown to be attached to the
readings, and by very close inspection readings of the dew-point were
obtained above the temperature of saturation, in one case by as much
as 07° C.
   From the experiments with Dines's hygrometer, it appears that the
instrument is likely to give very easy determinations of the dew-point
 thut are within small limits of error; but that if the instrument be

observed with the closest attention, the resnlt    will be considerably too
high in consequence of the formation of a dew deposit at a tempera
ture above the true dew-point, and it may possibly be erroneous in
consequence of variations in temperature of the different parts of the
box containing the thermometer.
  An account is given of Alluard's modification of Regnault's hygro
meter, and of Bogen's hygrometer.
  A  second   note, B, is appended to the report, showing the tables
nsed in various countries for the reduction of wet and dry bulb obser
vations.

I. " On Tidal Currents in the Ocean." By J. Y. BUCHANAN,
      M.A., F.R.S.E. Communicated by the late Sir Frederick
      Evans, K.C.B., R.N., Hydrographer to the Admiralty.
      Received March 24, 1884. Received after revision January
      23, 1888.
   It is frequently asserted and commonly believed that tidal currents
do not exist iu the open ocean or in waters remote from land.
Oceanic currents, that is, streams which set more or less constantly
in one general direction, are well-known and, from their importance
to navigation, have been the objects of much study.        Chief among
these may be mentioned the Gulf Stream and the Equatorial Cur
rents in both oceans. The data on which almost all our information
connected with these streams rests are furnished by the logs of ships
traversing them.     When the position of the ship is determined from
day to day by good astronomical observations on the one hand, and
the courses and distances sailed are carefully observed and noted on
the other, it is usual, after allowing for known perturbing causes, to
ascribe the differences between the positions as ascertained by "ob
servation " and by " dead reckoning " to the effect of a current. As
in the ordinary routine of a sea-going ship, the positions are made
up from noon to noon, the strength and direction of the current so
deduced is the integral resultant " set " of the previous twenty-four
hours.    The direction and strength of the current may have changed
in any way during that time, and it would be nearly impossible to
detect such changes.     The period of twenty-four hours corresponds
closely with that of the tidal wave, consequently in the time elapsing
between two successive noons, whatever effect may have been due to
a tidal cause will have completely reproduced itself twice over and a
very little more. The resultant current due to the tide during the
two complete periods will be nothing, and the only resultant current
affecting the day's reckoning will be that due to the difference be

1888.]                On Tidal Currents in the Ocean.                    341
tween the solar and lunar day.        From the nature of the observations
the effect due to this would not be easily detected.      It is evident then
that the ordinary method of observing oceanic currents is such as
completely to cloak any tidal effect which may exist.         The proximate
source    of energy for the production of tidal currents is the tidal
 wave.
    Storm    waves are confined   to the surface of the ocean, and break
only in comparatively shallow water. The tidal wave affects the
 deepest oceans to the bottom.        It might, therefore, be reasonably
 expected that, in passing over many of even the deeper ridges which
traverse the ocean bed, its character as an undulation would be
 modified with the production of a true tidal current.        We know that
 in the shallow water surrounding the land and in the bays and inlets
 which indent its coasts, a portion of the tidal energy is dissipated by
the partial transformation of the wave into currents.
    In littoral waters these currents are necessarily exaggerated by the
 confinement produced by the neighbouring land ; but the presence of
a shoal alone, without any dry land in the vicinity, ought to be
 sufficient to produce well-marked and regular tidal currents.
    Considerations of this nature determined me to take the first
opportunity which might offer of putting the matter to the test of
 observation.
    Thanks to the hospitable invitation of the India Rubber, Gutta
 Percha, and Telegraph Works Company, of Silvertown,               I had the
 good fortune to spend the months of October and November, of 1883,
on board the s.s. " Dacia," one of their excellently equipped cable
                                        " International," was sent out to
 ships, which, along with the s.s.
 connect Cadiz with the principal islands of the Canary Group by
 means of a telegraph cable.       The whole expedition was under the
command of the Company's Telegraphic Engineer-in-chief, Mr. Robert
 Kaye Gray, to whom        I  am particularly indebted for the facilities
 which were afforded me in carrying out this and many other investi
 gations, and I beg publicly to tender him my best thanks.
    In the course of the sounding operations carried out with a view of
 gaining a thorough acquaintance with the depth and nature of the
 sea bottom,    over which it was proposed to lay the cable, many
 remarkable inequalities were met with.        Perhaps the most striking
 was one which was called the
                                  " Dacia Bank," after the ship on which
 it was discovered.    This bank, which occupies a surface of 50 square
 miles with less than 100 fathoms of water on it, rises rapidly from the
 prevailing depth of 1800 or 1900 fathoms to within 500 fathoms of the
 surface,  whence the slope is very abrupt and in many places precipitous
 to within 100 fathoms of the surface.        As the bank lay close to the
 proposed   route of the cable, two days were spent in surveying it care
 fully.   In order to   have a fixed point to refer the soundings to, a
                                                                2 c 2

   mark-buoy was anchored in 175 fathoms, just outside the precipitous
   edge of the bank.
       On the afternoon of the 21st October, 1883,   I spent several hours
   in one of the ship's boats made fast to this buoy, and during that
   time  I  made frequent observations of the rate and direction of the
   surface current as well as of the general direction of the under
   current.   (See Table I.)
      It had been observed during the previous day and night that at
   times the current set strongly to the southward, at other times
   became nearly slack and even ran to the northward.            While the
  boat was being lowered and got away the ship drifted very slowly to
  the northward past the buoy and against a light northerly air blowing
  at the time.    When the boat was made fast to the buoy the current
  was found setting to the northward, against the wind and sea, and
  measures were immediately taken for determining its direction and
 velocity at frequent intervals. For this purpose an ordinary life-buoy
 was attached to the end of a line which was marked at every fifth
 fathom with a piece of wood, which also served the purpose of keep
  ing the line afloat and of showing whether it was going out straight
 or not. Although the wind was only barely perceptible, it was found
 to retard the life-buoy.    An arrangement of canvas was accordingly
 weighted and hung down in the axis of the buoy.          This greatly in
 creased its hold on the water and made its movements dependent
 only on the current. The direction of the current was observed with
 a pocket azimuth compass for use on land.          Although there was
 hardly any wind, there was a considerable swell coming up from the
 north, but it did not produce any motion sufficiently violent to in
 terfere with the use of the compass.      In order, however, to remove
 any uncertainty, which might have existed with regard to the
 correctness of the bearings so observed,    I always took a bearing of
the sun at the same time, as an index of the trustworthiness of the
eurrent observations.
     No accurate measurements were made of the under current, but
while the surface current was being observed a tow-net lashed to a
sonnding line was lowered to 35 fathoms for one hour, and to
70 fathoms also for an hour.      The directon taken by the sounding
line showed that down to 75 fathoms the direction inclined slightly
more to the eastward than the surface current, and its strength seemed
to be   slightly greater.
     The observed bearings of the sun give for the local variation 17° W.,
17° W., 21° W., 21° W.        According to the chart the variation is
19° W.      The bearings therefore as determined in the boat may be
depended on to a quarter of a point.
     Time was taken by a watch set to       local time. In letting the
current log run out care was taken to put no strain on the line, so

    " It will be seen from these observations that, in two hours,                 the
 current had shifted its direction through 90°, and had passed through
 a minimum velocity of 0' 26 per hour without there having been any
 period of slack water.' The observations are too few in number to-
             '
 make it worth while submitting them to analysis, but a little study
 of them will show that they indicate a current which is the resultant
 of a constant current and a periodic one. A constant current running
 S.E. by E., combined with a tidal current running N.N.W. and
 S.S.E., the maximum velocity of which, in either direction, is twice
 that of the permanent current, would give a resultant current
 agreeing fairly with that observed."*
    In these circumstances, during a complete tidal interval the water
 flows along an S-like path, and in the twenty-four hours it describes
 two such figures, and moves on in a zig--ag course.                 It is apparent
 that the integral drift in the twenty-four hours is that due to the
 constant current alone independently of the tidal current.                       The
 same holds for twelve hours.            Hence, if observations are carried on
 at frequent and regular intervals for twelve hours, we are able to
determine both the constant current and the tidal current superposed
on it, and it is to be hoped that when
                                                they can be mado they will not
be neglected by surveying ships and
                                              telegraph ships.
    Many banks are already known in the North Atlantic on which such
observations could conveniently be made, and there are probably many
more scattered about the
                                 ocean, for instance, on the ridge called after
the U.S.S. "Dolphin," which
                                       extends along a somewhat crooked line
from the Azores to Tristan

should, if possible, be moored with two lines to prevent swaying.       In
cable ships large nxushroom anchors with heavy chain bridles are in
common use.        If  one of them is dropped, a ship's boat may be
anchored to it with no more line than is required to reach the bottom,
and be in no danger of swaying.          Similar observations should be
made also from a boat anchored      in very deep water.
   No measurements were made of the under current, but by sinking
a tow-net made fast to a sounding line, it was seen to be running in
the same direction as the surface current, and apparently with much
the same velocity.        In the channels between the Canary Islands
where even on the shallowest ridges the water is over 1000 fathoms
in depth, the tidal current reaches to the very bottom, and its scour
ing action is shown by the nature of the bottom. To seaward in
1800 to 2000 fathoms the bottom is a fine Globigerina ooze, which
gets coarser and sandier as the water shoals in the channels, till on
the summit ridge there is generally no deposit at all, and the bottom
is rock or coral coated with black oxide of manganese.         Round the
western end of Tenerife the tide runs violently causing rips and over
falls.   Much rocky ground is met with in the North Atlantic in
depths of even 1300 and 1400 fathoms, especially on the ridge which
extends through the whole length of that ocean.         It is not unlikely
that the summit edge of this ridge is swept clean through the greater
part of its length, and it must be remembered that the removal of
sediment from one part of the ocean bottom means its deposit in
greater abundance in others, and especially in hollows in the neigh
bourhood of the ridge.      Hence a sounding in " ooze or clay " in one
position furnishes no argument against the trustworthiness of another
sounding in the vicinity and in equally deep water on " rock " or
" hard                Such ridges are great enemies to telegraph cables,
        ground."
for while the tidal currents keep the rock-surface clean, they also
tend to give the cable an oscillating or surging motion, which is apt
to bring it in rubbing contact with the rock-surface and so to wear it
through.     On the other hand these currents, in sweeping clean the
rocky eminences at the bottom of the ocean, prepare a lodging place
for deep-sea corals, and bring food to them when settled, thus enabling
them to build up their pillar-like banks, a very fine example of which
was discovered and surveyed by the
                                          " Dacia " on the 12th

1883.    It lies in lat. 34° 57' N., long. 13° 57' W., and the shoalest
sounding was 435 fathoms.       The surface of the bank was locally very
rough,  and   sloped gradually to the edge in about 550 fathoms, when
it terminated in an actual precipice, dropping to 835 fathoms in one
place.
   The coral on this bank was living and growing in the greatest
luxuriance, and many specimens which were brought up showed that
the living corals were growing on a mass of dead ones.         There can

therefore be little doubt that in this case we have a submarine bank
which is in vigorous growth towards the surface, and which has been
in existence long enough to have risen through a height of about 30)
fathoms or 1800 feet.       I  have little doubt that in a large number of
the coral islands of the Pacific, the intermediate platform between
the tropical reef-building coral and the volcanic peak, platean, and
ridge, which most probably form the foundation, is formed by these
deep-sea corals largely assisted by annelids, especially Serpulas, which
secrete calcareous tubes.      The tidal currents assist their growth both
by bringing the animals nourishment and by removing light debrii
which might choke them.

   In a former communication the authors described simultaneously
with Dr. Huggins the strongest portion of the spectrum of water,
subsequently they described a second less strong but more refrangible
section of the same spectrum.            M. Deslandres has noticed a third
still more refrangible section. The authors now find that the spectrum
extends, with diminishing intensity, into the visible region on the one
hand, and far into the ultra-violet on the other.            These faint parts of
the spectrum they have photographed, using the dispersion of a single
calcite prism and a lengthened exposure ; and in the present com
munication they give a map of the whole extent observed, and a list of
wave-lengths of upwards of 780 lines.

   The spectrum exhibits the appearance of a series of rhythmical
groups more or less overlapping one another, and the arrangement of
the lines in these groups is shown to follow, in many cases, the law
that the distances between the lines, as measured in wave-lengths, are
in an arithmetic progression. M. Deslandres had previously announced
that the succession of lines in A, B, and « follow this law when
their distances are measured in reciprocals of wave-lengths, and he has
stated that the groups A, B, and a have counterparts in the spectrum
of water. The authors find a striking resemblance between those
groups and certain parts of the water spectrum, but no exact corre
spondence.
   Dr. Grtlnwald, of Prague, predicted on theoretical grounds that
certain lines would appear in the spectrum of water, and the authors
have found a considerable number of lines which tally closely with
Dr. Griinwald's predictions, some of them, in the extremities of the
spectrum, heing the strongest lines observed in those regions.

I. " The Small Free Vibrations and Deformation of a Thin
     Elastic Shell." By A. E. H. Love, BA., Fellow of St. John's
     College, Cambridge.       Received January 19, 1888.
                                (Abstract.)
   In this paper the method employed by Kirchhoff and Clebsch for
the treatment of a thin plane plate is applied to the case of a thin
shell, or plate of finite curvature.   The form of the potential-energy-
function for the strain in an element of the shell is the same as that
obtained by Kirchhoff for a plate, the quantities depending on the
curvature of the surface being replaced by the difference of their
values in the strained and unstrained states.      It is proved that only
for an inextensible spherical surface is this function the same function
of the changes of principal curvature as for a plane plate. The
general equations of equilibrium and small motion under the action
of any system of forces are formed. It is shown that in general the
shell cannot vibrate in such a manner that no line on the middle-
surface is altered in length, because this condition makes it impos
sible to satisfy the boundary conditions which hold at a free edge.
It then appears that approximate equations of motion may be taken,
in which the terms of the potential energy depending on the bending
may be neglected, and only those depending on the stretching need
be retained.    It is shown that surfaces of uniform curvature with no
bounding edges are the only ones which admit of purely normal
vibrations, and that vibrations in which the displacement is purely
tangential are possible on all shells whose middle-surfaces are surfaces
of revolution bounded by small circles. The cases of the spherical
and cylindrical shell receive special discussion.           The equations
of motion can always be solved, but solutions of      the frequency equa
tions could only be obtained in case the displacement was symmetrical
about the axis.    The application of the general equations to problems
of equilibrium is illustrated in the case of spherical shells, for which

the equations can be solved ; some special examples are given. For
the sake of greater intelligibility, I have included an historical
account of previous theories of plane plates and shells, a description
of the method of the present paper, and a summary recapitulating
the chief physical results.
II.    " True Teeth in the young Ornithorhynchus paradoxus" By
        Edward B. Poulton, M.A., F.L.S., of Jesus and Keble
        Colleges, Oxford. Communicated by W. K. Parker, F.R.S.
        Received January 26, 1888.
    For   the purpose of continuing          some recent work upon various
epidermic      structures    in  Ornithorhynchus, Dr. Parker very kindly
placed his most valuable material at my disposal. Among other things
was a series of consecutive vertical transverse sections through the
head of a young individual, about 8"3 decimetres long, when in the
curled-up attitude in which it had been received, and which was
fixed by the spirit.         In this specimen only the larger hairs had
appeared above the surface of the skin.
    The sections had been prepared for Dr. Parker by his son, Professor
 W. Newton Parker, of Cardiff, and although intended for the investi
gation of morphological points in connexion with the development and
 structure of the skull, many of them were in every way adapted for
 minute histological investigation.          Examining these sections I found
 that large and apparently typical mammalian teeth were developing
 in the subepithelial tissues on each side of the roof of the mouth.                 1
 at once communicated with Dr. Parker, telling him of the discovery,
 and enquiring whether he had any objection to the publication of the
 fact.    Dr. Parker replied, and urged me to at once communicate the
 discovery to the Royal Society, at the same time offering me material
 in the most free and generous manner for the further investigation of
 the dental structures in Ornithorhynchus and in Echidna (if present
 in the latter).      When it is remembered that Dr. Parker had put the
 sections aside for a time in consequence of the press of other work,
 intending soon to make use of them for the investigation of the skull,
 it will be seen at once that my association with this discovery is
  purely accidental, and that I have been treated in an extremely
 generous spirit.
     As the lower jaw was not included in the sections,                I  cannot yet
  state that teeth are present in it, but there is little doubt that this is
  the case.*     Teeth were present in the upper jaw, in thirty sections
  through the head, and of these all, except the nine anterior sections,
  included some part of the eye. The teeth probably represent some
      * I have since found that teeth are present in the lower jaw. — Feb. 6, 1888.

 this conclusion. — Feb. 6, 1888.

 being present upon each side of each jaw.      The two posterior teeth have many
 cusps, and the two largest of these looked like separate teeth in sections.    The true
 shape has been shown by a dissected preparation of the lower jaw.— Feb. G, 1888.

    There can be no doubt that these structures are characteristic
 Mammalian teeth, and their appearance harmonises well with the
 results of Hertwig's researches on the structure and development of
 Placoid scales. His researches indicate that the Mammalian teeth are
 probably in a more ancestral condition than any other organ possessed
 by the adult.      They mnst have been derived at one time from Proto-
 therian ancestors, and yet existing Prototheria were not known to
 possess them. Their occurrence in Ornithorhynchus, therefore, supplies
 the step just where it is wanted, and the fact that they are practically
 identical with the teeth of higher mammals is a further indication of
 the ancestral nature of these structures, for other higher mammalian
 features represented in the Prototheria are profoundly modified in the
 latter.
    Dr. Parker has very kindly placed his material at my disposal, so
 that I propose to at once investigate, and shall shortly publish a paper
 upon, the nature of the teeth in the lower jaw of Ornithorhynchus
 and in Echidna (for it is in every way probable that they will be found
 in this genus also). I also intend to work at the mature organism,
 ture, although  in some sections it has been rendered apparently homogeneous,
 probably  by some method of preparation. — Feb. 6, 1888.

    The appearance of Professor Cooke's important memoir upon the
atomic weights of hydrogen and oxygenf induces me to communicate to

the Royal Society a notice of the results that have obtained with respect
to the relative densities of these gases.                  My motive for undertaking
this investigation, planned in 1882,{ was the same as that which
animated Professor Cooke, namely, the desire to examine whether the
relative atomic weights of the two bodies really deviated from the simple
l-atio 1 : 16, demanded by Prout's Law. For this purpose a knowledge
of the densities is not of itself sufficient ; but it appeared to me that
the other factor involved, viz., the relative atomic volumes of the two
gases, could be measured with great accuracy by eudiometric methods,
and      I   was aware that Mr. Scott had in view a redetermination of this
number, since in great part carried out.§                    If both investigations are

conducted with gases under the normal atmospheric conditions as to
temperature and pressure, any small departures from the laws of
Boyle and Charles will be practically without influence upon the final
number representing the ratio of atomic weights.
     In weighing the gas the procedure of Regnault was adopted, the
working globe being compensated by a similar closed globe of the same
external volume, made of the same kind of glass, and of nearly the
same weight. In this way the weighings are rendered independent of
the atmospheric conditions, and only small weights are required. The
weight of the globe used in the experiments here to be described was
about 200 grams, and the contents were about 1800 c.c.
     The balance is by Oertling, and readings with successive release-
ments of the beam and pans, but without removal of the globes,
usually agreed to T$th. mgrm. Each recorded weighing is the mean
 of the results of several releasements.
      The balance was situated in a cellar, where temperature was very
 constant, but at certain times the air currents, described by Professor
 Cooke, were very plainly noticeable.           The beam left swinging over
 night would be found still in motion when the weighings were com
 menced on the following morning. At other times these currents
 were absent, and the beam would settle down to almost absolute rest.
 This difference of behaviour was found to depend upon the distribution
 of temperature at various levels in the room. A delicate thermopile
 with reflecting cones was arranged so that one cone pointed towards
 the ceiling and the other to the floor. When the galvanometer indi
 cated that the ceiling was the warmer, the balance behaved well, and
 vice versa. The reason is of course that air is stable when the tem
 perature increases upwards, and unstable when heat is communicated
 below.        During the winter months the ground was usually warmer
 than the rest of the room, and air currents developed themselves in
 the weighing closet. During the summer the air cooled by contact
  with the ground remained as a layer below, and the balance was
  undisturbed.
       The principal difference to be noted between my arrangements and
  those of Professor Cooke is that in my case no desiccators were used
  within the weighing closet. The general air of the room was pre
  vented from getting too damp by means of a large blanket, occa
  sionally removed and dried before a fire.*
       In Regnault's experiments the globe was filled with gas to the
  atmospheric pressure (determined by an independent barometer), and
  the temperature was maintained at zero by a bath of ice.             The use of
  ice is no doubt to be recommended in the case of the heavier gases ;
  but it involves a cleaning of the globe, and therefore diminishes some-
      *  I can strongly recommend this method. In twenty-four hours the blanket will
   frequently absorb two pounds of moisture.

tented myself with enclosing the body of the globe during the process
of filling in a wooden box, into which passed the bulbs of two ther
mometers, reading to tenths of    degree centigrade.
                                   a                      It seems probable
that the mean of the readings.represents the temperature of the gag
to about -nith degree, or at any rate that the differences of temperature
on various occasions and with various gases will be given to at least
this degree of accuracy.     Indeed the results obtained with oxygen
exclude a greater uncertainty.
   Under these conditions the alternate full and empty weighings can
be effected with the minimum of interference with the surface of the
globe.    The stalk and tap were only touched with a glove, and the
body of the globe was scarcely touched at all. To make the symmetry
as complete as possible, the counterpoising globe was provided with
a similar case, and was carried backwards and forwards between the
balance    room and the laboratory exactly as was necessary for the
working globe.
    In my earliest experiments (1885) hydrogen and oxygen were pre
pared simultaneously in a     (J-shaped voltameter containing dilate sul
phuric acid. Since the same quantity of acid can be used indefinitely,
I  hoped in this way to eliminate all extraneous impurity, and to obtain
hydrogen contaminated only by small quantities of oxygen, and vice
versa. The final purification of the gases was to be effected by passing
them through red-hot tubes, and subsequent desiccation with phos
 phoric anhydride. In a few trials       did not succeed in obtaining good
                                         I
 hydrogen, result which
            a              I   was inclined to attribute to the inadequacy
 of a red heat to effect the combination of the small residue of oxygen.*
 Meeting this difficulty, I  abandoned the method for a time, purposing
 to recur to  it after I   had obtained experience with the more usual
 methods of preparing the gases.        In this part of the investigation
 my experience runs nearly parallel with that of Professor Cooke. The
 difficulty of getting quit of the dissolved air when, ast in the ordinary
preparation of hydrogen, the acid is fed in slowly at the time of
 working, induced me to design an apparatus whose action can be
 suspended by breaking an external electrical contact.           It may be
 regarded   asa Smee cell thoroughly enclosed. Two points of difference
 may be noted between this apparatus and that of Professor Cooke. In
 my manner of working        it was necessary that the generator should

stand an internal vacuum.               To guard more thoroughly against the
penetration of external air, every cemented joint was completely
covered with vaseline, and the vaseline again with water.                Again, the
zincs were in the form of solid sheets, closely surrounding the plati
nised plate on which the hydrogen was liberated, and standing in
mercury.       It was found far better to work these cells by their own
electromotive force, without stimulation by an external battery.                    If
the plates are close, and the contact wires thick, the evolution of gas
may be made more rapid than is necessary, or indeed desirable.
    Tubes, closed by drowned stopcocks, are provided, in order to allow
the acid to be renewed without breaking joints ; but one charge is
sufficient for a set of experiments (three to five fillings), and dnring
the whole of the time occupied (10 to 14 days) there is no access of
atmospheric air. The removal of dissolved air (and other volatile
impnrity) proved, however, not to be so easy as had been expected,
even when assisted by repeated exhaustions, with intermittent evolu
 tion of hydrogen ; and the results often showed a progressive improve
 ment in the hydrogen, even after a somewhat prolonged preliminary
 treatment. In subsequent experiments greater precautions will le
 taken.* Experience showed that good hydrogen could not thus be ob

tained from zinc and ordinary " pure sulphuric acid, or phosphoric
acid, without the aid of purifying agents. The best results so far have
been from sulphuric and hydrochloric acid, when the- gas is passed
in succession over liquid potash, through powdered corrosive subli
mate, and then through powdered caustic potash.                 All the joints of
the purifying tubes are connected by fusion, and a tap separates the
 damp from the dry side of the apparatus. The latter inclndes a
large and long tube charged with phosphoric anhydride, a cotton wool
filter, a blow-off tube sealed with mercury until the filling is com
pleted, besides the globe itself and the Toppler pump.                   A detailed
description is postponed until the experiments are complete.                 It may
be sufficient    to mention     that  there is but one  india-rubber connexion,
— that between the globe and the.r,est of the apparatus, and that the
 leakage through this was usually measured by the Toppler before
 commencing a filling or an evacuation.
    The object of giving a considerable capacity to the phosphoric
 tube was to provide against the danger of a too rapid passage of gas
 through the purifying tubes at the commencement of a filling.                  Sup
 pose the gas to be blowing off, all the apparatus except the globe
 (and the Toppler) being at a pressure somewhat above the atmo
 spheric.     The tap between the damp and dry sides is then closed,
 and that into the globe is opened.           The gas which now enters some-

what rapidly is thoroughly dry, having been in good contact with
the phosphoric anhydride.          In this way the pressure on the dry side
is reduced to about 2 inches of mercury, but this residue is sufficient
to allow the damp side of the apparatus to be exhausted to a still
lower pressure before the tap between the two sides of the apparatus
is reopened.        When this is done, the first movement of the gas is
retrograde ; and there is no danger at any stage of imperfect purifica
tion. The generator is then re-started until the gas (after from two of
five hours) begins to blow off again.
    In closing the globe some precaution is required to secure that
the pressure therein shall really be that measured by the barometer.
The mercury seal is at some distance from, and at a lower level than,
the rest of the apparatus.       After removal of the mercury the flow of
gas is continued for about one minute, and then the tap between the
dry and damp sides is closed.          Prom three to five minutes more were
usually allowed for the complete establishment of equilibrium before
the tap of the globe was turned off. Experiments on oxygen appeared
to show thnt two minutes was sufficient. For measuring the atmo
spheric pressure two standard mercury barometers were employed.
   The evacuations were effected by the Toppler to at least T0oii6'
so that the residual gas (at any rate after one filling with hydrogen)
could be neglected.

   The second column shows that globe (14) and certain platinum
weights were suspended from the left end of the beam, and the third
column that (in this series) only the counterpoising globe (11) was
hung from the right end. The fourth column gives the mean balance
reading in divisions of the scale, each of which (at the time of the
above experiments) represented 0*000187 gram.              The degree of agree
ment of these numbers in the first part of the table gives an idea of
the errors due to the balance, and to uncertainties in the condition of
the exteriors of the globes. A minute and unsystematic correction
depending upon imperfect compensation of volumes (to the extent of
about 2 c.c.) need not here be regarded.
   The weight of the hydrogen at each filling is deduced, whenever
                                     "      "
possible, by comparison of the full reading with the mean of the
immediately preceding and following
                                                  " empty " readings. The
difference, interpreted in grams, is taken provisionally as the weight
of the gas. Thus for the filling of Nov. 5 —
                 H = 0-154-2-25 x        0-000187    = 0-15358.
   The weights thus obtained depend of course upon the temperature
and pressure at the time of filling.          Reduced to correspond with a
temperature     of  12°, and to a barometric height of 30 inches (but
without a minute correction for varying temperature of the mercury)
they stand thus —
                      November 5                    0-15811
                                   8                0- 15807
                            „    10                 0-15798
                                  12                0- 15792
                                   Mean            0-15802
   The hydrogen obtained hitherto with similar apparatus and puri
fying tubes from hydrochloric acid is not quite so light, the mean of
two accordant series being 0'15812.
   The weighing of oxygen is of course a much easier operation than
in the case of hydrogen. The gas was prepared from chlorate of
potash, and from a mixture of the chlorates of potash and soda.
The discrepancies between the individual weighings were no more
than might fairly be attributed to thermometric and manometric
errors. The result reduced so as to correspond in all respects with
the numbers for hydrogen is 2 5186.*
    But before these numbers can be compared with the object of
obtaining the relative densities, a correction of some importance is
required, which appears to have been overlooked by Professor Cooke,
   • An  examination of the weights revealed no error worth taking into account at
present.

 3(52          Relative Densities of Hydrogen and Oiygen.      [Feb.   P,
as   it was by Regnanlt.   The weight of the gas is not to be found bj
merely taking the difference of the full and empty weighings, unless
indeed the weighings are conducted in vacuo. The external volume
of the globe is larger when it is full than when it is empty, and the
weight of the air corresponding to this difference of volume must be
 added to the apparent weight of the gas.
    By filling the globe with carefully boiled water, it is not difficult
to determine experimentally the expansion per atmosphere.          In the
case of globe (14) it appears that nnder normal atmospheric condi
tions the quantity to be added to the apparent weights of the
hydrogen and oxygen is 0-00056 gram.
    The actually observed alteration of volume (regard being had to
the compressibility of water) agrees very nearly with an d priori
estimate, founded upon the theory of thin spherical elastic shells and
the known properties of glass.          The proportional value of the
required correction, in my case about 16*66 of the weight of the
hydrogen, will be for spherical globes proportional to ajt, where
a is the radius of the globe, and t the thickness of the shell,
or -to V/W, if V be the contents, and W the weight of the glass.
This ratio is nearly the same for Professor Cooke's globe and for
mine ; but the much greater departure of his globe from the spherical
form may increase the amount of the correction which ought to be
introduced.
    In the estimates now to be given, which must be regarded as pro
visional, the apparent weight of the hydrogen is taken at 0-15804, so
that the real weight is 0-15860.     The, weight of the same volume of
oxygen under the same conditions is 2 5 186 + 0 0006 = 2 5192. The
ratio of these numbers is 15-884.
   The ratio of densities found by Regnault was 15-964, but the
greater part of the difference may well be accounted for by the omis
sion of the correction just now considered.
    In order to interpret our result as a ratio of atomic weights, we
need to know accurately the ratio of atomic volumes.        The number
given as most probable by Mr. Scott in May, 1887,* was 1 994, but
he informs me that more recent experiments under improved condi-
tions give l-9965. Combining this with the ratio of densities, we
obtain as the ratio of atomic weights —
                          2x15-884
                                       = 15-912.
                           1-9965
    It is not improbable that experiments conducted on the same lines,
but with still greater precautions, may raise the final number by one
or even two thousandths of its value.
    The ratio obtained by Professor Cooke is 15-953 ; but the difference
                                * Loc. -t.

between this number and that above obtained may be more than
accounted for, if I am right in my suggestion that his gas weighings
require correction for the diminished buoyancy of the globe when the
internal pressure is removed.

        Physician to Gny's Hospital.              Communicated by Professor

    Fibrinogen is a name conveniently given to a group of proteid sub
 stances which can all be Converted under certain conditions into
 fibrin. They exist in blood plasma (in traces in certain kinds of blood
 serum), and they can be prepared from almost all animal tissues
 (thymus, testis, brain, liver, kidney, stroma of red corpuscles, &c).
    They differ slightly in their behaviour towards various reagents,
 but they have a number of characters in common.                        They are all
 extremely easily changed by precipitation.              In their  normal    condition
                                 ....

 tbey are easily soluble in water (" soluble                              dissolved in
 milk). They are readily precipitated by acetic acid in excess, and
 dilute mineral acids in slight excess. If more dilute acid be added
 they . are re-dissolved.*                                                     .
     On adding pepsin to the acid solution and maintaining the mixture
 at a temperature of 37° for some hours, a very marked precipitate
  makes its appearance.         This precipitate is not dissolved if the artificial
  digestion be continued for many days.               Freshly formed, it is easily
  soluble in dilute alkalis, but not in dilute acids.                 It dissolves in
  strong nitric acid, giving a yellow or yellowish-green solution, which
  gives a marked xanthoproteic reaction on warming and adding ammo
  nia.    On incinerating it leaves a markedly acid ash. If it be burnt
  with a little soda and saltpetre the ash is found to be extremely rich
  in phosphoric acid.
     The phosphorus is present in the form of lecithin.
     The alcoholic extract of even very small quantities of the precipitate
  contains relatively very large quantities of lecithin.
     After complete extraction with alcohol there is either no phosphorus
    *  It is to be noted that fibrinogens are easily changed in this respect by precipi
  tation.

 at all in the ash, or a very dubious trace, due probably to imperfect
 extraction.
     The ash always contains iron, and the iron is not removed from the
 precipitate by extraction with alcohol containing hydrochloric acid.
 This description applies equally to the fibrinogen obtained from the
 tissues and the fibrinogens present in blood.*
     Under appropriate conditions these fibrinogens can be entirely con
 verted into fibrin.       The fibrin always contains lecithin ; but fibrin
  differs from the fibrinogens from which it is formed by being abso
 lutely and entirely soluble in artificial gastric juice. This remarkable
 difference in the behaviour of the two classes of substances towards
 artificial gastric juice is considered by the author as strong evidence
 that the relation between the lecithin and the proteid which both
 bodies contain must be different in the two cases.
     That lecithin was a very important factor in coagulation was shown
 by the author many years ago, and this fact has been fully confirmed
 by pupils of Alexander Schmidt (Nauck, Samson-Himmelstjeraa,
 Kriiger).
     Ordinary fibrin obtained by whipping blood always leaves an undi
 gested residue, due partly to the presence of admixed white corpuscles
 (Hammarsten), partly, however, to its containing unchanged fibrino
 gen.     Fibrin obtained from pure fibrinogen fluids by artificially
 induced coagulation is always completely digestible if care be taken
 that it contains no unchanged fibrinogen. The fibrin obtained by the
 action of ferment on fibrinogen is- always completely digestible
 (Hammarsten).

    This is a modification of Hesse's well-known process.                It consists
essentially in the substitution of a flat-bottomed conical flask for a
Hesse's tube.       Its chief advantages are: —(1.) Much smaller cost of
flask and fittings as compared with Hesse's tubes ; (2.) Very many
fewer breakages during sterilisation ; (3.) Great economy in jelly ;
(4.) Freedom from leakage during sterilisation ; (5.) Results not
vitiated by aerial currents.

    Air." By Professor Carnellev, D.Sc, and THOS. WlLSON,
    University College, Dundee. Communicated by Sir Henry
    Roscoe, F.R.S. Received February 3, 1888.
  As no determinations appear to have been made of the number of
micro-organisms in moorland air, the following results obtained last
summer may be of interest as forming a small contribution to our
knowledge of the distribution of micro-organisms in the air of
different localities.
   Our determinations were made " on the heather" in the neigh
bourhood of Midtown, in the parish of Tanadice, in Forfarshire.
This forms a part of the Clova district, so well known to botanists as
the habitat of many rare mountain and moorland plants. Midtown
is situated at a height of about 1000 feet above the level of the sea,
and is far removed from towns and other sources of contamination,
as is evidenced by the fact that the nearest railway is about six miles
away.
   We also made simultaneous estimations of the carbonic acid by
Pettenkofer's method.    The process employed for the determination
of the micro-organisms was the " flask method," which we have
already described in a previous paper.     The samples of air were
taken at a height of about 3 feet from the ground. The results
obtained are represented in the following table. 10 litres of air were
aspirated in each case.  More determinations would have been made,
but owing to an accident the remainder of the flasks were unfor
tunately spoilt.

    The weather had been fine and dry for a long time previous to
August 9th, but between that and the 15th there were several days
of rain.
 . It will thus be seen that not a single sample contained bacteria, and
that   all the micro-organisms      obtained consisted of moulds, amounting       oh
the average to 3-5 per litre.
   Now Miquel and Dr. P. Frankland have each Bhown that the air is
much richer in micro-organisms during the summer than during the
winter, there being a minimum about midwinter                   and a maximum
about July and August, thus : —

    It hence follows that the number of moulds we found in moorland
air was probably a maximum, since the determinations were                 made in
August, and that bacteria are absent all the year round in pure air
from moors and hills away from towns.

moorland air as compared with air from other localities, the following

    George Mivart, M.D., F.R.S.             Received February 14, 1888.
    The recent discovery by Mr. Edward B. Poulton of non-functional
teeth hidden beneath the bony plates of the jaws of the young Orni-
thorhynchus is not only most interesting in itself, but taken in con
nexion with another recent discovery as to the anatomy of that
animal, exceedingly suggestive. It is, of course, easy to assign too
great a value to the forms of teeth, and everyone knows how Cuvier
was thus led to associate the marsupial Carnivora with the placental
 Carnivores. There is an evident temptation also to exaggerate the
significance of dental structure, both on account of the obvious nature
 of such characters and also because they are so exceptionally well
 preserved in fossil remains.       But no zoologist can deny that the
 value of dental characters is often exceedingly great, and when, as in
 the case of Ornithorhynchus,      we have them in the form of living
fossils, as it were, entombed within the jaws, we may fairly presume
 that they show us what their shape was when they were last in
 actual use, and so must possess a greater or less taxonomic value. The
 most valuable evidences of affinity are commonly afforded by struc
 tures less distinctly related to habits of life. Thus, for example, the
 course taken by the internal carotid artery has often a more profound
 significance than has either the structure of the teeth or shape of the
 limbs ; while the possession by any two animals of a prehensile tail
 — in spite of the niceties of structure which concur to produce it —
 cannot alone be accepted as a test that they belong even to the same
 order.
     The shape of the teeth, having a manifest direct relation to condi
 tions of life, requires, then, a very careful criticism before any
 evidence it may seem to afford can be relied on as a test of affinity.
     The Ornithodelphia (Ornithorhynchus and Echidna) have long been
  known to possess characters resembling the Sauropsida and especially
  the Lacertilian Beptilia.       Nevertheless,     no less distinguished   an
  anatomist than Professor Huxley has, so late as 1880, regarded them
  as descendants (through imaginary creatures called Hypotheria) from
  amphibians and not from any of the Sauropsida ;* a view which               I
  myself have also held.
     The most interesting discovery by Mr. Caldwell of the eggs of Ornt-
  thodelfihia, the announcement      of which startled the meeting of the
   British Association in Canada, greatly strengthened the evidence pre
  viously relied on by certain naturalists, that the Omithodelphia
  descended from some Reptilian form, and this view seems to have

 1888.]          possibly Dual Oriyin        of  the Mammalia.                    373
met with general acceptance, and it is similarly supposed that all
other mammals must have followed the same route and must there-
fore also be descendants of some early reptile-like creature.
    The question, therefore, of this resemblance or non-resemblance of
the Ornithorhynchus teeth with any known reptilian teeth becomes a
question of much interest. The author of the recent communication,
Mr. Poulton, affirmed that the teeth were distinctly mammalian
teeth*
    I have long believed that no such teeth were to be found in any of
the Sauropsida, and the conviction I previously entertained has been
confirmed by a recent re-examination (ad hoc) of the dentition of
Reptiles extant and extinct, preserved in the National Collection; and
I  here desire to express my warm thanks to Mr. G. A. Boulenger and
                                                           I
Mr. Lydekker for the very kind and ready help have received from
them.
    The results of my examination may be summed up as follows : —
    The Sauropsidan tooth, from the lowest reptiles to Hesperornis-, may
be described in general terms as a subcorneal structure in which
subsidiary additions or modifications may arise, which, however, never
cause it to resemble a mammalian molar — except, of course, such
exceptional mammalian molars as are themselves mere dental cones —
or to resemble the mandibular tooth described by Mr. Poulton as exist
ing in Ornithorhynchus.       That tooth was said to present the follow
ing   characters : — Towards   its outer edge were two large cusps, one in
front of the other, and opposite to them were four or five very small
ones extending from behind forwards along the inner edge of the
tooth. The tooth above it was said to be conversely constructed, so
that the two interlocked, the greater prominence of the upper tooth
being towards its internal edge.
    Nothing of this kind exists in any reptile. In reptiles the dental
cone may be laterally compressed and serrated at its margin, as in
Megalosaurus ; it may be less laterally compressed but serrated and
furnished with vertical prominences, as in Iguanodon.                    From this
we find transitions to the tricuspid tooth of Cyclura, and the summit
is subdivided into two or three cusps in a multitude of existing
li-ards, while it may assume the form of a fleur-de-lys as in Ambly.
rhynchus.    Very rarely (only in Teius and Dicrodon) there may be a
supplementary prominence on one side, which may attain to within a
short distance of the height of the main cone and thus present the
appearance of a single cone with a deep antero-posteriorly directed
groove. Finally, as in Empedias-f there may be a central prominence
   * "The teeth probably represent    some  part of the molar series   in the higher
mammals."
   t The Empedocles molar is of Cope (see ' Amer. Phil. Soc. Proc.,' vol.  19, p. 47).
The specimens in our national collection are also thus labelled.

accessory prominence            both  on the inner and the outer side of the
central one.          As every one knows, reptilian teeth may become
obtuse    rounded      structures as in Cyclodus and Ada, or almost quite
flattened as in the curious extinct reptiles Lepidotus and Plucodu*.
The Theriodontia* offer examples of teeth more or less like the
incisors and canines of mammals, but exhibit no grinding molar, the
subdivisions of the summits of their molar teeth sometimes, however,
reminding us of the tricuspid molars so common in existing
Lacertilians.
    Such being the negative evidence with respect to the molar teeth of
the Sauropsida, I availed myself of the kind assistance of Mr. Oldficld
Thomas, F.Z.S., in an endeavour to find amongst mammals teeth
like those described as existing in the Ornithorhynchus.                 Although
various forms were seen to present slight              resemblances,  we failed to
obtain any which could be said to bear an unquestionable likeness to
them.
    The ancestors of the Ornithorhynchus which had functional teeth,
must, according to the ordinarily received doctrine of evolution, have
had a general bodily organisation at least as Sauropsidan as that of
the existing Ornithodelphia.             How far back in geological time that
tooth structure existed, we have as yet no evidence ; but we have
abundant evidence that a dentition much like that of some existing
Marsupials already existed during the deposition of the Oolite
strata.      Professor Huxley has expressedf his expectation                     that
generalised ancestors of the Monotremes may be found amongst the
remains "of the terrestrial Vertebrates of the later Palaeozoic
epochs."
    The toothed        ancestor   of the Ornithorhynchus, however, could I
think hardly have been extant at so extremely distant an epoch ; for
then its resemblance in other respects to the Lacertilia would make it
 probable that it had a pretty close connexion with the stem of the
 Sauropsidan tribe. But a connexion so low down seems unlikely,
 now that we are acquainted with its tooth-structure ; since amongst
 the multitude of numerous Sauropsidan species living and extinct, there
 is not one which has inherited a tooth at all like that of the Ornitho
 rhynchus, but the teeth of every one such species is, as above stated,
 formed upon a fundamentally different type ; this could hardly be
 the case if the Ornithorhynchus tooth was derived from some archaic
 form whence the Sauropsida, or any considerable sect ion of them, were
 also derived.        But this tooth if not derived from a non-mammalian
 animal, must either have been derived from some one amongst the

1888.]           possibly Dual Origin   of  the Mammalia.
earliest mammals which first had teeth of the mammalian type, or
have arisen independently.
    Let us first briefly consider the former alternative ; such a mam
malian ancestor must, on the generally received doctrine of evolution,
have had its general organisation like that of an existing Monotreme, or
have been formed on a yet lower type.        In either case if all mammals
furnished with grinding teeth have also proceeded from such early
root form, it is remarkable that none of its descendants save the
Monotremes have inherited those skeletal, cerebral and genito-urinary
peculiarities which characterise the Ornithodelphia, and which, on
this hypothesis, must also have been possessed by the various
ancestors of the different orders of non-monotrematous      mammals.    In
that case, the creatures which came to form all these orders          must
have simultaneously and persistently varied in a single direction,
resulting in that one very definite form of organisation which is com
mon to the placental and marsupial mammals.                 But this will
probably be considered an all but utterly inadmissible supposition.
    If, however, the Ornithorhynchus tooth arose in some much less
primitive mammal, one which was previously edentulous or had but
Sauropsidan teeth, and therefore was not also the progenitor of all the
other mammals with grinding teeth, then such teeth must have twice
arisen independently, and there seems, on this view, no reason to
repudiate the other alternative, namely, that the Ornithorhynchus
teeth might have arisen independently, in relatively modern times, in
what may have been no very remote ancestor of the Ornithorhynchus
itself.   In that case, however, the wonder remains that the Mono
tremes    should  have retained so many Sauropsida-like features which
all other mammals have entirely lost.
    The question then presents itself, is it possible that the Mono
tremes may be instances of degradation ; that they inherit their teeth
from early but ordinary toothed mammals, while their shoulder-
structure, rudimentary corpus callosum, and genito-urinary peculiar
ities are due to degradation and reversion ? It is now considered
by some naturalists that the Amphioxus and the Tunicates are
extremely degraded Vertebrates.
    When we recall to mind such instances amongst the Invertebrata as
Lenieocera and Sacculina, any amount of degradation seems possible.
 As to the corpus callosum, considerable differences exist amongst the
 Placentalia, and it is difficult to see why it might not sometimes
shrink as well as augment, and we must admit that the optic chiasms
 has disappeared in Teleostean fishes, if they had, as would be generally
 admitted, either Ganoid-like or Elasmobranch-like ancestors. A cloaca
 is absent in mammals which are not Monotremes, yet such a structure,
 though very shallow, has reappeared in Rodents and Edentates
  (Beaver and Sloth). The penis is strangely modified, but the pro

duction of the mouth of the cloaca of the female eft, Euproctus, into
an intromittent organ is also startling, and even amongst mammals,
the female of the spotted hyaana with its enormous clitoris, perforated
by the urethra, is wonderfully different from that of the striped hyaena,
otherwise so nearly resembling it in structure. The disconnexion
of the ureters with the bladder is a very important difference,
certainly, but even in placental mammals those ducts shift their
position greatly, as may be seen if we compare Sorex with
Hyrax.
   Moreover, it must be admitted that if the Monotremes had remote
Sauropsidan ancestors (as can hardly,      I think, now be questioned)
then more or less of epicoracoids, interclavicles, &c., must have been
" in their blood," so that reversion is conceivable.        Nevertheless,
I  am far from believing that such a reversion has actually taken
place.   Granted that degradation frequently occurs, yet it would
hardly,  I  think, get so completely on the old lines again. There
is, however, I venture to believe, another less improbable hypo
thesis which    I will now venture to suggest. It is the hypothesis
that the Monotremes come from a radically distinct stock from that
whence all other mammals proceeded ; that the Monotremes are
nn example of hypothetical higher mammals in the making, the
future evolution of which may probably be hindered by man's
presence, but which, did they appear, would produce mammalian
forms more or less parallel to but, of course, radically distinct
from, the placental and marsupial series of mammals.          The latter
series of mammals    — the superior mammals  —  may still be supposed to
have arisen from Amphibia- like root forms, according to the position
defended by Professor Huxley, for which I think there is a great
deal to be said.   The Monotremes, or inferior mammals, on the other
hand, must, I think, be supposed to be derived from Sauropsidan
ancestors, and according to this view the resemblances which exist
between these higher and lower kinds of mammals, including tooth
structure, will be induced resemblances — the two groups having
grown alike through the independent origin of similar structures.
   What evidence is there that the Amphioxus is a degraded animal?
What principle of evolution need hinder us from regarding it as a
possible parent of another line of Vertebrates profoundly different
from the Vertebrates which have come into being ? Each of these
suppositions is alike hypothetical, and a number of similar dilemmas
may be suggested in cases more or less parallel.
   With regard to the Monotremes, however, we have a very solid
reason for regarding them as mammals which have arisen from another
root from the higher (placental and marsupial) Mammalia, namely,
the fundamental difference which, according to Professor Gegeubaur,
exists between their mammary glands and the mammary glands of

1888.]                possibly    Dual Origin of       the  Mammalia.               377
other mammals,*           the one being formed from modified sweat glands,
and the other from sebaceous follicles.                If this distinction is found to
hold good throughout the class, it seems to me difficult to think that
the Mammalia had not this dual origin — an hypothesis which har
monises so well with the differences, skeletal, genito-urinary, and
developmental, which divide these two groups of mammals.
      On this view, the teeth of the toothed Ornithorhynchns ancestor
must have arisen for the first time in a form more reptilian than is
the form of our living Monotremes, yet sufficiently divergent from
the Sauropsidan main stem to explain the non-existence of teeth of
the kind in any known Sauropsidan,. living or fossil.
      To this hypothesis it will probably be at once objected, that
Mr. Caldwell'sf studies of the mammalian ova show a noteworthy
 resemblance between those of the Marsupials and Monotremes.                         But
 if the Marsupials are an offshoot             from,    the   placental mammals,    then
 such resemblances as exist between them and Monotremes in this
 respect must be induced resemblances.                   Moreover, certain very note
 worthy       resemblances       exist  between      the    ova of those exceptional
 Amphibians,          the Ophiomorpha,      and    Sauropsidan        ova. J It  may be
 objected in the second place that the dual hypothesis implies the
 independent origin of too many similar structures. But the inde
 pendent origin of similar structures is a doctrine for which I have
                                                  I         " similar," not " identical."
 combated ever since the year 1869.                   say
 No two leaves in a forest are absolutely alike ; how then could absolute
 resemblance be thought possible between two structures of different
 origin Y Yet the closeness of resemblances between parts which must
  Lave arisen diversely is often remarkable. The Marsupials are now
  regarded as having diverged from the mammalian stem by. some single
  remote ancestor.          Yet amongst its descendants have arisen animals
  some of the teeth of which strikingly resemble some of the teeth of
  beasts of the placental series.             Somo teeth of Perameles and Uro-
  trichus, of Macropus and MacrosceUdes, of Thylacinus and of Canis,
  may be cited as examples ; and though the histological difference of
  the extension of dentinal tubes into the enamel generally obtains in
  the Marsupials, yet it is more marked in the Kangaroos, which are
  the most differentiated forms, while such tubes almost or quite vanish
  in the Dasyuridm, which more nearly resemble ordinary mammals.
   But the most striking similarity of tooth structure is that between
   Orycteropus and Myliobates — a similarity which extends over the micro
   scopic characters.         Again, it would be difficult to find a more curious
   practical resemblance than that between the hinge teeth of Lophius, the

  378           On   the possibly Dual Origin         of the Mammalia.      [Feb.  10,
  Pike, and certain fishes yet undescribed.             The poison fangs of  Serpents
  have also arisen independently, as is certain when we compare the fang of
  Atractaspis with that of Vipera ; quite independently also have arisen
 the poison teeth of Heloderma.                   The scrotum of placentals and the
  singularly placed scrotum of marsupials (so difficult to explain either
       " natural " or " sexual "
  by                                       selection) must also have had a dual
  origin, as the prehensile pes of Didelphys and of the Apes has also
 doubtless had. For my own part I am still disposed to maintain the
 probability, which I long ago asserted, of the independent origin of
 the SimiacUe and the Cebidce, and now Professor Cope brings forward*
 noteworthy reasons for believing that the Horse of America and the
 Horse of Europe have had a widely distinct ancestry, and have grown
 alike from two distinct lines of descent.               Finally I would refer to the
 similar forms of placenta, both umbilical and allantoic, which seem to
 have arisen independently, as atso have the mammary glands of Mono-
 tremes and other mammals.                  Any one who is disposed to think in
 credible the independent origin of a mammalian molar in a diverging
 offshoot from the Sauropsidan tree,                 I  would ask to bear in mind
 the multitude of origins which we must regard as independent,
 and often as quite geologically modern.                     Among them       I would
 enumerate the dentition of Desmodus, Diphylla, and Cheiromyt, and
 especially the very remarkable multicuspidate canines of a Pteropino
 bat (Pteralopex atrata) recently describedf by Mr. Oldfield Thomas.
 What again can be more singular than the wonderful dental diver
 gence between the Narwhall and the Beluga, otherwise so extremely
 alike in structure ? The poison teeth and, as we shall soon learn, the
poison gland and ducts of Heloderma, before referred to, are also most
noteworthy. Again, what is more startling than to find the respiratory
 tail of the young Hylodes and the respiratory ventral folds of Sana
 cpistJwdon?^          The tip of the suout of the young of this animal
 reminds us of the beak of the unhatched chick, though there can be
 doubt but that these structures have arisen independently.                        The
development of this Batrachian recalls to mind the similarity of con
dition of the Axolotl, the larvae of Triton alpestris, and the so-called
Perennibranchiate Batrachians, all of which seem to have acquired a
normal or permanent condition of life resembling that of immature
stages in the existence of their several ancestors.
     Mr. Boulenger has been kind enough to inform me of another case
of the sudden origin of a new character — probably a reversion — which
he has noticed in a Lizard, a species of Gymnophthalmvs.                   Here nor
mally the tail is clothed with scales, quincuncially disposed, as in the

Seines. When the tail has been broken, however, it is reproduced with
an investment of scales arranged in a verticillate manner — a change
which shows how small is the real valae of a difference which has
been deemed by morphologists to be so important a taxonomic character.
And here I would venture to make another observation bearing upon
taxonomy.       The study of the processes of individual development are
of course of great importance in determining the nature of the adult
animal.      Nevertheless that importance may be exaggerated.            Ha n a
opisthodon is no less a Sana because it is never a Tadpole.         The out
come of the process of development is surely as important as the
process itself. Similarly with respect to the evolution of species, the
lines of descent are of the highest interest, but if Professor Cope is right
as to the diverse ancestry of the oriental and occidental Equus, then
surely its importance may be exaggerated also. The genus Equus is
no less one geuus for having arrived at maturity along two distinct
routes. It seems to me probable that various other natural groups,
which are commonly regarded, and          I think truly regarded, as natural
unities, have become one from various sources.             Should this view
become generally recognised, it seems to me that the idea of the tree
of life will not serve as a basis of a really satisfactory system of classi
fication. Certainly no system could be regarded as satisfactory or
natural which placed in widely different groups the two kinds of Horse
referred to.
                     I
    In concluding, beg leave to repeat my assertion, that all the teeth
of the Ornithorhynchus are unlike any known Sauropsidan teeth, while
nevertheless the totality of the structure of Monotremes, and especially
the nature of their mammary gland, lend support to the hypothesis
that they have become mammals along a different road from that
which the higher Mammalia have travelled, and that they gained their
 teeth by the way, after they had separated off from the main Reptilian
 stem. This difference of origin nevertheless constitutes in my eyes no
 reason whatever for not regarding Monotremes and higher Mammals
 as being all true members of the one class Mammalia.

       Distribution of the Cranial Nerves.                 Preliminary Commu
       nication." By W. H. Gaskell, M.D., F.R.S. Received
       February 9, 1888.
    In a previous paper*    I have pointed out that the structure, distribu
tion, and function of the spinal nerves, as well as the arrangement of
their centres of origin in the spinal cord, all lead to the conclusion
that these nerves are divisible into two parts ; (1) a somatic part,
supplying the external surface of the body and the muscles derived
from the muscle plates, and (2) a splanchnic part, supplying the
internal surfaces and organs and the muscles derived from the lateral
plates of niesoblast.
    I also pointed out that the cranial nerves were          built up on a similar
plan   and  arose from   similar   centres   of   origin    to the spinal nerves ;
that they too were divisible into somatic and splanchnic groups of the
same type as    in the spinal nerves.
    In that   paper  I dealt especially with efferent nerves, and pointed
ont that the sOmatic efferent nerves are non-ganglionated, and pass
from the nerve cells of the anterior horn direct to the muscles derived
from the muscle plates ; on the other hand, the splanchnic efferent
nerves are divisible into a ganglionated and a non-ganglionated group,
of which the non-ganglionated motor nerves arise from a lateral group
of nerve cells forming part of the lateral horn, which are continued
craniahvards as the separate nuclei of such nerves as the facial, Ac.,
and pass from the anterior root to the muscles derived from the
lateral plates of mesoblast ; while the ganglionated efferent nerves
 arise either from the cells of Clarke's column or from those of the
lateral horn or from both, and pass to the so-called sympathetic

ganglia to        supply the muscles of the vascular system,                   alimentary
canal, &c.
  The whole argument in that paper was based upon the structure
and distribution of the nerves of anterior roots, so that in speaking of
the sympathetic   ganglia as ganglia of a splanchnic root, all the
evidence for vasomotor nerves,              &c, went to show that these ganglia
might be considered      belonging
                           as                    to anterior (efferent)       roots rather
than to posterior (afferent) roots.
     Again Onodi's observations  that such ganglia are offshoots from
the  spinal ganglia on the posterior root do not militate against the
motor character of these ganglia, since in the lower animals and in
the first two cervical nerves of the higher animals both anterior and
posterior roots pass into the spinal ganglion, so that there is no
difficulty in imagining that as the motor portion of the original
spinal ganglion travelled away from its parent ganglion mass, the
motor or efferent nerves would no longer pass into the spinal ganglion
but would pass free from      being connected only with the separated
                                     it,
vagrant portions of the original ganglion, i.e., with the sympathetic
system.
     There   is   in fact no evidence to show that the anterior and posterior
roots are not       truly efferent and afferent, and there         is   also no evidence
to  show that the afferent ganglia have travelled away from their
original situation in the same way as the efferent ganglia. We may
therefore consider the ganglia of the afferent spinal nerves, both
somatic and splanchnic, as statvmnry in position, and as forming the
root ganglia of the various nerves, while the ganglia of the efferent
spinal nerves are vagrant,    and form the so-called      sympathetic
system.
     Acomplete segmental spinal nerve     then composed of (1) anterior
                                                       is
root with vagrant ganglion; (2) posterior root with stationary
ganglion.
   The anterior root again      divisible into two parts (1) a large-
                                       is                                 ;
fibred medullated, and' (2) a small-fibred medullated part, of
which the latter only      in connexion with the ganglia of this root
                                is                                                          ;
the non-medullated     fibres   being these splanchnic ganglionated
fibres which have lost their medullary sheath in one or other of the
ganglia.
   If the cranial nerves are built up on the same type as the spinal
Derves, it follows that in them too we must have (1) an anterior root
and (2) a posterior root, with     root ganglion stationary in position
                                            a
close to the exit of the  nerves from  the central nervous system into
which both anterior and posterior roots may or may not pass also                     ;
the anterior root must consist of a small-fibred ganglionated portion
and a large-fibred non-ganglionated portion, the ganglion on the
anterior root being in all probability vagrant and not stationary.

  384              Dr. W. H. GaskelL      Structure, Function,    [Feb. 23,
  In order   to see how far the cranial nerves    conform to the same type
 as the spinal nerves, T will consider their structure and distribution
  seriatim, leaving out of consideration for the present the olfactory,
 the optic, and also, for reasons to be mentioned, the auditory nerves.
     Beginning then with the IIIrd or oculo-motor nerve, we are dealing
 with a nerve whose function at the present time is purely motor, a
 nerve therefore which is ordinarily spoken of as representing an
 anterior root ; in this nerve we find indications of a large-fibred and a
 small-fibred part. Tracing up these fibres outwards to their destina
  tion it is seen that the large fibres pass off to supply the eye muscles
 supplied by this nerve, while most of the small fibres separate out
 from the large fibres and pass directly into the ganglion oculo-motorii.
 This ganglion, which is in the main formed by these small medullated
 fibres of the IIIrd nerve, i.e., radix brevis, is increased in size by the
 addition of ganglion cells formed on the radix longa from the
 trigeminal, and others in connexion with sympathetic fibres ; the
 fibres in the ganglion are all of small size, and the short ciliary nerves
 which arise from it have not a single large fibre among them. The
 nerve fibres of the short ciliary nerves are almost all medullated, and
 according      to  most  observers    (Bidder and Volkman) are        more
 numerous     than those entering the ganglion, so that in this case these
 small nerve fibres which are motor to the ciliary and splanchnic muscles
 do not lose their medullary sheath in their passage through the
 ganglion, a peculiarity which distinguishes them from the motor
 nerves of the vascular system, and is suggestive in connexion with the
 fact that these muscles though unstriped in structure are to a certain
 extent voluntary in action.
     Also the nerve cells of this ganglion are distinctly of two kinds,
 most of them unipolar, of the same type as those of a spinal ganglion,
 the minority multipolar of the type of the so-called sympathetic
 ganglion cells : this also suggests that this difference in the type of
 nerve cell is associated with the presence or absence of a medullary
 sheath in the nerves issuing from the ganglion, and does not
necessarily imply that these unipolar cells are connected with
posterior root fibres, and that therefore, as has been supposed, this
ganglion is the root ganglion of the oculo-motor nerve.
     We see then clearly that the oculo-motor ganglion is the ganglion of
these small-fibred efferent nerves of the IIIrd nerve.
    The IIIrd nerve then conforms in its structure, and in the vagrant
character of its motor ganglion, to the plan of a spinal nerve as far as
its anterior root is concerned.      Where then is its posterior root ? If
it conforms to the plan laid down, the ganglion on the posterior root,
i.e., its root ganglion, ought to be situated on the nerve near its exit
from the central nervous system, and here, in fact, I have found it in
the nerves of man and sheep.         I have made a series of consecutive

1888.]           and Distribution  of tlie  Cranial Nerves.            385
sections through the rootlets of the IIIrd nerve of man, beginning
from its exit ont of the brain and passing peripheralwards, and have
found that in the different rootlets a well-marked ganglion is formed
in the same way as any spinal ganglion, with, however, one important
difference; the nerve cells and groups of nerve cells have degenerated,
but their place and position remain conspicuously marked out with
characteristically arranged masses of peculiar neuroglia- like con
nective tissue substance.     So striking is the resemblance to a spinal
ganglion, that with a low power it is difficult at first sight to believe
that it is not a section of a functional ganglion which is exposed to
 view.
     These degenerated ganglia are limited to a definite portion of each
 nerve rootlet just as in a spinal ganglion ; centralwards of the gang
 lion the degenerated tissue can be traced as a strand of the same
 peculiar neuroglia-like connective tissue into the brain; peripheral-
 wards of the ganglion all trace of altered nerve tissue or ganglion
 cells has disappeared.
     Here then we have what appears to me without doubt to be the
 phylogenetically degenerated posterior root and root ganglion of the
 Illrd nerve ; so that in its posterior root, and in the situation of its
 root ganglion, it conforms also to the plan of a complete spinal nerve.
                          I
     In the IVth nerve find the same structure, an anterior root com
 posed of a large-fibred portion and a small small-fibred portion ; the
 destiny of this latter, and its connexion with any vagrant motor
  ganglion, I have not yet had time to trace out.
     Soon after the IVth nerve leaves the valve of Vieussens, it forms
 upon it a conspicuous spinal ganglion of the same character as those
 on the rootlets of the IIIrd nerve, the cells of which are all de
 generated, and the degenerated posterior root fibres are conspicuous
 between the brain and this ganglion, but cease peripheralwards of
 the ganglion.
     In the Vlth nerve the small-fibred part of the anterior root is much
 more doubtful than in the case of the two preceding nerves ; so, too,
  with the posterior root, its ganglion is limited to a few degenerated
  nerve cells, and is nothing like so conspicuous as in the case of the
  IIIrd  and  IVth  nerves.
     In the so-called motor root of the Vth nerve we see again distinct
 groups of small fibres together with the large motor fibres.       I have
 not yet had time to trace out these       small fibres to their respective
 motor ganglia, but have little doubt that they will be found to bear
 the same relation to the spheno-palatine ganglion as those of the
  IIIrd nerve do to the oculo-motor ganglion. In the so-called motor
  root of the Vth nerve is found also a degenerated posterior root, with
  its ganglion in the same situation and of the same character as in the
  preceding nerves.

386            Dr. W. H. Gaskell.        Structure, Function,    [Feb. 23,
   The so-called  motor root of the Vth nerve is therefore a complete
nerve belonging to the same group as the IIIrd, IVth, and Vlth, and
does not require the sensory portion of the Vth to make it resemble
a spinal nerve.
   Leaving aside for the moment the consideration of the sensory part
 of the Vth nerve we come to the VIIth nerve ; here we find the
anterior root manifestly composed of a large-fibred and a small-
fibred portion, the latter being derived mainly from the n. inter
medins, though some of the fibres are in the roots of the facial itself.
The ganglion geniculatum bears the same relation to these small
fibres as the ganglion oculo-motorii to those of the IIIrd nerve, and
ganglia which are still further vagrant are seen in the submaxillary
ganglion, &c. The ganglion of its posterior root is found in the root
lets of the facial in the usual position, directly after their exit from
the brain, and in man both nerve fibres and nerve cells are degene
rated in the same way as in the case of the cranial nerves already
considered.
   The cranial nerves considered up to this point form a natural
group all arranged on the same plan with a ganglionated and non-
ganglionated anterior root, and a phylogenetically degenerated
posterior root and ganglion.
   Passing now to the nerves of the medulla oblongata, we find
another group with different characteristics.       Here there is no sign
of any degenerated posterior roots or spinal ganglion ; here we find
not degeneration of any component but separation of the component
parts of a spinal nerve, so that the separate nerves no longer, as in
the previous cases, represent each a perfect nerve.     Thus in the IXth,
Xth, Xlth, and XIIth nerves of man at all events, the somatic por
tions of the posterior roots are absent in the nerves themselves with
the exception of the auricular branch of the vagus, but clearly are
not absent in reality, for the structure of the medulla oblongata shows
that they have become diverted from these nerves to help form the
sensory part of the Vth, and the Gasserian ganglion.          The somatic
motor part of this group     is present,  not  as forming  a  part of each
nerve, but as a separate nerve, the hypoglossal or XHth nerve, the
nucleus of origin of which extends along the whole length of the
medulla oblongata.      The ganglia jugularia of the IXth and Xth
nerves which give origin in the Sauropsida to the laryngopharyngeal
nerve, are the spinal ganglia of the splanchnic portions of the
posterior roots of this group, while the ganglion petrosum of IX, and
the ganglion trunci vagi (the vagrant character of which is well
shown in such animals as the crocodile) are the motor ganglia of the
small-fibred portions of the anterior roots of these nerves.       Finally,
the non-ganglionated splanchnic large-fibred motor nerves have not
separated off to form a sepaiate nerve like the XHth, but remain as

 1888.]         and Distribution   of  the Cranial Nerves.               387
 the motor nerves of the laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles.           In fact,
 the IXth and Xth nerves with the medullary part of XI contain all
 the splanchnic elements belonging to a spinal nerve, or rather a group
 of spinal nerves, and in man at all events contain none of the somatic
elements (with the exception of the auricular branch of the vagus),
 the somatic portions being represented by the hypoglossal, and a
 portion of the sensory root of the trigeminal.
    Turning our attention to the sensory root of V, we see no sign of
any degenerated ganglion or degenerated posterior root; it clearly
 possesses a functional, well-developed spinal ganglion, the Gasserian ;
and according to human anatomists, it is exclusively derived from
the ascending root of the Vth nerve, Le., it arises in close connexion
 with the posterior horn along the whole length of the central nervous
system comprised between its point of exit and the middle of the
 cervical region of the cord. In the absence, then, of any signs of
 degeneration among its fibres, combined with the presence of a dege
 nerated posterior root ganglion in the so-called motor root of V, we
 may, I think, fairly conclude from the peculiarity of its origin that the
sensory part of V and the Gasserian ganglion does not represent the
 posterior root of a nerve of which the so-called motor part of V is
the anterior root.     The explanation of the peculiarities of the origin
 of the sensory somatic elements of the ascending root of V, as well as
of the corresponding sensory splanchnic elements of the ascending
root of X must be sought for in the explanation of the presence of
 the degenerated posterior root ganglia of the Group I of cranial
 nerves already mentioned.
   As far as  VIII   is concerned, it will suffice at present to say that it
does not possess an undoubted degenerated ganglion, that part of it,
at all events, possesses a functional spinal ganglion, and that it is a
complex nerve, the structure of which requires a much more extensive
investigation than I have as yet been able to give it.
   In connexion with the presence of these degenerated posterior
roots and spinal ganglia, it is significant that in the region of the
brain from which these roots spring, groups of strongly pigmented
cells are found, the reason for the presence of which is unknown.
Of these groups the cells of the locus cceruleus are in structure and
position clearly the termination of Clarke's column, and are therefore
in all probability connected with the remnants of the small- fibred
gangliouated efferent portions of some of the nerves of this group ;
the cells, on the other hand, of the Substantia nigra are in apparent
connexion with and are embedded in the direct continuation of the
degenerated posterior root fibres of the Illrd nerve.
   To sum up, then, it is clear that apart from I, II, and VIII, the
rest of the cranial nerves are built up on the same type as the spinal
nerves, and that their peculiarities are such as to divide them into
   vol. mil.                                                     2 I

 two groups, viz., (1) those which arise from the mid-brain and hind-
 brain, i.e., III, IV, Vm, VI, VII, all of which are at present, i.e., in
 man, motor, but possess a degenerated posterior root and ganglion ;
 and (2) those which arise from the med. oblongata, viz., IX, X (in
 part), XI (in part), XII, V, (in part), which are characterised not
 by the loss of any component part, but by the scattering of the dif
 ferent components ; a scattering which bears an intimate connexion
 with the making good of the loss of the sensory elements of Group I.
    Finally, certain points connected with the question of the segmental
 value of the cranial nerves other than those already discussed are
 worthy of mention. The question of the segmental arrangement of
 any nerves may as far as their distribution is concerned be considered
in a twofold light ; 1st, the evidence for any segmental arrangement
 of somatic parts, as, for instance, of somatic muscles ; and 2nd.
evidence for any segmental arrangement of splanchnic parts, such as
visceral clefts and arches, and the visceral muscles formed from the
walls of such clefts.
   In order to compare cranial nerves with spinal nerves we must
compare structures of the same kind ; if the segmental arrangement
is based in the one case on the formation of myotomes, then we must
search for the corresponding myotomes in the other, if on visceral
arches, then we must argue upon the basis of visceral arch formation
throughout.       Now, van Wijhe has pointed out that the cranial
muscles are derived from two groups of muscle segments, (1) a set
of myotomes corresponding to the segmented muscle plates through
out the animal which form the muscles    I have called non-ganglionated
somatic, and (2) a set of lateral plates of mesoblast, lining the walls
of the different visceral and branchial cavities, which give rise to the
group of muscles which      I have called non-ganglionated splanchnic.
These latter muscles are unknown segmentally except in the head,
they probably form in the trunk, as will be shown immediately, the
diaphragm and trausversus abdominis muscles.
   Now van Wijhe, on the strength of his embryological researches,
divides the head of the Selachians intoni-e segments, with the follow
ing arrangement of muscles and nerve supply.

    From which we        see that    if  we look upon the myotomes as repre
senting the primitive          segmentation,        while the visceral clefts and
muscles from the lateral plates of mesoblast represent the secondary
segmentation (Branchiomery), the 4th, 5th, and 6th segments are
uurepresented by any muscles, or rather the 4th and 5th, for he
notices the slight muscle formation in the 6th somite, but was unable
to trace any special muscle to it.
   Now looking at these two groups of muscles, the splanchnic and
somatic, we see that the muscles of mastication and expression differ
in structure, colour, nature of contraction, and general appearance
from the muscles of the eye and the somatic muscles generally, with
the exception of the specialised tongue muscles.                  I find also that the
motor nerves of the IIIrd, IVth, and Vlth nerves are in the dog much
larger in calibre than those of the facial and slightly larger than
those of the trigeminal, the eye muscles being innervated by nerves
of the same size as the large motor nerves of anterior roots, i.e., from
14-4 ft — 18 ft, while the facial muscles are innervated by nerves of
the same size as the large motor nerves of the vagus and glosso
pharyngeal which supply the pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles,
i.e., from 9 fi — 10-8 /i.
   Any nerve fibres, therefore, of the size of those of the Vlth
nerve, for instance, would be very conspicuous and easily followed if
they appeared in among the smaller fibres of the facial. Such is the
case ; the facial roots possess a group of large fibres of the size of the
somatic motor nerves in among the smaller fibres ; a series of sections
through the facial has enabled me to trace one group of these large
fibres, and it is a beautiful sight to see them separating out one by
one to come to the edge of the nerve, and finally to form a small
nerve, which is found to be the n. stapedius. The rest of them leave
 the facial nearer its exit from the brain, and              I  think pass out as the
 nerve supplying the Levator veli palati muscle.                  The difficulty, how
 ever, of combining the dissection of these parts with the necessary
                                                                           2  -  2

freshness   and   freedom  from damage which is requisite to ensure a
good osmic preparation, has prevented me up to the present from
making sure of this latter point.
   When the facial leaves the stylo-mastoid foramen it is free from
these large fibres.   I venture to suggest that the structure of these
two muscles, their origins, their shape, colour, and appearance,
combined with the size of their motor fibres, all lead to the conclus-n
that they belong to the same group as the somatic eye muscles, and
represent van Wijhe's missing 4th and 5th myotomes.            Further, we
see this, that if the splanchnic voluntary muscles derived from the
lateral plates of mesoblast are differentiated from the somatic voluntary
muscles derived from the myotomes by the size of their motor nerve
fibres, we ought to find the same relation in the trunk as in the bead ;
this seems to me to be the case, the nerve fibres of the phrenic in the
rabbit separate out from those of the 4th and 5th cervical nerves as a
group of fibres of smaller size than the surronnding motor nerves oi
those segments, and also the fibres of the nerve supplying the
m. transversus abdominis in the dog are distinctly smaller than those of
the nerve supplying the m. obliq. sup.                 I
                                                  conclude then that the
primitive segmentation of the head is shown by the somatic muscles
of the IIIrd, IVth, and Vlth nerves, m. stapedius, m. levator veli
palati, and the muscles of the XIIth nerve, a segmentation which is
in agreement with the segmentation of the trunk. In addition to
this a secondary segmentation has taken place in the formation of the
gills ; the muscles belonging to this segmentation show a segmental
arrangement in connexion with the gills but not in the case of the
trunk, for as far as I know the m. transversus and the diaphragm show
no sign of segmentation.
    In this preliminary communication              I
                                                 cannot discuss all the
problems    which  are opened   out  by the  new   light which examination
 of the structure of the cranial nerves has shed upon their distribution
 and past history.     The explanation of the degenerated posterior
 roots of certain of the cranial nerves is certainly to be found in the
 history of the vertebrate animal, and             I
                                                hope in the course of the
 summer to publish the full paper of which this is a preliminary
 account, and in that paper to make some attempt to acconnt for this
 remarkable phylogenetic degeneration.        In conclusion, I may remark
 that Marshall has previously noticed in the chick a group of ganglion
 cells at the origin of the IIIrd nerve out of the brain.       Also it has
 been pointed out to me that my discovery of degenerated nerve cells
 and nerve tissue in such cranial nerves as the IIIrd is not, as I
 thought, entirely new.        The structures in question        have been
 observed by Thomsen and other pathologists.               The explanation
 which I have given       is,
                          however, entirely new.

of the Notes" sent to me by my son, on the development of this, the
lowest and most Reptilian of all birds known.               Seven stages before
hatching    have   been   obtained, and will yield,        I  am satisfied, most
instructive results and, added to what has already been done in the
other forms of the Ratitas, will give something like completeness to
our knowledge of the morphology of these archaic types.                    It is not
merely as low kinds of birds that the Struthious types are so important
to the biologist ; they are so intimately related to the more primitive
forms, both of Reptiles and Mammals, that any new fact as to their
structure is of great value. This short paper is accompanied by one of
my own, purposely to throw light upon its meaning and bearing.]

    Each alisphenoid is connected by a rod of cartilage (A) with the
postero-dorsal angle of the mesethmoid ; a transverse cartilaginous bar
is thus produced, which forms the anterior boundary of the pituitary
fossa and the dorsal boundary of the optic foramen.

   In the      lateral ethmoidal       plates    of this bird no clear distinction

can be drawn between ali-ethmoidal, ali-septal, and ali-nasal, any more
than between mesethmoid, septum nasi, and pre-nasal.            The dorsal
border of the mesethmoid, from anterior end of crista galli to within
about 2 cm. of end of beak, sends off horizontal plates on each side,
which pass at first outwards, then downwards, and finally, in part of
their extent, inwards, thus forming roof, outer wall, and in part floor
of the nasal chambers.
    The precise relation of these lateral ethmoidal plates varies in
different regions, and it is convenient to consider them as consisting
of five portions.
    In the first or posterior portion, besides passing outwards and down
wards, they take a sweep backwards, and then inwards, thus forming
an almost complete somewhat shell-like covering for the principal or
inter-orbital portion of the olfactory capsules. To this portion the name
ali-ethmoid may be applied.      Each ali-ethmoid is a thin plate of carti
lage, convex externally, forming the outer border of the cribriform space
 (olfactory foramen) by its dorsal free edge, and closely applied below
by its ventral edge to the mesethmoid, immediately dorsad of the
rostrum ; in front it is continuous laterally and dorsally with the
second portion, and ventrally ends irregularly, presenting a deep ante
rior emargination, which separates a slender, forwardly directed
process (c) from the main ali-ethmoidal cartilage.
   In its second portion the lateral ethmoidal cartilage furnishes only
roof and sides to the nasal chamber, the floor being absent, and thus
the turbinals are visible from below.
    In its third portion it again tarns inwards so as to furnish a floor
to the nasal cavity, in the form of a plate with a straight lower
border abutting against the mesethmoid, and with oblique anterior
and posterior edges.
   In their fourth portion the lateral ethmoids again furnish only roof
and outer walls to the off-chamber, and in their fifth or anterior
portion, they are entirely unconnected with the mesethmoid (pre-
nasal), and form two slightly divergent obliquely placed plates of
cartilage which are continued to the end of the beak, passing dorsad
of the nostrils.    To these the name ali-nasals might be applied, but
owing to the unique position of the anterior nares, the relations of
these and other parts of the ethmoidal region is strikingly different
from what we are familiar with in other birds.
   There is a single ethmoidal ossification, mesethmoid, in the form of
a bone composed of horizontal and vertical portions and T-shaped in
transverse section.       The horizontal portion is shield-shaped, and
appears on the surface of the skull between the posterior ends of the
nasals : the vertical portion ossifies the whole postero-dorsal region of
the mesethmoid : the bone in question is therefore partly mes- and
 partly ecto-ethmoidal.

   The turbinals consist of in-growths of the ali-ethmoid into the nasal
cavity, and are altogether three in number. They may be called
respectively anterior, middle, and posterior turbinals.       The posterior
turbinal has the form of a vertical scroll of very thin cartilage,
attached by the upper and lower ends of one edge to the ali-ethmoid,
but free in the middle ; it is rolled upon itself caudad, forming about
one  turn and a half.
   The middle turbinal is attached along the whole length of one
vertical  edge : from its attachment it passes mesiad, then tarns
sharply laterad, then curves         mesiad     again, and passes forwards
(upheld) as a broad plate somewhat indented in the middle by a
vertical furrow, which gives it, when viewed from the inner face, the
appearance of a double fold : this broad plate is attached to the ali-
ethmoid all along its vertical edge, and in front is rolled upon itself
candad, forming a scroll of one turn which is attached above and
below but free in the middle.

    The anterior turbinal arises as a single somewhat obliqae plate,
 attached to the ali-ethmoid along its whole length : it soon divides
 into two plates, each of which becomes rolled upon itself forwards,
 forming two oblique scrolls.
    Finally, the anterior turbinal is continued forwards into the narrow
 portion of the olfactory chamber (2ud and 3rd portions of lateral
 ethmoid, see sections), as a horizontal plate, which, like the main
 portion of the turbinal, divides into two : these are rolled upon them

selves respectively dorsad and ventrad, forming two horizontal scrolls,
which become simpler and simpler, finally being reduced to a single
narrow horizontal plate, which is continued as far forwards as a small
arterial foramen in the lateral ethmoidal cartilage at the junction of
its 3rd and 4th portions.
    In addition to these, which may be called the turbinals proper, the
5th anterior (free) portion of the lateral ethmoidal cartilage sends
inwards for a short distance a narrow horizontal shelf-like process
 (fig. 3, sect. 5), beginning immediately caudad of the nostril, and              ,
nearly as far back as the junction of the lateral ethmoids with the
mesethmoid.
     On each side of the ventral edge of the mesethmoid, in the vomerine
region is a slender, free rod of cartilage, shaded dark in fig. 2, imbedded
 in connective tisRue, and lying parallel with, and either immediately
 above or slightly laterad of, the dorsal edge of the vomer.         It is about
 10 mm. long, and about 0'14 mm. in diameter.                This is obviously
 the vestigial cartilage of Jacobson's organ, figured but not described

        Structures found in the Skull of Birds, both Carinatae and

        1888.
    One of the most remarkable structures found in the skull of cer
tain Amniota or higher Vertebrata — Reptiles and Mammals, is the
so-called "Jacobson's organ."
    A pair of these curious gland-like bodies, each carefully placed in
its own special capsule, may be seen in Serpents, Lizards, and
Mammals ; but they are not present in Tortoises, Crocodiles or Birds,
as far as our present knowledge goes.             Rathke, in his work on the
Snake's Skull, spoke of the "nasal glands and their capsules," and
for a long while this term made them to be confused with the nasal
glands of birds, which have nothing whatever to do with
                                                                   " Jacobson's
organs."
    These structures are largest in Serpents, Lizards, and Monotremes,
next in order come the Marsupials, Edentates, and Insectivores, then
the Mammalia generally, including Man himself, in whom they appear
for a time, and then vanish away.*
    These structures lie just above the anterior incisive foramina.             I

398      Prof. W. K. Parker.       Amphibian and Reptilian      [Feb. 23,
need    not   now state anything further with regard to them, as
I   have  already given in my papers on the Skull of the Snake,
the Lizard, the Edentata, and Insectivorous Mammalia, numerous
figures and descriptions of thom.         I  must, however, repeat one or
two facts ; in the Snake and Lizard these gland-like bodies lie each
in a little dish, formed by the vomer of that side, covered in by
another vomerine bone — the septomaxillary. They are also protected
at the opening of the capsule by a pedate tract of cartilage, derived
from the ali-nasal fold, which, in the Snake, frequently becomes
detached from its root.
    In low Mammalia there are several vomers, ten in Guscus maculaius,
a low kind of Phalanger. Now in most of the lower kinds of Mammalia,
examined by me, a pair of small anterior vomers lie on the inside of
Jacobson's organs, but the capsule itself is formed by a peculiar fold
of cartilage — the recurrent cartilage, which closes in upon itself and
unites its edges round the gland.
    As a rule these " recurrent cartilages " retain their union with the
alinasal folds, as in the Lizard ; in the Babbit they are distinct, as in
the Serpent (Howes).
    Now in Birds these      cartilages not unfrequently    appear, but no
" Jacobson's organ " has been found with them.           The Birds whose
vomerine region comes nearest to that of a low Mammal are the
" Turnicidae," or Hemipods, and the great group of the Passerine birds
 (Coracomorph®, or ^Bgithognatha of Huxley).
    It is not uncommon for the ox-faced vomer of these birds to be
formed of two pairs of bony centres, and these become not only fused
together, but actually grafted upon the floor of the cartilaginous
nasal capsule, in the same manner as is common in the lower kinds of
Mammalia.
    Now I find remnants of the cartilaginous capsule of Jacobson's
organs, not only in the Hemipods and in the lower Neotropical
Passerines (Homorus, Synallaxis, Anceretes), but also in some of the
 highest of the singing-birds, namely, the Wren (Anorthura troglo
dytes), and also in some of the Woodpeckers (Picidae), outside the
 Passerine order.
    In my paper on the " Skull of the Ostrich Tribe " (' Phil. Trans.,'
 1866, Plate 10, fig. 14, a.i.t.),  I figured and described, but did not
 understand, a peculiar cartilage perched right and left upon the
 large vomer of the Bhea.      I  have been for a long time satisfied that
 this also is one of the vomerine or Jacobson's cartilages, and this view
 is corroborated, and to my mind proved, by what my son has found
 in the palate of the Apteryx.
    Now if my son's figure* of the transversely-vertical section through
 these cartilages and the crura of the vomer in the Apteryx, be com-

pared with various figures in my Memoirs on the Mammalian Skull
(Parts 1, 2, and 3, Phil. Trans.'), it will be seen that it so nearly
                     '
corresponds with sections of the skull of the Pig, the Edentata, and the
Iniectivores, especially those taken just behind Jacobson's organ, that
without explanation it would be impossible to tell which figure
belonged to the Bird, and which to the Mammal.
   In the Fowl, the Duck, and other Precocial birds, the embryo of the
eighth day of incubation is in the Amphibian stage ; then, the web
goes beyond the toes, on the foot, whilst the rudimentary wing shows
clearly a paddle with three digits in              it,
                                            the first shortest, and the
third not    much shorter than the second.   Very soon, however, after
this, the first and second digits acquire a claw. Thns the Reptilian
stage has been attained for ;    know of no existing Amphibian with

   Before    Ihad ever offered any of my Morphological Papers to the
Royal Society, had stumbled upon a part in the development of the

many types of Birds, all the Rati tae except the Apteryx, and in family

of the skull     issupported by a long splint-bone, the nature of which
had been completely misunderstood by the old school of anatomists,
but which was put into its right category by our great Reformer,
Professor Huxley, and called        him " parasphenoid."

frog among others, the point of the dagger-shaped bone is separately
ossified, and remains distinct.
    In the Paradoxical Frog (Pseudis paradoxa) there is no "handle"
to the dagger ; the same form of parasphenoid is common among the
water-birds, e.g., Alea, Uria. This is an ossification which is the
earliest to appear in skulls that take on any kind of ossification ; it
is also the first bone to appear in an embryo bird, as in the larval
Frog.

that in seeking for a clue to the uprise of the Feathered Fowl, we
may leave out of immediate consideration all the existing types of
Reptilia : ancient Amphibians, or Reptiles just rising out of Amphibian
lowliness, are the forms that alone will help us in this search.
    We do get some light upon the Reptilian relationship of Birds,
but it is at best a scattered light ; the head of a bird is like that of the
Ichthyosaurus, in its great facial elongation, the neck- and limb-regions
of a Bird are those of a Plesiosaurus, whilst the hips and legs are
like those of the " Ornithoscelida."
    Scarcely any Urodeles, and only a few of the Anura, show any
special elongation of the
                             " intertrabecula " or pre-nasal rostral car
tilage ; this must have been very long in the Ichthyosauri as in the
 Selachians, and as in the embryos of all Birds.
    In the Tadpole, with its oral aperture in front of the head, the
quadrate cartilage or suspensorium of the lower jaw is parallel with
the fore part of the basis-cranii, or trabecuke. During transforma
 tion the quadrate hinge gradually gets further and further back
until, in the Bull-frog, it is beneath the neck, close to the shoulder.
The pterygo-palatine arcade, which was a mere connecting band
between the quadrate and the trabecula, becomes the long palato-ptery-
 goid arch or arcade, and the fore part of it is tri-radiate, and has
received a term for each ray.
    Thus the suspensorial part or pedicle is the ethmo-palatine, the
anterior free spike the pre-palatine, and the hinder part which runs
 into the pterygoid is the post-palatine.
     The anterior part of the pterygo-palatine arcade is distinct from
 the pterygoid in the Salamanders        and their allies — Urodeles — and
-the pterygoid iu them is an outgrowth of the quadrate which grwvs

forwards towards the palatine, but does not coalesce with it, except
in Ranodon sibiricus*
    This endoskeletal cartilaginous palatine, with its peduncle and fore
and hind ray or eras, appears in several kinds of birds, in addition
to tbeir normal parosteal palatine — a mere membrane bone, as in
Reptiles and Mammals.
    This vestige or remnant remains in the adult ; it is of no apparent
use, and occurs in the Families in the oddest way ; sometimes, how
ever, it is present in all the members of some particular Family-group,
as for instance in the Musophagidse                   or plantain- eaters (Musophaga,
Schizorhis, and Corythaix).f
    My own later researches show it well in the Oil Bird (Steatornis
caripensis) and in the Green Tody (Todus viridis) ; but it is well
                                         '
developed in Scythrops (see Linn. Soc. Trans.,' ser. 2 (Zool.), vol. 1,
plate 23, figs. 4 and 3, o.u.)
    In that nearly extinct Neotropical type, Steatornis, this curious
partly ossified remnant has the three crura, all well marked, and
their morphological meaning is evident ; albeit the whole piece is so
small and feeble that it can serve no purpose in the solid palate of
that remarkable bird.
    To show how unexpectedly this remnant exists, and does not exist,
 I will give a list of the Birds in which it has been found in a seg
 mented state as a distinct bony element of the face ; it often shows
 itself as a mere process of the ecto-ethmoid : I do not include those
 birds in the list.

 plate 24, figs. 1-3),      I  showed that the " post-palatine
                                                                      "  tract of cartil-
 lage   was    developed    as  a distinct    nucleus   in the Axolotl    (Siredon).
     That distinct nncleus representing the post-palatine region of the
 Frog's skull also re-appears in the Crow, in the Sparrow, and in all
 the Passerines, as far as I have been able to work them out. It lies
 outside the hinder part of the normal parosteal palatine bone, becomes
 a solid ear-shaped tract of hyaline cartilage, acquires its own osseous
  (endosteal) centre, and this, when ossified, coalesces with the normal
 palatine bone.
     The only Reptile in which          I  have discovered any distinct trace of
 the endoslceletal palatine is the Green Turtle; it is very small (see
                        " Challenger Reports," vol. 1,
 my paper in the                                                part 5, pl. 12, figs. 9,
 9a, 26    :  e.p.a.).
     These     are not all, or nearly all the vestigial structures that are
 familiar to me in the Bird's skull — to say nothing of the skeleton
 generally ; but they are sufficient,            I  think, to satisfy any reasonable
 person      that Birds arose, by secular transformation, either from the
 lowest and most ancient of the true Reptiles, or equally with Reptiles
 from archaic Amphibia, low in structure, but full of potential excel
 lence, and ready, pro re nata, to become Reptile, Bird, or even Mammal,
 as the case might be.
    For many years I have been endeavouring to gather up the frag
 ments of morphology that nothing should be lost ; I am satisfied that
 these lingering but practically useless structures will be found to be
 very difficult of deglutition to anyone who believes that the Birds that
now exist were created in their present form and condition.*

 I. " On the Changes produced by Magnetisation in the Dimen

     By Shelford Bidwell, M.A., F.R.S. Received February                                    t»,
         1888.
                                          (Abstract.)
   In paper communicated to the Royal Society in 1885,* the author
         a
has shown that the elongation which an iron rod undergoes when
magnetised does not, as had been generally believed, remain unchanged
at a maximum when the magnetising force exceeds that which       suffi             is
cient to produce so-called saturation. On the contrary, he finds that
when the magnetising force     continually increased beyond this limit,
                                        is
the elongation becomes gradually less and less, until the rod, after 6rst
returning to its original length, ultimately becomes actually shorter
than when in the unmagnetised condition.
   The experiments described in that paper are, however, open to
objection, on the following grounds — (1) The field due to the mag
                                                 :
netising solenoid was not quite uniform (2) the effect of the ends of
                                                       ;
the rods was uncertain, and might have played some material part
in the production of the phenomena in question (3) all the rods used
                                                                ;
in the experiments retained a certain amount of permanent magne
tism (4) the experiments might with advantage have been carried
       ;
further.   The paper now offered to the Society contains an account of

 the battery employed was increased from seven Grove's cells to thirty.
     After an explanation of the precautions taken to guard against the
effects of current heating, an account is given of some experiments
with three rings arranged in slightly different ways, and the results
are compared with those of an experiment made under similar con
 ditions with a straight rod.          It was found that in their general cha
 racter the phenomena of elongation and retraction were just the same
 in both cases, and were in close agreement with those of the former
paper. The differences in mere details were not greater than would pro
 bably be found to occur in different specimens of iron of the same form.
     Being satisfied that these curious effects of magnetism were prac
tically independent of the form of the iron, and having regard to the
 fact that it was much easier to obtain intense fields with straight than
 with circular solenoids, the author thought it worth while to make
some further experiments              with straight rods. The metals used in
addition to iron were cobalt, nickel, manganese-steel, and bismuth ;
and the highest magnetising force reached about 840 G.G.S. units,
the maximum in the old experiments having been 290.
     It was found that the retraction of the iron continued to increase
with higher forces until it was finally as much as 45 ten-millionths of
the length of the rod, when there were indications that a limit was
being approached.            The retraction of the nickel reached 113 ten-
millionths, when it also was evidently not far from its limit.
    The behaviour of the cobalt rod was exceedingly curious and inte
resting.       No evidence of any change of length appeared until the
magnetising force exceeded 30 or 40 units.                Then the length of the
rod began to diminish, and continued diminishing until the force was
about 400, when the retraction amounted               to 50 ten-millionths.       But
beyond this point the rod gradually became longer again, and the
retraction with the highest force of 800 units was only three-fifths of
its maximum amount.             It was ascertained that the maximum retraction
d'd not coincide with a maximum of magnetisation, as might have
been suspected to be the case.              It is suggested that iron and nickel
might possibly behave in a similar manner under sufficiently high
magnetising forces.*

    Tables and curves are given showing the relation between magne
tising force and changes of length in each taetal.
    Bismuth was found to be slightly elongated in strong fields, though
no change could be detected with forces of less than about 500.       The
greatest elongation    observed  was about 1-5 ten-millionths of length.
    Manganese-steel was almost unaffected.      The elongation in a field
of 850 was estimated to be about one fifty-millionth of the length.
    Finally, it is shown that the mechanical stress produced in iron by
magnetism does not account for more than one-fifth part of the
observed magnetic retraction.
    An Appendix to the paper contains evidence of the high degree of
accuracy obtainable by the method of observation employed.          In the
veiy great majority of the measurements of elongation and retrac-
tii n, the probable error was less than one two-and-a-half-millionth
 part of an inch, or one hundred-thousandth of a millimetre ; and
the results of experiments made upon different days (the apparatus
having been in the meantime dismantled), or with currents of
ascending and of descending strength, were strikingly concordant.
 This degree of precision is attributed to the perfection of the optical
arrangements, which rendered it possible to project the image of »
 wire with such sharpness, that after reflection from a mirror its
 position upon a scale 24 feet (732 cm.) distant could be read to a
 quarter of a scale division, each whole division being equal to
 ^u-inch (0 64 mm.).      The magnifying power was such that a change
 of one two-and-a-half-millionth     part of an inch (or one hundred-
 thousandth of a millimetre) in the length of the rod under examination
 caused the image of the wire to move through about three-quarters of
 a scale division.     More accurately, a scale division corresponds to
 0-000018 mm.
     The currents used were measured by one of Ayrton and Perry's
 commutator ammeters, and the accuracy with which the magnetising
 forces were estimated, though quite sufficient for the purpose of the
 experiments, does not claim to be very high.

     The cortex of the occipital lobe has been explored electrically by
  Ferrier and by Luciani and Tamburini.          In ten experiments npon
  monkeys Ferrier was unable to obtain any movements on stimulation
  of this part. Excitation of the angular gyrus produced conjugate
  deviation of both eyes to the opposite side, with sometimes an up

ward inclination when the anterior limb was stimulated, and a down
ward inclination when the electrodes were applied to the posterior
limb. Luciani and Tamburini obtained only a conjugate deviation to
the opposite side, without any constant upward or downward inclina
tion, and they got a similar but less marked movement by stimulating
the whole of the external surface of the occipital lobe.
    The following are the results .of my own observations : — Electrical
excitation of the posterior limb of the angular gyrus, of the upper
end of the middle temporal gyrus* (which is continuous with it) of
the whole cortex of the occipital lobe (inclusive of its mesial and
under aspects) and of the quadrate lobule, causes conjugate deviation
of the eyes to the opposite side. The movement is not, however, in
all cases a simple lateral deviation, but the lateral movement may be
combined with an upward or downward inclination according to the
 part stimulated. Thus (1) excitation of a superior zone which com
 prises on the external surface the posterior limb of the angular gyrus,
 the upper (posterior) end of the middle temporal gyrus, and the part
 of the occipital lobe immediately behind the external parioto-occipital
 fissure, and on the mesial surface the quadrate lobule immediately in
 front of the upper end of the internal parieto-occipital fissure, and
 the occipital lobe for a short distance behind the upper end of that
 fissure, produces, besides the lateral deviation, a downward inclination
 of the visual axes which is sometimes — especially when the stimula
 tion is applied at or near the mesial surface — so marked as greatly to
 obscure the lateral deviation.
     (2.) Excitation of an inferior zone comprising the whole of the
 inferior surface of the lobe, the lower part of the mesial surface,
 and the posterior or lowermost part of the convex or external surface,
 produces, besides the lateral deviation, an upward inclination of the
 visual axes which, like the downward movement resulting from stimu
 lation of the superior zone, may be so marked as partly to obscure the
 lateral deviation.
     (3.) Excitation of an intermediate zone which comprises the greater
  part of the external surface (where it gradually broadens out laterally)
 and extends over the margin of the great longitudinal fissure to in
  clude a narrow portion of the mesial surface, produces neither upward
  nor downward inclination of the visual axes, but a simple lateral
  movement.
     These zones are not sharply marked off from one another but merge
  gradually into one another, so that if the electrodes be applied near to
  the upper or lower limit of the intermediate zone there is produced                a
     * Excitation   of the upper end of the superior temporal gyrus gives a similar
  result.   Since this is commonly accompanied by a movement of the opposite car, it
  is usually considered that subjective auditory sensations have been called up by the
   excitation.

 slight downward or upward inclination accompanying or immediately
 following the lateral movement.
      The upward inclination of the eyes is often accompanied by eleva
 tion of the upper lids, and the downward inclination by depression of
these lids.
      Simultaneous excitation of corresponding points on the two hemi
 spheres by the same stimulus usually produces a struggle between the
 muscles producing the lateral movement, the eyes quivering, but not
 being directed more to one side than the other.                    On one occasion,
 however, when corresponding points of the mesial surfaces were
 simultaneously stimulated slight convergence of the optic axes was
 obtained.
      If,  as is highly probable, the movements of the eyes, which occur
 on excitation      of the occipital lobe and adjacent parts, are the result of
 the production of subjective visual sensations, these effects of excita
 tion of the several parts of that lobe and the adjoining portions of the
 brain would appear to indicate — 1. A connexion of the whole visual
 area of each hemisphere with the corresponding lateral half of each
retina. (This has already been ascertained to be the case from the
result of removing the whole of the area on one side, bilateral homo
 nymous hemianopsia being thereby produced.)
     2. A connexion        of the superior zone -with the superior part of the
corresponding         lateral half of each retina.
     3. A connexion of the inferior zone with the inferior part of the
corresponding lateral half of each retina.
     4. A connexion of the intermediate zone with the middle part of
the corresponding lateral half of each retina.
     If we imagine the visual areas of the two cerebral hemispheres to
he united in the middle line we may conceive each retina as projected
in its normal position over the united area. It will then at once
appear that the upper and lower parts of both retinas will fall upon
the corresponding parts of the united area, that the outer part of the
left retina and the inner part of the right will fall upon the outer
portion of the left side of the united area, and vice versa, and that a
vertical line bisecting each retina will fall along the line of union of
the two cerebral visual areas.              The parts concerned with direct or
central vision will therefore correspond with a part of the mesial
surface.        Aud each pair of " identic il points " of the retiuas will
correspond with one and the same spot of the cerebral surface.*

        Muscles on Excitation            of the Frontal and Occipito-
        Temporal Regions of the Brain."                  By E. A. Schafer,
        F.R.S., Jodrell Professor of Physiology in University
        College, London. Received February 13, 1888.
    Conjugate deviation of the eyes to the opposite side is produced by
excitation of entirely different regions of the cerebral cortex.               The
parts which when electrically excited produce this movement are :
(1) An area in the frontal region of the hemisphere which is included
in the motor or psychomotor zone of authors ;* (2) the superior
temporal gyrus ; (3) the upper end of the middle temporal gyrus ;
(4) the posterior limb of the angular gyrus ; (5) the whole cortex of
the occipital lobe including its mesial and under surfaces; (6) the
qua Irate lobule.
     Of these parts, excitation of which produces this result (conjugate
deviation of the eyes to the opposite side), one, viz., the frontal area,
 is distinguished from the rest by the fact that its removal produces
 paralysis of that movement.            This fact has been seized upon by
 Ferrier as indicating an important functional difference, the move
 ments in the one case being probably caused by the direct action of
this part of the cortex upon the centre of origin of the nerves to the
ocular muscles ; but in all other cases by indirect action, the move
 ment when, e.g., the visual or auditory rjgion is stimulated being the
result of visual or auditory impressions (subjective sensations) being
provoked in the brain by the excitation, and these impressions
producing indirectly the action in question.             Others have supported
the view that in all cases the movement is the result of the setting
up of subjective sensations, but that in the case of the frontal area
these are tactile or are connected with the muscular sense.
    It. seemed to me that light would be thrown upon the question if
the period of latent stimulation of the ocular muscles were accurately
determined under exactly the same conditions for the frontal and
posterior (temporal and occipital) areas respectively. The result of
this determination, which I have made in a number of monkeys, is
to show that the latent period is longer by some hundredths of a
second in the case of stimulation of the occipital lobe, or of the
superior temporal gyrus than when the frontal area is stimulated ;
thus indicating that in the former case the nervous impulses must be
transmitted through at least one more nerve centre than in the
latter.

    It seemed probable that this additional centre would be the fronUil
 area itself, but further experiments have proved that this is not the
 case — at least not necessarily so.    For the movement is still obtained
 on exciting    the occipital lobe, or the superior temporal gyrus, even
 after complete excision of the whole of the frontal area, and indeed
 of nearly the whole of the so-called motor region on both sides of
 the   brain in front of the fissure of Rolando.              It would seem,
 therefore, that under these conditions the additional centre must be
 looked for elsewhere — possibly in the grey matter of the corpora
 quadrigemina, or in the basal ganglia.*

    In a previous communication,* the authors have given a detailed
description of a number of micro-organisms — Bacilli and Micrococci
— which they had obtained in the course of investigations on the
distribution    of micro-organisms in the atmosphere.              The present
paper    deals similarly   with a  number    of   typical  and    characteristic
micro-organisms which they have derived from various natural
waters.
    The authors refer to the forms which have been obtained from
water by previous observers, more especially to the " peach-coloured
bacterium," the " Cladothrix dichutoma," and the " Crenothrir kiihni-
ana," as well as to others which have been more recently isolated by
means of the method of gelatine-plate cultivation.
    The authors point out the striking difference between the aerial
and aquatic micro-organisms, micrococci being the predominaut
forms amongst the former, whilst bacillar forms are almost ex
clusively present in water. In fact all the aquatic forms described
are bacilli.

   The chemical action which the several micro-organisms described
exert npon certain solutions containing salts of ammonia and of nitric
acid respectively has been investigated by one of the authors, with
the result that whilst none of the forms in question were found to
oxidise ammonia either to nitrous or nitric acids, several of them
were found to exert a powerfully reducing action on nitrates, con
verting the latter into nitrites, others were without any action on the
nitric acid, and others again caused the disappearance of an
appreciable proportion of the nitric acid without production of a
corresponding amount of nitrite.       The authors point out that these
differences in the behaviour of micro-organisms when introduced into
solutions containing nitrates are capable of furnishing very important
data for distinguishing between forms which otherwise present very
close resemblance.     Thus Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus, pre
viously described by them as closely resembling each other, can be
easily distinguished by the behaviour which they respectively exhibit
towards the nitrate-solution, for whilst both grow luxuriantly in this
medium, the Bacillus subtilis has no action on the nitric acid which
can be quantitatively recovered, the Bacillus cereus, on the other
hand, powerfully reduces the nitrate with formation of nitrite.
   The nitrate-solution employed for the purpose of these experiments
contained potassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, calcium chloride,
calcium nitrate, invert sugar, peptone, and an excess of calcium car
bonate.
   The following is a brief account of the descriptions given of the
various micro-organisms : —
   Bacillus arborescens. — This is seen under a high power ( X 1000
diameters) to be a slender bacillus giving rise to wavy threads,
sometimes of considerable length.        No spores were observed.      In
drop cultivations it is seen to be vibratory.
   On gelatine plates it produces highly characteristic colonies. Under
a low power ( x 100 diameters) the centre is seen to consist of a thin
axial stem with root-like branches from each of its two extremities,
this stem thickens as growth proceeds, and the ramified extremities
become so largely developed that the whole colony has the appearance
of a wheat sheaf.     The plate is slowly liquefied, and the periphery of
the colony extends irregularly and to some distance from the centre,
over the surface of the gelatine, giving rise to beautiful iridescent
colours.
   On potatoes it produces a fine deep-coloured orange pigment.
   On nitrates it has no action in the solution employed.
   Bacillus aquatilis. — This is a slender bacillus also giving rise to
wavy threads.     No spores were observed, and the individual bacilli
are seen in drop cultivations to exhibit only an oscillatory motion.
   On gelatine plates the contour of the colony becomes more and

416        Mrs. G. C.   Frankland and Dr. P. F. Frankland.         [Mar.  8,
more irregular as they approach the surface ; when liquefaction of
the gelatine commences, which only takes place excessively slowly,
convoluted bands of threads are seen to extend from the ceDtre
towards the periphery.
    It grows with great difficulty in all the media employed with the
exception of the aqueous solution, in which it grows abundantly, but
does not convert the nitrate into nitrite.
    Bacillus liquidus. — This is a short fat bacillus of very variable
dimensions.        In drop cultivations they are seen usually hanging
together in pairs, and exhibit great motility.
    It liquefies the gelatine, rapidly producing large circular depressions
with almost clear contents on gelatine plates.
    It produces a smooth shining expansion on agar-agar, and on
potatoes a thick flesh-coloured pigment.
    It reduces the nitrate powerfully in the aqueous solution em
ployed.
   Bacillus vermicularis. — This is a large bacillus with rounded ends,
giving rise to extensive vermiform threads.          It produces fine oval
spores. In drop crystallisations it exhibits oscillatory movement only.
    It powerfully reduces nitrates to nitrites.
    Bacillus nubilus. — This is a fine slender bacillus, which gives rise to
wavy threads.        No spores were observed.     In drop cultivations the
isolated bacilli exhibit violent circular movements with but little
motion of translation.
    On gelatine plates tho growth is very characteristic, nothing being
visible but patches of cloudy expansions with, in some cases, a very
faintly-defined centre.       The gelatine rapidly becomes softened, and
liquefaction soon follows.
    In gelatine-tubes the same characteristic cloudy appearance is
produced.       Its growth in the aqueous solution described results in
the reduction of a very small proportion of the nitrate to nitrite.
    Bacillus ramosus. — This is a large bacillus much resembling B. sub-
tilis, giving rise to long threads and spores, which are, however,
rounder in shape than those of the latter organism. In drop cultiva
tions the isolated bacilli exhibit very slight oscillatory movement.
    The colonies on the gelatine plates are seen to consist of a cloudy
centre with tangled root-like branches which extend in every direc
tion. Later liquefaction of the gelatine takes place.
    In gelatine the whole of the tube becomes impregnated with fluffy
ramifications, later liquefaction takes place, and a tough pelbicle forms
on the surface.
    When      grown on potatoes, it forms a dry continuous surface
expansion which is almost quite white.
    It exerts a powerfully reducing action on nitrates in the solution
employed.

    Bacillus aurantiacus. — This is a short fat bacillus of very variable
dimensions.       No spores were observed.         In drop cultivations the
isolated bacilli   are seen to  be motile.
    On gelatine plates it produces bright orange pin-heads, but on
potatoes it gives rise to a magnificent brilliant red-orange pigment,
which does not however extend far from the point of inocula
tion.
    It reduces the nitrates to nitrites only very slightly in the solution
 employed.
    Bacillus viscosiis. — This is a short bacillus about three or four
 times as long as broad, occurring mostly in pairs. No spores were
 observed.     It is exceedingly motile.
    It very rapidly liquefies the gelatine, rendering it very viscid and
 colouring it green.     On agar-agar the whole surface quickly assumes
 a green tint.
    No reduction of the nitric acid takes place when grown in the
 aqueous solution described.
    Bacillus violaceus. — This is a bacillus varying in thickness, some
 times appearing short and stout, but when grown on agar assuming
 a  far more slender appearance      ;  it also gives rise to short threads.
 Spore formation was observed.         In drop cultivations they are seen to
 be motile, the movement being, however, principally vibratory and
 rotatory.
     It produces on agar-agar a fine dark violet expansion.
     It  powerfully reduces nitrates to nitrites when grown           in the
 aqueous    solution  employed.
     Bacillus diffusus. — A fine slender bacillus recurring frequently in
  pairs, and giving rise also occasionally to long undulating threads.
  No spores were observed. In drop cultivations the bacilli are seen to
 execute vigorous oscillatory and rotatory movements, but do not
  traverse the field of the microscope.
     On gelatine plates the colonies give rise on reaching the surface to
 a halo, which, extending from the centre, spreads to a considerable
  distance ronnd, and is composed of a very thin and characteristically
  mottled expansion.
     It slightly reduces the nitrates to nitrites when grown in the
  aqneous solution employed.
     Bacillus candicans. — This bacillus varies very much in form in one
  and the same cultivation and still more in cultivations with different
  media ; sometimes it has almost the appearance of a micrococcus, at
  other times it shows a tendency to grow into short threads. In drop
  cultivations the same variety of forms was observed, but in no case
  was anything but oscillatory motion visible.
     When grown on gelatine plates it produces surface expansions
  much resembling drops of milk.

     Although it grows abundantly in the aqueous solution employed, it
 exerts no reducing action on the nitric acid.
    Bacillus scissus. — In form this organism much resembles Bacillui
 prodigiosus.    In no case were spores observed. In drop cultivations it
 is seen to be very motile.
    It produces pale light green surface expansions on gelatine plates
 which, under a low power ( x 100 diameters), are seen to be of fine
 granular texture, the edge being much frayed out.
     In tubes the gelatine and agar-agar become tinted green.
    It powerfully reduces nitrates to nitrites in the solution employed.
     Of the above, the first nine were derived from water, whilst the
 remaining three were obtained from garden soil.

                                 (Abstract.)
    In the   present memoir the author details the results     of further
observations as to the electromotive properties of the           electrical
organ of Torpedo, the experiments being carried out in October,
 1887, at the laboratory of the Sooiete Scientifique d'Arcachon.
    I. The first part of the work deals entirely with the phenomena of
 "irreciprocal conduction" in the organ of Torpedo,       as described by
du Bois-Reymond.
    From du Bois-Reymond's experiments it would appear that the
organ possesses the remarkable property of conducting an intense
current of short duration, led lengthwise through its columns, better
when the current is directed from its ventral to its dorsal surface
than when directed the reverse way. The former direction coincides
with that of the current of the shock of the organ, and is therefore
                   " homodromous," the latter
termed by him                                    being opposite in direc
                  "                    The evidence rests upon the value
tion, is termed     heterodromous."
of the galvanometric deflections obtained when both currents are
allowed to traverse a strip of organ and a galvanometric circuit. The
deflections are markedly unequal, particularly when induced currents
are used, the homodromous effect being always much greater than the

1888.]       the Electrical Organ of Torpedo mavmorata.              419
heterodromous.      The homodromous     current must therefore either
encounter less resistance than the heterodromous, or its electromotive
force must be suddenly strengthened, and that of the heterodromous
current weakened, by the sudden establishment in the tissue of a new
source of electromotive energy.       The first is the view taken by
Professor du Bois-Reymond.
   (1.) The present rheotome experiments reveal (a) the new fact
that the passage of such intense currents of short duration is always
followed by an excitatory response (shock) in the tissue ; (6) that if
the intense current due to this response is allowed to affect the gal
vanometer as well as the induced or other exciting current, then by
obvious algebraic summation the homodromons deflection must be
much larger than the heterodromous ; (c) and that when by means of
a fast-moving rheotome the induction shock only is allowed to affect
the instrument, no irreciprocity is found.
   The author therefore assumes that the phenomena of irreciprocal
conduction are in reality excitatory phenomena, the nature of which,
from the methods of investigation used, have not been recognised.
   (2.) The time relations of this response of the isolated strip of the
organ to the direct stimulation by the traversing induction shock are
now for the first time investigated, by means of the rheotome, and the
influence of temperature and other conditions upon these is shown by
experimental evidence.
   II. The second part deals with entirely novel phenomena, namely,
the excitation of the organ by the current of its own excitatory state.
It is shown that in vigorous summer fish every response of the whole
or part of the organ to a single excitation of its nerves is followed by
a second response, due to the passage through its own substance of
the intense current of the first response.    In other words the shock
of the organ 'excites its own nerve fibres and nerve endiugs, pro
ducing a feebler second shock, which in a similar manner evolves a
feebler third shock ; this a fourth, and so on.
   The response of the isolated organ to nerve excitation is thus
multiple ; a primary, secondary, tertiary response following the appli
cation to the nerve of a single stimulus. Since all these responses
produce currents similarly directed through the columns of the organ,
each column during its activity must reinforce by its echoes the force
of the primary explosion, both in its own substance and also in that
of its neighbours.

                                (Abstract.)
    The brain of Ceratodus has the following general arrangement : —
The membrane which represents the pia mater is of great thickness
and toughness ; there are two regions where a tela choroidea is de
veloped : one where it covers in the fourth ventricle, and the other
where it penetrates through the third ventricle and separates the
lateral ventricles from each other.
    The ventricles are all of large size, and the walls of the lateral
ventricles are not completed by nervous tissue.         The thalamence-
phalon and the mesencephalon are narrow, and the medulla oblongata
is wide.
    All  the cranial nerves are present except the abducens and the
hypoglossal. There is a large communicating branch between the
trifacial and the vagus.    The glossopharyngeal has no separate root,
but is a branch of the vagus.      The ganglion of the vagus is not the
termination of the main trunk, but is an offshoot from the ramns
lateralis ; the ganglion gives off the branchial nerves and the ramus
intestinalis ; the ramus lateralis passing on without entering it.
   In the minute structure of the dorsal part of the cerebrum there
are four layers to be seen, externally a layer of finely granular neo-
roglia, with slight indications of radial striation ; next a layer of
lurger sized cells ; then another layer of neuroglia with fibrillar having
a tendency to a longitudinal direction ; finally, a layer of rounded
cells closely crowded together on the internal surface.      The ventral
part of the cerebrum has only two layers — the external of neuroglia
and the internal of rounded cells.
   The olfactory lobes resemble the cerebrum in structure ; there is an
internal layer of cells continuous with those of the cerebrum, and an
external layer of glomeruli olfactorii, which seem as if they were the
external layer of the cerebrum condensed ; between the two there is a
layer of longitudinal fibres on which fusiform cells are developed.
   The optic lobes also consist of four layers ; externally there is a
layer of longitudinal fibrils derived from the optic tract; then a layer
of smoothly granular neuroglia; then a layer of transverse fibrillfe
which collect into a commissure in the central line at the dorsnl
surface ; there are also fusiform and rounded cells sparingly scattered

1888.]           Nervous System in Vertebrated Animals.               421
through it; -the internal layer contains cells mostly rounded.     At the
central line on the dorsal surface there is a ganglion of large cells
resembling those of the optic lobe of the Plagiostomata.
    The cerebellum is a mere bridge over the fourth ventricle, and its
structure presents the usual number of layers ; internally there is
the fibrous layer which ultimately goes to form the crura cerebelli ad
medullam; then the granular layer, the cells of which are of large
size compared to those of the same layer in Teleostei and Plagiosto
mata ; then comes a layer of Purkinje cells, the form and number of
processes of which are not uniform ; the external layer is the molecu
lar, which consists of a coarsely granular network derived from the
processes of the Purkinje cells, also a network of finer fibrils and
many rounded cells.
    In the spinal cord there are three columns of longitudinal fibres on
each side in the white substance, viz., the ventral columns between
the two ventral roots of the spinal nerves, the lateral columns between
the dorsal and ventral roots, and the dorsal columns between the two
dorsal roots ; fibres of large size are scattered throughout the two
former columns, but are collected principally in the ventral ; the dursal
columns consist entirely of fibres of minute size.
    The principal feature in the white substance is a fibre of gigantic
dimensions which is situated on the summit of the ventral columns
— one on each side ; it consists of a common medullary sheath enclosing,
where the fibre is- largest, about forty to fifty axis-cylinders ; these
have the characteristics of the axis-cylinders of the ordinary fibres of
the white substance, but have no separate medullary sheaths ; this
fibre is traceable throughout the spinal cord ; commencing opposite
the posterior end of the abdomen, it extends forward to a short" dis
 tance behind the exit of the facial nerve; it varies in size and becomes
 of the greatest diameter near the posterior end of the medulla oblon
 gata ; its axes escape through the medullary sheath and join the
 longitudinal fibres of the ventral columns ; near its anterior termina
 tion all the axes have escaped except one ; at this point it bears a
 great resemblance to Mauthner's fibre in the Teleostei.          This re
 maining fibre decussates with that of the other side a short distance
 behind the exit of the facial nerve and joins the root of that
 nerve.
    In   the grey substance of the spinal cord there are two series of
 ganglia — one in the ventral horn, which consists of multipolar cells
 often of very large size ; they send processes into the ventral and
 lateral columns which often, become the smaller-sized longitudinal
 fibres.   The cells of the other series are of smaller size and are
 situated in the substantia gelatinosa centralis ; they are smooth in
 outline and give off one or two processes ; they probably have to do
  with the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. Cells also of this kind

occur at other places as in the fibrae rectae, and in the- field of tbe
ventral columns.
    The transverse commissures are — one in the spinal cord which
passes through the substantia golatinosa centralis over the central
canal ; another occurs on the ventral side of the anterior part of the
medulla oblongata and corresponds to the commissura ansulata of
Teleostei ; it is connected with the commissure in the dorsal part of
the optic lobes.      Two other commissures are present corresponding
respectively to the anterior and posterior commissures of the third
ventricle of Mammalia.
    There is no chiasma of the optic nerve visible externally; what
there is of it is situated in the substance of the thalamencephalon.
    The anterior root of the fifth nerve arises from a ganglion occupy
ing a broad swelling in the lateral part of the grey matter of the floor
of the fourth ventricle.     The posterior root arises from the summit
of the restiform bodies.
    The facial passes backwards in a small tubercle at the junction of
the floor of the fourth ventricle with the restiform bodies.
    The acusticus arises from a bundle of fibres which are situated on
the summits of the ventral columns, and appears to be a continuation
forward of that part of the multiaxial fibre which has not decussated.
    The vagus has five roots ; they pass backward and enter in succes
sion the same tubercle as, and to the outside of, the facial nerve ; the
three posterior roots are double, so that the vagus is equivalent to
eight nerves, and consists entirely of dorsal roots.
    Two nerves are given off from the ventral side of the mednll*
oblongata, each of which has two roots ; they do not join the vagus
but pass back some distance in the vertebral canal and emerge on n
level with the exit of the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves.
    The second and third spinal nerves supply the pectoral fin and
pursue the course usually followed by the hypoglossal when that nerve
 is present in Teleostei.
    The fibres of the ventral roots of the spinal nerves enter in a direc
 tion upward and forward toward the inner edge of the multiaxial
 fibre, between it and the central canal, and then passing over the dorsal
 edge of the same, are either lost in the grey substance of the ventral
 horn, join a process of one of the multipolar cells, or become one of
 the longitudinal fibres of the ventral column.
     The brain of Ceratoilus presents an embryonic condition in three
 respects, viz., first in the extreme size of the ventricles and in the
 tenuity of the substance of their walls ; second, in the alternating
 origins of the dorsal and ventral roots; third, in the fact that the
 origins of the dorsal roots are close to the central line.
     Compared to Protopterns it differs in the shape and the imperfec
 tion of the cerebral lobes, and in the fact of its having a well-deve

   Ceratodus agrees also with the Ganoids in the comparative narrow
ness of the mesencephalon and in the proportions of the cerebellum.
   With the Plagiostomata it agrees in the structure of the optic
lobes, both orders presenting a ganglion of large cells in the dorsal
part.    With the Teleostei it agrees in the multiaxial fibres which, a
short distance anterior to its termination, resemble the Manthner's
fibres, also in the position and the fact of their decussation.
   With Petromyzan it agrees in the structure of the tela choroidea
which covers the fourth ventricle.

       Relation to the Periodic Law." By W. Chandler Roberts-

       Science, and Royal School of Mines, South Kensington.
       Received March 15, 1888.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The author points to the great industrial importance of the in
fluence    exerted by small quantities of metallic    and other impurities
on masses of metals in which they are hidden.        He states that this is
most marked in the case of iron, and that when        Bergman discovered,
in 1781, that the difference between wrought          iron, steel, and cast
iron depends on the presence or absence of            a small amount of
"graphite,"     he was astonished   at the smallness of the amount of
matter which is capable of producing such singular changes in the
properties of iron.       The evidence as to the importance of small
quantities of impurity is quite as strong in other directions at the
present day, as is shown by the statement of Sir Hussey Vivian, that
one-thousandth part of antimony converts " best select " copper into
 the worst conceivable, and by the assertion of Mr. Preece, that
                                                                         "a
 submarine cable made of the copper of to-day," now that the neces
                                                   " will
sity for employing pure copper is recognised,             carry double the
 number of messages that a similar cable of copper would in 1858,"
 when the influence of impurities in increasing the electrical resistance
 of copper was not understood.
    Allusion is made to the effect of a small quantity of tellurium on
 bismuth. Commercially pure bismuth has a fracture showing brilliant
 mirror-like planes, but if one-thousandth part of tellurium be present
 the fracture is minutely crystalline.       Specimens of such bismuth

 were submitted to the Society.     The author states that in his own
 experiments he has employed gold prepared by himself with great
 care, the purity of which has been recognised        by M. Stas. A
 portion of this gold was recently used by Professor Thorpe in a
 determination of the atomic weight of gold.        Gold was selected
                                                  —
 for the experiments for the following reasons: It can be prepared
 of a very high degree of purity ; it possesses considerable tenacity
 and ductility ; the accuracy of the results of the experiments is
 not likely to be disturbed by the oxidation of the metal or by the
 presence of occluded gases ; and the amount of impurity added to the
gold can be determined with rigorous accuracy. The influence of
small quantities of metallic impurity in rendering gold brittle has
long been known, and is frequently referred to by the older metallur
gists, especially by Geber, Biringuccio, and Gellert, and by Robert
Boyle. The first systematic experiments on the subject were made
by Hatchett at the request of the Privy Council, and were com-
municated to the Royal Society in 1803. Hatchett concluded that
certain metals, even when present in so small an amount as the l-iVo
part of the mass, will render gold brittle, and he stated that "The
different metallic substances which have been employed in these
experiments appear to effect gold in the following decreasing order: —
1. Bismuth; 2. Lead; 3. Antimony; 4. Arsenic; 5. Zinc; 6. Cobalt;
7. Manganese; 8. Nickel; 9. Tin; 10. Iron; 11. Platinum;       12. Cop
per; 13. Silver."    Mr. Hatchett did not, however, employ pure gold,
and in his time the importance of submitting metals to mechanical
tests was not understood.
   The author then proceeds to describe the results of his own experi
ments,   and he states that in selecting tenacity as the test to which
the metal should be submitted with a view to ascertain the. effect of
the added matter, the following considerations presented themselves.
W. Spring has built up alloys by compressing the powders of the
constituent metals, and by pointing to the evidence of molecular
mobility in solid alloys he has done much to show the close connexion
which exists between cohesion and chemical affinity. Raoul Pictet
considers that there is intimate relation between the melting points of
metals and the lengths of their molecular oscillations, the length of
the oscillation diminishing as the melting point rises ; and, as Car-
                           " We should
nelley has pointed out,                 expect that those metals which
have the highest melting points would also be the most tenacious."
It is known that the melting points of metals are altered by the
presence of small quantities of foreign matter, and their cohesion is
also thereby altered.    The degree of cohesion may thus be investi
gated   either by the  aid of heat or by mechanical stress.   It might
be well to ascertain    the amonnt of change in the melting point of
gold produced by the presence of the different elements in small

 quantity, bat, unfortunately, slight variations in high melting points
 are very difficult to determine with even approximate accuracy,
 iind it appeared to be better to ascertain the effect of metallic and
 other impurities on the cohesion of the gold, as indicated by the
 amount of force externally applied in an ordinary testing-machine,
 and in that way to ascertain whether the effect of added metals is
 amenable to any known law.
    The purest gold attainable has a tenacity of 7-0 tons per square
 inch, aud an elongation of 30-8 per cent, on 3 inches.                   Professor
 Kennedy     found  that  a  less  pure sample     which  contained 999-87 parts
 of gold in 1000, broke with a load of 6-29 tons per square inch ; it
 had an elastic limit of 212 tons per square inch, and elongated 18-5
 per cent, before breaking.          In the following experiments only the
 purest gold that could be prepared was employed.                The effect on the
 tenacity of gold produced by adding to it about 0-2 per cent. of
 various metals and metalloids is shown in the following table, in
 which the results are arranged according to the tensile strengths : —

428            Mr. H. H. Turner.       Observations of  the   [Mar. 15,
   The testing-machine employed is of the form devised by Professor
Gollner, and used by him at Prague. It is a double lever vertical
machine working up to a stress of 20 tons.
    The author points out that these results lead to the conclusion that
the tenacity of gold is affected by the elements in the order of their
atomic volumes, and he discusses the evidence in favour of this view
at some length, pointing especially to the fact that while those ele
ments, the atomic volumes of which are higher than that of gold,
gveatly diminish its tenacity, silver, which has nearly the same atomic
volume as gold, hardly affects either its tenacity or its extensibility.
He shows that, so far as the experiments have been conducted, not a
single metal or metalloid which occupies a position at the base of
either of the loops of Lothar Meyer's curve (which is a graphical
representation of the periodic law of Newlands and Mendeleef)
diminishes the tenacity of gold, while, on the other hand, metals
which render gold fragile all occupy higher positions on Meyer's
curve than gold does, and he urges that the relations between these
small quantities of the elements and the masses of metal in which
they are hidden are under the control of the law of periodicity,
which states that
                     " The properties of the elements ai« a periodic
function of their atomic weights."      Carnelley has given strong evi
                                                            "
dence in favour of supplementing the law as follows : — The proper
ties of compounds of the elements are a periodic function of the
atomic weights of their constituent elements," and the question
arises, May the law be so extended as to govern the relations
between the constituent metals of alloys in which, as is well known,
the atomic proportions are often far from simple ?
   The effect on gold of small but varying quantities of metals singly
nnd in presence of other metals, demands examination, and their
influence on the specific gravity of gold must be ascertained.     Until
this has been done no explanation as to the mode of action of ele
ments with large atomic volumes will be attempted.

    The three lines g, i, and k were extremely short, and did not appear
to extend beyond the chromosphere before and after totality.
    The unfavourable conditions under which the observations were
made as compared with Mr. Lockyer's — with a low sun and through
passing clouds, and an atmosphere charged with moisture which
doubtless diminished the light in this region of the spectrum con
siderably — perhaps account in some measure for the striking differ
ence in vividness of the phenomena.                The solar activity was also
much nearer minimum in 1886 than in 1882. As far as they go, how
ever, the observations are confirmatory of Mr. Lockyer's, except in
the visibility of the line k after totality.          This line was not noted
before totality, and it is possible that the observation may be spurious,
although the evidence for it is as good as that for all the obser
vations, which were found to be generally of a difficult character. The
instrument used was a 6-inch refractor by Simms, with a grating
spectroscope, the grating being 1£ inch square, ruled with 17,000 lines
to the inch. The second order of spectrum was used.

   2. During totality   I  was directed to look for currents in the corona.
 I can  only report a negative result. The structure of the corona
appeared in a 4-inch refractor, with a power of 80, to be radial to
the limb throughout, and no striking differences in special localities
were noticed.
   Appended to the paper are two drawings which do not attempt to
give more than the distances to which the coronal rays extended in
various directions. One was made by Mr. St. George with an opera
glass, and the other by Lieutenant Smith with the naked eye ; but in
the latter case the observer's eyes had been specially covered fifteen
minutes before totality, and the brighter portions of the corona
were screened from him by a disk of angular diameter three times
that of the moon.       He consequently traced the rays much farther
than Mr. St. George, though, allowing for this difference in conditions,
the drawings are    fairly accordant.

   The authors compare the results obtained by the Rutherford
grating which they used in measuring the wave-lengths of the iron
lines with those obtained with the larger Rowland's grating used for
measuring the wave-lengths recorded in this paper, arid find them
closely concordant.     They next compare the measures of wave-lengths
of the cadmium lines obtained by them by means of a plane
Rowland's grating and a goniometer with an 18-inch graduated
circle with those obtained by Bell with a large concave grating of
20 feet focal length.     The result of the comparison is that the plane
grating gives measures which agree very closely with those given by
the concave grating, while the former gives more light and is better
for complicated spectra, such as those described in this paper, because
the overlapping spectra of different orders are not all in focus
together as they are when a concave grating is used.
   The authors give a list of 580 ultra-violet lines of cobalt and 408
lines of nickel. They find a certain general resemblance of the two
spectra, but no such exact corrrespondence as the close chemical rela
tionship of the two metals would render probable.          They point out
that the coincidences of lines of the two metals are hardly, if at all,
more in number than would have been the case if the distribution of
the lines had been fortuitous.      They give a map of each spectrum to
the same scale as Angstrom's normal solar spectrum.

  The memoir       is occupied    with the investigation of a class of
functional invariants, constituted by combinations of the partial
 differential coefficients of a function of more than one independent
variable.     As the number of independent variables is limited to two,
partly    for the sake of conciseness, the general definition of such an
invariant is that it is a function 0 of the partial differential coefficients
of a dependent variable z with regard to x and y, siich that when the inde
pendent variables are changed to X and Y, and the same function <b is
formed with regard to the new variables, the relation
                                          <J,     =    J"0

              regard to each of the independent variables                               ;

Every invariant can be expressed in terms of this aggregate of irre

      of Pterosaurian (Scaphognathus Purdoni) from the Upper
       Lias, near Whitby, Yorkshire."         By E. T. Newton, F.G.S.,
       F.Z.S., Geological Survey. Communicated by Dr. Archi
       bald Geikie, F.R.S. Received March 1, 1888.
                                (Abstract.)
    The fossil Pterodactyl skull which is the subject of this com
munication was obtained from the Upper Lias of Lofthouse, near
Whitby, by the Rev. D. W. Purdon, of Wolverhampton.                It is the
first Pterodactyl found in the Yorkshire        Lias, and  is a new form,
allied to the Continental Jurassic species Scapltognathus (Pterodactylus)
crassirostris of Goldfuss.   The structure of the skull, including the
back, base, and palatal regions, is better shown than in any pre
viously discovered specimen ; and in addition to this the brain and
parts of the auditory organs have been exposed.
   In its present condition the skull is about five and a half inches
long ; but apparently about two inches of the front are wanting.
The elongated suout gives the skull a very bird- like appearance;
but its most striking features are the five apertures, surrounded by
bone, seen on each side.    The orbit is the largest of these apertures :
in front of this, and next in size, is the ant-orbital fossa ; still further
forward is the somewhat smaller external nostril. Behind the orbit
is the temporal space, divided by a bony bar into the supra- and infra
temporal fossae.     The premaxillae are united to form the prenasal
part of the suout, and send backwards an upper median process
which meets the frontals between the orbits. The maxilla is not
clearly divided from the premaxilla ; but there can be no donbt that

  the bone separating the nasal aperture from the ant-orbital fossa is a
  process of the maxilla.       Alveoli for four teeth are preserved on
  each side ; but it is not quite certain whether they all belong to the
  premaxill®.
     On the upper surface of the skull are to be seen the nasals and
  prefrontals, on each side of the premaxillary process.        The frontals
  form the upper boundaries to the orbits and are confluent posteriorly
  with the parietals. The supra-occipital region has been broken away.
  Strong buttresses extend outward from the postfrontal and parietal
  regions to form the supra-temporal bar. There is on each side a
  large lachrymal bone forming the greater part of the upper and
  hinder boundary of the ant-orbital fossa. The jugal and quadrato-jugal
  are of a somewhat unusual form ; the former bounding the lower half
  of the orbit, and the latter enclosing in an open V the greater part of
  the infra-temporal fossa. The quadrate is a wide but thin plate seen
  chiefly at the back of the skull. The base of the cranium is re
  markable for its depth and extreme antero-posterior flattening ;
  and viewed from behind, a pair of long rods are seen extending from
  its lower margin, one on each side, to the inner angles of the quad
  rates.    These bones are regarded as the homologues of the basi-ptery-
  goid processes of the sphenoid, such as are seen in some lizards and
  birds, as for example in the Chameleon and Emu.
     From the point of junction of the quadrate and basi-pterygoid
  process a bone runs along the palate, and dividing anteriorly forms
  the hinder boundary of the internal nostril, its outer portion joining
  the maxilla and its inner being continuous with a median bone
  occnpying the position of a vomer.       This bony bar, it is thought,
  represents the palatine and pterygoid bones, and its relations agree
  better with those of the lizard than with those of the bird, seeing
  that it does not come into such close contact with the base of the
  skull as it does in birds, but is thrust outwards by tbe long basi-
  pterygoid process.
     The back of the skull is essentially lacertilian.       A large parocci-
  pital bone extends outwards from the sides of the foramen magnum,
  and its distal end expanding, embraces the upper part of the quad
  rate. The relation which the base of the paroccipital bears to the
  semicircular canals shows that it must be chiefly formed by the
  opisthotic element, as Prof. W. K. Parker has shown to be the case
   in lizards, and not by the exoccipital as it is in birds.
     Bv removing the frontal and parietal bones of the left side, a cast of
  the brain cavity has been exposed, which there can be no doubt
  represents the form of the brain, just as closely as does that of a
  bird's cranial cavity.      In proportion to the size of the entire
  skull, the brain of this Pterodactyl is very small, being not more
i than one-eighth of its length. Each cerebral lobe is oval in shape,

and     abont as thick aR it is wide. The olfactory lobe is small.
Behind the cerebrum is a pair of large optic lobes, occupying a
prominent position on the sides of the brain, and extending upward*
well to the upper surface, but not meeting above in the middle
line. The region of the cerebellum has been broken away, and
its exact form therefore is somewhat uncertain ; but judging from
portions which remain, it is tolerably clear that it extended between
the optic lobes, and may have reached as far forwards as the cere
brum.     Attached to the side of the medulla oblongata is a large
flocculus, such as occurs in this position in birds.
    It was the finding of the flocculus which led to the discovery of
some parts of the auditory apparatus.        On clearing away the stone
in this region, a small tube filled with matrix was found arching
over the pedicle of the flocculus and dipping down between it and the
optic lobe. This tube occupies the position of the anterior vertical
semicircular canal in the goose. By tracing the canal backwards
and downwards it was found to join another similar tube forming an
arch behind the flocculus, that is, in just the position of a posterior
 vertical semicircular canal.    By careful excavation below the floccu
lus, a portion of a third tube was found, arching outwards in a
horizontal plane, and this is believed to be the external semicircular
canal.
    The similarity between the base of the fossil skull and that of the
 Chameleon led to the inference that the fenestra ovalis would he
found to be similarly placed in both, and by clearing away the matrix
from the orbit and temporal fossa this inference was proved to be
 correct.   The form and relations of the quadrate bone make it highly
probable that this Pterosaurian had no ear-drum.
    A comparison of this fossil with the skulls of known Pterosauria,
leaves no doubt that it is more nearly related to the Scaphogrmthiu
 (Plerodactylus) crassirostris than to any other species, but as it differs
 from that form, and is evidently new, it is to be named specifically
 Scaphngnathus Purdoni.
    The Pterosaurian skull, as exemplified by this Lias fossil, resembles
 more the Lacertilian than any other type of Reptile skull ; and seeing
 that the skulls of birds and lizards are in many points very similar,
 one is not surprised to find in this fossil characters which are also
 found in both these groups.      In considering, therefore, the relation
 which the Pterosaurian skull bears to those of birds and lizards, the
 characters should be especially noticed which serve to distinguish
 between the two groups, thus : —
     1. In birds the brain-case is larger in proportion to the size of the
 skull than it is in lizards.
    2. The quadrate, pterygoid, and palatine bones are movable on the
 skull in birds ; but more or less fixed in lizards.

   3.  In birds   the hinder end     of the palatine and front end of the
pterygoid are bronght into close relation with the rostrum of the
sphenoid.     This is not the case with lizards.
   4. The orbit is rarely completed by bone in birds, and never by the
jngal.    In lizards the orbit is surronnded by bone, and the jugal forms
part of it.
    5. In birds   there is no prefrontal bone, while  it is always present in
lizards.
    6. No bird has a supratemporal bar of bone, but it is always
developed in lizards.
    7. In lizards the paroccipital     process is large and formed by the
opisthotic.     In birds    the  paroccipital is small and formed by the
exoecipital.
    8. In birds the bones of the cranium are early ankylosed;       in lizards
they nearly always remain separate.
    9. Birds have the premaxillae large and united into one bone, in
lizards they are usually small.
    10. The ant-orbital fossa which is present in birds is only occasion
ally present in lizards.
    11. In birds there is always a lower temporal bar of bone extend
ing from the maxilla to the quadrate.         This bar is incomplete in all
lizards except Sphenodon, although well developed in other reptiles.
    The skull of Scaphognathus Purdoni agrees with lizards in the first
seven of the above characters ; and with birds in those numbered 8,
9, 10.    Number 11 need not be considered, as it can scarcely be re
garded as distinctive.          The greater importance of the first seven
characters makes it clear that in the structure of the skull, 8. Purdoni
most nearly resembles the Lacertilia.
    The brain of Scaphognathus Purdoni agrees with that of reptiles in
its relatively small size : while the separation of the optic lobes by the
cerebellum and the meeting of the latter with the cerebrum, as well
 as the possession of a distinct flocculus, are important points in which
it resembles the brain of the bird. On the other hand the form of
the optic lobes is unlike that of any living bird.
    The brain of the American fossil bird, Hesperornis, shows a striking
resemblance to that of Scaphognathus Purdoni, for not only is it pro
portionally smaller than in recent birds, but the relation of the cere
bellum and cerebrum to the optic lobes is very similar.
    The facts above stated seem to show that the Pterosauria are
related to the birds in the form of the brain, and to the lizards in
the structure of the skull.         This, however, does not constitute the
Pterosaurian a transitional form between birds and reptiles, in the
sense of the Pterosauria having been derived from reptiles, or of the
 birds having been derived from Pterosauria ; but rather points to
 Aves, Pterosauria, and Reptilia having been derived from some

    The whole of the following paper was planned and a great part of it
 was written when Captain Wharton's letter appeared in Nature,' on
                                                                       '
 Feb. 23.      Captain Wharton has anticipated my objections to the
 theory put    forward    by Mr. Murray in explanation of the formation of
 atolls and barrier reefs, and has suggested that the growth of corals
 on the periphery of a submerged bank is sufficient to explain the
 elevated rim of a barrier reef or atoll, and the contained lagoon
 channel or lagoon.        In this I cordially agree with him, and can only
 express my satisfaction that so eminent an observer should hare
 arrived, after an extended study, at conclusions nearly identical
 with mine.       In accounting for the luxuriance of coral growth upon
 the peripheral slopes of an atoll, I differ slightly from Captain
 Wharton, and the publication of his letter has led me to extend and
 modify the plan of the latter half of this paper, in order to show more
 clearly the points in which I agree with and those in which I differ
 from him.       I may take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to
 Captain Wharton for his kindness in sending me notes on the struc
 ture of the Cosmoledo and Farquhar groups, and to Dr. S. J. Hickson
 who has given me the benefit of his experience in N. Celebes.

  1888.]      and the Coral Formations     of the  Indian Ocean.        441
     In my visit to Diego Garcia in 1885 I took with me, among other
 works, the splendid papers of Alex. Agassiz on tbe Tortugas and
 Florida reefs, and diligently compared all his observations with struc
 tures existing at Diego Garcia.       I was much struck by the analogy
 between the formations, but     I also found differences in the stratifica
 tion of rocks, &c., which led me to the conviction that there has been
 a very small amount of elevation in the Chagos              group, which
 certainly  has not been  the case  in the Florida reefs.   This conviction
 was shared by an old resident on Diego Garcia, M. Spurs, a naturalist
 who has devoted many years to the study of coral reefs.
     A reference to the map will show that Diego Garcia is a typical
 atoll ; a narrow strip of land varying in width from a mile to 30
 yards, nearly completely encircles a lagoon of irregular shape. The
 lagoon is open to the ocean towards the north-west, its month being
 divided by three small islets into four channels, of which three are
 sufficiently deep to allow ships to enter the lagoon. The three islands
 are known by the names of Bird Island, Middle Island, and East
 Island (He des Oiseaux, He du Milieu, and He de l'Est), the last
 named being the largest of the three, and the one on which        I  spent
 much of my time during my visit. The whole of the land composing
 the atoll is very low ; the highest point in the island is not more than
 30 feet above the level of high tide, and this height, which is quite
exceptional, is due to the accumulation of great heaps of sand
 through the action of the S.E. trade winds which blow with consider
able strength for more than one-half of the year. Diego Garcia is
the southerumost atoll of the Chagos group ; it lies in S. lat. 7° 26',
E. long. 72° 23', and forms the last of the great chain of coral forma
tions reaching from the Laccadive Islands through the Maldives to
the Chagos group. To its south-west lie the submerged atoll-shaped
reefs known as Pitt's Bank and Centurion's Bank, to iti north lies
the huge submerged atoll known as the Great Chagos Bank. It is an
interesting fact that throughout the Laccadive, Maldive, and Chagos
groups there is no instance of a fringing or of a barrier reef ; nothing
but coral structure rises above the waves, all the islands are atolls ;
none of these are upraised, but there are several submerged banks.
The existence of this long line of atolls seemed to be one of the
strongest arguments in favour of Darwin's theory on the formation of
coral reefs. If the depths given in Stieler's hand-atlas are correct,
the three groups stand on a submarine bank lying 1000 fathoms
below the surface in an ocean of an average depth of 2000 fathoms.
    In Diego Garcia the nature of the soil varies considerably from
place to place. In some localities it consists of nothing else than bare
coral rock upon the surface of which coral boulders are scattered
about ; in other places it is composed wholly of calcareous sand, and
one may dig down for 6 or 8 feet without finding coral rock.          It is

442       Mr. U. C. Bourne.     The  Atoll of Diego Garcia    [Mar. 22,
obvious    after a short examination that some parts of the land are
older than others, and that the great strip of land was formerly a
series of disconnected islets which have since been joined together by
the accumulation of sand and coral debris between them.          In the
older parts of the island, which have apparently been covered with
vegetation for a considerable period, a thick peaty mould has been
formed by the decay of fallen leaves and stems of trees and shrubs.
   Throughout the island the outer or seaward shore is higher than
the inner or lagoonward shore, owing to the pile of coral boulders
thrown up in the form of a low rampart along the former by the
action of the waves. In most places a flat reef extends fully 60 yards
seaward of the rampart; and this reef is just uncovered at low spring
tides.   As a rule the inner shore slopes gently down into the lagoon
for some distance and then pitches down rather suddenly to a depth
of 10 or 12 fathoms, but in some places there is a depth of 6 or 8
fathoms close up to the inner shores.        Marshy pools of fresh or
brackish water are found in the centre of the strip of laud on the
S.E. and W. sides of the island ; into these the sea enters in many
cases during the highest spring tides, and at the S.E. and S. ends of
the island it has established permanent breaches into some of these
pools, through which the tide runs in and out regularly from the
lagoon. Thus there are formed sheets of water like secondary lagoons
within the strip of land ; these are known on the island by the name of
barachois, and they are of some importance when one comes to con
sider the amount of change which is continually going on in the
island.
   Externally the shores slope away very rapidly to considerable
depths, the sounding line giving depths of 250 fathoms and upward»
at a distance of a few hundred yards from the edge of the reef,
excepting at Horsburgh Point at the S.E. side, where a depth of 45
fathoms is found at a distance of 1 mile from the shore.       Unfortu
nately I had not the apparatus wherewith to make a series of
sectional soundings outside the island, nor if I had had the apparatns
         I
should have had the means of making use of it. The depths within
the lagoon have been accurately determined by H.M.S. "Rambler" iu
1885 ; they vary up to 19 fathoms.       After a stay of two or three
months on the island one cannot fail to be impressed with the im
mense amount of change which is continually in progress.          Large
masses of sand are in the space of a month deposited in one spot to
be swept away during the next month and deposited in another.
Everywhere there is evidence that the sea has encroached npon the
land or that the land has in its turn gained upon the sea. In one
place numerous dead and fallen coco-nut palms show where old
established land has been carried away ; in an adjoining spot tracts of
sand, either bare or covered with a scanty growth of young shrubs,

1888.]        and the Coral Formations    of the  Indian Ocean.        443
show where the combined       action of wind and waves has added a new
piece to the island.     Within the lagoon the currents are constantly
changing     in force and   direction, and their every change affects the
growth of coral in their track. In estimating the structure of the
atoll these changes should be kept in mind, although their complexity
makes it far more difficult to arrive at a correct conclusion.
   In the course of my investigations        I   learnt to distinguish the
following kinds of coral rock formed by the action of the waves or
wind or both combined.
   Firstly, reef rock, a tolerably homogeneous mass of compacted coral
debris, the component parts of which are so thoroughly infiltrated
with carbonate of lime held in solution in the sea-water that the
masses and fragments of coral composing the rock are rarely distin
guished from one another. This form of rock exhibits a fine hori
zontal stratification; it is invariably formed under the sea or between
tide marks.
   Secondly, boulder rock, formed just above high tide mark by means
of the masses of coral which are transported across the reef by the
waves and are piled up to form the low rampart already alluded to.
The interstices of the boulders are soon filled up with coral debris and
sand, aud are cemented together by the spray.           Such rock is only
formed on the seaward shores and invariably shows a stratification
dipping downwards towards the sea.
   Thirdly, shingle rock, which may be of two kinds. The first kind is
horizontally stratified and is scarcely distinguishable from reef rock,
except in its finer texture ; it is formed below water or between tide
marks by the agglomeration of small pieces of broken coral, among
which are included numerous shells of molluscs, remains of Crustacea,
echinoderms, &c., and in the more sheltered parts of the lagoon it may
include considerable masses of dead madrepores imbedded in their
natural position in the rock. This rock is of looser texture than the
reef rock. The second kind of shingle rock is formed above high-
water mark by the action of the waves.         It is entirely composed of
small fragments and exhibits a fine stratification dipping seawards at
an angle.
   Lastly, there is the sand rock formed above water by the action of
the wind. Wherever masses of fine sand are piled up within reach of
the spray they are gradually compacted, and form a friable rock, the
stratification of which dips seaward.
   In many parts of the island I observed that the land was composed
of stratified reef or shingle rock, the strata of which were perfectly
horizontal, and did not dip down towards either shore. Having
observed the manner in which the different kinds of coral rock were
formed, I was at a loss to understand how such horizontally stratified
 masses could have been formed in their present position above high

 water mark, and could only believe that they were originally formed
 as reef or shingle rock below high water mark, and had been subse
 quently raised to their present position. I was thus led to believe that
 a slight elevation had taken place, and this belief was strengthened by
 a study of the formation of East Islet.     This islet is about 800 yards
 long, and nearly 100 yards broad ;. its westernmost extremity is com
 posed of masses of sand piled up on the underlying reef rock, and in
 this place there is a clump of high trees (Hernandia peltata). The
 eastern and by far the larger part of the islet is of different formation.
 The even surface of the soil is covered with a low scrub, but bears no
high trees nor coco-nut palms.      It forms a low plateau, the surface of
which does not slope down towards the lagoon, but is perfectly hori
zontal, and stands 4 feet above the very highest spring tides. The
shore on the lagoonward side shows an abrupt fall of 6 feet to the
reef, which in this place extends for a distance of 50 yards towards
the lagoon, and is only left uncovered at the lowest spring tides. At
the eastern extremity of the island there is no reef, but from 1$ to
2 fathoms of water are found within a few yards of the shore.          This
point is exposed to the ocean, and a strong and constant current sets
against it, so that it is undergoing a considerable amount of erosion.
On the north or seaward side the reef again extends outwards from
the shore, the latter differing from the inner shore in the presence of
a talus of large boulders which have been thrown up against it by the
waves.     Wells have been sunk in various parts of the island, though
for some reason which     I  cannot explain, water is only found in one
of them. Numerous pits, some of which are 9 feet deep, have also
been dug for the purpose of planting coco-nuts.       These pits and wells
expose the interesting structure of the superficial part of the island.
Beneath a thin surface layer of sand and mould lies a horizontal layer
of stratified shingle rock, in which large imbedded coral masses may
occasionally be distinguished ; this layer is about 2^ feet thick.
Beneath it is a layer of loose coral sand about 18 inches thick, and
beneath that is another layer of coral rock of the same character as
the first, and about 3 feet thick.      Beneath this is another layer of
friable sand lying on the solid reef rock into which the excavations
did not penetrate.    These layers lie perfectly horizontally, and do not
dip in any direction. They crop out above the reef on the steep
eastern and southern shores, and as tho loose sand is washed out by
the waves the overhanging layer of rock breaks off and falls down in
large masses.     The central parts of this area are absolutely beyond the
reach of any waves at the present time, and as the strata of rock and sand
run evenly through it, there is no evidence of its having been formed
by successive additions of material through the action of the waves.
Nor can it possibly have been formed under the surface of the water
unless it has since been raised to its present position, for, as    I have

  1888.]      and  the Coral Formations of   the  Indian Ocean.         445
  said, its tipper surface is 4 feet above the level of high spring tides.
 On one occasion when the tide rose to an abnormal height and invaded
 several parts of the main island,     I saw that the water reached to
 within 3 feet of the top of the shore, but even then the whole of the
 upper stratum of coral rock was well above the waves.        It is scarcely
 credible that an even layer of shingle rock could have been formed
 above the highest high water mark.
    Owing to the dense growth of bushes it was not easy to explore
 the surface of East Islet ; but in one spot where the undergrowth
 was less thick I observed a very shallow, basin-like depression, of
 which the edges were surrounded by a miniature beach of coral debris,
 giving evidence that the sea had formerly occupied this spot, and yet
 it is now 4 feet above high water mark. Near this spot were lying
 great blocks of Mceandrina and Astroea, which could not possibly have
 been thrown by the waves to their present position if the surface on
 which they lie had not formerly occupied a lower level than it does
 now. Similar blocks were noticed by Semper in the atoll of Kriangle
 in the Pelew Islands, but in that case the blocks appear to have been
 of much larger size.
    These facts may not be convincing testimony in favour of a recent
elevation of a few feet, but my belief in such an elevation is further
strengthened by the folio wing facts communicated to me by M. Spurs,
a resident for twenty-five years at Diego, an ardent naturalist, and
much interested in coral formations.
    A small shore crab of the genus Ocypus is always to be found on the
sandy flats between high and low water mark. These crabs, as is
well known, form numerous galleries in the fine muddy sand, which
they line with seaweed, &c, to prevent their falling in. These
galleries open to the surface by short passages placed perpendicularly,
the mouths of which open only a few inches above the level of low
tide. This crab is only found on the shore between tide marks ; on
the dry land its place is taken by Gecarcinus, another genus of crab,
which forms different burrows. In the west part of East Islet there
is an aggregate of friable, scarcely compacted sand, which has some
 what the appearance of half-dried clay.        It lies 5 feet above high
water mark, and was found by M. Spurs, during some excavations
which he had to make for the purpose of constructing a slip for boats,
to be riddled with the seaweed-lined galleries of Ocypus, evidently
long since disused and empty.
    Having made this observation on East Island, M. Spurs made a
search in similar formations on the main island, and found, he tells me,
precisely the same facts in several instances, aggregates of sand lying
at some distance above high water mark, riddled with the abandoned
burrows of Ocypus.        Now since the burrows of Ocypus are quite
characteristic, and could not have been mistaken by so good an

446       Mr. G. C. Bourne.       The Atoll of Diego Garcia     [Mar. 22,
observer    as M. Spurs for those of another species, and since they are
iu the present day only found between tide marks, these observations
afford a further presumption in favour of a slight elevation having
recently taken place. In any case they preclude the idea of any sub
sidence being in progress, as Mr. Darwin fancied to be the case in the
Keeling atoll. M. Spurs further informs me that during the time
that he was superintendent of the oil company's estate, he caused
more than 30,000 pits to be dug on the main island for the purpose of
planting coco-nut palms, and that he frequently observed in different
localities the same alternate layers of sand and rock that         I  have
described as existing on East Island.          These alternations of Rand
and     rock   would suggest alternations     of  very slight subsidence
 with very slight elevation, rather than a single movement of
 upheaval ; yet on the supposition that all the layers were formed
 beneath the water, as their horizontal stratification leads mo to
 believe, I can venture on the following explanation.           The mass
 of rock which forms the base upon which the islets and other dry
 land rest is solid reef rock, and the whole floor of the lagoon is
 similarly formed. The latter is covered at depths of 3 or 4 fathoms
 and upwards by a layer of fine sand, which may attain a thickness
 of 2 or 3 feet. In protected parts of the lagoon and in spots where
 the changeable currents have ceased to deposit any quantity of sand,
 corals   will grow in considerable quantities, chiefly those wide-spread
 ing species of Madrepora which cannot find a lodging on the exterior
 of the reef, where they would be dashed to pieces by the waves.        By
 the continual growth of new colonies on the top of the old ones
 which have died, a layer of solid rock of considerable thickness
 may be formed.       Whilst diving for corals at the lower part of the
 lagoon, I often noticed such layers of half-formed rock on which
 living coral was growing or not, according as the constantly
 changing currents were at that time throwing up sand in the locality
 or not. Thus on the west side of the lagoon, off Point Marianne,
 there are large tracts of recently formed coral rock, on which no
 living corals are to be seen, whilst on the east side of the lagoon,
 exactly opposite to Point Marianne, a similar basis of rock is
 luxuriantly covered with growing coral.
     Now as the currents are constantly changing, and as the changes
  may, as I saw, affect an area some miles in extent, one may suppose
  that an area was first covered with corals growing on the sand, which
  everywhere covers the reef rock, when the latter lies more than a
  fathom below the surface.         A change in the currents brought
  abundant sand to the spot, killed the corals, and deposited an even
  layer of sand of some little thickness over the rock formed by the
  skeletons of the dead corals.    A further change in the currents would
  again   render  the  spot  suitable for coral growth, and a new layer of

1888.]       and the Coral Formations      of the Indian Ocean.        447
rock would be formed over the last layer of sand.        I have seen quite
analogous formations in progress in a fathom of water a little way
above Point Marianne.        Raise the formation to the surface, and you
get  that  stratification which  occurs in so many parts of the island, a
stratification which cannot be explained on any theory of subsidence,
and is scarcely less difficult to explain on the supposition of rest. At
first I had some hesitation in extending to an island on the borders
of the lagoon, as is East Island, a view of the formation of layers of
sand and rock derived from an inspection of the interior of the
lagoon, but afterwards I saw that similar layers were being formed
just within the large reef known as Spurs' Reef, west of Middle
Island, so that no objection can be raised on that score. The whole
character of the Chagos Group is very much opposed to the theory
that atolls and barrier reefs are formed during subsidence.          There
are several atolls rising above the waves, that of Peros Banhos being
55 miles in circuit, and composed of numerous small islets placed
upon a ring-shaped reef through which there are several large and
deep channels.       Egmont or Six Islands is an instance of an atoll in
which the encircling reef is perfect and unbroken by any channels,
the laud consisting of six islets placed for the most part on the
southern and western sides of the reef. There are several submerged
 banks, nearly all of which have an atoll form.         Of these the best
known is the Great Chagos Bank, a huge submerged atoll 95 miles
 long and 05 miles broad, having a depth of 4 — 10 fathoms over a
narrow rim around its periphery, and a central lagoon of a depth
 varying up to 45 fathoms.        South-west of the Great Chagos Bank,
distant less than 15 miles, lies the atoll of Six Islands, and on the
other side of these, scarcely 12 miles distant, lies another submerged
atoll, known as Pitt Bank.        South-west of Pitt Bank are two smaller
banks, Ganges and Centurion's Banks. Darwin considered that the
Great Chagos Bank afforded particularly good evidence of the truth
of the subsidence theory. He regarded it as an atoll carried down by
 a too rapid subsidence below the depth at which reef-building corals
 flourish.   The same would be the case for Pitts Bank and the two
 others just mentioned.       A more intimate knowledge of the Great
 Chagos Bank, and of the relations of it and other submerged banks
 to existing land, shows this view to be untenable.      In the first place
 the rim of the Great Chagos Bank is on an average not more than
 6 fathoms below tho surface, and therefore situated in a depth
eminently favourable for coral growth, and there are actually six islets
on the northern and western edges rising above the water, and some
 of them inhabited. Secondly, any such rapid subsidence could not
 have affected areas only 30 miles apart without involving the Six
 Islands atoll lying directly between them. A similar argument might
 be extended to the more northern islands of the Chagos group, and

448       Mr. G. 0. Bourne.         The  Atoll of Diego Garcia      [Mar. 22,
even to Diego Garcia itself, although it lies somewhat apart from the
rest of the group. Again, if atolls and barrier reefs are formed around
subsiding peaks, it is at least curious that throughout the Laccadive,
Maldive, and Chagos groups there are no instances of high islands
surrounded by barrier reefs, marking the last remnants of pre-existing
land.    In the more western parts of the Indian Ocean, between Mada
gascar and the Seychelles, there are numerous atoll islands, and in
long. 60° E. there lie the submerged Saya de Mai ha Bank and the
reef known as Cargados Carajos. Between these two lies the exten
sive Nazareth Bank, having over it depths of from 14 to 45 fathoms.
The Saya de Malha Bank appears to have the characters of a sub
merged atoll, having a central depression of 65 fathoms, surrounded
by a rim which has only 8 to 16 fathoms on its eastern side, but
22 fathoms on the western.          Some of the groups north of Madagascar
afford very good evidence of upheaval.           Aldabra Island, situated in
lat. 9°  22'  S., long. 46° 14' E., is a perfect instance of an upraised
atoll. Captain Wharton describes the external shores as consisting of
low coral cliffs, about 20 feet high, the surface of the land being
composed of jagged coral rock.          The lagoon is entered by a passage
varying from 11 to 5 fathoms in depth, but its internal portions are
either very shallow or partly dry at low water. Not far distant is
the Cosmo Ledo group, a perfect atoll, with a lagoon some 4 fathoms
deep, or less. There are ten islets of various sizes on the reef, and
all of them appear to have been elevated some 10 feet. There are
some hills 40 and 50 feet high on the two largest islands, but these
appear, according to Captain Wharton, to be formed of blown sand.
The Farquhar group and Assumption Island, situated within the
same area, have been raised, according to the same authority, some
1U feet.     Providence Island, in lat. 9° 14' S., long. 51° 2' E., appears
to be a low island situated upon the edge of the atoll-shaped Provi
dence reef.      At a distance of 19 miles from Providence Island is the
island of St. Pierre, which has no fringing reef. It is particularly
interesting, for although it is in close proximity to the low Providence
atoll, it has been raised about 40 feet above high water, and in the
absence of a fringing reef the sea breaks with great violence against
a low cliffy coast, hollowing out a number of caverns which, from the
description given in the sailing directions for Mauritius and its
islands, appear to open inshore by " blow-holes."*
    Near and among these raised coral formations are several sub
merged banks, the most important of which is McLeod Bank, situated
in lat. 9° 57' S., long. 50° 20' E., between Providence Island and the
Cosmo Ledo group. The details show that there is a group of coral

1888.]         and  the  Coral Formations    of the  Indian Ocean.         449
formations, situated near lat. 10° S., north of Madagascar, in which
are found raised atolls — atolls whose dry land just rises above the
waves and submerged banks.              There can be no clearer proof that
atolls are formed in areas of elevation, and, if the facts which I have
already stated concerning Diego Garcia are of any weight, it would
seem that most of the coral formations of the Indian Ocean mark
areas of elevation rather than of rest ; certainly they are not evidence
of subsidence.
     Those who have felt that the evidence brought against Darwin's
 subsidence theory is too strong to be resisted, must often have felt
 that no satisfactory explanation of the lagoons of atolls or the lagoon
 channels of barrier reefs has been given in its place.        Semper was the
 first to suggest that the lagoon was formed by a solution of the
 interior parts of the reef, and more recently this view has been urged
 with great force by Murray, who points out in addition, that corals
 on the periphery of a reef must, from their position, get the advantage
 over those more interiorly situated, being more directly in the track
 of food-bearing currents. Neither of these explanations has com
 pletely satisfied me. That sea-water exercises a solvent action upon
 carbonate of lime does not admit of doubt, and that the scour of
  tides, combined with this solvent action of the water, does affect the
  extent and depth of a lagoon is obvious.          But I challenge the state
  ment that the destructive agencies within an atoll or a submerged
  bank are in excess of the constructive. It would be nearer the mark
  to say that they nearly balance one another.           In the first place the
  carbonate of lime held in solution by sea- water is deposited as crystal
  line limestone in the interstices of dead corals or coral d'bris. Anyone
  who is acquainted with the structure of coralline rock knows how
  such a porous mass as a Masandrina head becomes perfectly solid by
  the deposition of lime within its mass. This deposition can only be
  effected by the infiltration of sea-water.         In reckoning the solvent
  action of   sea-water,  therefore,  account  must   be taken of the fact that
  a not inconsiderable proportion of the carbonate of lime held in solu
  tion is redeposited in the form of crystalline limestone.           Of this, it
   seems, Mr. Murray has not taken sufficient account, and has, there
   fore, overstated the destructive agency of the sea.           Secondly, the
   growth   of  corals, and  the  consequent  formation    of coral rock within
   the lagoon, is generally overlooked.
      Whilst diving for corals at Diego Garcia          I  had abundant oppor
   tunities of studying the formation of coral rock within the lagoon, in
   depths under 2 fathoms.        The layers of tolerably compact rock thus
   formed are of no mean extent or thickness ; they soon become covered
   with sand, and are thus protected from the solvent action of the
   water.    I  have found it impossible to reconcile Mr. Murray's views
   with what I saw of coral growth within a lagoon.            Not only do the

450      Mr. G. C. Bonnie.       The  Atoll of Diego Garcia       [Mar. 22,
more delicate   branching species of the Madreporaria flourish in con
siderable numbers, but true reef-building species, Pontes, Mceandrina,
Pocillopora, and various stout species of Madrepora, are found there.
It is a mistake to suppose that certain species of corals are restricted
to the external shores, others to the lagoon.       My collections proved
that many of the species growing in      the lagoon at distances of 5 miles
and upwards from its outlet are identical with those growing on the
outer reef. In addition to them are numerous species, such as
Heriatopora stricta, Mussa corymbota, Favia lobata, Fungia dentata,
and many others that are not found on the outside.           The reason in
that the last-named are either free forms such as Fungia, or are
attached by such slender and fragile stems to their supports that they
could not possibly obtain a foothold and maintain themselves among
the powerful currents and waves of the open ocean.
   These various species, numbers of which grow close together, form
knolls and patches within the lagoon, and it cannot be doubted that
their tendency is to fill it up. Again, in reefs which do not rise above
the surface, or are awash for the greater part of their extent at low
tides, great quantities of debris, torn from the outer slopes, are con
stantly carried over the rim of the reef and tend to fill it up.
Hence it follows that in a lagoon entirely surrounded by dry land, or
nearly so, as is the case at Diego Garcia, the tendency to accumulation
of material within the lagoon would be less than in submerged or in
complete atolls, for debris cannot be swept over into the lagoon, and
the only constructive agency is the growth of coral.        If the power of
solution  of sea-water  is  so great, it  must  be supposed that in com
plete or nearly complete atolls the lagoon would be deepening rather
than shallowing; yet at Diego Garcia the lagoon is obviously shallow
ing in many places, and has nowhere increased in depth since Captain
Moresby's survey in 1837. Indeed, the southern part seems to have
shoaled a fathom since that time, and this is the more remarkable,
since the S.E. trade winds are by far the most constant and strongest
winds there, and tend to accumulate material at the northern rather
than at the southern end. The fact is, that these winds sweep the
sand out of the southern part, and thus leave an area particularly
favourably situated for the growth of corals. Mr. Murray points out
that larger atolls generally have deeper lagoons than small atolls, and
urges this fact in support of his theory ; but here again the facts in
the Chagos group are against him. Victory Bank is a submerged
atoll, the Solomons is an atoll with a large extent of dry land, in
each the- lagoon attains a depth of 17 — 18 fathoms, and in Diego
Garcia the lagoon,- although far larger, does not attain a greater
depth.    Peros Banhos is far smaller than the Great Chagos Bank, vet
 in both the lagoons attain nearly the same maximum depth, viz.,
 41 fathoms for Peros Banhos, 44 fathoms for the Great Chagos Bank.

1888.]        and the  Coral Formations of the Indian Ocean.              451
Speaker's Bank is very little larger than Peros Banhos ; its lagoon is
far shallower, having a maximum depth of 24 fathoms.
    These considerations have led me to discredit the solution theory
as an explanation of lagoons and lagoon channels, and other objections
have been lately urged with great force by Captain Wharton. The
conclusion which I reached, after carefully considering the conditions
of submerged banks of atoll form, is that the ring-shape of the outer
reef is to be explained by the peculiarly favourable conditions for
coral growth found on the external Blopes. Although corals may and
do nourish in lagoons, they are only found in knolls and patches, and
are always liable to be smothered when, by a change in the tidal
currents, sand is thrown down upon the place where they are grow
ing. On the external slopes, however, corals grow in extraordinary
abundance, and chiefly those massive forms whose skeletons take so
conspicuous a share in the formation of coral rock. If once it is
admitted that the periphery of the reef offers peculiarly favourable
conditions to the growth of reef-forming corals, it follows that, as
the reef rises to the surface its external parts will outstrip the more
internal, and will reach the surface first, forming a rim around a
central depression or lagoon.      This elevated rim will be as marked a
feature in submerged as in complete atolls. Not long after I had
arrived at this conclusion, and whilst the earlier part of this paper
 was writing, Captain Wharton published a letter on coral formations
 in ' Nature,' in which he arrives at identical conclusions. His know
 ledge of coral islands is so extensive that his views have great
 authority, and    I  am extremely pleased to find that his opinions on
 this subject are the same as those which       I  have formed.     The only
 point in which I differ with him concerns the explanation of the
 favourable conditions on the external slopes.
     Following Agissiz. Murray, Guppy, and others, Captain Wharton
 supposes that the favourable conditions consist in the increased food
 supply brought by the superficial currents of the ocean. This I
 cannot believe to be a complete explanation. The quantity of food
 present must of course determine the existence of coral polypes in
  any particular locality, as it does that of all other animals, but it
 cannot be considered to be the chief favouring cause of coral growth
  on the external shores of an atoll for several reasons.      If the prime
  cause of luxuriant coral growth is an abundant food supply, and if, as
  we may assume for the present, the food consists in the minute pelagic
  animals borne in ocean currents, there must always be a definite rela
  tion between ocean currents and coral formations.           Some authors
  (A^assiz   and  Murray)   have gone  bo far as  to say that coral  reefs are
  only formed in the track of great ocean currents. This is hardly the
  case.   In the Pacific a study of the chart shows that atolls and barrier
  reefs are formed irrespective of currents, and some large groups, such

452      Mr. G. C. Bourne.       The Atoll of Diego Garcia      [Mar. 22,
as the  Paumotu Islands, seem to lie altogether to one side of the pre
vailing currents. The islands north of Madagascar (Cosmo Ledo,
Farquhar groups, &c.) do not lie in the track of the Mozambique
current, but to one side of it, and the Chagos group does not lie in
any constant current, but is at one season of the year washed by the
currents caused by the S.E. trades, at another by the irregnlar cur
rents caused by the N.W. monsoons.        During the latter season there
are often long periods of absolute calm during which the currents
are merely tidal.    The S.E. trades, however, are the dominant winds
both in force and frequency, and if the coral growth were dependent
chiefly on the supply of food brought by surface currents, those corals
growing on the windward side would naturally have the advantage in
the food supply.      Situated in the direct tract of the current, they
would receive an abundant supply of living organisms, and then the
impoverished current, sweeping past the sides of the reef, would
become poorer and poorer in organic life as it flowed towards the
leeward side, till finally on the further shore, the backwash would
hardly bring any sufficient supply of food for coral growth.       A reef,
therefore, would tend to extend in the direction of the current, and
the longer diameters of the atolls might be expected in the Chagos
groups to lie S.E. and N.W. This is not the case.       Diego Garcia and
Speaker's Bank lie north and south; Peros Banhos is nearly square;
the Solomons lie N.E. and N.W. ; the Great Chagos Bank lies east
and west.    Pitt's Bank does lie S.E. and N.W., but the rim on the
northern aud north-western side is nearer to the surface by some
•, fathoms than it is on the southern  and south-eastern side, indicating
a more vigorous coral growth on the side turned away from the pre
vailing current. In the case of a submerged bank it is difficult to
see why the corals situated to leeward should be better off as regards
food supply than those living in the interior of the lagoon, for the
superficial parts of the current would flow freely over the windward
rim and bring abundant food into the lagoon.           But in the Great
Chagos Bank the northern rim is, on the average, higher than the
south-eastern, and all the islets are placed on the northern and western
parts of the rim. A stndy of the corals growing within the lagoon
of Diego Garcia is in this case of considerable interest.         If their
existence depended upon pelagic life brought to them by currents, it
would be expected that the most numerous coral patches would be
found at the northern end of the lagoon in the track of the tidal
currents. There is a considerable area of active coral growth to the
south and west of Middle Islet, but beyond this there is no relation
whatever between the luxuriance of the coral patches and the month
of the lagoon.     Corals grow most vigorously along the shore between
Minni Minny and East Point, and most vigorously of all at the
southern end of the lagoon, where they are most remote from the

 1888.]       and the Coral Formations       of  the  Indian Ocean.          453
 influence of currents setting in from the ocean. Yet, as                I  have
 already  shown,   it  is to the growth  of  coral  alone  that the  shoaling of
 this part of the lagoon can be attributed. These facts are a sufficient
Argument against the idea that currents teeming with pelagic life are
the prime factors in determining coral growth. It must be remem
 bered that we are very ignorant about the food of corals.            There are
 very few accounts of the food found in their digestive cavities, and it is
 purely an assumption to speak of their feeding only on pelagic organ
 isms.   I  have in another place reported the presence of vegetable
 matter in the curiously modified digestive stomodaeum of Ettphyllin,
 and   I have no doubt, after what Dr. Hickson has told me of the
 relations of corals to mangrove swamps in Celebes, that far more
 corals are vegetable feeders than has hitherto been supposed.              The
 lagoon of an atoll is always full of decaying vegetable matter derived
 from the shore bushes and palms, and it seems likely that there is a
 connexion between the richer coral growth along the shores of a lagoon
 und the supply of vegetable debris from the shore.
    My observations incline me to the belief that the most important
 circumstances affecting coral growth are the direction and velocity of
 currents. My observations are confirmed in every particular by those
 made by Dr. Hickson in Celebes, and communicated by him to the
 British Association in 1887.          Corals grow best in places where a
 moderate current flows constantly over them.               They are killed in
 still water by the deposition of sediment, and they will not grow in
 places where a strong current sets directly against them.             I noticed
at Diego Garcia in many places, but particularly at the east end of
 East Islet, that a strongand direct ocean current is most unfavourable
to coral growth, and that the reef is barren and suffering rapid
erosion at such exposed spots as allow the whole force of the current
to fall directly upon them.         As the current parts and flows round
the obstacle, one meets with a reef covered with debris, but barren of
live coral ; further on, as the current moderates in force, one finds a
few growing heads of coral ; and, finally, at the further end of the
reef, where the current has abated its force considerably, there is a
luxuriant bed of living corals and Alcyonaria.             This can be seen in
perfection on   the   southern   reef of East  Islet.     Dr. Hickson tells me
that he has observed the same facts at Celebes, that direct and strong
currents are unfavourable to coral growth, that moderate tangential
currents are extremely favourable, and sluggish or still water again
unfavourable.     This view, which both of us can support by many
observations, is much at variance with the old accepted saying that
corals grow best where the breakers are the heaviest.            It appeared to
me that heavy breakers are not favourable to coral growth, because
of the quantity of shingle which they dash against the soft-bodied
polyps. Some massive forms might withstand the force of breakers

and violent currents   if  the polyps could be sufficiently protected from
the shingle, but the branching Madrepores are soon broken off and
swept away, and even the more massive Maeandrina soon follows, for
whilst the surface of the colony grows the base is dead, is soon
riddled by boring sponges, Serpulae, &c., and is no longer able to bear
the strain put upon it.      The great mass then breaks off and is rolled
along   the  reef, pounding other corals in its course.         I was long
puzzled at Diego Garcia when I found that the onter reef was nearly
barren of coral, even where it is covered by a foot or two of water at
the lowest spring tides.       I noticed directly after my arrival that the
sea always broke on the reef west of Middle Islet (Spurs' Reef), and
believing, from what I had read, that this must be a most favourable
spot for coral growth,   I  took the first opportunity of visiting it at low
tide. To my surprise I waded for nearly a mile, nearly waist deep,
without finding a single living coral on the seaward flat, although
the lagoon just within the reef was filled with knolls of living coral*
growing at various depths.        All around the shores I found the same
thing, flat reefs of barren coral rock, slnping very gently down to the
ocean, on whose surfaces, even where they were constantly covered
 with water, no live corals were to be found. Just at the edges of the
reef, where the sea breaks at low spring tides, I could detect during
the reflux of the waves, solid masses of Millepora, and dead rock
covered with Millepores, bnt no live Madrepores, excepting where
narrow channels ran up into the reef, the sides of which generally
bore a few colonies of Mmandrina, Porites, or Madrepora aspera.           On
the other hand, it can readily be seen that the external slopes, just
beyond the rim of the reef behind the breakers, are covered with
masses of coral.      A short experience of wading across the reefs
showed me the reason of the want of coral on the flat upper surfaces.
Debris, torn from the corals growing on the slopes, is continually
washed across the flat reef surfaces, and in strong breezes large
masses are rolled along.         Even in the calmest weather the coarse
fragments can be felt sweeping past one's legs with some force, and one
can readily understand that the soft polypes could not withstand the
constant wear and tear.       The moderate currents, on the other hand, do
not carry large fragments, but prevent deposition of sand which would
choke the corals, and at the same time supply the conditions of nutri
 tion necessary to their growth. In still water, sand is thrown down in
 large quantities, and this and the absence of a constant supply of
 food prevents coral growth.        The conclusions to which I came were
 that the external slopes afforded conditions eminently favourable to
 coral growth, that the upper surfaces of the shore reefs were very
 unfavourable, and that in certain parts of the lagoon favourable con
 ditions again occur, though the growth is never so luxuriant there as
 ou the external slopes.     The favourable conditions on the last-named

1888.]       and the Coral Formations          of   the      Indian Ocean.           455
places are explained by the behaviour of a current when it meets with
an obstacle which presents a sloping wall to it. The lowest parts of
a strong and deep current are the first to strike the sloping wall or
glacis ; they are in part divided and sweep around the sides of the
obstacle, but a large part of the current is deflected upwards over the
slope, and its action, combined with that of the more superficial parts
of the same current, results in a moderate current flowing upwards
over the slope (wide- Plate 4, fig. 2). This moderate current favours
coral growth on the slope, but at its upper edge the superficial current
combines with the upward stream, and the two dash onwards with
increased force over the flat upper surface, destroying all coral life
there. At the sides of an island the current flows tangentially, with
moderated force, especially in its more superficial portions, and affords
the necessary conditions on the external slopes there, whilst on the
reverse side of the islaud the backwash affords weak currents, which
are highly favourable to coral growth.     Thus it is that everywhere
around the island the external slopes are covered with a luxuriant bed
of corals.
   To fully understand the manner in which currents are moderated
in flowing past an obstacle, it is necessary to remember that water
possesses a certain amount of adhesiveness, and tends to cling to
the sides of the obstacle, so that the current is always rather stronger
at a little distance from the obstacle, whatever it may be, than it is
where it runs close against         it,
                               and the rougher the surface past which
it   flows the greater   is   the adhesion,well known to everyone who
                                              as   is
has had experience in boating or shipbuilding.
   The net result of all this  that the corals are always thickest along
                                   is
the slopes around a coral reef, and the reef tends to increase at its
periphery, growing upwards there, whilst      tends at the same time to
                                                        it
spread outwards. These principles hold good in the case of a sub
merged bank as well as in the case of     reef that

merged bank must tend in the course of time to reach the surface in
its circumferential portions, and form an atoll-shaped reef, on the rim
of which detritus may be heaped from place to place, forming shingle
cays or islets which may temporarily form dry land.      In atolls where
storms are of frequent occurrence, regular storm- beaches may be
formed, till the fragments piled high upon one another may form low
islets standing some       or 10 feet above high water mark, upon

which vegetation may subsequently find a footing.       Atolls are often
formed in this way, without any elevation taking place, and such has
undoubtedly been the case in the Florida reefs, where atolls (the Tor-
tugas) and barrier reefs and islands have been formed in an area of
complete rest.    No one who has read the admirable work of Alex.

wind and waves alone, without any assistance from the upheaval of
the bed of the sea. But       I am not satisfied that this has been the
case in the Chagos group.       Storms are of very infrequent occurrence
there, and the horizontal masses of reef rock standing above high
water mark cannot be attributed to the normal action of the prevailing
winds and currents.
    In the Florida reefs the nature of the soil betrays its origin —
its strata slope towards the sea on every side, and the lamination of •
the rocks attests the long-co-tinued action of waves and spray.      Bat
the alternate horizontal layers of sand and rock occurring so abun
dantly at Diego Garcia are quite different ; they do not dip seawards,
their composition differs from the rocks of the Florida reefs, and their
edges, instead of showing signs of accumulation of fresh material,
are often bluff, and show that the sea is gradually eating them away.
It is difficult to explain these appearances except on the hypothesis of
slight elevation. It might be objected that if any upheaval had taken
place, the banks lying at various depths below the surface would
have been raised to different heights, and that it would he in
the highest degree unlikely that so many would be raised some
4 or 5 feet above high water mark and no more throughout so large
areas as the Laccadive, Maldive, and Chagos Islands, and the various
low groups in the Pacific. Tho force of the objection must be
admitted, but it may be observed that atolls raised from 10 to 40 feet
above the waves are not so uncommon as has been hitherto sup
posed, and that the numerous submerged banks lying at very various
depths show that all the reefs have not been raised to one height
in a single area of elevation.     The uniform level of many atolls and
barrier reefs admits of a further explanation.       A reef raised some
few feet above the sea level is at once attacked by the waves, and as
the rim is very narrow, it must soon be worn away till the whole of
the land is eaten away, and its surface is brought awash once more.
Thus every slight movement of elevation would soon be compensated
by the denuding action of the waves. The island of St. Pierre, already
described, is a good instance of this process of erosion.       It cannot
be doubted that this island, which has recently been raised 40 feet, is
undergoing rapid waste, and must soon be reduced to the level of the
sea.   At Diego Garcia I was astonished at the rapid destruction of
dry land which is in progress, on the outside as well as the inside
of the lagoon.      The destruction is not so great on the outside as on
the inside as a rule, for in the former case the rampart of coral
boulders thrown up by the waves compensates in many places for
their erosive action. But in the bay above Horsburgh Point, exposed
to the full strength of the S.E. trades, the destruction is very great.
M. Spurs, an old resident on the island, writes to me on this subject :
"
  Cette destruction est tres rapide ; Diego perd en moyenne un pied

largenr premiere."
   M. Spnrs has overestimated the rate of destruction, but there can
be no doubt that it is very considerable.            It is most conspicuous along
the shores bordering the lagoon.           The stumps of coco-nut palms, tho
newly-made breaches into the land, forming shallow inland lagoons,
the vertical faces of old banks of half consolidated sand all attest it.
Just above Point Marianne is a road running along the lagoonward
shore, which wlien I left the island had been narrowed by the action
of the sea to a mere path, and was in some places almost impass
able, as the sea had made clean breaches across                  it,

into some shallow fresh water lagoons lying on the other side of the
road.  I   was assured that this road had been over 12 feet wide some
years previously, and that         itwas formerly separated from the lagoon
by a narrow strip of land of an equal width.                     Perhaps the best

lagoons connected with the main lagoon                 by   a narrow outlet some
2  fathoms deep or more. They are filled and emptied every tide,
and their floor      intersected by numerous small channels running in
                      is

north-westerly wind of unusual violence, the water rises to great
heights and invades the land in several places.                 In some instances
it  actually  makes    a  breach   in  the   lagoonward      shore, and fills up tho
shallow depressions which are often found in the middle of the strip
of land. A pool of salt water            isthus formed, which killn the coco
palms and other vegetation growing in its bed, and as this process

repeated again and again, in the course of a few years a channel
cut out between the pool and the lagoon, which finally becomes so
deep that spring tides, and finally even neap tides, run in and out of
the pool regularly.       As soon as these conditions are established tho
channel    is scoured out aud deepened, and the daily tides scour out
the bed of the pool, forming a complete barachois.

 vious day, clearing away an amount of soil which was almost incre
 dible. My companion M. Casimir Leconte told me that the sea had
 not been known to wash over this place before.                                 It was apparent
 that after a few more of such high tides as I had witnessed, a perma
 nent breach would be made at this spot, and another lagoon outlet
 would be formed, which would be continually deepened as the tide
 set through it.          At the south-eastern side of the island I noticed that
 the land was being rapidly destroyed on the outer shores just opposite
to a half-formed barachois, whose margins are situated not 60 yards
from the outer shore.                 If the same process of external destruction
continues, whilst the barachois is deepened and scooped out from
within, it will not be many years before the ocean makes a new channel
into the lagoon at this point. Thus the continuous strip of land which
now nearly encircles the lagoon of Diego Garcia is tending to be
split up again into a series of islets. At the points where the breaches
are made the tides and ocean currents will rush with great force into
the lagoon and will scour out deep channels similar to that now exist
ing between Middle and East Islets.
   These facts taken together show how the normal action of tides,
winds, and waves is constantly tending to lower to the sea level any
dry land that may have been formed by elevation or otherwise. It
does not seem to me to be surprising that the majority of atolls and
barrier reefs are, under such circumstances, only just able to maintain
their surfaces above the sea level.
   No explanation of atoll formation would be complete if it did not
include an explanation of the great Maldive atolls.                                          Without
attempting to enter into a lengthy discussion of Darwin's views,
I will give my own explanation of the atoll. Tilla-don-Matte atoll
is, as is well known, a huge atoll composed of atolls.                                    The islets
forming the rim of the main atoll are themselves atolls                                   with   their
own lagoons ; the main lagoon contains a few secondary atolls
corresponding to the coral patches in an ordinary atoll. It will
be generally admitted that coral reefs are constantly increasing to
seaward because of the excessive growth of coral on their external
slopes.*       As the inward shores of an atoll are constantly being re
moved, and an atoll           if completely formed              tends to be broken up again
into small islets when it has reached a                       certain    size, and as the chan
nels between the islets must be continually deepened by the scour of
the tides until deep passages are formed, an atoll like Diego Garcia
   * This statement may         at first sight seem at variance with what            I  have just said
about   the  rapid  destruction    of   land   on the  outer   and  inner   shores   of  an atoll ; but
in the   latter  case  it is  land   above   water   that  is destroyed.     Coincidently    with this
process    the  reef-rock  below    water   is  constantly   tending  to  raise  itself  and to -pread
in all directions,   owing   to  the   perpetual growth       of  corals  and   the   accumulation   of
their skeletons.

may be expected to reach in time a condition like that of Peros
Banhos.       It is probable that a large bank like the Great Chagos
Bank, when it reaches the surface, can never give rise to a continuous
strip of land, but must consist of a chain of islets separated by chan
nels of some depth and by tracts of submerged reef. The islets and
tracts of reef in either case would be bonnded by deeper channels,
and these channels, swept by strong currents, would become wider
and deeper, for corals could not thrive in them.             After a time the
islets would become so far isolated, and the entries into the lagoon
would become so large and numerous, that oceanic conditions would
prevail in the lagoon, and then there would be around each separate
islet or piece of reef all the necessary conditions for the formation of
a new atoll. The currents would strike upon one side of the islet
or reef, sweep round          it,
                             and give    a backwash at the further side the
                                                                       ;
corals would      flourish  in   the  circumferential   parts of the reef sur
rounding the islet, and new atolls with shallow lagoons would be
formed.
    In Tilla-dou-Matte the lagoons of the secondary atolls are tolerably
deep. In this case they must have been formed before any land
 reached the surface.      Applying the same reasoning as in the former
 case, it can readily be understood how in the case of the Great Chagos
 Bank, which has wide and deep breaches in many places, the isolated
 reefs as they grow to the surface must tend to assume an atoll form.
 An examination of the chart shows that this the case. The Great
                                                       is
 Chagos Bank in the course of time will rise to the surface as an atoll
 composed of secondary atolls or atollons, similar to, but on a smaller
 scale than, Tilla-dou-Matte atoll.           The explanation of atollons in
 the centre of a large lagoon in which oceanic conditions have been
 established,  is quite obvious.
    In conclusion, may sum up by saying that the strength and direc
                    I
 tion of currents appears to me to be the main influence on coral growth     ;
 that the behaviour of currents on meeting an obstacle with sloping
 shores, explains the superabundant growth of corals on the outer
 slopes of a reef, whether submerged or awash           ;  that the growth of
 corals on  the  periphery   of  a bank   being in great excess of the growth
 in its interior portions        sufficient to explain the formations known
                                    is

                I    have shown that Mr. Murray has overestimated          the
 effects of solution in neglecting the compensating action of the re-pre
 cipitation of the carbonate of lime held in solution, and the formation
 of coral rock within the lagoon through the agency of coral growth
 there.  I   have also shown that the role played by currents         is   not
 what    is supposed     that
                          ;     the   carriage  of food  by currents must be
 considered of subsidiary importance in estimating their effect, though

  I  would be the last to deny that organic material brought by currents
   must determine the existence of coral polyps in every instance.           I
   have confined myself to a discussion of the islands of the Indian
   Ocean, because    I  have no practical knowledge of coral formationi in
  other parts of the world, and it would be rash to dogmatise about
   their structure when the conditions may be different.        In the Indian
   Ocean I may fairly assume that the coral groups are subjected to the
  same influences that     I studied at Diego Garcia. No doubt many of
  my statements will be contradicted by observers in the Pacific Islands
  and elsewhere.      I can only say that they are true of the group which
  I have visited, and that within the limits of that group they form
  contradictions to existing theories.     The seas in which coral reefs are
  formed are not all subject to the same conditions. In the Chagtis
  group there is always a heavy swell on the ocean, and the sea breaki
  with a great force against the outer shores, and even over the shallower
  parts of submerged banks ; the breakers are said to reach a height of
  15 to 18 feet, but    I never saw them so large at Diego Garcia.         In
  other groups of coral formations the sea is wonderfully calm, and the
  sea rarely breaks on the outer shores with any violence.              Some
  islands are situated in the direct course of great ocean currents, otheri
 are not, and are swept by the minor currents caused by prevailing
 winds. However one looks at the subject one must realise that the laws
 governing the formation of coral reefs are exceedingly complex, and
 that many circumstances have to be taken into account before any
 perfect explanation of their structure can be obtained. Action and
  reaction, destruction and reconstruction, growth and decay are con
 stantly at work ; the result of the multitude of nicely balanced forcei,
 seemingly antagonistic, is the atoll or reef. It seems to me that the
 current theories of the formation of coral reefs attempt to explain
 everything by one or two agencies, whereas the agencies are numerous,
 and interact in a most complicated manner. Mr. Murray is undoubtedly
 right in laying stress on the necessities of nutrition suitable for coral
 growth, and the solveut action of sea water, but he has not taken
 count of other agencies which tend to modify and obscure these, and
 therefore his theory is not in itself sufficient to explain the question.
 I cannot expect that my views will be of universal application, since
 my observations were made on so limited a field, but I hope that com
petent observers will spend some months on coral formations in
different parts of the world and give the closest attention to their
facies, without overlooking the minutest particular bearing ou coral
growth on the formation of the reef. Then only shall we bo in a
position to construct a general theory of coral reefs.

  These planula? are necessarily swept away by strong currents to the
  further shores of a reef, and it has been shown experimentally by
  von Koch that they will not attach themselves in a strong current, or
  if attached, will loose their hold when a strong current is directed
  upon them.          Although coral colonies grow larger by budding, they
  originate in every case from planulee, and no great group of corals
  could grow in a place whero the strong currents prevented planulaa
  from attaching themselves. —March 20].

  III. "The         Chemical Composition of Pearls."                      By GEORGE
         Harley, M.D., F.R.S., aud Harald S.                     Harley.      Received
        February 26, 1888.
     Although there are many qualitative analyses of pearls, from our
 being unable, in their voluminous literature, to find any evidence
 of a quantitative analysis of their ingredients having been recorded,
 we undertook the examination of several varieties, of which the fol
 lowing is an account : —
     1st. As regards oyster pearls.               Of these three varieties were
examined, British, Australian, and Ceylonese.
    The qualitative analyses showed that they all had an identical com
position, and that they consisted solely of water, organic matter, and
calcium carbonate.           There was a total absence of magnesia and of all
the other mineral ingredients of sea- water — from which the inorganic
part of pearls must of course be obtained.                      Seeing that ordinary
sea-water contains close upon ten and                    a half times more calcium
sulphate than calcium carbonate, one might have expected that at
least some sulphates would have been found along with the car
bonates, more especially if they are the mere fortuitous concretions
some persons imagine them to be — a view we cannot endorse, from the
fact that by steeping pearls in a weak aqueous solution of nitric acid,
we are able to completely remove from them all their mineral con
stituents without in any way altering their shape, and but very
slightly changing their naked eye appearances, so long as they are

permitted to remain in the solution. When taken out they rapidly dry
and shrivel up. We shall take occasion to point out in our next
communication, which will be on the microscopic structure of pearls,
that a decalcified crystalline pearl bears an intimate resemblance to a
decalcified bone, in so far as it possesses a perfectly organised matrix
of animal matter. No phosphates whatever were found in any of the
three before-named varieties of pearls.*
   The next point being to ascertain the exact proportions of the sub
stances composing the pearls, and pure white pearls being expensive,
from our having ascertained that all the three kinds we were operat
ing upon had exactly the same chemical composition, instead of making
separate quantitative analyses of them, we simply selected two pearls
from each variety, of as nearly the same size and weight — giving a
total of 16 grains — and analysed them collectively, the result obtained
being —
              Carbonate of limef                       91"72 per cent.

                                                       100-00
   From   this it is seen that notwithstanding that mother-of-pearl
consists of precisely the same ingredients, their proportions are quite
different from what they are in fine, pure white pearls (we say fine
pure white, because pearls vary greatly in purity, and those we
analysed were good ones), which are infinitely denser, and con
sequently harder than the mother-of-pearl constituting the shells iu
which they are formed.      The analysis of mother-of-pearl given in
Watts' Dictionary of Chemistry is —
        '                         '
              Carbonate of lime                        66-00 per cent.

              Organic matter                             2-50    „
thus showing that while mother-of-pearl contains less than half
the quantity of organic matter pearls do, it at the same time possesses
close upon fourteen times more water.      This fact appears to ns all
the more surprising as, not alone to the naked eye, but even under the

   t The carbonic acid was e-timated by disengaging it with dilute sulphuric acid

  microscope,   the structure of the mother-of-pearl of the shell and
  of pearls is almost identical.
     [One can scarcely imagine that the analyst could have possibly
 employed in his investigation a piece of shell while it was yet in a
 fresh and consequently moist state.
    As regards the hardness of pearls, again, it may perhaps be as well
 for us to remark that good pearls have a much denser texture than
 the majority of persons appear to suppose, as may be gleaned from
 the following facts.
    On one occasion being desirous to crush into powder a split-pea
 sized pearl, we folded it between two plies of note-paper, turned up
 the corner of the carpet, and placing it on the hard bare floor, stood
 upon it with all our weight. Yet notwithstanding that we weigh over
 12 stone, we failed to make any impression whatever upon the pearl,
 and even stamping upon it with the heel of our boot did not suffice so
much as to fracture it.      It was accordingly given to the servant to
bieak with a hammer, and on his return he informed us that on
attempting to break it with the hammer against the pantry table, all
he succeeded in doing was to make the pearl pierce through the paper
and sink into the wooden table, just as if it had been the top part of
an iron nail, and that it was not until he had given it a hard blow
with the hammer against the bottom of a flat-iron that he succeeded
in breaking it.
    In addition to the foregoing we may likewise take occasion to
mention that shell-fish pearls are not nearly so easily dissolved in
strong vinegar as the interesting tale of Cleopatra having taken a
large pearl from her . ear, and, after having dissolved it in vinegar,
drunk it to the health of her lover Antony, would lead one to believe.
For during our experiments we have learned that not only does it
take many days to dissolve out the mineral constituents of a large
pearl in cold vinegar, but that it even requires several hours to extract
the mineral matter, by boiling vinegar, from a pearl not bigger than a
garden pea.      While in neither case, moreover, can the pearl be thus
made to disappear, as from the fact of the organic matrix of a pearl
being totally insoluble in vinegar, even after every particle of its
earthy substance has been removed, it still remains of the same shape,
bulk, acd almost identical appearance as before.       Hence we fear that
if the Cleopatra legend is to be believed at all, it requires considerable
modifications ere it can be brought into harmony with scientific truth.
There is, indeed, only one way in which a large pearl, such as the one
Cleopatra is said to have employed, could be dissolved in vinegar at
a supper-table, and that is by having it completely pulverized by a
hard hammer and a strong arm before applying the vinegar to it.
For once the mineral constituents of a pearl have been reduced to the
state of an impalpable powder, they not only readily dissolve, but

same time as the mineral constituents been minutely subdivided, its
presence would scarcely be recognisable in the solution.]*
   2nd. Composition of cocoa-nut pearls.
   Qualitative analyses of pearls found in cocoa-nuts bave been
published by both Dr. J. Bacon and Dr. Kimminis.f             But their
analyses differ somewhat, for while Bacon found carbonate of lime and
an organic substance akin to albumen, Kimminis met with nothing
whatever in them except pure carbonate of lime.         We subjected a
portion of a garden pea sized cocoa-nut pearl, weighing 14 grains
(kindly given to us by Messrs. Streeter) to analysis, and found that,
like shell-fish pearls it consisted of carbonate of lime, organic matter
(animal), and water.
   The pearl which we examined was sent to Messrs. Streeter by their
agent at Singapore (the same place from whence Bacon obtained his
specimen), and as we stated last year (on June the 8th), when we
exhibited at the soiree of the Royal Society both drawings and micro
scopic sections of              it,
                         we are exceedingly sceptical of the pearl we
examined being in reality the product of a cocoa-nut, for the following
reasons.    It had all the external appearances of the pearli found in
the large clams (Tridacna gigas) of the Southern Ocean, being
perfectly globular, with a smooth, glistening, dull white surface, and
resembling them exactly in microscopic structure. Besides which in
chemical           composition       similarity to cocoa-nut milk, to
                                         it   bore    no
which        supposed to be related.
             it   is                    For cocoa-nut milk     said to                      is

lime. That there are pearls found in cocoa-nuts we do not presume
to deny   all we mean to say
             ;                   that we are doubtful
                                                 is      the specimen             if

 ox was the late Professor Pannum, of Copenhagen, who in 1874 pre

    In so far  as naked eye appearances are concerned, a good specimen
 of the variety of pearl now spoken of is quite undistinguishable from
 a fine specimen of oriental oyster pearl, from its not only bein^ globu
lar in shape, and of a pure white colour, but from its also possessing
 the iridescent sheen so characteristic of oriental oyster pearls of fine
 quality.
    In chemical composition, however, mammalian pearls bear no
similarity whatever to pearls found in shell-fish, for they are com
posed of an organic instead of an inorganic material, namely cholesterin.
la minute structure again, they bear a marked resemblance to the
crystalline variety of shell-fish pearls.

    A  few years ago I noticed a remarkable fact in the development of
the Green Turtle (Chflone viridis), namely, that whilst thirteen
myotomes are developed in the cervical region, the intercalary ver
tebral segments found afterwards are only eight*

  probable that the Amphibian stock from which birds arose — becoming
  Reptiles in their ascent, but spurning that intermediate stag* — were
  long, eel-like forms, not dissimilar to Amphiuma and Menubrnnchu*
  among the existing Urodeles.             I will therefore state what evidence
  there is of evolutional abbreviation in the development of the species
  in existing Birds.

     Working with Foster and Balfour's ' Elements of Embryology
  beside me, I was struck with one part of their description, and with
  my own preparations showing the phenomenon.                    At page 157 we read
  as follows :   —
     " The notochord
                             [in the Chick] is on the sixth day at the maxi
  mum of its development, the changes which it henceforward under
  goes being of a retrograde character.
     " From the seventh day onward it is at various
                                                                    points encroache.l
  upon by its investment.           Constrictions are thus produced, which first
  make their appearance in the intervertebral portions of the sacral
  region.     In the cervical region, according to Gegeubaur, the inter
  vertebral portions are not constricted till the ninth day, though ns
  early as the seventh day constrictions are visible in the vertebral
  portions of the lower cervical vertebrae.                 By the ninth and tenth
  days, however, all the intervertebral portions have become distinctly
  constricted, and at the same time in such vertebral portions there have
  also appeared two constrictions, giving rise to a central and to two
  terminal enlargements.           In the space therefore corresponding to each
  vertebra and its appropriate intervertebral portion, there are in all
  four constrictions and their enlargements."
     I had long ago noticed, figured, and described a similar monili-
  form condition in the cephalic portion of the notochord in the Chick,*
• and this observation set me speculating upon the dying out of the
  axial segmentation in the region of the skull.
     Now this peculiar secondary and temporary segmentation of the noto
  chord is not equal throughout the whole chain of rndimentary ver
  tebrae ;  I  can only find two beads in the sacral region, and none in the
  caudal.
     Nevertheless,     taking these headings as a true historical record of
  development,      and    allowing for them in such a bird as the Common
  Swan (Cygnus olor), we get, hypothetically, a very long ancestral
  form. In that bird there are thirty presacral, twenty -one sacntl, and
  thirteen caudal vertebrae that are developed as distinct vertebral
  segments of the axis. Then, if we treble the presacrals and double
  the sacrals, we add eighty-one to the actual sixty-four of the modern
  bird, and thus obtain more than twelve dozen — 145 — vertebrae with
  which to accredit the ancestral form.

                On the Number of Vertebrce in Existing Birds.
   The    Swan, one of the noblest of the Precncial birds, comes the
nearest of any of the Carinatro to the huge, almost wingless Struthious
types in the large number of its vertebrae ; indeed in the cervical
region it has more vertebrae than any bird                  I   have yet examined,
namely, twenty-Jive,       and    its general sacral   region is as long as in the
large Ratitae, so that this bird, although so exquisitely specialised as a
flying, swimming, sailing, and walking bird, has not departed very
far from the Struthious birds in respect of the length of the spine.
More than this, in my recent researches into the development of this
and cognate birds, I find that the Swan has been built upon the
Struthious foundation — so to speak. In the parts that suspend them
selves from the twenty-one sacral vertebrae, the hip-girdle moieties,
it is most clearly seen that the difference in these parts between this
bird and the African Ostrich (Struthio camelus) is altogether one of
gentle transformation by a late growth of cartilage. Arrest the pelvis
of the embryo Swan, when only two-thirds ripe, and in the ossification
afterwards unite the pubes by ankylosis, and then the two pelves
would correspond, point by point. So that this part of the skeleton
passes in the most orderly manner, first through a general Reptilian,
then through an Ornithoscelidan, and then through a Struthious stage,
before it takes on the characteristic form of the Swan, the pelvis of
 which is one of the largest and most remarkable in the class, and
 quite typical, nevertheless, as the pelvis of a Carinate bird.
    Returning to the Vertebral Chain,               I   may now show how, for
adaptive purposes, that series             of axial   segments gets shorter and
 shorter as we ascend towards the smallest and highest of the
 " Altrices," the highest kind of birds, with tender young, and, as a
rule, arboreal nidification.
    Even within the limits of the Anatidae, the family to which the
 Swan belongs, the cervical and sacral series get reduced to about
 three-fourths the number found in the Common Swan. Indeed, in the
 genus Cygnus, itself, I find a variation, for in C. nigricollis there are
 only twenty-four cervical vertebrae.
    But among the larger Precocial birds the number varies extremely,
 and in passing from species to species, in the Cranes (Gruidse), I find no
 two alike in this respect.           Once, however, amongst the noblest and
 most intelligent of all the birds, the Passerines, and we come upon a
 uniformity that is as remarkable as the variety seen in the wading,
 and land, and water birds.
    The Crows stand at the top of the Passerines, and being the largest
 kind, they have the longest vertebral chain.
    In the old* Rook or Carrion Crow (Oorvus frugilegus and 0. corone),
   * The fledgling is more generalised, and has twelve    vertebra) united by the diapo-
 physes in the sacral series.

  the vertebral series is twenty in the presacral region, or only two-
  thirds as many as in the Common Swan, eleven in the sacral region,
  or half as many as are enclosed by the ilia in the Swan, whose first
  caudal corresponds with the last sacral of many birds.
     Instead of sixty-four, I can only find forty-two vertebra? deve-
• loped in a Crow, twenty pre-sacrals, eleven sacrals, and eleven
  caudals.    .
     Now taking a familiar bird, the Common Chat (Pratincola rubelra),
  I find   that it has only nineteen presacrals, eleven sacrals, and origi
  nally eleven caudals, but only seven distinct in the adult. Now we get
  in the cervical region in this little bird, fourteen vertebrae, one less
  than in the Crow, little more than half as many as in the Swan, and
  just twice as many as in the normal Mammal.
     I take up the next that comes, the Tellow Wagtail (Budytes rayi),
  and it has the same number as the Chat ; and, indeed, in only one
  species of Passerine bird, namely, Petroica bicolor* from Western
  Australia, are there only sixteen free vertebrae in front of the compound
  sacrum.
     As   a rule, however, in the lesser birds of this Order the number is
  marvellously uniform, and agrees with what              I have given above.
     But the lesser species of Passerines amount in number to nearly one-
  third of the known species in the whole Class of the Carinatae.
     If it could be shown that the lesser singing birds had come up
  directly from the low ancestral forms, they yet suggest a rather
  long spine for that ancestor. It might have possessed ninety vertebrae.
  But I have by me most satisfactory proofs that the highest singing
  birds came through a series of forms that are traceable towards the
  Struthiou3 birds, until, at last, I have no doubt of their merging into
  them.                                                                                ,
     The Passerines from the Notogaea, both east and west, have among
  them various genera that come short of the excellence of the general
  Arctogasal types.      This is seen in the structure of their skulls, and in
  their vocal organs, and in the lower grade of their intelligence, whilst
  in the " Pteroptochidae," the sternum itself — a sort of anchor to the
  classifier, which is very safe and sure in all the Passerines except
  in two or three genera — gives way at last, and in those birds has five
  metasternal processes instead of three.
     In the smallest of all birds — the Humming-birds           — the actual number
  of vertebrae varies very little from what is found in the lesser Pas
  serines, but they are generally disposed of in a different manner ; they
  may have as many as four pairs of developed ribs in the fore part of
  the sacrum, as in the largest kind (Patagona gigai) ; in lesser forms, as
  HeUostryplm parzudukii, Diplogenia hcsperus, and also in the long-

                   On the Articulation   of the Vertebree  in Birds.
      Special modification of the vertebral chain takes place to a greater
  extent in birds than in any other of the Vertebrata.                Even in the
  intensely modified vertebree of Serpents, with their zygosphene and
  zygantrum, we still have merely the
                                              " proccelous " articulation of the
  centra.             /
      But in birds, as soon as the short-tailed forms appear, we have as in
  Marsh's gigantic Hesperornis, or feeble-winged Colymbine Grebe with
  pleurodont teeth — the highest known form of the vertebral articula
  tion, namely, the "cylindroidal" or " heteroccelous."                  This most
  accurate mode of locking the vertebral segments together, in which
  the centra viewed from below seem to be proccelous, but seen endwise
                                                                 I
  or laterally are opisthoccelous, is peculiar, as far as know, to birds,
  and apparently was not always, or from the beginning, present in
  them. This seems to be shown by the fact that the other of Marsh's
  toothed birds, namely, Ichthyornis, has for the most part " amphi-
            " vertebree,
  ccelou8                only one or two joints at the upper part of the neck
  showing the cylindroidal articulation, and that imperfectly.
      Now this is a most puzzling fact in Palaeontology, for Ichthyornis is
  a Carinate bird, and as far as      I can see, is the paront form of the Gulls
  (Laridse), although it possesses thecodont teeth in its long jaws.
  Everyone knows that the Loons and Grebes (Colymbits, Podilymbus,
 and Podiceps) are " Pygopods," and rather of a low type, but the
  Gulls are amongst the noblest and most intelligent of the Palmipeds,
  and are semi-altricial in their breeding.
     Now it is a fact that modern Grebes and Loons disagree with the
 other Pygopods in having all their presacral vertebrae cylindroidal,
 whilst the Alcidae and the Penguins (Spheniscidaa) and Gulls have
 their dorsal vertebree opisthoccelous.           More than this, by careful
 examination of the fore end of the first sacral (dorso-sacral) vertebra
 in the lesser Gulls (Lartis canus, L. ridibundus, L. tridactylus),            I  find
 that this is not a ball to fit accurately into the cup of the last free
 dorsal, but that its facet is sinuous, and does leave some space inside
 the joint.
     Hence    I infer, cantionsly, but with some considerable degree of con
fidence, that the modern Gulls have not quite perfected even the lower
or " opisthoccelous " form of articulation of the vertebral centra for
all their dorsals.
     I call the opisthoccelous mode of articulation lower, because it cer
tainly comes short in type of the cylindroidal, and is              I believe the

more    common     kind of articulation in Archaic Reptiles, whilst the
"              " mode is almost universal in the
   procoelous                                         existing Reptiles.
    But, in fact, Birds are very eclectic in the manner in which their
vertebral centra are articulated, and any kind of articulation that
happens to be the best for the particular region in which it is found
is selected, so to speak.
   I  will show, 1st, in what families the dorsal vertebrae are opistho-
ccelous ; 2ndly, the modification in Birds of that type of articulation ;
and then how many sorts of articulation they exhibit in this or that
Family.
   In his valuable memoir on the Penguins,* the late Professor
Morrison Watson greatly understates the number of Families that
have this peculiarity, namely, the Penguins and the Auks.                   Now
amongst    the   Steganopods    or Pelicanine    types they     are found in the
Cormorants and Darters (Plotus).
   Amongst the Old World Pygopods this structure occurs in all the
Alcidae — Alca, Uria, Oiceronia, &c., and in all the Cbaradriomorphae
or Shore birds (Limicolae), and in the Gulls (Laridae, Lestridae, <fcc.),
bnt not in the Petrel tribe- — Procellaridra.
   But amongst the most highly specialised arboreal " Altrices " I
have long been familiar with this peculiarity in the great Parrot
Family — Psittaeidae — in which, strangely enough, it is combined with
a very unloosed for character, namely, with terminal epiphyses — a
structure which begins to show itself in the Ornithorhynchus, in the
caudal region.
   This is very remarkable in these high, hot-blooded birds, for in the
whole class epiphyses are very rare, only one being constant ; this is
found in the cnemial crest of the tibia.
    But the Parrots are not the only high kinds of birds in which the
dorsal vertebrae are opisthoccelous ; I have within the last two years
found it in that remarkable type, the Oil Bird (Steatornis caripensus),
an archaic, frugivorous Goatiucker — a bird which has no near allies, a
crepuscular Cave-dweller, found only in Cumana and a neighbouring
island, and manifestly a waif from a nearly lost group.
      On the Modification   of the Opisthoccelian Articulation in Birds.
    The cup and ball in these opisthoccelous dorsals of birds is very
 different from what is found in the proccelous vertebrae of the
 Ophidia ; in them it is fairly circular or hemispherical, whilst in
birds it is generally scarcely more than three-fifths of an ellipse, and
the upper margin is emarginate, having a concave outline answering
to the general concavity of the floor of the spinal canal.
    That which shows such intense specialisation in the proccelous
vertebrae of the Serpents is the remarkable manner in which an
                   * "Challenger" Reports, Zoology, vol. 7, p. 16.

  1888.]             On the Vertebral Chain      of Birds.              471
 additional upper pair of confluent pre-zygapophyses form what Owen
 calls a " zygosphene ;" this fits iuto a double cavity — the " zygantrum."
    Now the articulation of the opisthoccelous dorsals of the birds thus
 mentioned is a complication of the articulation of centrum with
 centrum, and not any special modification, in their case, of the neural
 arch from which the zygapophyses spring.
    In Reptiles, as far as I can see, whether existing, or otherwise, there
 is nothing like what I am about to describe ; if any Palaeontologist
will show me a similar structure I shall be most glad to know of it.
 Such a fact would tell us how carefully these highly metamorphosed
types, the Birds, have kept along Reptilian lines ; if not, if no such
structure as this, any more than the cylindroidal articulation, is ever
seen in Reptiles, then we have another instance of the manner in
which the Birds have proceeded beyond the excellencies of their
progenitors.
    The greatest perfection of this complex opisthoccelian articulation
 of the dorsal vertebrae is best seen in some remarkable Charadrian
 birds ; three of which are Neotropical, whilst one is found in
 Kerguelen's Island ;   I refer to Chionis, Atlajis, and Thinocorus-.
    In Attagis gayi, a Neotropical bird of the Plover family, stouter
 than a Lapwing, but abont the same size, a nearly extinct type, and
very archaic, I find the best instanca of this Ornithic modification of
the opisthoccelian articulation of the dorsal vertebrae. On the hind
face of the centrum the cup in its fresh state is heart-shaped ; it is
half a long ellipse, with its upper edge gently emarginate. There is a
                  "
strong annular meniscus," P5 mm. deep below, and 0-6 mm. wide for
the rest of its extent.    It is a very solid fibro-cartilage, except for a
small extent above, where it- is finished by a ligamentous part. When
this meniscus", which partly divides the joint cavity into two spaces,
is removed, the hollow cartilaginous tract is seen to be in three parts;
Itelow, a semicircular hollow, marked in its middle by the notoohordal
"suspensory ligament," and above, on each side, a flat ear-shaped
additional facet.    These two facets look equally downwards and back
wards, and they lie obliquely on a similar pair of facets over the ball
on the fore-end of the centrum of the pext vertebra which looks up
wards and forwards. These well-fitting oblique facets, fore and aft,
are, indeed, additional zygapophyses, arising not from the neural arch,
but from the centrum; and they check the movement of the cup-and-ball
joint.   For a bird needs not only a very long and absolutely ankylosed
sacrum, it must also have a very strong dorsal series ; not unfre-
quently all but the last of this series are also ankylosed together ;
this only takes place in birds which have thsir dorsals cylindroidal.
                                                                 2 L 2

     On the Presence of Procoelons Vertebrce in Birds, and of the Imperfect
                       and Irregular Joints between the Centra.
      The modern proccelous Reptilian form of vertebral articulation is
  not altogether wanting in Birds.              The atlas, although devoid of its
  proper centrum, forms a more or less perfect joint of this kind in all
 birds ; it is crescentic in many of the Precoces, and circular in most
  of the Altrices ; and in the latter it is not notched above for the
  " odontoid or
                     suspensory ligament," but perforated.
     But in many of the higher or Altricial birds the last two movable
 joints in the caudal series become proccelous, and also acquire a
  joint-cavity.       The rest of that series have a sub-concave joint, with
  an intervertebral fibro-cartilage filling in the slight interspace ; these
 joints, however, retain the suspensory ligament like all the rest, and
  towards the end of this series the centrum is perforated by this
 remnant of the notochord, as in lower types.
     The joint formed by the hind part of the atlas and fore-part of
 the axis is irregular ; it cannot be classified with any of the other
 modes of articulation, but this arises from the fact that it is formed
 between the cortical or inferior part only of those two vertebra.                The
 two first vertebrae are greatly modified in all the " Amniota," an
 anticipation of which is found in the Urodelous Amphibia.*
     There are two main varieties, in Carinate birds, of the articulation of
 the atlas with the occipital condyle, and of the atlas with the axis.
     These correspond on the whole with the Natural Division of birds
 into "Altrices" and "Precoces"; the Piping Crow of Australia (Gym-
 norhina hbicen) may be taken as an example of the first, and the
 Australian Bustard (Eupodotis australis) of the second kind.
     In Gymnorhina the atlantal (proccelous) cup is a perfect hemi
 sphere, but near its upper rim the suspensory ligament passes through
 a small hole to reach the basi-occipital.               This cup fils well under
 the hemispherical occipital condyle ; it is in position intermediate
between that condyle and the true atlantal centrum. The hind face
 of this imperfect vertebral body is scooped so as to form a crescentic
 groove, with the concavity upwards ; the convex fore-end of the axis
 fits into this groove, and the atlas grows under the joint as a bilobate
and carinate process ; the joint is a crescentic condyle with its con
cavity looking upwards.
    * In many of these there is an imperfect vertebra between that which is articu
lated with the t»o occipital condyles l it is evidently an atlas with an imperfect
neural arch, and the median and lateral elements of which become fused to form the
odontoid process. The perfect vertebra next following is evidently the ax4, but bss
the atlantal    function of carrying the skull.   See Wiedcrsheim, ' On Salamaadrina
perxpicillata,'   Genoa,  1875, Plates 2 — 4, and  my papers,

    In  Eupodotis the proccelons facet of the atlas is a crescent with
horns approximating, and between these the odontoid process, or true
atlantal centrum, appears ; it is embraced by these "horns," and, as
in the other type, is tied to the basi-occipital by the suspensory liga
ment. In this bird, contrary to the rule, the atlas does not grow
under the axis, and the joint between them is almost proccelous ;
 and in this and still more in some other Precoces, the occipital arti
culation is transversely enlarged, i.e., shows signs of being double,
 as in Amphibia, the notochordal dimple answering to the wide inter
 space between the condyles in these forms.
    I shall explain these things more perfectly when I come to fhe
 " intercentra."
    The imperfect joints are those of the sacrum and the coccygeal bones.
The long general sacrum of a bird does not correspond to the special
sacrum of a Reptile or a Mammal, and in the dorsal region of this
 long series the articulations are, at first, like those of the free dorsals
 in front of them ; i.e., they are cylindroidal or opisthoccelous, as the
 case may be. But as we approach the true sacral region, between the
 acetabula, the faces of the centra are roughly flat, and the centra
 themselves are transverse subcrescentic blocks, with all the inter-
 central structures aborted.
    The same thing takes place in the ploughshare or coccygeal bone,
which finishes the chain by a series of from four to six, more and more
 imperfect, segments, from which, for a time, in the embryo the noto-
 chord projects, uncovered, behind.
    There are other ankylosed parts of the vertebral chain besides the
 sacrum and the coccygeal bone ; in these the parts are normal at first,
 becoming afterwards fused together. It is very common for the last
 cervical (whose free rib does not unite by a short piece with the
sternum) to be fused with the dorsals — all but the last, which remains
free, as in Falcons, Pigeons, Fowls, &c.      The same thing takes place
in many of the Crane family, but generally with fewer bones. In the
Horubills (Buceridae) the atlas and axis become ankylosed. In some
other Altrices we have there found that which is normally the last free
dorsal fused with the first of the dorso-sacral series ; and in others
the first dorsal sacral, covered by the iliac bones, remains free ; this
is, however, a very irregular modification, and is sometimes due to
old age in one case, and to a somewhat immature condition in the
other.
   In the present paper I cannot go into details as to the various modi
fications of the neural arches, with their zygapophyses and spines, nor
describe the various outgrowths below that arise from the centra.
But there are distinct parts of the vertebra that must be mentioned ;
these are the
                 " intercentra " and ribs.

                           On the Intercentra  of Birds.
      I  have not spoken of the neural arches as actually distinct from tbe
   centra ; they are, as bony tracts, for a time, but the great heat and
   hmte of the development of an embryo bird causes many essentially
   distinct parts to be converted into hyaline cartilage continuously ;
   such distinct morphological regions, however, are very apt to assert
  their independence for a few weeks during the growth of the young
  bird, and although separate osseous centres in a continuous tract of
  hyaline cartilage are apt to be very inconstant as to the share they
  take in the work, yet, on the whole, in default of the primary seg
  mentation of the cartilage, they are very valuable landmarks.
      In a survey of this subject from below upwards, it is well known
  that the neural arches come before the centra ; that establishes their
  independence and importance.
      It is very difficult to put this matter into a small compass, and to
  show throughout the whole of the Vertebrata what parts of a ver
  tebra are ^important autogenous         " elements " and what are mere
 apophyses or outgrowths. The old ¦pre-embryologieal nomenclature fails
  us here, entirely.
     Nothing newer and nothing        better has been said upon this subject
 than by Baur, whose wide acquaintance with the extinct forms that
 lie between Birds above, and Fishes below, makes him, on the whole, an
 excellent guide.
     In some " General Notes " [extracted from the ' American Natu
ralist,' October, 1887, pp. 942—945] Dr. Baur (p. 945) gives his

   If we consider the structure of a bird as compared with a Reptile
or a long-tailed Mammal, it would seem to have no necessity for the
                  " chevron-bones " or intercentra
development of                                     ; yet these elements
are constantly present at the two extremities of the vertebral chain,
although in the hind-part they are often not more developed than
those seen in the lumbar region of the Mole (Talpa europcea).
   If all birds have come up to us through forms similar to the
Archceopteryx, then there must have been a slow, secular degradation
 of these inferior arches : that view, however, places the Toothed
 Birds of the Cretaceous Period as far from those Saururous types as
the Birds of the present time.
   That the aquatic, gill-bearing forms from which, originally, the
Reptile and the Bird both arose were long-tailed, I have not the least
doubt. One thing, however, I never can see, and that is that there
was any absolute necessity that there should be just one pair of those
old quasi-larval Dipnoans (or Amphibians) that had, at that im
measurably remote epoch, "the promise and. potency" of all thoso
Reptiles and Birds that we know have arisen, and of all those myriads
of others of which we know nothing.
   As the times became ripe for the harvest of scaly and feathered
Jorms, they did appear, but had they all one father and one
mother -t
   Another question to be asked is, Were there ever any per saltum
rises in the scale; did all those nobler and still nobler forms acquire
their varying degrees of excellency, from a low Reptile to a high
Singing-bird, by the slow accretion of growth, and almost imperceptible
change of structure, and increase of faculty ?
   It would greatly relieve my mind if it could be shown that the
most probable hypothasis is that the swarm of old Perennibrauchiatts
in a thousand places, and at varying times, changed for the better ;
became sometimes rapidly, at other times more slowly, transformed
as the occasions     arose ; when the dilemma was transform or die.
That is the dilemma, now, to all our native Amphibia year by
year, and that which takes place now in forms that rapidly rise to

     However it came about,            the  Saururous (long-tailed) forms have
 become Nothurous, have a mere bastard              tail or stump. Yet this mor
 phological feat is performed in the transformation of any Tadpole
 in "a month of days," hence the real difficulty does not lie with
  Nature, but with us.
     Bat in studying the abortive chevron-bones of birds we shall find
 that these high and marvellously transformed types are not short-
 tailed, if we consider number merely ; it is the peculiar contraction
 and packing — consolidation — these segments have undergone that
 make them to differ so greatly from Reptiles and Saururous birds.*
     In the Common Swan (Cygnw olor), behind the four true sacrals
 there are ten " urosacrals " fused with the long post-ilia ; then come
 seven simple, and one compound, bone, composed in the cygnet of five
 bony segments and an unossified rudiment behind, six altogether.
  VVe thus get, even allowing for four sacrals, twenty-three vertebrae,
 more or less developed behind the outgoing sacral nerves, whilst the
 Archceopteryx appears to have had only twenty-one caudal vertebne

    Now of these post-sacral vertebrae of the Swan nearly the hinder
 half have rudimentary intercentra.               These are very small, those in
 the middle of the series being the largest. In the cygnet about a
 month after hatching, the first is beneath the third movable
 joint, and the last under the last cartilaginous interspace but one, in
 the series of imperfect segments that form the "ploughshare bone;"
 thus there are eight in all.
     But there are intercentra at the other end of the chain ; these
 I have studied in the Cygnet, in the ripe embryo of the Mooruk

 Apteryx. In these embyo, and young birds, there are always found
 the following osseous centres in the atlas and axis, namely, a pair for

an Amniotic type.       But the so-called body of the atlas is in position
between as well as below the occipital articulation, and is cortical.
The lesser and foremost bone in the axis is also intermediate between
as well as below the true centrum of the atlas and of the axis.           I
quite agree with Baur that these two bones are intercentra, although
I  am not ready with the " strong reasons

corner of Palaeontology.
    In considering both intercentra and ribs, there are two birds that
 have helped me most; these are the Swan and the Cormorant (Phala-
 erocorax carbo).
    Whether faster or more slowly, the transformation of these two
 types from a Reptilian into an Avian form is certainly well worthy
 of our closest attention.      The Ostrich tribe, a sort of half-way
 creatures, only help a little in this research ; yet in tracing the stages
 of a Swan or of any other of the Anatidae, there would appear
 to be nothing strange in the sudden arrest of one at the Struthious
 stage ; we seem for a time to have before us a new kind of short-
 legged and web-footed bird of the Ostrich kind ; it does move,
 however, it develops into a Carinate bird with a Desmognathous
 palate.                                           I
           I lay stress upon this, because, as shall soon show, the
 Anatidae hold with the Katitae in the matter of a perfect series of
 cervical ribs, as in the Crocodile, but more aborted, and soon fused
 with the vertebra. Birds are very uniform, in all essentials, in their
 atlas and axis ; but their caudal vertebrae differ just as much as the
 structures they support differ, e.g., the " Rectrices," or tail quills,
 that form their double, fan-shaped, third wing.
    The Cormorant puts its tail to a much greater variety of uses than
 the Swan ; the component vertebrae of the former are stronger and
 have much larger intercentra to serve as levers to the depressors of
 the tail.
    There are two movable caudals between the post-ilia in the Cormo
 rant, and the second of these has a seed-like intercentrum that lies
 below and between the second caudal articulation.        The next is much
 larger, and the rest are as long and twice as broad as the neural spines
 of the same vertebrae, and are ankylosed to the hinder bone ; they
 be well under the one in front, and form the lower third of the pro-
 ccelous joint.   The last or compound bono has four of these intercentra
 fused together and to the imperfect vertebrae to which they belong ;
 thus this bone has a dilated and dentate base, the fore-part of which
 passes under three-fourths of the last simple vertebra, and is bilobate,
 whilst those in front are clavate. In some birds these intercentra have

two crura, and these may meet below and form a hcemal canal ; in the
Cormorant they are solid, and are manifestly developed for steering
purposes — as in the Kestrel or Windhover (Falco tinnuneulus) .          The
habits of that voracious, rapid, and powerful bird (the Cormorant)
explain the teleology of these strong and solid intercentra of the tail.
    Coming now to the ribs, my two chosen types, the Swan and tho
 Cormorant, will be the best instances to show how thin the partition
is between a hot-blooded bird, and a cold-blooded generalised Reptile,
like the Crocodile. In my earlier pnpers on the Osteology of Birds,         I
wrote in a general and somewhat confused manner about reptilian
characters in Birds ; bat Professor Huxley's inestimable paper On
                                                                        "

472), so thoroughly ventilated the relations of the two great classes,
 Reptiles and Birds, showing indeed that in a very true sense the two
were one, a huge double class — base below and noble above — that if
 I am confused now, it is not the fault of my " guide."
    It is perfectly true that the Ratitae, on the whole, are the lowest,
most generalised, and most reptilian of birds ; but they have a high
degree of ornithic specialisation in some parts, much beyond what is
 seen in some other birds that, on the whole, belong to a much higher
 level.
    Now the Ratit8? are related to a large number of families of birds,
 that like themselves have cylindroidal vertebrae up to the sacrum ; and
 there is an almost natural and complete series of these forms, Tinamous,
 Hemipods, Fowls, &c., &c. But as I showed many years ago, the
 Duck -tribe and the Fowl-tribe have a skull which is fundamentally
 alike in both groups, and is unlike that of any other kind of bird's
 skull, and yet is easily derivable from the Struthious type, by this
 and that gentle metamorphic alteration.
     But if the Cormorant and his relatives wero each derived from
 Batitae, they must have been quite unlike those now existing; a Swan,
 strange as the assertion may sound, is modified from an essentially
 Struthious embryo.       I have traced it step by step.
    But the Cormorant, and the Darter (Plotus), its nearest relative,
seem more like a survival of transformed Plesiosaurs, and their Verte
bral Chain is so intensely Reptilian that, among living forms, the
Crocodile is the best guide to the morphologist in i£s interpretation.
                             On the Bibs of Birds.
    I will first describe the ribs of the Swan, and then those of the
 Cormorant.
    In  Cygnus olor, as  in all the normal " Chenomorphas," the vertebral
artery, right and left, runs inside a series of bridges, which, eked out
by strong membrane, form a canal all along the neck. The piers of
 theso small bridges are formed by the upper and lower transverse

   processes (diapophyses and parapophyses) ; the arches by arrested ribs — ¦
   "pleuroids." As a rale, in the Carinatae, these are not developed on
   the axis and atlas; but in the Anatidas, as in the Ratitae, generally,
   they are found in them also.       The arch on the atlas is a strong but
   narrow .bar ; in the Cygnet of a month old there is in it a styloid
   bony rib, placed subvertically.     The rest are larger, are horizontally
   placed, and have a free styloid end, which in many cases almost
   reaches to the end of the centrum of the next vertebra.                These
   riblets have but little primary independence as cartilages ; but they
   ossify separately ; they aro clavate, and this clubbed fore-end has
   thns no. distinction of "eapituluni" and " tuberculum," although
   the lower edge answers to the one, and the upper to the other.
      In the twenty-second vertebra the styloid part is lost, and only a
   broad vertical bridge is developed by the " pleuroid ;" in the twenty-
   third only a narrow bridge, like that on the atlas, but stouter. On the
   twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth the ribs are segmented off, have double
   heads, and remain free, although they do not form a perfect arch by
   reaching the sternum ; indeed the last but one is very short. In these
   two vertebras the facet for the capitulum is on the centrum, opposite
   the lower part of the facet of the centrum ; that for the tuberculum
   is on the diapophysis.      Thence along the five free dorsals and the
   two first dorso-sacrals, the joint for the tuberculum (the parapophysis)
   gets gradually higher, so that in the two last it lies over where the
   suture was between the centrum and neurapophysis.            The developed
   ribs of the third and fourth sacral (doi so-sacral), have lost their
   capitulum, and articulate only by their tuberculum on the diapo-
.  physis.
      The last three vertebrae of the seven that buttress the pre-ilia, have
  only a generalised mass, right and left ; and on the next four, the
  true sacrals, these aro either gone, or reduced to mere prickles.         The
  twelfth and thirteenth have strong pleural bars, not segmented off in
  the cartilaginous     condition, but they are ossified     as  distinct bars  ;
  these coalesce with the centrum and diapophysis. Behind these, in the
                           "
  Cygnet, there are no pleuroids," but in a recently hatched Duckling
   (Anas   bosehas, domesticus),  I find Jive pairs of these little rib-bars to
  the fore-half of the Urosacral series.
      Thus there are thirty-fcur pairs of ribs, rudimentary or developed,
  without a break,       in the Common Swan, and then an attempt at
  forming a new series behind the sacral nerves.        Also, let it be noticed,
  that the first two pairs of pleuroids, or rib-rudiments, arise from inter-
  centra, whilst the last two of the twenty-nine have lost their capitu
  lum, or primary head, and are articulated by their tuberculum or
  secondary head to the diapophysis, an outgrowth of the neural arch
  (neuroid).
      Thus we have in a single vertebral chain an epitome of the history

480                           Prof. W. K. Parker.                 [Mar. 22,
of the evolution of ribs. Towards the end of that chain, the vertebrae
and ribs form the upper part of the most highly specialised thoracic
cage in existence, it is the last consummation of the whole evolutional
series, the furthest from the beginning made by the Ammoccete, when
it has just been metamorphosed into a Lamprey.
   In the Cormorant, one of the lower forms of the Pelecanine
Family (" Steganopods," " Dysporomorphae "), the vertebral chain is
much more archaic than in either the Swan, or even the Ostrich and
its kindred.
   Here, indeed, we miss the atlantal rib, but rudiments are present
on the axis, and these are attached to an ankylosed intercentrum.
   Ou the whole, the greater number of the styloid cervical ribs are
like those of the Swan, except that the upper edge of the free style is
not connected with the neural arch by an ossified aponeurosis.        There
are    only three presacral vertebra          that  have    developed    ribs
attached to sternal pieces, and thus forming perfect cinctures, finished
below by the common inverted keystone or sternum.           The ribs on the
last two cervicals, the nineteenth and twentieth, have perfect heads,
and have uncinate pieces attached and ankylosed to them, but their
sternals are suppressed.       In front of them there are three vertebrae,
with non-segmented riblets, that have no retral style ; these are mere
necks of a developed rib, and run almost horizontally from the centrum
to the large diapophysis ; they are, in fact, similar to, but much
stronger than, the atlantal rib of the Swan. The parapophysis in these
three vertebrae stretches straight out from the centrum, which is also
alate behind  it, and these bars enclose large foramen,
                                             a             8  mm. wide and
4  mm. high. The nineteenth cervical, with its developed vertebral
rib, forms for the capitulum of that rib a deep cup with two
distinct facets, so that the head of the rib articulates in a manner
similar to what      seen in Mammals.
                    is                    In them, however, the two facets
are one in front of the other, and on distinct vertebrae   ;   here they are
one above the other, and near the fore-end of the same vertebra, one
is on the centrum, and the other    ison the neural arch. The facet on the
centrum  is  higher than the junction of capitulum and centrum, in the
non-segmented rib next in front.       In the last cervical, the lower facet
is still higher, but    on the centrum both these pairs of ribs have
                         is              ;                                  a
long neck and the normal articulation of the tuberculum with the
under face of the end of the large diapophysis, an outgrowth of the
neural arch.
   In the three dorsals the parapophysial cup for the capitulum             is
entirely on the neural arch, and, from before, backwards,   it  keeps rising
to a higher point in that arch. Thus in         few vertebra
                                                 a              we have the
capitulum rising from         point where the intercentrum would be

 were developed, to a point quite clear of, and some height above, the
centrum itself. The first general sacral vertebra     is similar to the last

free     dorsal; its vertebral rib has a perfect sternal piece, and thus
there are four complete cinctures to the thorax. The last developed rib
is feebler, and its sternal piece does not quite reach the sternum.
There is a dia-parapophysial facet for its feeble upper part ; it is a
cup nearly as large as the diapophysial facet in front of it, and the
cartilage lining the cup is extended downwards on a narrow convexity
of the transversely carinate outgrowth, and thus this rib, with a small
head, and a neck less than half the normal size, articulates by one
continuous facet belonging to both tuberculum and capitulum, and
entirely on the neural arch.
     The third vertebra in the general sacral series has a pair of ribs ;
these have lost their capitulum entirely ; they are mere rods, 6 mm.
long and 0-75 mm. thick, and are ankylosed by their inner twisted
 end to the diapophyses.
     After these come three pairs of strong pre-iliac buttresses —gener
 alised masses, from which all trace of rudimentary ribs has gone — in
 the old bird. Then come two vertebra with the bodies nearly devoid
 of lower outgrowths ; these are the true sacrals. These are followed
 by the urosacrals, the first of which has strong rib-bars that buttress
 the post-ilia, and that are ossified as distinct riblets, but are not seg
 mented off as distinct tracts of cartilage in the embryo.                      But in old
 birds the buttresses of the second true sacral are not quite absorbed,
 but remain as prickles, for the clearing away of unnecessary parts
 goes on even after the bird is adult.                This is only one among many
 instances that could be adduced in which the transformation of the
 skeleton is seen to be continued throughout life. In that transforma
 tion, from beginning to end, each individual bird repeats the story of
 its birth in the past ages, and each individual bird seems to be striving
 towards some goal, albeit in its present state, when adult, its struc
 ture is to the morphologist an absolutely perfect thing.
      In birds, as a rule, the true sacrals abort, or even suppress, the
 pleuroid rudiments in the true sacrals ; four of these block-like
 vertebrae form the sacrum proper of the Swan ; two only in the
 Cormorant.*

     Professor  Mivart   speaks of his examination of the skeleton of      P. bicrittatus and
 P. bratiliensit,   as well  as of P. carbo. His figure of the pelvis is probably one

    I shall finish this paper with one more instance. In most birds the
true sacrals have only the upper transverse processes, or diapo-
physes; the lower bars, or arrested "pleoroids," are entirely gone
in the adult, but small prickles remain, often more on one side than
on the other. Thus the spaces for the large sacral nerves and their
ganglia, and for the lobes of the kidneys, are not quite cleared.                 In
the Tiger-Bittern (Tigrisoma leucolophum), a Neotropical member of
the " Ardeidae," there is no vertebra in the sacrum, until we come to
the last three uro-sacrals, that has not its inferior or "pleuroid
                                                                              " bars.
    The sacrum of this bird is composed of. fifteen vertebrae, the first
has developed ribs, with imperfect sternal pieces, the next two have
small ankylosed ribs, separated for some distance from the diapophyses.
Then come three with stout generalised pre-iliac buttresses.                     The
next six have inferior rib-bars, those of the last four are strong,
those of the first two weak.             On the left side the second of these
rods is membranous for a short extent ; on the right side it is im
perfect in its outer part, it is a mere prickle growing from the
centrum. Except on the atlas this bird has ribs or rudiments of ribs
up to the twelfth sacral. 1 suspect that if the ancestral form from
which the Tiger-bittern arose could be put face to face with its stilted
descendant, the two would differ as much as the vermiform larva
of Tipula oleracea differs from its winged and stilted imago.
V. " Second Preliminary Note on the Development of A pteryx."
       By T. Jeffery Parker, B.Sc.. C.M.Z.S., Professor of
       Biology in the University of Otago. Communicated by
       W. K. Parker, F.R.S. Received March 8, 1888.
   The materials for the present investigation consist of embryos of
<he three common         species of Apteryx, viz., A. australis, A. crweni, and
A. mantelli. Most of them, including all the earlier stages, were
collected for me by Mr. R. Heury, of Lake Te Anau ; a nearly ripe
embryo of A. mantelli was obtained from Mr. A. Roischek : and I am
indebted to Mme. Miiller for a half-ripe specimen of A. oweni, and to
Sir Walter Buller for two, somewhat older, of A. mantelli.
   I  desire to record my sincere thanks to the Council of the Royal
Society for the grant which has enabled me to defray the expenses of
the invest igation.
   My observations        are far from complete, and deal only with com
paratively late stages. The egijs of Apteryx are at all times difficult
to obtain, as evidenced by their high market value, and Mr. Heury is
bird dissected by me in having the pre-iliv buttressed by seren pairs of massive
processes instead of fix, by having only one true sacral, and by showing strong costal
                                   "'

the only collector     I have yet met with who was willing to give his
time not only to collecting the eggs, but to removing and preserving
the embryos.      I  have, unfortunately, never been able to leave Dunedin
during the breeding season        so as to try ard procure the earlier stages,
the removal and preservation of which could not be entrusted to a
collector.
   My first Stage (A) corresponds roughly with a chick embryo of
the fourth day of incubation : the full number of mesoblastic somites
— about 44 — has already appeared. Stage B is apparently only a few
hours older : Stage C corresponds very nearly with a fifth day chick,
except that the limbs are in a less advanced condition.
   Stage D is in about the same state of development as a chick of
the 7th day ; it was unfortunately damaged by the collector during
removal from the egg, both fore-limbs being destroyed.                        Avian
characters are now definitely assumed, the bead being produced into
a short beak very like that of a chick at the corresponding period.
The hind-limbs are still in the primitive position, i.e., stretched out
at right angles to the long axis of the body, but their extremities are
dilated into flattened paw-like feet which distinctly show the three
principal digits and a small knob-like hallux.
   Stage E is a little later than D, and is chiefly interesting for the
condition of the fore-limb, which is terminated by a tridactyle paw with
sub-equal digits.       In the hind-limb the cueinial flexure has appeared,
but not the mesotarsal flexure, so that the combined cms and pes are
directed backwards.
   In Stage F the characteristic features of the genus Apteryx are
assumed, the beak having undergone a great increase in length and
bearing the nostrils at the tip. The fore-limb is now a true wing,
the manus being supported mainly by the second digit, but presenting
blunt projections on the pre- and post-axial borders of the wrist
which indicate respectively the positions of the reduced first and
third digits. In the hind-limb the mesotarsal flexure has appeared,
and the pes has nearly assumed its adult characters.                  The feather-
papillae appear first in this etage.
   In Stage G the feather-papillae have become larger and more widely
distributed ; the beak and the hind-limbs have further increased in
length, and the wing shows no trace externally of either the first or
the third digit.      In all the remaining stages the adult form is assumed
and the body covered with feathers.
   Contrary to the usual statements as to the pterylosis of the Ratitae,
Ap'eryx has distinct apteria, which are especially noticeable in the
earlier stages.*      In Stage F, in which the feather-papillae first appear,
they are arranged in fairly distinct dorsal, humeral, and femoral
  • Pterylae and apteria are figured in the embrvo ostrich and referred to in the
description of the figures by Miss B. Lindsay,

tracts ; the ventral tract appears in Stage G. In the ripe embryo
and even in the adult, besides the narrow ventral space recognised by
Nitzsch, there are well-marked lateral spaces separating the dorsal and
ventral, and the dorsal and femoro-crural tracts from one another.
   In the full paper a table and diagrams will be given showing the
length of important parts of the body (head, beak, limbs, &c.), in the
various stages, expressed as percentages of length of vertebral column.
The table shows that while the wings attain their maximum relative
size in Stage F, the legs continue to increase in proportional length
some time after hatching.       The brain-case, also, undergoes from
Stage G onwards a proportional diminution in size, while the beak
increases steadily up to adult life.
   The greater part of the full paper                will deal with the skeleton      :   a
detailed description will be given of the entire skeleton at about the
time of hatching, when all the more important ossifications have
appeared and but little ankylosis has taken place.
  The vertebral formula is —
                                                      a
              Cv.   16.   Th.   5+3   :   L. 8   :    S. 3   :   Cd. 3 + 6-8.
  The bracket indicates that the last three thoracic, all the lumbar
and sacral, and the first three caudal vertebra are united to form the
compound sacrum of the adult.
  The axis vertebra is ossified by five centres, the additional one
occurring in the antero-ventral region of the body, below the
odontoid ; this evidently represents an inter-centrum or inter-vertebral
wedge-bone.
   The cervical ribs appear to chondrify separately from the rest of
the vertebrae ; but further observations are needed on this point, as
well as on the autogenously ossified transverse processes of the sacral
vertebrae which in the youngest specimen hitherto examined are
continuous with the vertebrae.
   The skull differs so little except in details from that of other birds,
that there is little to be said about it in an abstract.     The chondro-
cranium of the ripe embryo and the separate membrane bones will be
fully described and figured. As in other birds,                        I
                                                         find no trace of
Jacobson's organ ; the capsule of the organ                      is,
                                                     however, represented
by  a distinct (paired) rod    of cartilage in  the vomerine  region, as                  in
Rhea.
  In Stages D —       the shoulder-girdle consists of a solid piece of
                      G
cartilage having much the same shape as the adult bone. In Stage H
an ossification appears in the scapular region, and another in the post-
axial moiety of the coracoid region.    In Stage a fenestra appears,
                                                                  I

ventral portion of the shoulder-girdle into procoracoid and coracoid

regions. The resemblance at this stage to the shoulder-girdle of the
ostrich is very close, but the late occurrence of the distinction between
coracoid and procoracoid, and their formation by fenestration of a
continuous cartilage, are remarkable. In Stage K the procoracoid
has degenerated into a ligament which now forms the sole pre-axial
boundary of the coracoid fenestra.        Later, the coracoid ossification
extends pre-axiad until the membrane of the fenestra is replaced by
bone, but even, in the adult the position of the fenestra is marked by
the thin, often emarginate plate which forms the inner or pre-axial
portion of the coracoid.     The small aperture situated mesio-ventrad
of the glenoid cavity, and sometimes described as the coracoid
fenestra, serves for the transmission of a nerve.
   In Stage E the manus contains three well-chondrified sub-equal
digits ; the carpals are not yet chondrified, and are only indicated by
a concentration of nuclei in the blastema.        In Stage F the second
digit has increased out of all proportion to the first and third. In
Stage G the pollex has degenerated, and its position is indicated only
by a concentration of nuclei in the mesoblast; two well-marked
carpals have appeared, one of which — the radiale — lies pre-axiad and
slightly proximad of the other, which gives attachment to the second
and third metacarpals.      In Stage H the radiale lies entirely proximad
of the second or distal carpal, which is closely applied to the proximal
ends of the two metacarpals.       In the newly-hatched bird the second
and third metacarpals have ankylosed with one another and with the
distal carpal, the radiale remaining separate.
   In Stage G the pubis closely resembles that of a chick of the
6th day, the pubis being vertical and the ilium comparatively short.
In Stage E the ilium has lengthened greatly, and the pubis forms an
angle of 20° with the vertical.      In G the adult form is assumed, and
in H ossification has begun.
   In Stage D the tarsus consists of three elements, tibiale, fibulare.
and a single cartilage representing the five distalia.         Besides the
three functional digits of the adult, and the pollex, which at this
stage has its normal connexion with the tarsus, there is a distinct
vestige of the fifth metatarsal in the form of a rod-like cartilage,
0-4 mm. long.      In Stage E the foot has elongated ; the pollex has
shifted distalwards, and is now attached to the pre-axial edge of the
second metatarsal at about the middle of its length.       The fifth meta
tarsal is still distinct, but has not increased in size ; the tibiale and
fibulare have united.
   In Stage F the foot has nearly attained its adult form. The united
tibiale and fibulare instead of being, as in the preceding stage, in
close contact with the combined distalia, are separated from them by
a narrow in-growth of connective tissue, the rudiment of the meso-
tarsal semilunar pad.       The fifth metatarsal is still visible, but has

 1888.]                                     Presents.                               487
 undergone distinct retrogression, being only 0-15 ram. in length, and
 formed of indifferent tissue instead of hyaline cartilage. From this
 it would appear that the fifth metatarsal actually disappears in
 Apteryx instead of fusing with the fourth as in the chick.
     In Stage G the proximal tarsals are closely applied to but have not
 yet united with the tibia; the distalia also are still distinct from the
 metatarsals.          The rndiment of the mesotarsal semilunar pad has
 increased considerably, and in the centre of it a rounded nodule of
 hyaline cartilage has appeared, which                 I  take to be the representative
 of   the  centrale     tarsi,  an  element    not  hitherto recognised in birds.* In
 a recently-hatched specimen of Apteryx australis, it is a perfectly
 distinct cartilage about 2 mm. in diameter, imbedded in the fibrous
 tissue of the semilunar pad ; in the adult it becomes ossified, attaining
 a diameter, in A. oweni, of about 5 mm.
      As the scientific libraries to which               I  have access are small and
 imperfect,      I                                                  I
                     take this opportunity of saying that shall be extremely
 grateful     to    the   authors of papers bearing upon the subjects of the
present investigation who will favour me with separate copies.

    The   authors have examined a variety of cells analogous to
 Becquerel's
               " pile a oxygene ; " i.e., containing two platinum or other
non-oxidisable plates, one immersed in an acid fluid, the other in an
alkaline one, the two fluids being connected by a wet wick or siphon,
and either some oxidising agent being also contained in the acid or
some reducing substance in the alkali.          In the first case continuous
evolution of oxygen was brought about from the surface of the
plate immersed in the alkali ; in the second the converse phe
nomenon was observed,          i.e., hydrogen was continuously evolved
from the plate in the acid ; in eaoh case the quantity of gas liberated
was equivalent to the current passing as measured by a small silver
voltameter.     Thus the following figures were obtained in various
experiments,    the  measurements being made after sufficient amounts

of current had passed to about saturate with oxygen or hydrogen
respectively the fluid in the collecting tube, and so avoid loss by
solution ; in the first set the alkaline fluid was strong caustic soda solu
tion; in the second somewhat diluted sulphuric acid (1 to 4 or 5
water) was the acid liquid.          Carbon plates were used in experiments
G and H ; platinum ones          in all the others.

    Various reducing agents were found ineffective in causing hydro
 gen evolution in this way ; thus no noticeable amount of hydrogen
 was produced when sodium sulphite or hypophosphite, potassium
 t'errocyanide,   or manganous       hydroxide and ammoniacal sal-ammoniac
 were used.       Similarly,     no  oxygen evolution was observed when a
 mixture of sulphuric acid and barium dioxide, or hydrochloric acid
 containing iodine in solution, was the acid fluid. On the other hand,
 the oxygen absorbed by a platinum sponge aeration plate was suffi
ciently active to cause some four times as much permanent current to
pass as was produced when a solid platinum plate was used immersed
some centimetres below the surface of the acid.
    By substituting various metals and caustic soda or ammonia solu
tion for the platinum plate and alkaline solution containing a
reducing substance, tolerably energetic cells were obtained ; even in
the case of metals not ordinarily regarded as belonging to the oxi-
disable class, solution was readily brought about when the alkaline
fluid contained potassium cyanide.                In all cases hydrogen was
evolved from the surface of the opposed platinum plate immersed in
sulphuric acid solution in quantity proportionate to the current
passing, whilst a quantity of metal was dissolved usually sensibly
equal to that representing the formation of the lowest oxide ; tin
dissolved to a somewhat less extent, indicating the production of
some stannic oxide, from 3 to 7 per cent. of the metal being dissolved in
this form, and the rest as stannous oxide ; and mercury dissolved to
form mercuric potassio-cyanide,            100 parts of metal dissolving for
108 of silver       thrown    down     in the   voltameter. Gold, silver, and
palladium readily evolved hydrogen when immersed in cyanide solu
tion ; but platinum was ineffective, and iron gave only a faint action.
Thus the following figures were obtained iu various experiments : —

where Y is some substance capable of uniting with oxygen (pyro-
gallol, ferrous oxide, copper, gold, <fcc.). For every gram-equivalent
of silver thrown down in the voltameter, consequently, a gram-
equivalent of both acid and alkali must disappear by mutual neutra
lisation during the passage of the current. This disappearance was
verified quantitatively by titration in various experiments with no
more lack of precision than the nature of the observation would lead
one to anticipate.
    We find that by combining two fluids, one alkaline and containing
a powerful reducing agent, the other acid and containing an energetic
oxidiser, with platinum plates immersed in each (e.g., caustic soda
solution of pyrogallol, and sulphuric acid solution of chromic anhy

dride),   continuous currents of very considerable         power may be
obtained    when   the internal resistance is diminished sufficiently by
using cells of considerable magnitude j e.g., when made of the stone
ware and inner porous vessels usually employed for Grove's cells, the
porous vessel being cemented into the outer stoneware vessel (by
paraffin wax or other unattacked material) in such a fashion as to
divide it into three compartments separated one from the other by
porous dividing walls ; the acid and alkaline fluids being placed in
the two outermost compartments, and the innermost one being filled
with a solution of a neutral salt, e.g., sodium sulphate. A large
variety of analogous cells of more or less power can thus be formed by
using different organic and inorganic reducing substances soluble in
alkali, e.g., ferrocyanides, hydrosulphites, opianates, &c.

                                  Part I.
   I was induced to undertake this investigation by a careful observa
tion of the action of picric acid and potassium hydrate upon normal
human urine at the boiling temperature.
   The introduction of picric acid as a test for sugar in urine is due
to my father, Dr. George Johnson, who accidentally discovered the
production of a very dark colour on the addition of picric acid to a
portion of saccharine urine which had been previously boiled with
potassium hydrate. He made this observation in November, 1882.
The dark colour was found to be duo to reduction of potassium
picrate to potassium picramate by glucose at the boiling temperature,
and in presence of potassium hydrate.             The reaction had been
described by C. D. Braun nearly twenty years previously (" Ueber
die Umwandlung der Pikrinsaure in Pikraminsaiire und liber din
                                          '
Nachweisung des Traubenzuckers,"            Fresenius, Zeitschrift,' 1865),
but it had not hitherto been applied to any practical purpose.
   Having observed the extreme delicacy of the test, and the ease with
which the reaction is effected, my father determined to introduce it to
the notice of the medical profession, not merely as a trustworthy
qualitative test of extreme delicacy, but also as a means of estimating
quantitatively the actual amount of glucose in diabetic urines. In
this latter object I did my best to assist him, and our united efforts
resulted in the elaboration of a new, easy, and accurate method for

son's volume of ' Medical Lectures and Essays,' and also in the last
edition of Dr. Roberts' work on ' Urinary and Renal Diseases.'
  Reaction of the  Picric Acid and Potash Test in Normal Human Urine.
   As soon    as the  picric acid and potash test was introduced to my
notice,  I applied it to normal human urine, and found that it gave
indication of the pre-ence therein, if not of glucose, at all events of
a reducing substance capable of reducing yellow potassium picrate to
red potassium picramate in presence of potassium hydrate at the
boiling temperatu re.
   After the elaboration of the test as a quantitative one, many speci
mens of urine from men in perfect health were examined by its means,
and we never met with h single specimen which gave no reducing
action, though, as would be expected, the reduction was more marked
in concentrated specimens, and the smallest quantity of reducing sub
stance was found in the urine of patients suffering from diabetes
insipidus, in which ca-es the specific gravity of the secretion was very
low.
   In most urines fioiu healthy individuals, of the average specific
gravity (l-020), the amount of reduction exerted upon picric acid in
presence of potassium hydrate at the boiling temperature corresponded
with that which would have been produced by a solution of glucose
containing 0-6 gro in pi-r fluid ounce ; whilst the quantity of reducing
agent indicated by the method of Fehling or Pavy is always slightly
greater, the cupric oxide reduction of normal human urine expressed
in terms of glucose averaging 0"75 grain per fluid ounce.
   But is this normal reducing agent glucose ? and if not, what is it ?
The object of the present research is to answer these questions.
Observations ichich   negative the Hypothesis  that the Reducing Agent    of
                          Normal Urine is Glucose.
   Dr. Robert Kirk (' Lancet,' June     16, 1883) was,  I believe, the first
to publish the fact that healthy urine gives some indication of reducing
picric acid in presence of potash at the ordinary temperature, whereas
glucose   effects no reduction   until the temperature approaches       the
boiling point.    This  is an important distinction.
   Again, after repented experiments, I have never once succeeded in
producing alcohol and carbon dioxide from normal human urine by
the action of yeast. even when the solution was artificially concen
trated before introducing the yeast, and the liquid containing the
ferment was kept under the most favourable conditions of temj,era-
ture, &c.

                                   On Kreatinin*.
 Repeated Observations have confirmed the Existence of Reducing             Agents
                            in Normal Human Urine.
    It  was probably owing to the impossibility         of accounting otherwise
 for   the reducing action which normal urine            invariably exerts upon
 cupric   oxide   in boiling   alkaline  solutions,  that  physiological chemists
 were led to assert that dextrose is present in the urine of healthy men.
    In a paper published in the Medico-Chirurgical                       Society's
 '                 '
   Transactions      (vol. 63,  p. 222),   Dr.  F. W.   Pavy,   F.R.S.,  writes as
 follows : — "  The reducing action before the addition of acetate of lead
 is due partly to uric acid and partly to the small amount of sugar
 naturally present in urine. It is doubtful if there is any other body
 worthy of consideration to exert any sensible reducing effect."              And
 Dr. Pavy finds that one-fourth of the total reduction of copper oxide
 by normal urine is due to uric acid.          This result Dr. Pavy arrived at
 by estimating the cupric oxide reduction of the urine before and after
 precipitation by lead acetate, which removes from solution the uric
 acid, but not the other reducing agent to which three-fourths of the
 total reducing effect must be ascribed, and which Dr. Pavy con
cludes is sugar.      Briicke's views on this subject are too well known to
need comment.
    Amongst the known substances other than glucose, which reduce
potassium picrate to picramate in boiling alkaline sdlutions, are- —
    (1.) Potassium ferrocyanide, a salt which is not likely to be found
in urine, since it is devoid of medicinal properties, and is therefore
not likely to be administered.
    (2.) Sulphides of the alkali metals.            I  have shown (' Chemical
 News,' vol. 47, 1883, p. 87) that in boiling dilute solutions of potassium
 hydrate, albumen yields potassium tetrathionate, and not potassium
 sulphide, and as potassium tetrathionato does not reduce potassium
 picrate in boiling dilute solutions of potassium hydrate, and as a very
 dilute solution of potassium hydrate is employed in the quantitative
estimation of glucose by picric acid, viz., 30 minims of the liquor
 potasses of the British Pharmacopoeia, diluted to 4 drachms, there is no
 possibility of reduction of picric acid by alkaline sulphides, formed by
the action of potassium hydrate upon unoxidised sulphur compounds
in the urine at the boiling temperature.
    Kreatinin has been suggested by Dr. Oliver as the reducing agent
of normal urine (' Bedside Urinary Testing ') .                  The sample of
kreatinin which he examined was sold by Messrs. Hopkin and
Williams.      I have examined a portion of this sample, and found that
it was very deficient in reducing power. Allowing most liberally for
its presence in the nrine, only about one-twentieth of the total reduc
tion of cupric oxide effected by that secretion in its normal condition
could be accounted for by this substance.

   The reducing action of kreatinin upon cupric oxide in boiling solu
tions containing caustic alkali has been long known to German
chemists. Thus, Riihne draws attention to this fact at page 505 of
his ' Lehrbuch der Physiologischon Chemie.'
   As regards the amount of cupric oxide reduction usually attributed
to kreatinin by German physiological chemists,                      I
                                                     may quote a recent
paper by   Professor E. Salkowski,  in the '
                                             Centralblatt fur die Medi-
cinischen Wissenschaften,' March, 1886, in which the reduction due
to uric acid and kreatinin combined is estimated as varying from
one-fifth to one-sixth of the total cupric oxide reduction effected by
normal urine, the remainder being attributed to other substances, and
probably to compounds of glycuronic acid (Glykuronsauroverbin-
dungen).
The Reducing Agent of Normal Urine is disintegrated     prolonged             bij
        Boiling with Dilute Solution Potassium Hydrate.
                                                     of
   Whilst examining the reactions of the reducing agent in normal
urine, I  found that by prolonged boiling with dilute potassium
hydrate solution, about three-fourths of the copper oxide reducing
power of the urine       lost, the remaining one-fourth being due to
                          is
survival of the uric acid. The urine which had been subjected to
this treatment did not reduce picric acid at all, for uric acid has no
reducing action upon picric acid in boiling alkaline solutions.
   The reducing agent of normal urine       therefore disintegrated by
                                                       is
prolonged ebullition with potassium hydrate. On comparing the beha
viour of solutions of glucose in the same circumstances,      have since     I
found that such solutions lose their reducing action upon cupric oxide
with far greater rapidity than the reducing agent of normal urine.
   In the 'British Medical Journal,' (March 17th, 1883), will be
found a table of results of some determinations of the reducing
action of normal urines upon picric acid and cupric oxide respectively,

hydrate solution upon the reducing agent of normal urine          visible             is

of glucose.
   Summing up all the evidence, there is no doubt that a reducing
agent is present as a normal constituent of the urine of healthy men,
and that it confers upon normal urine the property of reducing cupric
oxide to the same extent as if it held in solution (on the average)
6 grains of glucose in every 10 fluid ounces of urine, or 1'34 grams
per litre. But, considering the impossibility of causing alcoholic fer
mentation to take place in solntions of this reducing agent, and its
property of reducing picric acid to some extent in presence of
potassium hydrate at the ordinary temperature, its identity vrith
glucose appears to be very doubtful.          Further doubt is thrown upon
this identity by the fact that if a solution of mercuric chloride be added
to normal urine and afterwards potassium hydrate, the yellowish pre
cipitate which forms, becomes grey in a few minutes by reduction at
the ordinary temperature, whereas glucose does not effect reduction
of mercuric oxide in presence of potassium hydrate without applica
tion of heat in less than one hour.
       Endeavours    to Isolate  the Reducing  Agent of Normal Urine.
   Having examined qualitatively the reactions of the reducing agent
of normal urine, and having found reasons to doubt its identity with
diabetic sugar, I next proceeded to employ various precipitants with
a view to its removal from the complex fluid in which it is dissolved.
   Normal lead acetate, basic lead acetate, baryta-water, solution of
ammonia, alcohol, were all employed in turn, but the filtrates in each
case reduced picric acid as strongly as before precipitation, showing
that the precipitants employed had failed to remove the reducing
agent from solution.
   Finally 1 succeeded in removing the whole of the normal reducing
agent from urine by complete precipitation with strong aqueous solu
tion of mercuric chloride.
Previous Researches on       the  Action of Mercuric Chloride upon Normal
                                  Human Urine.
   It  has  long been known that an aqueous solution of mercuric
chloride produces in all specimens of normal urine a flocculent pre
cipitate, when added in sufficient excess.            But the state of our
knowledge as to the nature of the substance or substances thus
precipitated is very unsatisfactory.
   Dr. John Greene, of Birmingham, published in the ' British
                   '
Medical Journal (May 10th, 1879) a research in which he describes
the isolation from this precipitate, produced by mercuric chloride in
normal urine, of a white flocculent albumen-like substance, precipi-

     The main object of Dr. Greene's research was to prove that the
 precipitate produced by mercuric chloride in normal urine contains a
 large proportion of organic nitrogen, and that corrections might be
 made, in the determination of the urea in urine by the hypobromite
 method, by deducting so much nitrogen for every gram of mercury
 precipitate yielded by the original urine.
     As, however, Dr. Greene rejected everything in the precipitate by
 mercuric chloride in normal urine which is not also precipitated by
 lead acetate, he of course missed the normal reducing agent altogether,
and must have also considerably under-estimated the total nitrogen
 contained in tho mercury precipitate, for the reducing agent of normal
 urine is highly nitrogenous, as will presently appear.
     Maly (' Ann. Chem. Pharm.,' vol. 159, p. 279) describes a method
for obtaining kreatinin hydrochloride from the urine of man or the
horse by precipitation with mercuric chloride.         His method consists
in concentrating the urine to one-third of its original bulk, then pre
cipitating by lead acetate and filtering, whereby the uric acid and
Greene's substance are removed.        The filtrate is freed from lead bv
sodium carbonate or sulphuretted hydrogen, neutralised after a second
filtration by acetic acid or sodium carbonate, and then precipitated by
mercuric chloride. The precipitate is washed and then decomposed
by hydrogen sulphide under water, and the filtrate is decolourised by
animal charcoal and evaporated.      The residue, on being re-crystallised
once or twice from alcohol, yields pure kreatinin hydrochloride in hard
shining prisms (vide Watts's ' Dictionary,' Suppl. 2, p. 393).
    In spite of these researches, mercuric chloride has recently been
again recommended as a precipitant for albumen in urine, and the

precipitate produced by mercuric chloride in normal urine is of a very
complex nature.
    Reaction of Normal Human Urine with Stromj Solution of Mercuric
                    Chloride. — The Author's Itwnrche*.
    In all my experiments with     a view to separate the reducing agent
from normal urine, I     have employed a solution of mercuric chloride
in water, saturated at the temperature of the laboratory (16° C.).
    In my first experiments I filtered the urine immediately after
adding to it one-fourth of its volume of the cold saturated mercuric
chloride solution, and always found that the Nitrates still contained
the reducing substance in solution.
    I soon observed, however, that after separating the flocculent amor
phous precipitate first produced by mercuric chloride, the filtrate did
not long remain clear, but after about half an hour a second precipi
tate began to form, having a granular appearance, and continuing to
separate out for many days.         On filtering from time to time, and
examining the reducing action of the filtrate, it was found that the
reducing power progressively diminished as more and more of the
mercury salt separated out from the solution.           In short it soon
became evident that the reducing agent of normal urine may be com
pletely removed from that liquid by precipitation with mercuric chlo
ride.
    Although the complete precipitation of the reducing substance is
very slow if mercuric chloride be added alone, if we add to fresh un-
concentrated urine one-twentieth of its volume of a cold saturated
solution of sodium acetate, then one-fourth of its volume of cold
saturated solution of mercuric chloride, and filter immediately, the
filtrate deposits the whole of the normal reducing agent as mercury
salt in about forty-eight hours. The precipitation is known to be
complete when the filtrate from the second mercury precipitate re
mains clear, even ou the addition of more solution of sodium acetate
and mercuric chloride. It will then be found that the permanently
clear filtrate is without reducing action upon both potassium picrata
and cupric oxide in boiling alkaline solutions.
    The first precipitate produced by mercuric chloride in normal urine
is amorphous and flocculent, and has some resemblance to coagulated
albumen. Finding that it contained no reducing agent,          I have de
ferred the study of this precipitate for the present, but a cursory
examination of it showed that it contained uric acid, probably as mer
curic urate, besides the substance described by Dr. Greene, which is
precipitated by lead acetate. When decomposed by hydrogen sulphide
under water, the filtrate from mercuric sulphide is acid in reaction,

contains much chlorine, hut no phosphoric acid, and yields a gummy
mass on evaporation. It exerts no reducing action either upon cupric
oxide or potassium picrate in boiling alkaline solutions.
   Satisfied, therefore, that the granular precipitate which gradually
separated out from the filtrate from the above amorphous substance
contains the whole of the normal reducing agent of urine,             I confined
myself to the examination of that compound.

                                      Urine.
   I  have described this      precipitate as granular, and it certainly
appears upon superficial observation to be a crystalline substance, as
indeed might be expected from its gradual formation, but microscopic
examination reveals some curious facts in connexion with it.
   Examined under a quarter-inch object glass, the substanco is at
once seen to be perfectly homogeneous, and often has the appear
ance of minute crystals united together in stellate groups ; but
under a one-sixteenth inch object glass these stellate groups are
seen to be composed of a number of very minute and perfectly
spherical masses. I have watched the growth of these spherules
from a minute point to a little globe resembling an oil-globule. The

 mode of formation of this compound        appeared   to me bo remarkable
 that  I have prevailed upon my friend     Mr. Herbert Jackson to execute
 some microphotographs of the spherical mercury salt of the reducing
 base of urine.
    This spherical mercury salt is very sparingly soluble in cold water.
 When recently precipitated it dissolves with great ease in hydro
 chloric acid, but is insoluble or nearly so in acetic acid.
   Chemical Reactions and Decompositions of the Spherical Mercury Salt.
    Aqueous solution of ammonia does not blacken the spherical com
 pound, but if the Rait be thrown into boiling water, the sediment
 which remains undissolved is immediately blackened by ammonia-
 water, so that a portion of the mercury in this compound is reduced
 to the mercnrous condition by contact with water at 100° C. There
 fore, the spherical mercury salt must be washed with cold water,
 and must be dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid, in order to avoid this
 decomposition.
    Moistened with solution of potassium hydrate at the ordinary tem
 perature, the compound gradually becomes black by reduction, a
 compound ammonia escaping at the same time in abundance.
    Suspended in cold water and treated with hydrogen sulphide, the
 compound first becomes yellow-and finally black (mercuric mercury),
 and if the stream of gas be continued, nothing remains undissolved
 but mercuric sulphide. The solution is acid in reaction, and reduces
 both potassium picrate and cupric oxide in presence of potassium
 hydrate at the boiling temperature (hydrochloride of the reducing
base).
    Having convinced myself that the spherical compound is a definite
substance, I proceeded to ascertain the weight of it which is yielded
 by a known volume of urine, and to subject the salt to analysis with
a view to ascertain its composition.
    Whilst determining the quantity of the spherical compound obtained
by precipitation from known volumes of urine,        I was of course accu
mulating a store    of material  from  which to prepare large quantities of
the reducing base itself for subsequent examination. The method
         I
which adopted was as follows : —
    A quantity of fresh human urine is examined for albumen and sugar,
and, if found normal, its volume is exactly noted. The reaction to
litmus is then ascertained, and also the amount of reduction of picric
acid (or cupric oxide) which it is capable of effecting.         Next the
specific gravity  of  the specimen    is observed, after which I add to it
one-twentieth of its volume of a cold saturated solution of sodium
acetate, and from one-third to one-fourth of its volume of cold satu
rated mercuric chloride solution. There is no need to concentrate
the urine by evaporation.           The mixture is now immediately

filtered to separate the flocculent amorphous mercury precipitate, and
the filtrate is received into a large glass vessel capable of holding about
60 litres.      It is better not to operate with more than a litre of urine
at a time, because       if    a larger volume be taken there is risk of forma
tion of spherical mercury salt before the filtration is complete, and of
its retention upon the filter. But the mercuric chloride acts so effec
tually in preventing putrefaction that sample after sample may be
treated as above directed, and filtered into the same receptacle, in
which the spherical compound accumulates and awaits the convenience
of the operator.         When a sufficient quantity has accumulated, it is
thrown upon a filter, washed with cold distilled water till the wash
ings are only slightly troubled by silver nitrate, and the washed com
pound is then dried over sulphuric acid i» vacuo and weighed.
    The following tables will give an idea of the scale upon which I
have operated, and will also show how the weight of mercury salt
obtained is proportional to the amount of reduction exerted by the
specimens examined           : —

504                        Mr. G. S. Johnson.
    The total volume operated on (Table I) was thus 34,640 c.c. The
mean specific gravity was 1-020, and the mean reduction of picric acid
(expressed in terms of glucose) was equivalent to 0-67 grain of glucose
per fluid ounce.
    The spherical mercury salt obtained from the above urine, after
being washed with cold water and dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid,
weighed 198 grams.      This is at the rate of 5 7 grams of the spherical
compound to each litre of urine.
    The mean specific gravity at 16° C. of the above samples (Table II)
of normal human urine is 1-022, and the mean reduction of picric
 acid is equivalent to that which would be effected by a solution con-
taining 0 86 grain of glucose per fluid ounce.
    The washed and dried spherical mercury salt from the above
40,625 c.c. of normal urine weighed 293"13 grams, which is equivalent
to 7"19 grams per 1 litre of urine.
    It is apparent from the above tables that the weight of mercury
 salt obtained from an equal volume of urine is proportional to the
amount of reduction effected by the secretion, and that both have a
tendency to increase with the specific gravity of the latter.
    The following observations made upon my own urine during the
past winter, illustrate some interesting points in connexion with the
iprecipitation of normal urine by mercuric chloride :—
    My weight at the time of the experiment was 70-08 kilos.     I was in
•good health, in active work both mental and bodily, and consuming an
ordinary mixed diet.     All the samples had the normal acid reaction to
litmus, and were free from albumen and sugar.
    The total urine of each twenty-four hours, having been measured,
was mixed with a cold saturated solution of sodic acetate, and then
precipitated with one-fourth of its volume of cold saturated solution
of mercuric chloride. Both first and second precipitates were collected
on filters previously counterpoised, washed with cold water, dried to
vacuo over H2S04, and weighed.
     The total volume of urine during the six days amounted to
8930 c.c.

    Hence it appears that the mercury salt of the reducing base is far
 more constant in quantity than the amorphous mercury-compounds
 first precipitated. Also in my case the average weight of kreatinin
passed in twenty-four hours amounted to 1- 77 grams, or 25/1000000
of the body-weight.
                Analysis of the Spherical Mercury Salt from Urine.
    As precipitated from urine, the spherical mercury salt has a fawn
colour, due to enclosure of urinary colouring- matter.                 It was there
fore deemed advisable to re -precipitate the compound in order to obtain
it pure for analysis.        With this object in view, the thoroughly washed
compound is suspended in water and subjected to a stream of hydrogen
sulphide until completely decomposed.              The deep yellow filtrate from
the mercuric sulphide is digested for some days with purified animal
charcoal (which must be quite free from lime salts), and is then mixed
with solutions of sodium acetate and mereuric chloride. A very pure
compound is obtained, if the decolourised solution is largely diluted
before adding the mercuric chloride, in which case any precipitate
which forms at once may be separated by filtration, after which tho
filtrate gradually deposits the pure spherical compound in a colourless
condition.        Having been washed with cold water and dried in vaouu
over sulphuric acid, tho pure mercury salt was analysed with the
following results: —

   The nitrogen     was   estimated   in this compound and in all the
analyses recorded in this research by a modification of Dumas' method.
The substance to be analysed is introduced in a boat behind the copper
oxide, instead of being mixed with the latter. "By this means the
copper oxide can be ignited strongly in a stream of carbon dioxide,
before adjusting the measuring tube for the nitrogen.              Residual
carbon left in the boat at the end of the combustion is burnt off by
oxygen generated by heating potassium chlorate in a second boat
placed behind that which contains the substance to be analysed.
   The following results were obtained : —
   (a.) 0-7728 gram of Hg salt gave 44-83 c.c. of nitrogen, measured
          at 0" 0. and 760 mm. P., equivalent to 0 0560385 gram of N.
        Hence the Hg salt contains 7"25 per cent, nitrogen.
   (6.) 0-6228 gram Hg salt gave 36 29 c.c. of nitrogen, measured at
          0° C. and 760 mm., equivalent to 0-0453625 gram of         N.
        Hence the Hg salt contains 7 28 per cent. of N.
   The mercury was determined in two ways : 1st, by dissolving the
Hg salt in HC1 and precipitating the solution by H2S ; and 2ndly,
by suspending the Hg salt in water and decomposing by H2S. The
close concordance between the results proves how very completely the
mercury salt may be decomposed by hydrogen sulphide under water,
   (a.) 1-0882 gram of Hg salt dissolved in boiling HC1 gave by pre
           cipitation with H2S 0-7868 gram of HgS, equivalent to
           0-67827 gram of metallic mercury.
        Hence the salt contains 62-33 per cent. of     Hg.
   (6.) 0-8232 gram of Hg salt, suspended in water and decomposed
           by H2S, gave 0-5996 gram HgS, equivalent to 0-5169 gram
           of mercury.
        Hence the salt contains 62-79 per cent. of Hg.
   The chlorine was determined (1) by decomposing the Hg salt under
water with H3S and precipitating the filtrate with AgNOs ; (2) by
igniting the Hg salt with pure sodium carbonate, dissolving in water,
acidulating with HNO3, and precipitating with AgNO3.             The follow
ing results were obtained :    —
   (a.) 0-8070 gram of the Hg salt gave 0-5226 gram of silver chloride,
          equivalent to 0-1285 gram of chlorine, or 15-92 per cent,
          of CI.

     (6.) 0-8232 gram of Hg salt gave 0-5356 gram of AgCl, equivalent
            to 0-1325 gram of chlorine.
          The salt therefore contains 16-09 per cent, of chlorine.
     The empirical formula derived from the results of these analyses is
     The simplest rational formula is 4(C4HsHgN3O-HCl)-3HgCl2-2H20.

                                        of   Urine.
   In order to prepare the hydrochloride of the reducing base of urine,
the crude spherical mercury salt    suspended in water and completely
                                             is
decomposed by hydrogen sulphide.           The deep yellow acid filtrate
from the resulting mercuric sulphide      then decolourised as completely
                                                  is
as possible by very pure animal charcoal, and the nearly colourless
filtrate from the charcoal     left to evaporate spontaneously in vacuo
                                is
over sulphuric acid.     Large well-formed prisms with pyramidal apices
separate out,  which  only need washing with a little strong alcohol to
separate a small quantity of dark tarry matter, which usually adheres
to the bottom of the vessel.    They need no re-crystallisation.
    This ready crystallisation of the hydrochloride of the reducing base
is  doubtless due to the great purity of the mercury salt which                           is
attained by separating the amorphous compounds first precipitated
from the urine by mercuric chloride by immediate filtration.
I     have worked Maly's process (ride supra) exactly as he directs,

 508                         Mr. G. S. Johnson.
 and found that, notwithstanding the preliminary precipitation of the
 concentrated urine with lead acetate, a tarry mass is obtained after
 the H2S. treatment of the mercury precipitate, which stands much in
 need of the re-crystallisation from alcohol recommended by Maly,
 before it will yield distinct crystals. If, however, the precipitate firit
 formed by mercuric chloride in Maly's process be separated by imme
 diate filtration, and only the precipitate produced in the filtrate on
 standing be decomposed by H3S, all goes smoothly and well. The
 preliminary precipitation by lead acetate and the artificial concentra
 tion of the urine are quite useless.
    The crystals of the hydrochloride of the reducing base of urine,
 obtained as above, are quite permanent in the air, and their weight is
 unaltered by exposure to a temperature of 100o O.
    0'3708 gram of the crystals (not re-crystallised) gave 0-3512 gram
       of silver chloride, equivalent to 0-086881 gram of chlorine, or
       23 43 per cent. CI.
    The formula C4H7N3O-HC1 requires 23- 74 per cent. CI.
    The crystals are excessively soluble in water, and also to a great
extent in alcohol.
    Mixed in aqueous solution with mercuric chloride, there is no pre
cipitate, but on adding solution of sodium acetate, the spherical
mercury salt separates out.
    Mixed in aqueous solution with mercuric chloride and potassium
hydrate, there is first a whitish precipitate, which dissolves in excess
of the potassium hydrate, but the solution becomes turbid again after
a few seconds with formation of a yellowish precipitate, which imme
diately afterwards becomes black by spontaneous reduction.
    Mixed in aqueous solution with Nessler reagent, a bright yellow
precipitate separates out, which rapidly becomes black by spontaneous
reduction, a compound ammonia being evolved at the same time.
    When an alcoholic solution of the hydrochloride of the reducing
base of urine is mixed with excess of an alcoholic solution of platinic
chloride, a yellow crystalline platinum salt is immediately precipitated.
These crystals appear dendritic under the microscope.           They are
anhydrous, and permanent in the air.
    When dissolved in water, and spontaneously evaporated, a fine
orange-coloured prismatic platinum salt is formed, which loses water
at 100° C., becoming opaque and of a lemon-yellow tint         The same
orange-coloured prisms     are obtained by spontaneous evaporation of a
mixture of the hydrochloride of the reducing base with platinic
chloride in aqueous solution.
   The determination of the water of crystallisation in these orange-
coloured prisms shows that they contain (on the average) 5-32 per
cent, of
          H30.

      to 0-0132 gram of hydrogen, or 271 per cent. of H, and

      15-12 per cent. carbon, and left

      per cent, of C.
   The chlorine was determined by mixing the platinum salt with pure
caustic lime, igniting, dissolving in diluted nitric acid, filtering from
the spongy platinum (which is weighed), and precipitating the
chlorine in the filtrate as AgCl.

   The above being the formula of the anhydrous platinum salt of the
reducing base of urine, it appears that the formula of the orange-
coloured prisms obtained by spontaneous evaporation of the aqueous
solution, is 2(C4H7N3O.HCl).PtCI4.2H20.                       This formula requires
5-34 per cent. of water of crystallisation, whilst the mean of the three
determinations given above indicates the presence of 5*32 per cent.
Preparation and Properties of             the Reducing   Base — Kreatinin    of Urine.
   The reducing base or kreatinin of urine is obtained in the free state
by treating the concentrated aqueous solution of its hydrochloride
(prepared as above from the spherical mercury salt) with excess of
very pure hydrated lead oxide at the ordinary temperature.
   The crystallised hydrochloride should be dissolved in about fifteen
times its weight of cold water, and an excess of perfectly pure recently
precipitated lead hydrate added to the solution, which should be kept
stirred constantly for about twenty minutes at the ordinary tempera
ture. After the liquid has acquired a strongly alkaline reaction, it
will be found to filter clear through paper. The filtrate is perfectly
free from chlorine and colouring matter, and yields the urinary
kreatinin on spontaneous evaporation in vacuo over sulphuric acid in
the crystalline condition.             It is better not to dilute the filtrate by
adding the washings from the lead oxychloride to it, but these may
be evaporated separately by heat.*
   The same sample of the spherical mercury salt of the urinary
kreatinin may be made to yield three different substances according
to the treatment adopted in the separation of the kreatinin from it.
The following details of an experiment conducted upon the large
scale will best exemplify this statement.
   260 grams of the spherical mercury salt of the urinary kreatinin
   * The   lend hydrnto employed for liberating the reducing kreatinin of urine from
its hydrochloride    must be free from basic lead nitrate.       When this compound i¦
present, the alkaline filtrate, though free from chlorine, is found to hold in solution
both lead and the radicle of nitric acid l moreover, the lead cannot be removed from
solution by animal charcoal, evon at the boiling temperature, but must be separate 1
by hydrogen sulphide, after which the filtrate from the lead sulphide exhibit* an
acid reaction, and deposits crystals of kreatinin nitrate on evaporation.
   I  have  found  it best   to employ lead hydrate     precipitated from the acetate by
ammonia.

 was decomposed      by hydrogen sulphide in presenco of water, special
 care being taken to avoid too great a rise of temperature by constant
 agitation in a closed bottle during the action of the gas upon the
 precipitate.
    After the action was complete the solution was set aside for three
 days in a tall glass cylinder, to allow the mercuric sulphide to
 settle.   As much as possible of the clear and supernatant liquor
 was then decanted off from the precipitate, and set to evaporate in
 vacuo over sulphuric acid.       Hard anhydrous crystals of kreatinin
 hydrochloride   resulted.  After  being washed with a little cold alcohol,
 these crystals were dissolved in about fifteen times their weight of
 cold water, the solution was well stirred with pure lead hydrate,
 and filtered. The filtrate when evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric
 acid, deposited needle-shaped crystals of a base for which      I propose
 the name of efflorescent kreatinin, whose properties and composition
 will be described shortly. This efflorescent kreatinin, being obtained
 from the spherical mercury salt of urine as far as possible without
 any application of heat,   I believe to be the true natural kreatinin of
 urine.
    The washings from the lead oxychloride, &c., after the above treat
 ment were evaporated at 60° C. on a copper plate kept hot by steam.
 A number of anhydrous square tables were obtained on cooling; which
 when dissolved in cold water yielded an alkaline solution which
 deposited efflorescent kreatinin on evaporation in vacuo over sulphuric
acid.
    The third substance is obtained as follows : —
    The washings from the mercuric sulphide in the above experiment
 were concentrated over steam.      The concentrated liquor was diluted,
 decolourised by animal charcoal, and filtered. The filtrate was again
 concentrated over steam, and finally evaporated in vacuo over sul
 phuric acid. The resulting crystals of kreatinin hydrochloride did
not differ in outward appearance from those obtained from the solu
tion to which no heat had been applied ; but, when decomposed by
 pure lead hydrate after solution in fifteen parts of cold water — in
short, under conditions as nearly as possible identical with those
present in the case of the hydrochloride crystallised from cold
aqueoas solution — instead of efflorescent kreatinin, anhydrous square
or oblong tabular crystals are obtained, similar in form to the tabular
crystals resulting from the evaporation of an aqueous solution of the
efflorescent kreatinin of urine at 60° C., but more transparent than
the latter, and differing from them in that their cold aqueous solution
deposits anhydrous tabular crystals again on spontaneous evaporation,
instead of efflorescent crystals.
   This tabular anhydrous kreatinin, which re-crystallises unaltered
from its cold aqueous solution on evaporation in vacuo over sulphuric

acid,  I stall speak of in this paper as tabular kreatinin a. of urine,
whilst the tabular crystals which yield efflorescent kreatinin under
similar treatment will be alluded to as tabular kreatinin /3 of urine,
the term efflorescent kreatinin being reserved for the natural base.
   It will be apparent from the following details of experiments that
these three varieties of urinary kreatinin are convertible into one
another at the will of the operator.
   Suppose we start with efflorescent kreatinin.    This substance crys
tallises in splendid transparent square prisms, often upwards of an
inch in length, which, however, begin to lose their transparency
when freed from extraneous moisture within half an hour in summer
weather, and very rapidly even in winter upon mere exposure to
common air. After complete efflorescence the crystals retain their
•original form without any tendency to crumble, and then resemble
porcelain in appearance.
   Now if these effloresced crystals are re-dissolved in the smallest
possible quantity of cold water, the solution deposits efflorescent
kreatinin again on evaporation in vacuo over sulphuric acid.
   But if the effloresced kreatinin be dissolved in water at 60° C., and
the evaporation be continued at that temperature till the crystallising
point is reached, the crystals deposited on cooling are tabular kreatinin
/3 of urine, anhydrous crystals, which yield efflorescent   kreatinin on
spontaneous evaporation of their cold aqueous solution over sulphuric
acid.    And if the effloresced kreatinin be dissolved in water at
100° C., the solution, evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid (in case
the water present is in sufficient quantity to hold all the kreatinin
in solution at the ordinary temperature), deposits crystals of tabular
kreatinin a. of urine, which re-crystallises unchanged from cold aqueous
solution.
   Again, if tabular kreatinin a of urine be dissolved in a larger
volume of water at 60° C. than is necessary to hold it in solution at
the ordinary temperature, and if the solution be kept at 60° C. for
one hour, then allowed to cool and evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric
acid, efflorescent kreatinin crystallises out.
                       Analysis of Urinary Kreatinin.
   The determination of the water of crystallisation in the efflorescent
kreatinin is not easy, on account of the rapidity of the efflorescence
when the crystals are quite free from extraneous moisture.
   The results of analysis, however, prove that the composition of the
crystals is represented by the formula GiHjNsO^H3O.
   The mean of the two determinations gives 23-87 per cent. H<,0,
whilst the formula C4H7N3O.2H3O requires 24-17 per cent.

   When a weighed quantity of the effloresced kreatinin of urine is
dissolved in boiling water, and the solution evaporated to dryness in
vacuo over sulphuric acid, the weight of tabular kreatinin a obtained
is identical with that of the effloresced kreatinin taken.
   This fact indicates that the percentage composition of the two'
bodies is identical ; a view which is fully supported by the results of
their ultimate analysis.

    Supported by the analyses of mercury and platinum salts, and of
the hydrochloride, these analyses leave no doubt that the empirical
formula of the reducing base of urine is C4H7N3O.
                     Gold Salt of the Kreatinin of Urine.
    Both the tabular kreatinin a. of urine and the efflorescent kreatinin
of urine, when dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid and mixed with
a concentrated aqueous solution of auric chloride, yield large thin
plates of kreatinin-auric chloride. This salt is remarkably stable.
The crystals are permanent in the air, possess a brilliant golden-
yellow lustre, and undergo no change at 100° C., except a temporary
darkening of colour, which disappears again on cooling.
    The analysis of this salt confirms the view that the molecular
weight of the reducing kreatinin of urine is 113.

Determination of   the  Solubility in Water of the Efflorescent Kreatinin and
                      of Tabular Kreatinin x of Urine.
    Some solution of efflorescent kreatinin of urine, which was deposit
ing crystals over sulphuric acid at 14° C., was poured off from these
crystals into a tared dish, weighed, and evaporated to dryness in vacuo
over sulphuric acid.
    The residue was further dried at 100° C. and then weighed.
    4934 grams of the aqueous solution saturated at 14° C. left a
residue (effloresced K.) which dried at 100° C. weighed 0-329 gram.
    Therefore 4-605 grams of water at 14° C. held in solntion 0-32i*
gram of effloresced kreatinin, corresponding with 0-4338 gram of
efflorescent kreatinin (C4H7N30.2H30).
    Hence the efflorescent kreatinin (C4H7N3O.2H2O) requires 10-6 times
its weight of water at 14° C. for complete solution.

                               On Kreat-tnins,                            515
   And the effloresced kreatinin        (C4H7N30) requires 14 times its
weight of water for complete solution at 14° C.
   A very pure specimen of the tabular kreatinin at of urine was
dissolved to saturation in water kept at 40° C. The saturated solu
tion was then kept at 17° C. for 12 hours.                Crystals separated
out.
   3-9828 grams of the resulting solution saturated at 17° C. was
evaporated to dryness in vacuo over sulphuric acid.               The residue
weighed 0-3376 gram. Therefore 3"6452 grams of water at 17° C.
held in solution 0"3376 gram of the tabular kreatinin, or 1 gram of
tabular kreatinin a. of urine is soluble in 10-78 grams of water at
17° C.
   Allowing for the different temperatures, it appears, therefore, that
the solubility in water of the efflorescent kreatinin (C4H7N3O.2H.2O)
before efflorescence is practically    identical with that of the tabular
kreatinin a. of urine (C4H7N30).
   The solubility of kreatinin prepared from the kreatin of flesh is
given by Liebig as 1 part in 11 "5 parts of water at 16° C.
          Solubility of Tabular Kreatinin     a of Urine in Alcohol.
   A  fine specimen of the tabular kreatinin a. was digested with alcohol
of specific gravity 0-795 at its boiling point in a continuous extraction
apparatus for some hours. The hot alcoholic solution deposited a
number of dendritic crystals on cooling. The solution was left at the
ordinary temperature for 20 hours in a well-corked bottle.             10 c.c.
of the solution, whose temperature was 17° C., was then drawn off in
a pipette and evaporated to dryness over steam. The residue weighed
0-0220 gram. A second 10 c.c. left a residue weighing 0-0216 gram.
7-95 grams of absolute alcohol at 17° C. therefore dissolved 0-022
gram of the tabular kreatinin.
   Therefore 1 part by weight of the kreatinin dissolves in 362 parts
by weight of absolute alcohol at 17° C.
   The solubility of kreatinin prepared from the kreatin of flesh is
given by Liebig as 1 part in 102 parts of absolute alcohol at 16° C.
Determination    of the Weight of Cupric Oxide reduced by Efflorescent
    Kreatinin of Urine and by Tabular Kreatinin * of Urine in Boiling
    Alkaline Solutions.
   My object in making these determinations being to ascertain how
much of the reducing action of normal urine is to be ascribed to the
kreatinin which is present in that secretion,         I employed the same
method therein as     in  estimating the cupric oxide reduction effected
by the urine itself, viz., Pavy's ammoniacal cupric method.
   11-2 c.c. of a solution of the efflorescent kreatinin of urine, containing

516                          Mr. G. S.    J ohnson.
0-1346 gram of the anhydrous base (C^HyNlO) in 60 c.c. were required
for the complete reduction of 40 c.c. of Pavy's ammoniacal cupric
solution.
   Now 40 c.c. of Pavy's solution = 0-02 gram of glucose.
   And 1P2 c.c. of the kreatinin solution contain 0-0251           gram  of
C4H7NsO.
   Therefore 12-5 grams of the effloresced kreatinin are equivalent to
10 grams of glucose in reducing action upon cupric oxide.
   Again 0"5 gram of the tabular kreatinin a. of urine was dissolved in
250 c.c. of water.
   6 c.c. of this solution was required to decolourise 20 c.c. of Pavy's
ammoniacal cupric solution (= 0-01 gram of glucose). And 11"9 c.c.
was required for 40 c.c. of the cupric solution.
   Hence 12 grams of the tabular kreatinin a. of urine are equivalent to
10 grams of glucose in reducing action upon cupric oxide.
   Now                    2CH7NsO     : CfiHioOg : : 12 : 95.
                            = 226         = 180
   From which it appears that 2 mols. of the reducing kreatinin of
urine are abont equal to 1 mol. of glucose in reducing action upon
cupric oxide.
Reduction    of Cupric Oxide   by  Kreatinin from Kreatin of Flesh prepared
                              by  Liebig's Method.
   62 lbs. of fresh beef, treated by Liebig's process for the extraction
of the kreatin, gave some fine crystals of that substance.
   3"685 grams of the kreatin obtained in this way was converted into
kreatinin hydrochloride by the action of dry hydrogen chloride in
Liebig's drying tube.
   The resulting hydrochloride was dissolved in 24 parts of water as
recommended by Liebig, boiled, and treated with pure lead hydrate
added a little at a time. In short, Liebig's directions for preparing
kreatinin from the kreatin of flesh were followed as exactly as possible.
The kreatinin thus prepared was re-crystallised six times from the
smallest possible quantity of cold water by evaporation in vacuo over
sulphuric acid.
   Well-formed anhydrous tabular crystals resulted. In order to com
pare the cupric oxide reduction of this substance with that of the
natural kreatinin of urine, a solution was made containing 01 gram of
the substance in 100 c.c.
   27*5 c.c.  of this solution decolourised 30 c.c of Pavy's ammoniacal
     cupric solution (= 0-015 gram glucose).
   Hence 180 parts by weight of glucose are equivalent to 329 94 parts
      by weight of kreatinin.

                                On Krealinins.                          517
    Or  1 mol. of glucose is equal to 3 mols. of kreatinin from kreatin of
      flesh in reducing action upon cupric oxide.
    Whereas 1 mol. of glucose is equal to 2 mols. of the natural kreati
      nin of urine in cupric oxide reducing power.
    Bat the important practical deduction which I draw from the ahove
 data is this — that the natural kreatinin of urine is responsible for
 the bulk of the reducing action exerted by normal human urine, and
 further that, in my belief, the whole cupric oxide reduction effected
 by that secretion may be accounted for by uric acid and kreatinin.
    Taking 1500 c.c. (= 52-8 fluid ounces) as the average volume of
urine passed by a healthy man in the twenty-four hours, and 6 to
 7 grams per litre as the average weight of the spherical mercury salt
of kreatinin yielded by the normal secretion, then, as the spherical
mercury salt contains 20 per cent. of kreatinin (C4H7N3O), the weight
of anhydrous kreatinin passed in twenty-four hours by a healthy man
will vary between P8 and 2-1 grams. And as 12 grams of the reducing
kreatinin of urine are equivalent to 10 grams of glucose in reducing
action upon cupric oxide, it follows that the cupric oxide reduction
effected by the urinary kreatinin in twenty-four hours is equivalent
to that which would be produced by 1*5 to l-75 grams of glucose, i.e.,
by from 23 to 27 grains of glucose in 52-8 fluid ounces of urine.
   Accordingly cupric oxide is reduced by the kreatinin of normal
urine in the same degree as if the secretion contained from 0-43 to
0-51 grain of glucose in each fluid ounce.
    But the total cupric oxide reduction effected by normal human
urine is equivalent to from 0-6 to 0-8 grain of glncose per 1 fluid
ounce, and of this total reduction one-fourth has been shown by
Dr. Pavy to be due to uric acid. Therefore the total reduction is
accounted for by the conjoined action of the uric acid and kreatinin.
   I  can only attribute the little importance which has hitherto been
attached to the reducing action of urinary kreatinin, and the low
estimates which have been made thereof, to the fact that only one
substance having the formula C4H7N30 has hitherto been recognised
by physiological chemists, and that therefore the properties of the
kreatinin obtained by Liebig's process from kreatin of flesh have been
supposed to be identical with those of the natural kreatinin of urine.
   1 shall prove in Part     II of this paper that the properties of the
kreatinins obtained from the kreatin of urinary kreatinin itself, by
treating it according to Liebig's direction, are in many respects
different from those of the natural base.          It will be sufficient at
present   to emphasise   some   of the differences   in properties which  I
have observed      between the natural       kreatinin of urine and the
kreatinin described by Liebig.
   1st. As regards reducing action.

and have found differences in the reducing action given by the
products. But the specimen which agreed best with the description
given by Liebig was destitute of reducing action.
   Professor W. N. Hartley has compared the absorption spectrum of
this specimen with that of a specimen of tabular kreatinin a of urine
for me, and his results are published in an Appendix to this paper.
   2nd. The platinum salts differ.
                                                                     I
   In all the descriptions of " kreatinin platinic chloride " that have
found, the salt is described as anhydrous.      I have subjected the plati
num salt of urinary kreatinin to complete analysis, and find that it
contains 2 mols. of water of crystallisation.
   3rd. The solubilities in water and alcohol differ.
   The solubility in alcohol of kreatinin (Liebig) is 1 part in 102 parts
of alcohol at 16° C.
   The solubility in alcohol of tabular kreatinin a of urine is 1 part in
362 parts of alcohol at 17° C.
   Kreatinin (Liebig) [dissolves in 11-5 parts of water at 16° C.
   Tabular kreatinin a of urine dissolves in \0-18 parts of water at
17° C.
   It appears/ therefore, that the tabular kreatinin of urine is slightly
more soluble in water, and vastly less soluble in alcohol than the
artificial base described by Liebig.
   I  will conclude this part of my work by laying stress upon the
importance of the precipitation of kreatinin from urine as spherical
mercury salt, not only as a convenient method of obtaining the
natural base in a state of purity, but also as a means of estimating
with accuracy the quantity of kreatinin in a given volume of the
secretion ; and at the same time the amount of reduction exerted by
the natural base. In Part        II will be found an account of the bases
obtainable    from  the kreatin  of urinary kreatinin.

  On    the Kreatinins derived from   the Dehydration of Urinary Kreatin.
   When the kreatinin of urine is boiled in dilute aqueous solution in
proportion 1 : 1000 by weight of water, it is gradually converted into
kreatin, which may be crystallised out by concentrating at the boil
ing temperature.       If the first crop of kreatin be separated from the
mother-liquor, the latter, diluted largely and again concentrated,
yields a further crop of crystals, and this may be repeated as long as
any kreatin crystallises out.       The whole of the crystals thus obtained
are then dissolved together in boiling water, the solution kept boiling
with animal charcoal till colourless, filtered, and concentrated.        On
cooling the pure urinary kreatin crystallises out.

  Conversion of Urinary Kreatin into Kreatinin Hydrochloride by Liebig's
                                         Process.
     Weighed portions of the air-dried urinary kreatin were introduced
 into a counterpoised Liebig's drying tube, connected at one extremity
 with apparatus for the delivery of dry air or dry hydrogen chloride at
 will, and at the other extremity with a counterpoised bulb apparatus
 containing sulphuric acid.            In some experiments the kreatin was
 first dried at 100° C. in dry air, and then subjected to the action of
dry HC1 at 100° C. ; in others the crystals were at once acted on by
HC1, without previous removal of their water of crystallisation.                       The
 final products were found to have similar properties in all the ex
periments.         Dry air was, of course, kept passing in all cases at
100° C., until no more water was expelled, i.e., until the weight of
the sulphuric acid bulbs in front of the kreatin tube became constant.
    The following are some of the quantitative results : —

    The above results sufficiently prove that when urinary kreatin is
acted     upon by dry HC1 at 100° C., the change is expressed                      by the
equation C4H9N30„.H3O + HC1 = C^NgCHGl + 2H2O.

Comparison    between   Kreatinin Hydrochloride prepared by Liebig's Pro
   cess  from Urinary Kreatin and the Kreatinin Hydrochloride obtained
  from the Spherical Mercury Salt of Urine.
   When the contents of the tube, in which urinary kreatin has been
converted into kreatinin hydrochloride by dry HC1 at 100° C., are
dissolved in cold water, three times its weight of which is sufficient
for complete solution, there are obtained on evaporation in vacuo over
sulphuric acid transparent flattened prisms, which rapidly become
opaque on exposure to common         air by efflorescence.
   1 "26 gram of these crystals       (air-dried and weighed at once) lost
7-06    per cent. after 48 hours' exposure to common air at 15° C.
Being finally dried at 100° C.,they were found to have lost altogether
10-9 per cent.
   The formula C4H7N3O.HC1.H3O requires 11-04 per cent. H3O. In
this respect, kreatinin hydrochloride obtained by Liebig's process
from urinary kreatin, resembles the kreatinin hydrochloride obtained
from kreatinin of flesh by the same process.
   Thus 0-323 gram of air-dried transparent square plates of kreatin
hydrochloride, prepared by me from beef by Liebig's process, and
crystallised by spontaneous evaporation from cold aqueous solution,
lost 12-4 per cent. of their weight when dried at 100° C., which is
rather more than is required by the formula C^H^NgO. HC1.H30. The
occurrence of water of crystallisation in the crystals obtained by
spontaneous evaporation of cold aqueous solutions of kreatinin hydro
chloride obtained artificially        by Liebig's process from kreatin
(whether urinary or sarcous in its origin) is an important means of
distinguishing these artificial hydrochlorides from the natural hydro
chloride of urinary kreatinin, the crystals of which       I have invariably
found to be anhydrous, even when the utmost care is taken to avoid
heating their solution (vide Part I of this paper).
Description of   the Preparation of Kreatinins from the Kreatinin Hydro
                   chloride produced from Urinary Kreatin.
   The same process was adopted in liberating the kreatinin from the
artificial hydrochloride as in the case of the hydrochloride of the
kreatinin of urine itself.        The concentrated aqueous solution was
well stirred with excess of pure lead hydrate, at the ordinary tempe
rature, till the reaction to litmus became strongly alkaline.            The
liquid was then filtered and evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid.
In some cases this treatment produced efflorescent kreatinin, exactly
resembling in crystalline form and in composition the efflorescent
kreatinin of urine (C4H7N3O.2H2O) ; whilst in other cases anhydrous
tabular crystals were formed, which were found to be crystallo-

have been unable to ascertain the cause of the formation of these two
bodies in different experiments, but           I  shall show presently that they
are very easily convertible the one into the other.
   For the crystallographic examination of the kreatinin crystals pre
pared by me from urine and from the kreatin of urine,                   I  am indebted
to the kindness and patience of Mr.            L.  Fletcher   of   the   Mineralogical
Department of the British Museum. He has found that the tabular
crystals of kreatinin, both natural and artificial, are identical in their
angles with those measured by Kopp and Heintz.                      He has also made
for me (with the aid of Mr. H. A. Miers) what,                    I  suppose, are the
first measurements of the efflorescent kreatinin.                      Mr. Fletcher's
report is as follows :       —

      Platinum and Gold Salts of Kreatinins from Urinary Kreatin.
   When a solution of tabular kreatinin, prepared from urinary
kreatin by Liebig's process, and which has re-crystallised in the tabular
form from cold aqueous solution, is acidulated with hydrochloric
acid, mixed with aqueous solution of platinic chloride and evaporated
in vacuo over sulphuric acid, a crystalline platinum salt is formed.
The crystals are paler in colour than the platinum salt of the tabular
kreatinin of urine, and require nearly twice as much water to dissolve
them.      The salt is easily purified by washing away the excess of
platinic chloride from it with strong alcohol, and then re-crystallising
from watery solntion.
   Like the platinum salt of the kreatinin of urine, it contains two
molecules of water of crystallisation.
   0-162 gram of the salt became opaque at 100° C., losing 0-009 gram
of water.
   This corresponds with <v55 per cent.
   The formula 2{C4H7N3O.HCl}PtCl4.2H20 requires 5-34 per cent.

   Thus the platinum salt of the natural kreatinin is nearly twice as
soluble in water as that of the artificial base.
   Neither the efflorescent kreatinin of urine, nor the efflorescent
kreatinin from urinary kreatin form platinum salts of any definite
nature. After treatment with alcohol the crystalline matter which
remains upon spontaneous evaporation of mixed chlorides is found to
be a mixture of a little yellow granular       matter with transparent
colourless needles, probably the hydrochloride of the kreatinin.
   With auric chloride, however, the efflorescent kreatin, and also the
tabular anhydrous kreatinin from urinary kreatin, give fine gold salts,
having the formula C4H7N3O.HClvAuCls,          and crystallising in thin
yellow lustrous plates.
   The gold salt of the efflorescent kreatinin from kreatin is darker in

same composition,       as  shown from the following analysis     : —

        0-226 gram Au, equivalent to 43-461 per cent.

     The gold salts of natural kreatinins from urine may be readily
distinguished from those of artificial kreatinins obtained from the
urinary kreatin, by the action of ether, which decomposes the latter,
but has no action upon the former. When applied to the crystals of
 artificial kreatinin auric chloride, ether renders them opaque, dis
 solving out auric chloride and leaving the hydrochloride of the
 kreatinin.
     The crystals of gold salt of the natural kreatinin on the contrary
 remain unchanged under ether.
     Also, if ether be added to the alcoholic solution of the natural
 kreatinin in auric chloride, no change takes place, but it causes a
 precipitate of the kreatinin hydrochloride when added to the alcoholic
 solutions of the gold salts of the artificial kreatinins.

       5-0412 grams              0-4314 gram                 10-68 parts
     This agrees very closely with the solubility of natural tabular
  kreatinin in water, which requires 10-78 parts at 17° C.
     The solubility of the artificial tabular kreatinin in alcohol is,
  however, greater than that of the natural base. At 18-5° C., 324 parts
 of absolute alcohol dissolve 1 part by weight of tabular kreatinin a.
  from urinary kreatin, whereas the natural tabular kreatinin of urine
  requires 362 times its weight at 17° C.

   There is  no apparent difference between the crystals of (1) and (2),
nor any between those of (3) and (4). Yet, when the conditions of
solution and evaporation are kept as similar as possible, there is the
remarkable difference described in the products of re-crystallisation.
These four substances may be obtained as follows —                                        :
   (1.) Efflorescent kreatinin a     the product usually obtained after

the treatment of the kreatinin hydrochloride, prepared from urinary
kreatin, by Liebig' process, with pure lead hydrate at the ordinary
temperature. After        has effloresced, we may obtain from

   The weight of both these forms of crystals     always identical with        is
that of the effloresced kreatinin from which they were obtained.

never obtained by deposition on cooling from a hot solution.

  In this   case alternate crystallisation of tabular and efflorescent

                           repeated

 ultimately to assume the efflorescent form.
    By redissolving at 60° C, we may, at any time, cause the production
 of temporarily tabular kreatinin        which swings back to the per

                               ;
 produce tabular kreatinin a, which re-crystallises in the same form
 indefinitely from cold aqueous solution.
    It extremely remarkable, however, that the efflorescent kreatinin
       is
 is obtained by dissolving tabular kreatinin a in water at 60° C., and
 then evaporating spontaneously.
  Condition     of   the   Two Molecules of Water in               the Efflorescent   Kreatinin.
   Although this water behaves like the water of crystallisation in an
           salt in many respects, and although
efflorescent                                      does not appear in   it
 the gold salt formed by the efflorescent kreatinin, yet there are
 reasons for supposing that either the kreatinin in the efflorescent
 kreatinin differs from the tabular anhydrous kreatinin       or else that       ;
 the water     more closely combined with the kreatinin than ordinary
               is
 water of crystallisation.    For instance —
     1st. The solubility in water of the efflorescent kreatinin before
 efflorescence  the same as that of the anhydrous tabular kreatinin.
                is
     2nd. When re-crystallised by evaporation of its cold solution in vacuo
 after being dissolved at the boiling temperature, anhydrous tabular
 kreatinin  is produced.
     3rd. There     difficulty in forming a platinum salt of efflorescent
                     is
 kreatinin, none in forming the platinum salt of the tabular kreatinin.
     4th. When re- crystallised from boiling alcoholic solution, the
 efflorescent kreatinin forms needle-shaped crystals exactly resembling
 the original base, and entirely different from those which are produced
 in the alcoholic solution of the tabular kreatinin.

    Reducing    Action of a Specimen of Kreatinin from Kreatin    of Beef.
    The kreatin from which this kreatinin was prepared was extracted
by myself from beef (62 lbs.) by Liebig's process, and            I followed
Liiebig's directions as exactly as possible in converting it into krea
tinin.     The product, however, required 390"2 times its weight of
alcohol at 15° C. for solution, and its platinum salt contained water of
crystallisation, so that the base does not agree in properties with that
described by Liebig.
    The reducing action of this base was feebler than that of the arti
ficial kreatinin from the kreatin of urine. It required 3 mols. of this
kreatinin to reduce as much cupric oxide as 1 mol. of glucose.
    Thus, comparing the reducing action of kreatinins, we have —

    It  is evident, therefore, that the reducing action of the natural
kreatinin is much greater than any of the artificial kreatinins which I
have examined.

    In conclusion, think it is proved —
    (1st.) That the most active reducing agent in normal urine is the
urinary kreatinin.
    (2nd.) That the properties of kreatinins artificially prepared cannot
be considered as identical with those of the natural base ; and
    (3rd.) That there is strong presumptive evidence against the exist
ence of sugar in normal human urine.
    In this paper I have confined my attention to the differentiation of
kreatinins by the study of their physical properties, reactions, &c.         I
 hope shortly to study the substitution products of the various sub
 stances   I  have described, with a view to the construction of rational
 formulae, &c.
             Appendix by Professor W. N. HARTLEY, F.R.S.
              On the Absorption-spectrum    of a Base from Urine.
    The   base   which Mr. G. S. Johnson has separated from urine is
 regarded    as   isomeric with kreatinin artificially prepared by Liebig's
 process ; it has therefore been considered of interest to ascertain the
 character of its absorption-spectrum and more especially to compare
 the specific absorptive power of the two substances.         The method of
                                                 '
 examination was that described in the Proceedings of the Royal

 530                      Prof. W. N. Hartley.
                                                                 '
Society,' vol. 33, p. 1, with the modifications described in the Journal
of the Chemical Society,' vol. 47, pp. 685 — 757. The absorption-curves
have been drawn in the same way as those figured in the latter publi
cation.
   The two bodies, kreatinin and the base from urine, are compounds
with a very similar constitution, as is apparent from the two curves
accompanying this note. The absorption-bands are not caused by the
condensation of the carbon atoms as in aromatic derivatives of ben
zene, but by the condensation of the numerous oxygen and nitrogen
atoms, as is the case with uric acid. The absorption-bands, though
definite, have no great persistency, but the intensity of the total
actinic absorption is great, the band of kreatinin becoming visible
when 2 mm. of a solution were examined containing little more than
1 part of the substance    in 1000 of water. With the base from urine
2 mm. of solution show a band when the same quantity is contained
in 5000 of water.

        OBITUARY NOTICE OF FELLOW DECEASED.
    Henry Mangles Denham, son of the late Henry Denham, Esq., of
Sherborne, was born on the 28th of August, 1800.
    He commenced his career in the Royal Navy at a very early age,
and continued an almost uninterrupted course of service afloat in
the surveying branch of the profession for the long period of fifty
years.
    He was one of the most able and eminent of our nautical surveyors,
and was considered a high authority on all questions relating to
hydrographical engineering ; he was intimately connected with the
improvement of our great commercial ports, upon which his counsel
and advice were frequently sought, almost to the close of his life.
    Daring his early service, between the years 1810 and 1827, ho was
employed under that distinguished surveying officer, Captain Martin
White, on the surveys of the Channel Islands, and in the English and
Irish Channels. In the latter year he was appointed to the command
of the " Linnet," of ten guns, and, during the next seven years, he
conducted the surveys of the Bristol Channel and of the ports of
Liverpool and Milford.
    He was promoted to the rank of Commander in 1835 ; and his next
 service in command of the
                               " Lucifer " was on the
                                                        surveys of tho
 coast of Lancashire and Cumberland.      In 1845 he was appointed to
 the command of     the " Avon,"  and was sent to the West Coast of
 Africa on special surveying duties, which he conducted with so much
 ability, under very unfavourable circumstances, that he was rewarded
 with post rank in the following year — 1846.
    He then returned to England, and was again employed on hydro-
 graphical duties connected with tho home coasts.
    Early in the year 1852 Captain Denham was appointed to tho com
 mand of an expedition, consisting of H.M. ships " Herald " and
 " Torch," for exploration and survey in the Western Pacific, where
 he was actively employed until the close of the year 1860.
    During this protracted voyage the " Herald
                                                   " and
                                                           her consort
 added greatly to tho hydrographical knowledge of this extensive
 region. Various surveys were made on both the eastern and western
coasts of Australia, but the region of Captain Denham's special
 exploration was the Coral Sea, where he thoroughly examined and
 defined the route outside the Great Barrier Reefs, by Torres Strait,
 to tho Dutch possessions in the Java Sea, Singapore, and India;
 likewise among the various groups of islands eastward and northward
 of Australia, where tho salient points of New Caledonia, the New

Hebrides, Fiji and Tonga groups, with those of the Solomon and
Louisiade Archipelagos, were accurately determined, and numerous
doubtful dangers, long the cause of perplexity and anxiety to
the navigator, were either correctly placed or prayed to have no
existence.
   These examinations, and the improved conditions of the charts
which resulted from them, much facilitated the intercourse between
our great Australasian colonies, the islands of the Western Pacific,
and the coasts of China and Japan.
   During this voyage a considerable portion of the Fiji group was
also surveyed in detail, but the " Herald's

                                                   long absence from
England caused the completion of this work to be left, to other
hands.
   In  1861 the   " Herald " returned  to England by Torres Straits
and the Cape of Good Hope, arriving home in the month of May,
and this memorable voyage terminated Captain Denham's active
service afloat.
   During the short intervals of active service under the Admiralty,
Captain Denham executed several commissions connected with the
mercantile steam marine for the Lords Committee of the Privy Council
for Trade, and also with reference to harbour improvements at Liver
pool, Swansea, and Bideford.
   He received votes of thanks from various National and Local
Boards, and in 1834 was presented with the freedom of the borough
of Liverpool, and elected a member of the Literary and Philosophical
Society of that city.
   In 1839 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and, in 1841,
a brother of the Corporation of Trinity House, and a corresponding
member of the United States National Institute for the Promotion of
Science.
   Sir Heury Denham was knighted for his long and important
services   in the " Herald " on the Pacific Station, and especially for
the assistance   he rendered by his counsel and otherwise to the New
South Wales Goverument during the Russian War of 1854-55.
   He was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral in March, 18G4, of
Vice-Admiral in January, 1870, and Admiral in August, 1877.
   He died at his residence, Carlton Gardens, on July 3rd, 1887.

    Mr. John Arthur Phillips, F.G.S., F.C 8., and M.T.C.E., who died
at his home in London through a sudden attack of illness on the 5th
of January, 1887, was one of those devotees of scientific inquiry who
deserve to have a longer portion of life blest with that leisure which
is needed for research.
    He was born in the neighbourhood of Polgooth Mine, near St.
Austell, Cornwall, and appears to have taken as a boy a hereditary
 interest in mining and metallurgical matters, for his grandfather was
the manager of that noted old tin mine, and was quoted as " its very
intelligent director," by Mr. J. Hawkins, F.R.S., and as his chief
informant in 1791, on the phenomena of that remarkable locality
which was described by Mr. Hawkins in the first volume of the
'
  Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall' in 1818.
    Mr. Phillips' attention was drawn in early youth to observations
and experiments connected with electricity and the deposition of
metallic copper.     We may trace this in part to the influence of the
Polytechnic Society of Cornwall and its useful annual exhibitions at
Falmouth, as well as to the example and studies of the late Robert
Were Fox, F.R.S., one of its founders. Young Phillips soon becoming
desirous of a more thorough grounding in the metallurgical sciences,
entered as a student at the Ecole des Mines, passed its curriculum
with credit, and for a short time was intrusted with the charge of a
coal mine in the South of France.
    On returning to England Mr. Phillips was employed in taking a
practical part in the evaporation experiments on steam coals carried
out with a Cornish boiler at the Civil Engineers College at Putney,
for the Admiralty, the results of which were embodied in the well-
 known " Report."      This work was followed np by various papers on
chemical and metallurgical subjects, among which one of the most
                                  " Chemical Examination of the Metals
generally interesting was a
                             "
known to the Ancients          ('Journal of the Chemical Society,' 1852,
and 'Liebig's   Annalen,'   vol.  81).
    For many years past the rich silver-lead lodes of Pontgibaud in
the Auvergne have been worked by a partly English Company, and
Mr. Phillips was engaged for a considerable time, between 1855 and
1860, on behalf of the Messrs. Taylor of London, the managers, in
experimenting and erecting furnaces for the treatment of those ores.
He also for a few years acted      as a consulting mining engineer, taking
the opportunity   of  visiting   and   describing the singular gold-bearing
deposits of Nova Scotia, and the more important gold fields of Cali
                                                       '
fornia, his notes on which wei-e published in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society,' 1868.
   But it was not until his metallurgical aptitude was proved by suc
cess as a manager that Mr. Phillips obtained the leisure to take up
independent studies.       The profitable results which attended the co-
                                                                    d

operation of Mr. Claudet and himself in the conduct of a work at
Widnes, in which copper, silver, and gold were extracted from
" burnt " Spanish pyrites, placed him in a more favourable position.
    He became a Fellow of the Geologicul Society, and in the ' Quar
                 '
terly Journal of that Society, in the Philosophical Magazine,' as
                                               '
                     '             '
also in our own Proceedings          and elsewhere, he brought out a long
series of papers descriptive of results of chemical analysis and of
microscopic work as bearing on mining and geological subjects.
Among these some of the more notable were those on the phonolite
of the Wolf Rock, on the salt spring at Wheal Seton Copper Mine, on
the
       "               "
                         of Cornwall, in which he confirmed the views of
         greenstones
Mr. Allport as to the great extent to which rocks, originally augitic,
 have been converted into varieties of a horublende character.           This
he followed up by observations on chemical and mineralogical changes
 which have taken place in the igneous rocks of North Wales ; and in
a generally interesting paper in 1875 he showed reasons for calling in
 question the startling generalisation of Mr. Sorby as to the depth and
 pressure under which the granitic rocks had been formed.
     Numerous observations had before been made on the subject of the
 dark enclosures — whether rounded or angular — which so often occur
 in granite ; but Mr. Phillips seems to have been the first to apply
 (1879) a series of analyses and microscopical investigations to the
 question, although only confirming, after all, the old opinion that
 some of them are concretionary, others only fragments.
     Meanwhile, at various intervals several larger works had issued
 from his pen — an elementary, and then a fuller Manual of Metallurgy,
 a treatise on the Mining and Metallurgy of Gold and Silver, a very
 full compilation from well-selected sources on Ore Deposits ; and at
 the very last he was occupied in bringing out a new edition of his
 Metallurgy.
     Mr. Phillips, on coming from     Lancashire to reside in London, added
 greatly to his circle of friends     by his generous and outspoken cha
 racter, and his good common         sense and special knowledge will be
 seriously missed at the council       tables of Societies at which he was a
 frequent attendant.
                                                                 W. W. S.
     Joseph Baxendell was born in Manchester in 1815, and died at
  Southport on October 7th, 1887. Having to make his way in the
 world he was sent to sea at an early age. It is believed that the
  circumstances of his profession led him to recognise the immense
  importance of the two great branches              of observational science
  astronomy    and  meteorology,  and    to interest himself in their cultiva
  tion.
     With this object in view he was assiduous in supplementing the

                                       V
deficiencies of a limited education, and ultimately acquired a know
ledge of mathematics which was of much service to him in his
 scientific investigations.
    Mr. Baxendell was what this training made him. He became
 a thoughtful and retiring student of nature rather than one who cared
to take a prominent place in general scientific society. But he was
 much esteemed by those whose tastes were similar to his own, and a
 meeting of such students nsually took place once a fortnight during
 the winter months at the rooms of the Manchester Literary and
 Philosophical Society.     At first Mr. Baxendell was a regular attendant
 at these meetings, and ultimately he was chosen to be Secretary of the
 Society and Editor of its publications.      The duties of these offices
 were discharged by Mr. Baxendell in a very intelligent and con
 scientious manner.
    In astronomy Mr. Baxendell contributed observations of various
 kinds.    Of these perhaps the most important are embodied in his
  Catalogue of Variable Stars, a work which is highly esteemed by all
 astronomers.
    In  meteorology his contributions are of conspicuous importance,
 and in one branch of this science he may claim to be the pioneer.
    In 1871, after having discussed eleven years' observations of the
 Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford, he came to the conclusion that the
 forces which produce the movements of the earth's atmosphere are
 most energetic in those years when there are numerous spots on the
  surface of the sun. This conclusion was, like that of many similar
 pioneers, derived from perhaps a somewhat limited series of observa
 tions, but the sagacity of Mr. Baxendell is justified by the fact
 that many other men of science have since followed in his foot
 steps.
    Mr. Baxendell was likewise an independent discoverer of the fact
 that the faculffi which accompany sun-spots are thrown more behind
 them than before — the word behind having reference to the direction
 of rotation of the sun upon its axis.
    Again he entertained the opinion, which has since spread, that the
 behaviour of sun-spots is connected in an intimate manner with that
 of  meteoric matter round the sun.
    Mr. Baxendell foretold the long drought of 1868, and persuaded
 the city of Manchester to take precautionary measures which had
the effect of mitigating the inconvenience arising from want of
 water.
    He was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, a correspond
 ing member of the Royal Society of Konigsherg, of the Scientific and
 Literary Academy of Palermo, and of the National Observatories of
 France, Germany, and Italy.
    He held for many years the office of Astronomer to the Manchester
                                                                   e

time of his death.
                                                                  B. S.
    Sie George Burrows, who died December 12th, 1887, was born in
1801 in Bloomsbury Square. His father, Dr. George Man Burrows, a
member of a family of Kentish yeomen, who had lived for at least
two centuries at Chalk, near Gravesend, was at that time a general
practitioner, and one of the most energetic.      His early education was
at a school of good renown at Ealing, kept by Dr. Nicholas ; and
among his teachers was Professor Huxley's father, to whose lessons
he ascribed the love of mathematics which led to much of his success
in later life. In 1819 and 1820, being destined for the medical pro
fession, he attended Mr. Abernethy's lectures and dissected at St. Bar
tholomew's Hospital, and attended the lectures of Brande and Faraday
at the Royal Institution.     In 1821 his father determined to send him
to Ediuburgh, that he might there take his doctor's degree, and the
day for his leaving London was fixed ; but, on the urgent advice of
Dr. Latham, who pointed out the far greater value of an English
degree to one who was to practise in London, the plan was changed,
and he went to Cambridge and entered at Caius College.
    There he worked hard, did well in the annual college examinations,
was active in athletics, a good rower and cricketer, but in social life
was deemed quiet and reserved.          In 1825 he took his B.A. degree,
passing as tenth wrangler, and was soon after elected a Fellow of his
 College. During his undergraduate time he had been appointed to a
 Tancred Studentship, which involved the necessity of his taking the
 M.B. within the year after the B.A. ; but he obtained some respite
 from this rule, took pupils, was a junior mathematical lecturer,
 studied what he could of medjcine with the University professors, and
 passed the M.B. examination at some time in 1826.         Soon after this
 he returned to St. Bartholomew's, was for twelve months one of
 Lawrence's dressers, and was a constant- worker with Latham and
 Watson.      Thus he went on till, having a good opportunity of travel
 ling, he visited  and studied at the Universities of Paris and Pavia and
 some of those in Germany.         In 1829 he obtained at Cambridge a
 licence to practise, and was admitted an inceptor candidate at the
 College of Physicians.     In 1831 he took his M.D., and was appointed
 with Dr. Roupell to the Lecturership on Forensic Medicine, then first
 instituted at St. Bartholomew's. In 1832 he was admitted a Fellow of
 the College of Physicians, and was put in charge of wards prepared
 for cholera patients in the epidemic of that year, the first time of its
  occurrence in England. In 1834 he was appointed the first Assistant-
  Physician, and took charge of medical out-patients, who were then,
  for the first time, dealt with as a separate class.

                                   ¦vii
    From this time onwards Sir George Burrows's career was one of
constantly increasing success and professional distinction.      It may be
indicated by the offices  to which he was appointed.
    At the College of Physicians ho was Gulstonian Lecturer in
1834; Croonian in 1835 and 1836; Lumleian in 1843 and 1844;
Censor in 1839-40—43 and -46 ; Councillor for five periods of three
years between 1838 and 1870 ; President from 1871 to 1875.          In the
General Medical Council he represented the College, and was one of
the Treasurers from 1860 to 1863, and was President from 1864 to
1869.
    In the Hospital    he became in 1834 sole Lecturer on Forensic
Medicine,    in  1836 joint Lecturer on Medicine with Dr. Latham,
in 1841 sole Lecturer and full Physician, —appointments which he
held till 1863, when, on his retirement, he was elected Consulting
Physician.
    In 1870 he was appointed Physician-Extraordinary to the Queen ;
in 1873, Physician-in-Ordinary.         In 1874 he was made a Baronet.
    He was President of the Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1869-71 ;
President of the British Medical Association in 1862 ; was elected
a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1847, and Honorary LL.D. of Cam
bridge and D.C.L. of Oxford, a Member of the Senate of the
University of London, and an Honorary Fellow of Caius College,
Cambridge.       He was a very active member, as his father had been,
of the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical
Men, and was for many years its President, as he was also of the
British Medical Benevolent Fund.
    This brief and swift recital of the appointments which Sir George
Burrows filled may tell the general character of his professional
life, and may be sufficient evidence of the esteem with which he was
always regarded, and of the assurance that was felt that, whatever
duties were assigned to him, he would do them well. All the high
offices, all the honours conferred on him, seemed to come quite natu
rally and of course ; he never asked for one, or did anything on purpose
to obtain one ; bis having them excited neither jealousy nor surprise ;
and herein may be at once the explanation and the chief lesson of
his life.     He had excellent mental power.          He showed it in his
University career,    and   always  afterwards   ; but that which was yet
more admirable and characteristic was his steadfast, resolute use of
his power straight to the work he had to do, More enthusiasm or
more enterprise might have made him a more impressive or more
popular teacher, might have made him more keen in research, more
successful in acquiring new knowledge ; but they might not have
added to the general utility or the good influence of the long life
which he spent in learning and teaching what seemed directly useful,
in treating disease in the methods generally regarded as the best, and

                                         viii
   in discussing all manner of questions relating to his profession in
   senates, councils, and committees.
      Sir George Burrows was not a frequent writer on medical
   subjects.   The only book he wrote was ' On the Disorders of the
    Cerebral Circulation,' 8vo., 1846. The substance of it had been given
   in the Lumleian Lectures at the College of Physicians in 1843 and
    1844, and its chief value was in the evidence which it gave of the
   error of the belief, then generally held, that the cranium being a
   complete case of bone, completely filled by the brain and its
   membranes, and excluding from them all atmospheric pressure, the
   quantity of blood circulating in the brain cannot be materially
   increased or diminished by posture, bleeding, changes in the heart or
   breathing, or by any such means.       The belief thus held was not only
   general, but was influential in the treatment of disease, leading some
   to hold that, so long as the skull was entire, no abstraction of blood,
    by any manner of bleeding, could have any effect on the blood-vessels
   of the brain, so as to lessen the absolute quantity of blood contained
   within them.
      In opposition to this, Sir George Burrows showed, in careful expe
   riments, testing those of Dr. Kellie on which chiefly the belief had
   rested, that the quantity of blood in the brain is materially altered
  by bleeding largely, and by posture and by suffocation ; and that,
  admitting that the contents of the cranium must be always nearly
  the same, the variations in the blood may be balanced by those of the
  cerebro-spinal fluid.
      As one reads this book one cannot but regret that he did not give
 himself more frequently to original research, for it is clear, critical,
 and definite, and it greatly helped to the correction of serious
 errors. But he was not fond of research ; he preferred the daily
 business of practical life, and in it the use of the best knowledge
 he could gain from others' and his own attentive observation.
 The only other essays that he published were two papers in the
    Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,' one "A Case of Extensive Carci
 '
noma in the Lungs," in vol. 27, the other on " Tubercular Pericar
 ditis," in vol. 30, and the articles on measles, scarlet fever, and
                                 '
haemorrbage in Tweedie's           Library of Medicine.' Besides these he
published     some   clinical lectures  in the ' Medical Gazette ; ' and his
first lecture on Forensic Medicine, which was also separately printed,
is in the ' London Medical and Surgical Journal ' for February 4th,
1832.
     From all this   I  think it may justly be said that that which     most
marked Sir George Burrows's mental character, and contributed           most
to his professional success and to his influence and utility, was        that,
having a strong will and a strong, clear intellect, he applied          them
steadfastly to the plain daily duties of his life.
                                                                     J. P.

    Astlet Cooper Key     was the second son of   Mr. Charles Aston Key,
 Sargeon-in-Ordinaiy to H.R.H. the late Prince Consort, and was
 born in the year 1821 ; he was educated at the Royal Naval College
 at Portsmouth, and from his boyhood he manifested a scientific bent
 of mind, which he cultivated and followed up in after life, so far as
 the duties of a most active and unremitting professional career
 afforded him the leisure to do so.
    At the Naval College he gained the prize which carried with it a
 Lieutenant's commission, and he was consequently promoted to that
 rank as soon as he became eligible in point of age.
    In 1843 he was appointed to the " Gorgon," Captain, afterwards
 Sir Charles, Hotham, and served in her on the South-east Coast"
of America ; he was the junior Lieutenant of this ship in 1844
when, during a severe pampero, she was driven from her anchors at
Monte Video, and cast upon the beach ; when the waters had sub
sided, which during this storm had risen 20 feet above the usual sea-
level, the " Gorgon " was left literally on the dry land, from which
very few, save her gifted Captain — who never doubted but that she
must float again — believed that she would ever be moved ; Mr. Key
was among those few, and by his zeal and untiring exertions added in
no small degree to the successful result. After many months of per
severing efforts, under great difficulties and undiscouraged by frequent
failure, the " Gorgon," by the united exertions of the English squadron
ia these waters, was again, uninjured, upon her proper element.
    The writer of this notice was present, and well remembers the jokes
and jeers of the foreign ships of war at her expense ; the French
Admiral remarking " that no one but a pig-headed Englishman would
have persevered in such a hopeless task." He was the first, however,
in his flag-ship to give the " Gorgon " three hearty cheers as she
steamed round the squadron after her remarkable release.
    Mr. Key wrote a narrative of the means employed in this most
successful operation entitled, " The Recovery of the 1 Gorgon,' which
                                                                 "
added much to his professional reputation. In the following year
              " Gorgon " took part in the combined attack, by the
C1845) the
English and French squadrons on the forts and forces of General
Rosas, President of Buenos Ayres, at Obligado, in the Parana.
   Captain Hotham, who commanded            the English squadron,   gave
Mr. Key the command of an armed brig (the " Fanny ") on this ex
pedition, and in her he was present at the capture of the forts and
during the subsequent operations which were undertaken with the
view of opening the upper waters of the River Plate, and establishing
commercial intercourse with Paraguay. These operations were con
tinued until the close of the year 1846; and for his share in them

                                       X
  Mr. Key was promoted to the rank of Commander on the day of the
  action at Obligado — viz., the 18th of November, 1845.
     Commnnder Key's next service was in command of the " Bull Dog,"
  from 1847 to 1850, with the Mediterranean Fleet, under the late
  Admiral Sir William Parker, Bart.        Daring the Sicilian Revolution
  of 1848 he was despatched for the protection of British subjects at
  Palermo, where by his energy and tact the Neapolitan troops were
  prevented from attacking the English quarter of the city ; he was
  afterwards sent on a delicate mission to Civita Vecchia, and placed
  his ship at the disposal of the Pope should it have become necessary
  for him to embark from his dominions — Rome being in a very dis-
  tutb>d state.      His Holiness, however, from various causes decided to
/ escape by
               land to Gaeta, which he did in disguise.
     Commander Key's services were so highly appreciated by the Com
  mander-in-Chief on these occasions that he was especially recom
  mended, and was promoted to the rank of Captain in 1850.
     Captain Key next served in command of the
                                                      " Amphion " during
  the Baltic Campaign of 1854, when he took part in the capture of
  the forts of Bomarsund, and other operations.
     In 1855 he was appointed to the command of the " Sans Pareil""
  screw line-of-battle-ship, and was one of the Captains selected to
  command a flotilla of gun- and mortar-boats then preparing for the
  attack on Cronstadt, in the summer of that year ; in the meantime,
  however, peace was concluded with Russia, when for his services
  during the war he was nominated a C.B.
     On the breaking out of the Indian Mutiny, in 1857, he was sent m
                       "
  the " Sans Pareil      with a squadron of guuboats to Calcutta, and for
  his services there received the thanks of the Indian Government.
      In 1858 he was ordered to China, and commanded a battalion of
  seamen at the capture of Canton. On the signing of the Treaty of
   Peace at Tientsin in June, 1858, Captain Key returned to England
   and served as the naval member on the Royal Commission which was
   appointed to consider the condition of our coast defences.
      In I860 he was appointed to the command of the Steam Reserve at
   Devouport, and after three years' service in that capacity he was
   transferred to the command of the "Excellent," the gunnery ship at
   Portsmouth, and was also Superintendent of the Royal Naval College
   at that port, where he served until 1865.
       About this time, the great change in the size and power of naval
   guns, brought about by the introduction of armour-plated ships,
   necessitated the creation of a new department at the Admiralty, and
   Captain Key was appointed Director-General of this new Naval
   Ordnance Department, which he held as Captain and Rear-Admiral
   until 1869, having been promoted to flag rank in 1866.
       In the latter part of 1869 he was appoiuted Admiral Superintendent

                                     xi
of Portsmouth     Dockyard, but was shortly transferred to a similar
position at Malta, when he became second in command of the Medi
terranean fleet.
   Soon after vacating this position, he was at the end of 1872 ap
pointed President of the newly-established Naval College at Green
wich for the higher education and study of naval officers of all ranks.
In 1873 he was promoted to the rank of Vice- Admiral, and in January,
1876, was appointed Commander-in-Chief on the North American and
West Indian Stations. In 1878 he became Admiral, and received the
appointment of First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to the
Queen.
   In the year 1879 he went to the Admiralty as Principal Naval Lord,
where he served under two administrations until 1885. During Lord
Northbrook's absence on his mission to Egypt in 1884, Sir Cooper
Key was sworn of the Privy Council, .and conducted the administra
tion of the Admiralty.
   In 1866 he came under the Age Retirement Scheme, and was placed
on the Retired List of Admirals.     He had been nominated a K.C.B.
in 1873, and was raised to the dignity of a G.C.B. in 1882. The
University of Oxford had, in 1880, conferred upon him the honorary
degree of D.C.L.
   There have been few naval officers who have enjoyed so long and
uninterrupted a career, or who have held positions of so important
and responsible a character as Sir Cooper Key. He was always a most
successful and popular officer, and during his whole course of service
had displayed qualities and abilities of a high order, whether as a
commander or an administrator ; he was an earnest and generous
supporter of many benevolent institutions, especially of those con
nected with the moral and religious training of seamen.
   He died at his residence, Laggan House, Maidenhead, on the 3rd of
March, 1888.

   Vice-Admiral Tiiomas A. B. Spratt, C.B., the eldest son of the late
Commander James Spratt, who served with much distinction on
                            " at the
board H.M.S. " Defiance               battle of Trafalgar, was born in
1811, and   entered  the navy in 1827.   As midshipman he joined the
                                                             " Mastiff" in
surveying branch of the naval service on board H.M.S.
the Mediterranean, on which station he served all but continuously
until 1863.
   In 1847 he was appointed as a lieutenant to the command of the
                   " Volage," and in the following year succeeded as
surveying vessel
commander to the command of the
                                     " Spitfire," the principal surveying
ship of the station.
   Employed mainly in the Archipelago, Commander Spratt worked

                                    xii
 steadily at charting those intricate seas, whilst his archaeological and
 geological knowledge enabled him to make and publish many
 scientific observations on the places visited. In 1847 he publisbed
 with Professor E. Forbes a work on ' Travels in Lycia.'
    During the Crimean war the " Spitfire " was attached to the fleet
 in the Black Sea, and Commander Spratt's services were in constant
requisition. Besides surveys of all the places required for the
anchorage or operations of the fleet, some of them made under the
enemy's fire, he planned the attacks on Kertch and Kiuburn, and.
led the combined fleet to their position before the latter place.      He
repeatedly    received  the acknowledgements     of  the  Commander-in-
Chief, Admiral Sir £. Lyons, for his exertions on these and similar
occasions, and was finally promoted for his services in January, 1855.
He received the distinction of C.B. and of officer of the Legion of
Honour at the close of the war.
   On peace being proclaimed, Captain Spratt resumed his hydro-
graphical surveys in the Archipelago, and continued them until the
close of 1863.
   Amongst papers and works published by .Captain Spratt may be
mentioned —
   '
     A Report on the Geology of Malta and Gozo,' 1854.
   '
     On the Movements of Teigumouth Bar,' 1856.
   '
     Deep Soundings in the Mediterranean,' 1856-7.
   '
     On the Comparative Conditions on the Different Mouths Branches
of the Danube,' 1858.
   '
     Investigation of the Effect of the Prevailing Wave Influence on
the Nile Deposits,' 1859.
   '
     On the Evidences of Rapid Silting in progress at Port Said,'
1870.
   '
     Travels and Researches in Crete,' in two volumes, 1865.
   This last work eminently illustrates his powers and versatility in
different branches of scientific observation, and contains much
valuable information on geological, archaeological, and other sub
jects.
   Captain Spratt became a Rear- Admiral on the retired list in 1872,
and a Vice- Admiral in 1878. He was a Fellow of the Geological,
Zoological, and Geographical Societies, and of the Society of Anti
quaries, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1856.
   He was a Commissioner of Fisheries from 1866 to 1873, and held
the appointment of Acting Conservator of the Mersey from 1879 to
his death, which occurred on the 18th March, 1888.
