  Of late years many careful determinations have been made of the
dielectric constants of water and ice by different observers.   These
evaluations may   be divided into  two  classes. Firstly, those 'which
are, strictly speaking, determinations     of the specific inductive
capacity of the material, and have been made by measuring the
change in the capacity of a condenser when water or ice is substi
tuted for air as the dielectric.    Secondly, those which are really
measurements of the electrical refractive index of water or ice for
electric waves of various lengths, and which have been generally
made by obtaining the reduction in wave-length experienced by an
electric wave on passing from air into water or ice. The square of
this refractive index or the ratio of wave-length reduction is then
taken as the dielectric constant.
   In order that results thus recently obtained may be compared, we
have collected into two tables (I and II) some of the values for the
specific inductive capacity, and the electric refractive index of water
for waves of various lengths.
  The determinations of the specific inductive capacity quoted all
appear to have been made by methods which, whilst excluding, or
believed to exclude, error arising from the conductivity of the waterr
may yet be regarded as giving the value corresponding to com
paratively slow reversals of electromotive force or to waves of infinite
wave-length.    The electric refractive index observations have been
made by using electric waves of lengths in air varying from 8 mm.
to 600 cm.
   Two very careful determinations of the specific inductive capacity
of water seem to be those of W. Nernst (80'0 at 17° C.) and F.
Heerwagen (= 80-88 at 17° C.), and that of J. F. Smale is in close
agreement with that of Nernst.
   As regards the electrical refractive index, it will be seen that the
determinations of P. Drude for waves of 70 cm., which give ;t —
8-95, and hence p* = 80-2 at 17° C., and those of Cohn and Zee-
man, which give /i = 8'91 and          = 79'39, as
                                       IC-             amean value for
waves from 155 to 560 cm. in length, are in fairly close agreement
with one another, and with the best determinations of specific induc
tive capacity.

       The general results show that the square root of the specific in
ductive capacity of water as determined by relatively slow-speed
electrostatic            methods        is expressed    by a number which is not very
different from that which denotes the refractive index of water for
electrical waves varying in length from 8 mm. to 600 cm. Max
 well's law is, therefore, fulfilled in the case of water under these
conditions.
       The general             evidence      at disposal does not indicate any very
marked dispersive power on the part of water for electric waves
varying in length between the above-named limits ; though the care
ful results of P. Drude in 1896, for waves from 40 to 200 cm. in
length, taken by themselves, indicate a slight normal dispersion,
the refractive index increasing with decreasing wave-length. Change
of temperature has a marked effect upon the electrical refractive
index, and conclusions cannot be drawn, therefore, from the com

     M. E. Bonty (' Journal de Physique,' 3 S., vol. 1, 1892, p. 454)
 found by a slow-speed method a value of 78'8 for the specific induc
 tive capacity of ice at —23° C. and upwards, whilst R. Blondlot
 (' Compt. Rend.,' vol. 119, 1894, pp. 595 — 597), using electric waves
 and measuring the wave-lengths in air and in ice, found 1'41 for the
 electric refractive index of ice, and hence the number 2'0 as the
 value of tbe dielectric constant of ice at a temperature not stated,
 but presumably not far below 0° C.
    Also A. Perrott ('Compt. Rend.,' vol. 119, 1894, p. 601, also
 '
   Compt. Rend.,' vol. 114, June, 1892, p. 1528) found the valuo 143
for the refractive index, and hence 2'04 for the square of the elec
tric and refractive index of ice. C. B. Thwing, working with eloctric
resonance, and therefore very rapid reversals, gives (' Zeits. Phys.
Chem.,' vol. 14, 1894, pp. 286—300) 3-3C at -2° and 2'85 at -5° C. as
values for the dielectric constant of ice.
    It seemed desirable to endeavour to throw light on the reasons for
these differences by an examination of the dielectric constant of ice
at very low temperatures.* We have accordingly applied the method
and apparatus used by us in the latest determinations of the di
electric constant of liquid oxygenf for the purpose of making an
examination of the dielectric constant of ice and frozen ethyl alcohol.
    A condenser was constructed consisting of three very thin con
centric brass tubes about 20 cm. in length. The extreme outer and
inner tubes, having diameters of 3'74 and 3 cm. respectively, were
connected together metallically at the bottom, and formed one plate
of the condenser. An intermediate brass cylinder 3'37 cm. in dia
meter was suspended between the inner and outer tubes, thus forming
the other plate of the condenser.    This last plate was insulated and
suspended    from   the others by providing it with small wire attach
ments, which were passed through the holes in six glass beads
wedged in between the inner and outer connected cylinders at the
top and bottom as shown in fig. 1. This condenser was contained in
another brass cylinder closed at the bottom, and then had its dielec
tric formed of ice by filling the annular space between the cylinders
with distilled water and freezing it. The terminal wires from this
condenser were connected to a rapid contact maker driven by an
   * Note added February 15, 1897. Since this Paper was presented a communica
tion has been made to the Royal Society by Dr. J. Hopkinson and Mr. E. Wilson,
in which they describe experiments on the dielectric constant of ice. These authors
find that the specific inductive capacity of ice, when measured with electro-
motive force reversals haying a period of from 1/100 to 1/10 of a second, is a
number of the order of 80, but if measured with periods such as 1/106 of a second
it is a number less than 3. The difference they ascribe to residual charge. Hence
it is clear that these observations are in accord with those of Bouty and Blondlot.

cap and steel stylus dipping into         to close an electrical circuit 124>

times every second, and thus drive synchronously an electro-mag
netic contact maker, which placed one terminal of the condenser
alternately in connection with a battery of fifty lithanode secondary
cells, and with a    sensitive galvanometer. The other terminals of the
battery, galvanometer and condenser, were connected together. In
this way the galvanometer was traversed by a rapid series of electric
charges, which have all the effect of            continuous current. The
                                                    a
galvanometer deflection remains perfectly steady as long as the battery
voltage is   unaltered. Other things remaining the same, the galvano
meter deflection measures the capacity of the condenser.         In employ
ing this method, the galvanometer may be arranged so as to be
affected by the series of discharges of the condenser, or            may be

this will show itself by making the galvanometer readings in the two
cases nneqnal.    Mr. Petavel, who assisted us in these observations,
and to whom our thanks are due, arranged a convenient switch
ing device which enabled the galvanometer to have its position
 in the circuits instantly changed to take either the charge
currents or the discharge currents of the condenser, and the
equality of these readings is taken as an indication that bo sen
sible leakage takes place across the dielectric during the passage
of the contact maker from one stop to the other. This method of
exchanging the position of the galvanometer also eliminates errors
due to the setting of the scale, as the deflections are on opposite sides
of the zero.   The above-described arrangements having been made,
the ice condenser was cooled down to the temperature of liquid air
by immersing it in the liquefied gas contained in a large vacuum
vessel.
   In order to take the temperature of the condenser a platinum wire re
sistance thermometer was placed in the inside of the inner cylinder and
in close contact with it. The ice having been reduced in temperature
to —185° C., or —198° platinum temperature, the capacity of the con
denser was measured. The condenser was then raised out of the liquid
air and allowed to warm up very slowly, and its capacity taken at
various stages as the temperature rose. Before and after the experi
ment with the ice the capacity of the condenser was taken when the
metal cylinders were at the temperature of —185°, but the dielectric
was gaseous air at that temperature instead of ice, and the results so
obtained enabled the dielectric constant of the ice to be calculated.
   These experiments being to a considerable extent preliminary
experiments, and intended merely to explore the ground, we do not
make any particular claim for the accuracy of the numbers as deter
minations of a physical constant.        We are arranging improved
methods for repeating the whole of these measurements.            All we
desired in the first instance to do was to examine the mode in which
the dielectric constant varied with temperature and its approximate
magnitude at each temperature.       The following Table   III shows the
observed value of the dielectric constant of ice between —185° C.
(-198° pt.) and about -120° (-130° pt.). The voltage used on the
condenser was 24' 1 volts, and kept perfectly constant during the
whole time. In order to ascertain if the galvanometer deflection was
really due to the sequence of capacity charges or discharges only,
and not to any measurable admixture of conduction current through
the ice, a resistance of 1,000 to 90,000 ohms was occasionally
inserted in the galvanometer circuit, and the absence of any observed
change in the galvanometer deflection was taken as a proof that
sensible conduction did not interfere with the true capacity effect.
The galvanometer used had a resistance of 500 ohms.

 They show clearly that the dielectric constant of the ice increases
progressively from a value of about 2-8 to 11'6 between the limits of
 — 198° and —131° pt.             Moreover, the trend of the curve shows that
at the absolute zero the dielectric constant of the ice would probably
not be far from 2'0.          With the above arrangements we were not able,
partly for want of time and partly because of the very moderate
frequency of the tuning-fork, to take the dielectric constant at higher
temperature, but this we hope to do before long, and also to examine
the effect of varying the frequency of the contact maker.

  The broad general result which emerges from these experiments                                   is
that at a temperature of — 185° C. we find  value for the dielectric       a
constant for ice, when using relatively very slow reversals of
electromotive force, which     not very different from that found by
                                    is
observers using reversals of many millions per second by the use of
electrical oscillations or waves, when working at temperatures of
0° C. or a little below.
   C. B. Thwing ('Zeits. Phys. Chem.,' vol. 14, 1894), using an
electrical resonance method, has examined the variation of the
dielectric constant of water with temperatures from 0° C. to 88° C.,
and found a maximum value of 85'2 at or near the temperature of
maximum density of water.
   It seems therefore to be a matter of some importance to measure
the dielectric constant of ice at all temperatures from the lowest
which can be reached up to 0° C., using various frequencies of alter
nating electromotive force, and to explore the mode of variation of the
dielectric constant with temperature and with frequency throughout
this range. The point which especially needs to be cleared up is
whether the dielectric constant of ice                          is,   or   is   not, more changed by

 10     Profs.  J. Dewar and      J. A. Fleming.     On  the Dielectric
 change of frequency of the electromotive force than is the case with
 water.    It appears certain that as far as water at 0° C. is concerned,
 the dielectric constant and the square of the electric refractive index
 is a number not far from 80, for waves having wave-lengths between
 8 mm. and infinity, or for electromotive force reversals having
 frequencies varying from 37'5 X 10' to zero. On the other hand,
 the values found for ice at or a little below 0° C. seem to indicate a
 dielectric constant of 78, when using very slow oscillations ; and a
 value of about 2-0 when using oscillations having a frequency of
 some millions per second.
    It is clear that in this matter there is still room for further investi
 gation. It is evident, since the optical refractive index of water is a
 number lying between 1'3 and 1'4 for waves having a wave-length of
0'00005 cm. or reversals having a frequency of —400 X 10" to 700 X 10",
that water may be regarded as presenting the phenomenon of
anomalous dispersion beyond the range of the visible spectrum,
 because the refractive index for waves of a length of 0-8 cm. and
upwards is a number not far removed from 8'9, and this number
 is very much greater than that for wave-lengths of the order of
 visible light.
    Within the octave of wave-lengths comprising visible light the
refractive index of water lies between 1'3 and 1'4. We know very
little about the refractive index of water for the fourteen octaves of
radiation lying beyond the extreme red end of the spectrum, but we
know that water has very considerable absorptive power for a large
range of this radiation. The next ten octaves beyond the last, include
the range of the Hertz radiation or of wave-lengths from .£ to 500 cm.
in length, and for all this tho refractive index of water is approxi
mately 8'9. It remains to be seen how the high value is connected
with the low one, and whether this variation may be properly
Tegarded as a case of anomalous dispersion analogous to that found
in the case of an alcoholic solution of fuchsine within the range of
the visible spectrum.      It is evident that since the dielectric constant
of any one substance, such as ice- water, is a function both of tem
perature and time, it can best be represented geometrically by a
surface, which may be called the dielectric surface, and which is
defined by the co-ordinates representing dielectrio constant, tempera
ture, and frequency of electromotive force reversals.
   Tbe details of two determinations of the dielectric constant of ice
at -185° C. are given in Table IV.
    The same readings were obtained both with 90,000 ohms and
1,000 ohms in the galvanometer circuit.
   The above figures of observation require two corrections to be
applied. In the first place, the pins which support the inner con
denser plate, and which pass through glass beads, have a total area

         Constant   of Ice  and Alcohol at very      Low Temperatures.             11

 of  04 sq. cm., or 0'17 per cent, of the area of the condenser plate,

0'8o per cent, of the effective capacity of the              condenser   when the
 dielectric is gaseous air at —185° C.
    In order to determine this last capacity the brass condenser had its
capacity taken at 20° C., air being the dielectric, and then it was
cooled in liquid air and then lifted out into the cold gaseous air at a
temperature of — 185° C, lying above the liquid air, and in this con
dition the same readings taken.             The following were the observed

    The difference between the mean galvanometer readings, viz., 8'31
and 8'39, in the two last cases, is due to the fact that the condenser
capacity is changed by the cooling, owing to the fact that the plates
contract. The actual difference due to the temperature of the air
changing from 20° C. to — 185° C. is very much smaller, and does not
sensibly affect the capacity as far as the accuracy of the present
measurements is concerned.
    There is, however, another correction which needs to be applied,
and that is for the capacity of the leads and of the contact maker.
Experiment showed that this was equivalent to 4'15 mm. deflection
of the galvanometer, and hence the amount has to be deducted from
all mean galvanometer readings.
    The final result then is as follows : —
    The specific inductive capacity, K, of the ice at —185° C. is very
nearly equal to the ratio of (22-917— 0-07-0-415) to (8-39-007—
0-415), or K = 2-83.
    The correction 0'07 is the correction for the capacity of the glass
separators, which is equal to 5x0'17 = 0'85 per cent, of the total
capacity, and hence the remanent capacity of the condenser is 8'39 —
8-39x0-0085 = 8-39-0-07. The correction 0-415 is the correction
for the capacity of the contact maker and leads.
   A second determination was made at a lower voltage, the details of
which are as follows in Table VII.

  Galvanometer        deflection corrected for capacity of glass separators and also of

   Since the corrected capacity of the condenser when at —185° C.
and filled with gaseous air at — 185° C. is represented by the number
7-905 = 8'39— 0'07— 0'415, we have for the dielectric constant of
solid alcohol at -185° C. the value 24665/7-905 = 312.
   In addition to measuring the dielectric constants, the same experi
mental arrangements enabled us to measure approximately the
dielectric resistance of the ice and frozen alcohol at and from the
temperature of — 185° C., and the following tables give the approxi

    In the same way the resistance of the frozen ethylic alcohol con
denser was taken at temperatures lying between —185° C., and about

   The above numbers cannot be considered as more than moderate
approximations, but they are sufficient to show the mode of variation
of resistance in the two cases.
   The values for the resistance of the ice and alcohol have been set
out in the two curves in figs. 3 and 4.
   These figures show that in the case of the alcohol, as soon as a tem
perature of —190° pt. ie reached the resistance begins to fall with
great rapidity or the conductivity to go up.
   In the case of the ice the same rapid increase in conductivity
begins to take place at about — 90°.
   Wo have designed a form of condenser which will enable ns to
repeat these measurements and free them from some sources of error
due to the difference between the contraction of the metal plates of
the condenser and that of the dielectric; but pending such more
accurate measurements the above figures may be taken as showing
approximately the course of events when the ice and frozen alcohol
are heated up from the temperature of boiling liquid air.
   We add two tables, XI and XII, giving some recent determina
tions of the dielectric constant of the ethyl alcohol, the results in
Table XII showing that evidence apparently exists of abnormal dis-

   The experiments described in the paper constituted an attempt to
determine whether the change of length which a nickel wire experi
ences when placed in a magnetic field can be explained by means of
the stresses which are known to exist in consequence of the magneti
sation.
   The method of calculating the effect of magnetic stresses on the
dimensions of a magnetised body was given by Kirchhoff and applied
by Cantone to the case of an ellipsoid of revolution of soft magnetic
material placed in a uniform longitudinal field.
   The expression given by Cantone for the elongation of an ellipsoid
of revolution contains terms representing the effect of Maxwell's
system of stresses, and also terms representing the effect of those
stresses which arise in consequence of the fact that magnetisation
depends upon strain.
   It is shown that the latter terms reduce, when the eccentricity of
the ellipsoid    is great, to \~K —   , where el is the increase  of inag-
netisation of a cylindrical portion of the material caused by an
increase of tension eP per unit area, and H is the magnetising field.
   It is also shown by an independent method, due to Professor J. J.
                                  >5l
Thomson, that the term        |H   — represents the elongation of a long
cylinder of the material, supposed uniformly magnetised, due to the
stresses which exist in consequence of the dependence of magnetisa
tion on strain.       Hence, since this term is generally numerically
great in comparison with the terms representing the effect of Max
well's stresses, a very long cylinder of the material could be used for
the measurement of both the magnetic elongation and the effect of
tension on magnetisation.
   The specimen used in the experiments was a long wire of annealed
nickel. The magnetisation and the effect of increase of tension on
magnetisation were first measured for a series of field-strengths and
for two different tensions, these measurements being made by the
ballistic method.
   Then the magnetic elongation was measured, in independent ex
periments, for a series of field-strengths and the same two tensions,
it being arranged that       the  nickel wire was in the same    magnetic

sured by causing a lever, whose arms were in a great ratio, to deflect
a mirror which was observed by means of a telescope and scale at a
considerable distance.
   The observed change of length was always a contraction.                      The
change    of length    calculated   from    the   theory   of   stresses  was   also

negative.
   The difference between the observed and calculated contractions
was, however, considerable, the theory only accounting for a part of
the observed contraction.
   Diagrams are given showing the values of the magnetisation, of
the effect of increase of tension on magnetisation, and of the observed
and calculated contractions, all as functions of the field H.
   It was found that the difference between the observed and calcu
lated contractions was approximately proportional to the fourth
power of the magnetisation, a diagram showing that, if this corrected
 contraction be represented as a function of I1, the points all lie very
near a straight line passing through the origin, the deviations being
within the limits of experimental error.

   (From the Laboratory   of Chemical Pathology    in University College, London.)
    The following is a brief summary of certain results which we have
obtained in the investigation of the relations prevailing between the
cerebellum and other parts of the nervous system, and which we
 commenced in consequence of an observation made by one of us (L),
on the 24th May, 1895.
    This consisted in the observation that when both cerebral hemi
spheres were removed and, as a result, active extension tonus* of
the limbs was obtained, excitation (favadic) of the upper surface of
the cerebellum caused immediate relaxation of such tonus so long as
   * We venture  to propose the term
                                       " acerebral
                                                    " tonus for the phenomenon, to
avoid unnecessary periphrasis, and to distinguish it from     that observed after re
moval of the cerebellar hemispheres.

       Relations between the Cerebellar and other Centres,     SfC.   21
the current was applied, and that on the latter being shut off the
tonus was immediately re-established.
   As this observation appeared to indicate a distinct relation between
the cerebellum and the bulbospinal system of lower centres, it was
obviously very important to examine it further, especially as to
whether it was a truly central effect or not.
   It was soon made clear that the effect was a constant one, pro
vided that the above mentioned tonus was distinctly established, and
further that the primary effect of excitation of the cerebellum upon
the upper limb in such case was not an active relaxation of the triceps
alone, but that there was a marked contraction of the biceps.
   Further, this effect, though constant, when tonus is present, was
not the character of the muscle changes obtained when the tonus
was absent.
   It was, therefore, necessary to arrange a large series      of experi
ments to determine a comparison between the changes           in the two
groups of muscles according as to whether the cortex cerebri, corona
radiata, crusta, tegmentum, cerebellum, or cerebellar peduncles were
excited either singly or in combination.
   After making fifteen experiments in which the contraction of the
niuscles involved was determined by inspection, passive movement
and palpation only, the movements produced were graphically re
corded, and the general conduct of the experiments arranged as
follows : —
                        Method of Experimentation.
    The animal (the dog and cat have       so far been examined) was
anaesthetised  by ether, tracheotomy performed for the purposes of
convenient anaesthesia and a ligature looped loosely round each com
mon carotid artery. The left sigmoid gyrus, the right occipital lobe
and right half of the cerebellum were freely exposed, the dura mater
preserved intact, and the whole kept warm by pads of absorbent
wool soaked in warm normal saline solution.
   The right forearm was next carefully detached at the elbow after
the brachial artery had been ligatured, the nerve trunks cut short,
and the lower bony insertions of the biceps and brachialis anticus
separated from the ulna and radius shafts. A ligature was then
attached to these conjointly, and a similar ligature was fastened
to the olecranon, which had been detached by a cut through the
bottom of the greater sigmoid notch.
   The threads securing the muscles were affixed to Fick's spring
myographs of suitable strength, and a record thus obtained on paper
of the changes in form of the muscles, as well as of the moment and
duration of excitation by suitable signals (F. J. Smith's).
    The nerve centres were excited in all cases by fine platinum elec

                         History of Previous Observations.
     The history    of previous investigation of the relations of the cere
bellum to the      other regions of the central nervous system we intend
to discuss in      a future communication, which will contain the full
details of our     experiments.
                               Synopsis  of Results.*
A. Excitation of       the Left "Motor" Cortex, i.e., Forelimb Area of          the
                      Sigmoid Gyrus of the Left Hemisphere.
     In the dog and cat excitation of the forelimb area of the excitable
cortex produced out of fourteen experiments invariably synchronous
contraction of both biceps and triceps mnscles.             The degree of con
traction also was remarkably symmetrical, and in the majority of
cases even the relative degree of tonus and clonus respectively was
constant.
     Further, when quasi-purposive reflex (?) movements occurred
during alterations in the anaesthesia, >fcc., this symmetry was even
more pronounced.
     So far as antagonism is concerned,          when the cortex alone was
excited, no relaxation        of either  the biceps or triceps was observed.
It will be remembered that these results are purely those obtained
from carnivorous animals.
                   B. Excitation of    the Left Corona Badiata.
     Stimulation     of the corona radiata produced in eight cases inva
riably symmetrical and synchronous contraction of both biceps and
triceps. This was an absolutely constant result in all the cases
examined.       No relaxation was ever obtained.
            C. Excitation of    the Crusta of the Left Cms Cerebri.
    In sixteen experiments      the crura were excited     on the cut surface.
The excision of the cerebral hemispheres was always performed by
ligaturing both common carotid arteries, and then dividing the
mesencephalon by a single incision passing through, or just in front
of, the anterior corpora quadrigemiua.
   * It is to bo remembered that the muscles prepared for graphic record were in
all experiments the biceps and brachialis nnticus and the triceps, of the right side
onlv.

    In all the experiments the excitation             was performed before    the
general tonus was established, as well as after in the instances where
the tonus actually occurred.
    (a) Excitation of the left Crusta before General Tonus is established.

resulted invariably contraction of both the biceps and triceps.

   In bis most recent communication* on the subject of antagonistic
muscle action, Sherrington states that he has obtained cessation of the
" acerebral " triceps tonic contraction by excitation of the crus
pyramidal fibres. As he does not state how often he observed this
effect, we cannot compare the conditions of the two sets of
experiments.
            D. Excitation of      the Crusta of  Hie  right Cms Cerebri.
   The right crusta was also excited in eight experiments, and it was
found that, as a rule, there was evoked contraction in both biceps
and triceps, but twice relaxation of the biceps and once of the triceps
was observed.
         E. Excitation of      the Tegmentum      of the left Crus Cerebri.
   The surface of the tegmentum was excited, and an effect upon the
biceps and triceps observed when the stimulation was applied to the
region of the red nucleus and the locus niger. Excitation of the
anterior corpora quadrigemina was without effect.
   In every case in which the left tegmentum was excited it evoked
contraction of both biceps and triceps.
         F. Excitation of     the Tegmentum of the right Crus Cerebri.
   The right tegmentum, when stimulated in                five cases, gave always
contraction     of both muscles, as a rule, the triceps being in excess ot
the biceps, but this was reversed on two occasions.
                         G. Excitation of     the Cerebellum.
   Excitation of tho cerebellum produced very constant and sharply
                                                                      "

 present or not, and, further, a notable difference according to the
 side of the cerebellum excited.
     The limits of the excitable region of the cerebellum will not now
 be discussed, but we may here state that the most excitable area is
 along the line of junction of the vermis superior with the lateral
lobe.     (This, it will be noted, is that portion of the cortex of the
 cerebellum which, in vertical position, is nearest the superior cere
 bellar peduncle.)
    For the purposes of the present communication excitation of the
cerebellum means excitation of this focal area.
                                             "          "
    (a) Excitation of the Cerebellum when acerebral        Tonus is estab
 lished. — The effect of excitation of the cerebellum when ablation of
 the cerebral hemispheres has produced general tonic contraction, in
 extension of the trunk and limb muscles is a striking and constant
active relaxation so far as the triceps (of the side stimulated) is con
cerned, and an active contraction of the biceps.
    In the absence of graphic record it is impossible to determine
precisely what is the nature of this effect on either the biceps or
triceps.
    We have, however, proved by the graphic method that—
    (1) The biceps contracts powerfully ;
    (2) The triceps actively relaxes, i.e., it does not simply relax by
            ceasing to contract, but it relaxes so as to lose its normal
            physiological tonus.
    The next step was of course the further investigation whether this
phenomenon is unilateral.       We have found as the result of twenty-
nine experiments that the muscles of the right arm can be influenced
 by excitation of both halves of the cerebellum, but that the effect is
very much greater from excitation of the right half, i.e., the same
side.    In addition we have excited the two halves of the cerebellum
after median division of the organ, and then found that the effect was
practically limited to the same side.
    This is of course in harmony with the results of ablation of the
cerebellar hemispheres obtained by Luciani, Risien Russell, and
Ferrier and Turner.
    In five experiments it was interesting to find that excitation of the
left half of the cerebellum, i.e., that of the opposite side, evoked
relaxation of the biceps.      This crossed effect we noticed early in the
investigation, and the similarity in the movements of the forelimb in
walking was very striking.
    The phenomenon of relaxation of the triceps and contraction of the
biceps can be obtained also by excitation of the sub-cortical white
substance of the cerebellum and of the peduncles in part.

 a tonic contraction of either the triceps or biceps, or both together, if

        H.  Synchronous    Excitation of   the Cerebellum and Cerebrum.
    Synchronous excitation of the cerebral area for the forelimb and
 the cerebellar focus has given so far, in cases where the cerebellum
 is definitely excitable, an addition to the tonus elicited previously from
 the cortex cerebri.
    While such reinforcement seems to be the rule, we believe that the
 clonic character of the cortical impulses is adversely affected by the
 cerebellar activity.
    Since Professor Sherrington's third note on " Reciprocal Innerva
 tion of Antagonistic Muscles " appeared, we have investigated the
                                           "            "
 question of reflex inhibition of the acerebral           tonus by the graphic
 method, to see how far the two effects are identical, and have obtained
 some instructive results, the full discussion of which, however, must
 be postponed, as the observations are incomplete.              It is sufficient
 now to say that while we have confirmed Professor Sherrington's
 discovery that excitation of an afferent tract on the same (i.e., in our
 experiments, right) side causes relaxation of the triceps and contrac
 tion of the biceps, we have also found that excitation of a left afferent
 tract causes relaxation of tho biceps and contraction of the triceps, an
 intex-esting correspondence with the alternation we observed in the
 two halves of the cerebellum, and which is obviously related to
 the movement of progression.

-clearly attributable to the illumination.
     The diastatic solutions have been extract of malt; solution of
 diastase precipitated from such extract by alcohol ; diluted human
 saliva freed from mucin ; and extracts of foliage leaves.            The solu
 tions have been preserved by the addition of 0'2 per cent, of potassic
.cyanide.
     The source of  illumination has been either bright sunshine, diffused
 daylight, or the light from a powerful naked electric arc, access to
 the latter having been obtained through the kindness of Mr. Barker,
 the manager of the electric light works at Cambridge.
     The diastatic power has been ascertained by titrating the results
 of the digestions with Folding's fluid, combusting the filters with the
 precipitates, and weighing the resulting cupric oxide.
     When all tho rays of the spectrum were under investigation, the
 -diastatic extracts were exposed to the light source either in quartz-
 fronted cells, or mixed with films of agar-agar, the former method
 giving the most satisfactory results.
     From many repeated experiments it was found that exposure to
 the whole of the spectrum for several hours caused the destruction
 of from 20 to 60 per cent, of the diastase.
     When the ultra-violet rays were cut off by the use of glass vessels,
 glass having been proved by many observers to be opaque to these
 rays, tho effect was different. At first and for some time there was a
  very considerable increase in the diastase, but this was succeeded on
 a prolonged exposure, lasting several days, by a gradual and almost
  complete destruction of the enzyme.
     By the use of a series of screens, arranged according to the direc
  tions of Landolt,f the visible spectrum was divided into five regions :
  red, extending from wave-length 720 pp to 640 pp ; orange, 640 pp to
  58o/i/i; green, 585 pp to 500 pp ; blue, 500 pp to 430 pp; and violet
  beyond 430/i/i, and these several bands were examined separately.
     Details of the experiments are given in the complete paper.           The
  results may be stated in percentages.

                  Diastase and its Biological Significance.                    27
     The infra-red, red, orange,     and blue regions gave increases of 10'8,
 53'5, 475, and 20'8 per cent.        ;   the green a diminution of 15'7 per
 cent.    The violet gave also          a marked diminution, but it was not
 measured, as no satisfactory         screen, allowing only the violet rays to
  pass, could be devised.      The   paper is illustrated by a curve showing
 these effects.
    The effects of the illumination were found to be progressive, the
 increase or diminution of the diastase continuing after the solutions
 were removed from the access of the several rays.
    The deleterious rays were found to be absorbed by the solution,
 the absorption being effected partly by the diastase itself, whether
 boiled or unboiled, and partly by the proteids present in the extracts.
  After removal of the latter by boiling and filtration, the solution was
 still opaque to the rays.
    The screening influence of proteids was examined separately, by
 adding small quantities of egg-albumin to the extracts.               The latter
 was found to be protective, the degree of protection being however,
 only roughly proportional to the amount of albumin present.
    The colouring matter of the barley grain was also ascertained to
 act as a screen for the deleterious rays.
    The living leaf was also examined by the same method as the
 extracts, and the diastase in it was found to undergo a similar
 destruction under the influence of the light.
    It was found impossible to investigate the possible protective
 inflnence of chlorophyll in the leaf, as all the solvents of the latter
 proved to be opaqne to the ultra- violet rays.             They confirmed, how
 ever, the view that the violet rays, and possibly the green, have a
 destructive effect upon the enzyme.
    The experiments lead to the conclusion that there exists in the leaf
 and in the various extracts examined a certain amount of zymogen
 which is converted by the infra-red and the red, orange, and blue
 rays into active diastase.         This conclusion is supported by experi
 ments, detailed in the paper, upon the effect of keeping the solutions
 for several days at a temperature of 38° C.              A curve of the effect of
 this exposure is given in the paper.
    The violet and ultra-violet rays, on the other hand, cause a
 destruction of the diastase, or at least such a change in the configura
 tion of its molecule that it is unable to effect the hydrolysis of starch.
    Three other conclusions of some importance have resulted from the
.experiments    : —
    1.  That  the enzyme is not located         in the chlorophyll grain, but in
 the protoplasm of the cell.
    2. That the suggestion of          Pick* and Johowf that      the red colour-

ing of certain leaves is a material help to the translocation of starch'
in them is probably sound, as such colouring matters screen off the-
rays which destroy the diastase.
    3. That there exists in plants a power of absorbing and utilising
the radiant energy of light, sometimes to a considerable extent, with
 out the presence of a chlorophyll apparatus.
     The last conclusion appears to be of very far-reaching importance,

 ever, have indicated such utilisation           of the rays of the visible-

     The following results are deducible from the investigations
 described in the paper : —
      1. The zones of fission in Lineus gesserensis         coincide with the-
 transverse markings observable externally at definite intervals on its
 body.
     2. The process of fission in all cases proceeds from within outwards,.
 i.e., from the digestive canal towards the cutaneous tissues.
     3. The process of fission is a process of solution, and that, too,
 through the agency of the digestive fluids of the alimentary tract.
     4. The solution of the tissues of the body-wall at the zones of
  fission is preceded in those regions by circular outgrowths of intes
 tinal epithelium together with the formation of corresponding
 external grooves.
      5. In the plane passing through any zone of fission, there is dis
  tinct evidence of the exertion of continuous pressure in opposite-
  directions, or pressure exerted outwards through the intestinal out
  growth is met by pressure exerted inwards in the same plane through
  the body-wall.
      6. As the result of these opposing forces, atrophy, disintegration
  and disappearance of the outermost cells of the intestinal outgrowth
  take place.    Thus the layers of the body-wall are brought into con--

.outwards.
    7. The ruptured surfaces are at once covered up by the intestinal
 outgrowth, and by the proliferation of the subjacent connective
tissue.
    8. The connective tissues all along the zone of fission multiply in
 -order to aid in the healing of the fragments.
    9. The intestinal epithelium changes in character as it takes up its
 new external position.
    10. The whole process of fission has evident relationships to the
 jn-ooess of sexual reproduction.

      Received January 19, — Read March 4, 1897.
                               (Abstract.)
    The  author gives an abbreviated account of a long series of experi
 ments conducted by himself and his assistant, Mr. Davies, in con
 tinuation of those related in 'Phil. Trans.,' A, 1893 (Aberration
 Problems, &c.). The method consists in bifurcating a beam of lights
 and sending each half in opposite directions round a closed periphery
 very near a rapidly rotating mass of matter, and then observing by
 means of interference fringes whether the velocity of light is affected
 in the slightest degree by this neighbourhood of moving matter.
 The steel disks have been now whirled to higher speeds, chiefly at
3000 revolutions a minute ; the steadiness of the machine and the
 definition of the bands have been improved, other minor improve
ments have been made, and a long series of niicrometric readings
have been taken, both at increasing and at decreasing speeds.
    Further, the steel disks have been replaced by a much more
massive lump of iron, weighing     J ton, with a narrower channel for
the light to travel in ; and the bands have been observed close up to
the moving surface, and even when reflected in it.    The rotation was
also continued for some hours to see if by chance time had an}-
influence.
    Moreover, the iron mass was strongly magnetised by a steady
current, so that the light travelled across a moving magnetic field ;
and lastly the steel disks were replaced, with an insulated third disk
between them, and strongly electrified, so that the beam of light
travelled across a moving electrostatic field. After a number of
spurious disturbances had been gradually eliminated, the author
finds that in none of these ways is the velocity of light at all appre
ciably affected, and accordingly concludes that there is no viscous
connexion between the ether and matter of observable magnitude ; i.e.,
that whatever motion moving matter may confer upon the ether must
be of an irrotational kind.    It was demonstrated theoretically in the-
previous memoir that no optical experiments could be competent to
detect motion of this latter character, and accordingly no attempt has

    32          Prof.   J.   \V. Judd.     Second Report on Specimens
    been made to look for any kind of motion except such as would          bo
    caused by something akin to viscosity.
         Incidentally the author points out that by rotating the whole optical
    apparatus and observer, instead of the disks, at a very moderate speed,
    a shift of the bands should be seen ; and even that the earth's rotation
    would with a large enough frame produce an effect, which latter,
    however, it appears difficult or impossible to observe, not on account
    of its smallness, but on account of its constancy.
       The effect to be expected on Fresuel-Fizeau principles from whirling
    air, was unfortunately just too small for the author to safely observe.
    The residual disturbing causes just masked it, but it is probably not
    beyond the reach of another attempt with a still more thoroughly
    steady machine, if anyone feels inclined to persevere so far.    At the
    same time if it be supposed that any microscopic trace of true ether
    effect still possibly exists (which the author wholly disbelieves), and
    if a further attempt be hereafter made to observe           it,
                                                                a number of
    slight residual disturbing causes would be got rid of (and probably
    other difficulties introduced) by rotating the machine in a vacuum.

     , The last report on the borings undertaken in the delta of the Nile
    under the auspices of the Royal Society was communicated to the
    Society by the direction of the Delta Committee on November 12,
     885, and published in No. 240 of the       Proceedings.'  This report

    dealt with the materials obtained     from  the three borings made at
    Kasr-el-Nil, at Kafr-ez-Zayat, and at Tantah, which reached depths
    of 45 feet, 84 feet, and 73 feet respectively. Although these borings
    made known to us the character of the delta deposits at greater
    depths than the explorations made by Mr. Leonard Horner and M.
    Linant de Bellefondes, yet none of them succeeded in reaching the
    solid rock on which these deposits lie, and in which the Nile -Valley
    was originally excavated. It was therefore decided by the Delia
    Committee to make still more strenuous efforts to attain this result —
    a result which the sections published by Figari Bey, said to be based
    on borings made for the purpose, led the Committee to believe might
    be arrived at with a moderate expenditure.
       In their attempts to carry out this important work, the Delta Com-

  mittee have received the most valuable aid from the Secretary of
  State for War, the Inspector-General         of Fortifications, and the
  officers of the detachment of the Royal Engineers attached to the
  Army of Occupation in Egypt ; and their thanks are especially due to
   Colonel Turner, R.E., Captain Dickenson, R.E., Lieutenant Godly,
   R.E., and Corporal Bellinger, R.E. To the Egyptian Railway Admini
   stration the Committee is indebted for permission to choose a site for
   boring on their land, and for much assistance given from time to
   time.
I     Zagazig having been chosen by the Royal Society Committee as a
  -suitable site for the next attempt to penetrate the delta deposits, a
   Legrand-and-Sutcliffe boring apparatus, which had already been set
   up and tested at Kasr-el-Nil, was brought to the selected locality, and
  arrangements were made for carrying the boring to the depth of
   100 feet with a 5-inch lining tube, and to another 100 feet with a
  4-inch tube.      It was considered certain at that time —-and many
  published statements supported the belief — that the solid rock of the
  Nile Valley could not fail to be met with at a depth of less than
  200 feet.    The spot where the boring commenced had an elevation of
  26 feet 1 inch above the sea-level at Alexandria, as determined by
  the Egyptian Public Works Department.
      A pit having been dug to the depth of 8 feet, and a platform
  erected over it, the 5-inch pipes were driven in and carried without
  any great difficulty to a depth of 97 feet from the surface. At this
  depth a 4-inch pipe was driven within the other, and the boring
  operations were proceeded with.          When, however, a depth of
  190 feet 6 inches had been reached, it was found impossible to drive
 the pipe farther, its bottom being still in a quicksand. Thus the
 work, which had been commenced on May 7, 1886, had to be discon
 tinued on August 14 of the same year.
      On the recommendation of Captain Dickenson, R.E., who had so
 ably and successfully directed these operations, it was decided by the
  Delta Committee to resume the work at this borehole in the follow
 ing year, with a 3-inch pipe. The necessary apparatus having been
 sent out, the work was resumed on April 21, 1887, and by vigorous
 and skilful efforts carried to a depth of 339 feet 6 inches.
      At that point, however, it was found impossible to drive the 3-inch
 pipe farther, but a rod was pushed down 5 feet 6 inches without
 reaching solid rock : the exploration thus attained a total depth from
 the surface of 345 feet, or 319 feet below the sea-level.
      From the surface to a depth of 115 feet the strata passed through
 in the Zagazig boring closely resembled those already reported
  upon as occurring in the three earlier borings of Kasr-el-Nil,
  Kafr-ez-Zayat and Tantah, and consisted of alternations of desert-
  sand and Nile-mud.       All the samples sent home have been carefully

    In the alluvial mud, which prevails from the surface to the depth
 of 20 feet, small tubular and knot-like bodies abound.       These are
 undoubtedly   formed   by  the deposition of calcium  carbonate  on the
 rootlets of plants, giving rise to beautiful calcareous tubes, and to
 knot-like bodies where the rootlets branch. These calcareous tubes
 and knot-like bodies are covered on the outside by cemented mud-
 grains, and present a singular resemblance to some of the arenaceous
foraminifera like Astrorhiza.      The knot-like bodies are evidently
formed where the rootlets have branched or become twisted, and
certain of them simulate in outward form some of the bodies l-eferred
to as Stacheice.    As we go downwards in the deposit, these bodies
become fewer in number and less definite in form ; and in the clay
from depths between 75 and 92 feet, we find no such tubnlar bodies,
but instead of them masses of concretionary limestone or " race,"
probably resulting from the solution and re-deposition of the calcium
carbonate. The sand, which prevails from depths of 20 to 75 feet,
varies in coarseness, and is almost always well rounded and evidently
wind-bome, and is in places indurated into a sand-rock or imperfect
sandstone.
   From    75 feet to 92 feet an indurated    alluvial mud was found.
The tube-like bodies are here wanting, but    in their place we find the
                                                                "
irregular masses of concretionary argillaceous limestone or race,"
evidently formed, as we have seen, by the solution and re-deposition
of the calcium carbonate originally deposited on the root-fibres.   The
most careful washing of these clays by my assistant, Mr. F. Chap
man, failed to reveal any trace of contemporary organisms, but at a
depth of 90 feet he obtained a good specimen of a Nummulite (N.
 Guettardi, d'Arch. and Haime) evidently derived from the Eocene
limestones of the country.
   At the depth of 115 feet a very noteworthy change was found to
occur in the characters of the beds passed through, a mass of coarse
sand and shingle being met with, and this continued to the depth of
151 feet.    At the latter depth a band of yellow clay 2 feet thick was
passed through, and under it sand and shingle beds prevailed till the
lowest depth reached, 345 feet.     Specially coarse shingle beds were
found at depths of 121 feet, 160 feet, 175 feet, 190 feet, 208 feet,
250 feet, 265 feet, and 270 feet.    In some of these shingle beds the
fragments, which were usually well rounded — often, indeed, perfect
pebbles — were very coarse, the fragments being of all sizes up to
that of a hen's egg.
   It is interesting to note that a boring made at Rosetta in the

         of the Deposits of  the  Nile Delta, obtained hy Boring.      35
summer     of 1885 by Mr. T. E. Cornish, C.M.G., Director of the
 Alexandria Waterworks, gave a section very similar to that at
Zagazig. The object of this boring was to obtain a supply of fresh
,water for the town of Rosetta, but success not having been attained
 when a depth of 153 feet 4 inches from the surface had been reached,
 it was found too costly to carry the work farther.
    For details of this interesting boring the Royal Society's Commit
 tee is indebted to Sir Colin Scott Moncrieff, R.E., K.C.M.G., at that
 time Under-Secretary of State for the Public Works Department of
 the Egyptian Goverument.          The boring was carried down by a
5-inch tube, the surface being 9 feet 4 inches above mean sea level.
Various beds of sand and mud, the latter containing in some places
impure lignite, were found down to the depth of 143 feet 8 inches
from the surface, but at this latter depth a mass of " coarse sand
               " was found, which was followed
and pebbles                                        down for about 10 feet.
No specimens from the boring have reached this country.
    It will thus be seen that in the case of the Zagazig boring we find
at the depth of 115 feet 8 inches (89 feet below sea level) a
sudden change from the blown sand and alluvial mud of the Nile
delta to masses of shingle and sand, and that the same change is
found to take place at the Rosetta boring at a depth of 143 feet
8 inches (134 feet 4 inches below sea level).         That these shingle
beds were deposited under totally different conditions to those which
prevailed while the delta deposits were laid down, and that they
were in fact the product of ordinary fluviatile action, can scarcely
be doubted, and the determination of the geological age of the great
gravelly deposit which is now shown to underlie the modern delta
deposits, and to attain depths which certainly in places exceed 230
feet, becomes a problem of the greatest importance and interest.
    That the surface of these old gravelly deposits is a very uneven one
is indicated by the difference of depth at which it is found at Rosetta
and Zagazig respectively.      It is possible, indeed, that this gravelly
floor may in places rise through the whole of the Nile deposits, and
form the present surface of the country. The late Sir Samuel Baker,
in a letter addressed to the Royal Society's Delta Committee on
February 20, 1886, called attention to the existence of the so-called
"turtle-backs," which he regards as interesting proofs of " the pre-
existence of desert, before the Nile deposit had converted the lower-
level into delta."
    " There are," he says, " several of these turtle-backs, varying from
two to twenty acres, which represent the original desert that has,
from its superior level, never been subjected to the inundation of
the river.     These patches of sand appear like islands in the wide
expanse of dark alluvium, which exhibits the maximum deposits of
the Nile." Several of these turtle-backs may be seen from the rail
                                                                d 2

way between Tantah and Cairo. A sketch section, given by Sir
 Samuel Baker, shows that in his view they form part of the original
floor on which the Delta deposits were laid down.
   In considering this suggestion of Sir Samuel Baker, however, it
should be borne in mind that the alluvial mud of the Nile alternates
 with considerable masses of blown sand, and that the turtle-backs
 may be the surfaces of great lenticular patches of such blown sand.
 Communications which have been made to me by Colonel J. C. Ross,
 R.E., C.M.G., formerly Inspector- General of Irrigation, seem to point
 to the same conclusions as those arrived at by the late Sir Samuel
 Baker.    Colonel Ross states that the turtle-backs sometimes show a
 distinctly shingly character like that of the materials derived from
 the borings.
    Bearing in mind the extreme importance of determining the
 geological age of the deposits underlying the delta-deposits, I have
 made the greatest efforts to obtain contemporary fossils from their
 materials. The clays have been most carefully washed and picked
 over, and the sands sifted and searched ; but although derived fossils
 are in some cases very abundant, not a single organism has been
 found which lived when the beds were deposited, and would serve to
 throw light on the geological period to which they must be assigned.
 Even the fine clays between 151 and 153 feet, which, it was hoped,
 might have permitted of the preservation of some organic forms,
 have proved to be hopelessly barren of fossil remains.
    Ab it was of considerable interest to determine the source of the
 various pebbles making up the shingle deposit, which we may con
 veniently speak of as the
                              " Sub-delta formation," I placed myself in
 communication with Dr. Karl von Zittel, F.M.G.S., of Munich, who
 possesses such a unique knowledge of the rocks and fossils of North
 Eastern Africa. In his obliging communication, he has indicated the
probable source of the pebbles which I forwarded to him, and writes
as follows : —
    " The
           quartz and chalcedony pebbles from depths of 120, 160, 245,
 and 270 feet are almost absolutely pure examples of those rocks.
 The sandstones (for example, those from the depth of 120 feet)
 rather recall, in their general appearance, the Tertiary Sandstone of
 Gebel Achmar, near Cairo, than the older (Cretaceous) Nubian
 Sandstone of Upper Egypt. The quartz and chalcedony pebbles,
 before referred to, might also be derived from the Gebel Achmar
 Sandstone. The absence of limestone pebbles is striking ; it would
appear that only the harder rocks have been preserved in the gravels
of the Delta, the softer ones having been possibly worn away."
   With respect to the igneous rocks found as pebbles in these shingle
beds, Dr. von Zittel suggests, from their macroscopic appearance, that
                        " from the side valleys of the Arabian Desert."
they may be derived

         of  the Deposits   of the  Nile Delta, obtained by Boring.      37
    The microscopic examinations of these pebbles of igneous rocks
shows that they consist of much altered hornblende andesite, or
porphyrite (208 feet), and andesitic (porphyritic) tuffs (121 feet,
175 feet, 208 feet).        These rocks remind one of those of Djebal
Dockran, except from the circumstance that they are not coloured
by the manganese epidote like the celebrated " Porfido rosso antico."
Altered qnartz-andesite, dacite, or quartz-porphyrite (160 feet;
with rhyolite, showing beautiful flow-structure and many foreign
fragments caught up in its mass (160 feet), — and rhyolite or quartz-
andesite tuffs (170 feet, 250 feet) were also found.
     Of metamorphic rocks, quartzites, which are evidently altered
sandstones, were found somewhat frequently.             And in some cases
(208    feet,  250 feet)  the pebbles   showed evidence that the rocks from
which they were derived had undergone great crushing — the myloni-
tic (cataclastic) structure and the brecciated and veined structures
affording striking evidence of the deformation to which the rocks had
been subjected.
     Many pebbles of sandstone, sometimes showing stratification and
 fault-structures, but destitute of organic remains, were obtained at
 various depths. Some examples of sand-grains bound together with
 iron oxide (like our " carstone ") also occur among      the pebbles.   The
 chief fossiliferous rocks found were as follows : —
     Pebbles of flinty limestone from depths of 160, 175, 250 feet con
  tain recognisable Foraminifera, and one pebble, from 175 feet, in
  crowded with specimens recognised by von Zittel as " belonging to
  the Textularidae, Rotalidee, and Globigerinae." Of these there are
  other specimens from a depth of 270 feet. Dr. von Zittel states :
  "I   hold it as probable that these pebbles come from the Eocene of the
  Nile valley.     Flinty layers and concretions are extremely common in
  the Egyptian Eocene (as, for example, in Central and Upper Egypt).
  The absence of sections of Nummulites and Alveolina is particularly
  noticeable."
      At the request of Dr. von Zittel the sections containing Foramini
  fera were submitted to Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.B.S., who, with
   the aid of Mr. F. Chapman, has examined and reported upon them.
  The following notes on certain of the fossiliferous pebbles are based
  on the reports kindly furnished to me : —
      From a depth of 160 feet a pebble was obtained containing both
   Foraminifera and, apparently, sponge-spicules. The species recog
   nised were —
      Globigerina bulloides d'Orb. (a form with a thick prickly test, prob
  ably a deep-sea variety).

    A flint with    numerous and very well preserved examples of Fora-
 minifera was obtained from a depth of 175 feet, and in several
 sections made from this pebble the following forms were detected : —
                        Textularia globulosa, Ehrb.

                       Anomalina, sp.
                       Spiroloculina, sp.
    From the same depth of 175 feet a pebble of chert (apparently a
silicified dolomitic limestone) yielded the following : —
                       Bolivina obsoleta, Ehrb.
                       Globigerina bulloides, d'Orb.
    From a depth of 250 feet a flint pebble was obtained, which has
all the appearance under the microscope of being a silicified ooze,
crowded with specimens of Globigerina bulloides d'Orb. (a variety
with a thick-walled test), and containing also the following
species    : —
                       llotalia ammoniformis,         Lamk.
                       Polymorphina         compressa,  d'Orb.
                       Pulvinulina, sp., &c.
    From a depth of 270 feet several flint pebbles were obtained which
contained organisms, but these appear to have been partially dis
solved before silicification took place, and hence identification is diffi
cult.     They include Globigerina, Discorbina, &c.
   The whole of these fossils are regarded by Professor Rupert
Jones as proving that the fragments containing them were derived
from the Eocene (Nummulitic) limestones of Egypt, thus fully con
firming the conclusions of Dr. von Zittel.
   At the depth of 121 feet a pebble of a somewhat different class of
rock was obtained. It appears to be an indurated sandstone with
detrital fragments of wood, Foraminifera of the following species : —
                       Lagena laivis, Mont.
                           ,,      globosa, Mont.
                       Globigerina, sp.
                       Discorbina, sp.
and,    in addition,     a    Lithistid     sponge-spicule, an ostracod valve
(Cythere ?), fragments of spines of Echini, a Radiolarian (?.), and

         of the Deposits  of the Nile Delta, obtained  by Boring.    39
oolitic grains (silicified) were detected.   This rock may have come
 from a Cretaceous deposit, and not from the Eocene like the others.
    Of the general sources from which      these  pebbles  were derived
 Dr. von Zittel writes as follows : —
    " On the whole it
                         appears to me conceivable that these gravels
 under the delta originated at a time when the Nile had already
 formed its present valley, but not to so great a depth as at present.
 The majority of the rolled rock-fragments would seem not to have
 been derived from points extremely distant from those in which they
 are at present found."
    In considering the nature and sources of the pebbles found in the
 boring at Zagazig, it may be well to point out that the spot where
the boring was carried out is directly opposite to the Great Wady
 (W. Tumilat), which opens on the delta from the east, and that
much of the materials composing the gravels may havo been brought
down by this tributary rather than by the main stream of the Nile
itself.   Hence we may not have in this particular section so good an
average sample of the contents of the Sub-delta formation as would
be obtained at other localities.
    There can scarcely be the smallest doubt that in this Sub-delta
formation we have a series of deposits, which were formed under
totally different conditions from those which prevail in North
Eastern Africa at the present time. The land must have been at an
elevation at least from 100 to 300 feet higher than at present, and
the Lower Nile, instead of forming an alluvial flat, as at present,
must have deposited coarse sands and gravels. It is upon the very
-uneven surface of this Sub-delta deposit that the alluvial mud and
sands of the delta have been deposited, as the surface gradually sub
sided below the level of the Mediterranean.
    The interesting problem of the geological age of this Sab-delta
deposit remains to be solved, but it may be hoped that the explora
tions now being carried on by the Geological Survey of Egypt, under
Captain H. G. Lyons, R.E., F.G.S., may furnish new and important
evidence bearing on this important question.
    It is to be regretted that the borings carried out by the Royal
Society have not set at rest the doubts which have long existed as to
the depth at which the solid rock-floor lies below the surface of the
delta. But while this has not yet been accomplished, it is satis
factory to have been able to show that the supposed insignificant
thickness of the alluvial deposits is altogether a mistake, while the
existence of an underlying formation, laid down under conditions
totally different to those which prevail at present, has been demon
strated.

 rocks on which the Sub-delta deposits rest.
" The Palaeolithic Deposits at Hitchin and their Relation to the
       Glacial Epoch."      By Clement Reid, F.L.S., F.G.S., of
      the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom.             Commu
       nicated by Sir ARCHIBALD           Geikie, F.R.S.      Received
      February 15,— Read March 4, 1897.
   Certain excavations and borings at Hoxne, undertaken in the
year 1896 at the cost of the British Association and of the Royal
Society, threw much light on the relation of Palaeolithic man to the
Glacial Epoch. It was thought advisable therefore to examine the
similar deposits at Hitchin, to ascertain to what extent the conclu
sions already arrived at were supported by exploration at a fresh
locality.   It was desired also to see whether a new locality would aid
us in restoring pages in the geological history missing in the Hoxne
record.    At the instance of Sir Archibald Geikie, a grant of £50 was
made by the Council of the Royal Society towards the cost of the
necessary excavations, borings, and incidental expenses, unavoidable
if the inquiry was to be carried out satisfactorily. Of this sum,
only about £30 has been expended, for, after reaching a certain stage
with good results, it was discovered that any further advance meant
a far greater expenditure of time and money than seemed justified.
Work was therefore stopped as soon as the main point under dispute
had been cleared up, and a sufficient series of fossil plants had been
obtained to determine the climatic conditions that held while the
ancient alluvial strata were being deposited.
   It is perhaps scarcely necessary under the circumstances to do more
than allude to the results of previous work.    Palaeolithic implements
have long been known from Hitchin, and their position in and at the
base of a stony brickearth was well ascertained.      It was also known
that this brickearth rested on loam and shell marl, with fresh-water
mollusca and mammalian remains. All this had been made perfectly
clear, principally by the researches of Prestwich, Sir John Evans,
Mr. W. Ransom, and Mr. William Hill. The most important of the
doubtful points were the relations of these ancient alluvia to the wide
spread sheet of chalky boulder clay, and to the valleys of the existing
streams.
   In the prosecution of  these supplementary researches    I have been
greatly aided by the local assistance freely rendered by    Mr. William

                 mid tlieir Relation to the Glacial Epoch.               41
 Hill and Mr. W. Ransom.         1 have  also to tlutuk the different land
owners and tenants, especially Mr. Theodore Ransom and Mr. Jeeves,
for the liberality with which they have permitted excavations and
borings to be made on their land.
    A preliminary examination of the neighbourhood of Hitchin con
 vinced me that the Palaeolithic and ancient alluvial deposits there found
occupied a small irregular valley, which had become silted up and
almost obliterated. It was desirable to construct an accurate geological
section across this valley, such as we were able to draw at Hoxne ;
but it seemed' likely that conditions would prove much less favour
able than at Hoxne, and that the coarse, loose, and watery character
of the strata would render work difficult.       Such proved to be the
case, and, instead of being able to make a connected chain of boringb,
it was necessary to select sites where the difficulties could best be
avoided. The result of this method of work has been, that while the
general structure and relation of the deposit has become perfectly
clear, it is impossible to draw an accurate section across the old valley.
Bore after bore was stopped by the closing in of the sides or by tho
gravelly nature of the beds, and though no doubt with time and
money the deposits could have been pierced, previous experience did
not encourage me to persevere, or to hope for any very definite results
even if the bottom of the old channel were reached.         Attention was
therefore mainly devoted to the search for boulder clay beneath the
Paleolithic loams, and to the sinking of a trial pit and bore at the
point where the buried valley appeared to be deepest.
    This exploration tended to show that the story told by the old
valley at Hoxne was repeated at Hitchin. Indeed the succession of
events at the two localities was so similar as to leave scarcely a
doubt that we were dealing with an equivalent set of strata, though
unfortunately the series was less perfect, and the gaps discovered at
Hoxne are still unbridged by any records yet found at Hitchin.
Hitchin yields strong corroborative evidence in favour of the conclu
sions arrived at in the Hoxne Report, and adds somewhat to our
knowledge of the temperate flora of the ancient alluvial strata lying
between the chalky boulder clay and the Palaeolithic brickearth.          I
must confess, however, that in other respects the results are some
what disappointing.
    Hitchin lies in the valley cut by the Hiz, a small stream which
rises within a mile of tho town.        Chalk is seen in the valleys, and
rises irregularly througb the thick sheet of drift that masks most of
the area. The greater part of this drift consists of coarse flint gravel,
partly of Glacial, partly of Palaeolithic age, and one of the greatest
difficulties met with is the impossibility of deciding whether any par
ticular pit is in Glacial or in Post-glacial gravel, and whether the
gravel passes under or over the chalky boulder clay.         The material
                                                                d 3

 being used again and again, the composition of the gravel is practi
cally the same in each case, except for the occurrence of implements
in the newer deposits. It was soon found that Mr. Hill was right as
to the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory evidence from a study of the
gravels. Even between clear sections correlation is impossible, and
 boring in boulder gravels is so difficult and expensive that I did not
 feel justified in spending money in attempting to penetrate them to
 the boulder clay.       Even if the boulder clay were reached, it would
 be fairly open to any critic to say that nothing had been settled, as
 there is no evidence which of some three or four gravels may be the
 one represented at that particular spot.
    The first thing to be done evidently was to ascertain whether the
chalky boulder clay, an undoubted glacial deposit, passes under or
over the Palaeolithic brickearth.           With this object, borings were
 made in      the  pits   out of  which  implements have been dug.              The
 details of the borings are given in the Appendix ; the results may be
 shortly summarised thus : — In Ransom's (New) Brickyard, after
 penetrating the Paleolithic brickearth and underlying fluviatile loam
 to a depth of 60 feet, some blue, chalky clay was penetrated in BH 2,
 and in BH 1 derivative fossils from the boulder clay were obtained at
 about the same level in the lower part of the old alluvium.             In each
case boring was stopped by gravelly sand full of water.                    Other
boring6    in  Jeeves'   Yard   and  in some  old brick -pits  on    Maydencroft
Farm yielded no trace of boulder clay. One only (BH 12) passed
through undoubted boulder clay. The section was —

    The site of this boring is close to the western margin of the old
channel, chalk appearing at the surface within a short distance.
The occurrence of the chalky boulder clay at this spot at a high
level, and its absence, or representation by derivative material, at
lower levels in borings made nearer to the centre of the channel,
suggest that the channel was, to a large extent, excavated, or
re-excavated, after the deposition of the boulder clay, as was the case
;it lloxno.

   The course of the ancient silted-up channel cannot yet be denned.
Loam with Palaeolithic implements occupies a belt extending for
about a mile south of Hitchin. It has been extensively worked at
various times between Windmill Hill and Maydencroft Lane. Accord
ing to Mr. Hill, implements have also been found on Thistly Farm,
half a mile further south. The only pits now worked are those
known as " Ransom's
                       " and " Jeeves'."
   The underlying river alluvium is entirely overlapped and hidden
by the Palaeolithic brickearth, and is only to be seen where the
brickearth has been dug away. It is found in Ransom's and Jeeves'
brickyards, and we have now discovered it, half a mile to the S.S.W.,
in two borings on Maydencroft Farm.            It apparently occupies a
narrow belt   in the middle of  the old  valley. The greatest depth of
this valley could not be proved, owing to the running sand and
gravel, which made boring so difficult.      The bottom lies at least as
low as the level of the existing valleys of the Hiz and Purwell, for
five different borings were abandoned at about that level, without
having reached chalk. The trend of the buried channel seems to be
from south to north, in this following the general slope of the ground
and running parallel to the course of the existing streams.
   Work was commenced last November in Ransom's brickyard, one
boring being put down at the east corner and another at the south
end.    The section at the east comer showed 30 feet of Palaeolithic
loam, resting on 25 feet of carbonaceous loam with freshwater shells,
below which came 12 feet of loamy sand and gravel of doubtful age
 — perhaps glacial, perhaps later. At the south end BH 2 showed —

   Other borings in Jeeves' Yard and near Maydencroft Farm yielded

41        Mr. C. Reid.    The Palaeolithic Deposits at Hitchin
similar results, but only the one already mentioned (BH 12) reached
undoubted boulder clay below the alluvial strata.
   The relation of the boulder clay to the alluvial deposits having
been settled, attention was devoted to an attempt to penetrate to the-
bottom of the valley in its deepest part. A trial-pit was sunk in
 Ransom's old brickyard, within a few yards of the spot where a pit
had been sunk by Messrs. Prestwich and Evans in 1877, and samples
were taken from various depths for washing and minute examination
in London. In this brickyard a large number of implements had
been obtained from the irregular gravelly base of the brickearth,
where it rests on the older alluvial deposits.  The newer brickearth,
here about 24 feet thick, had been already entirely removed at the
spot where the trial-pit was sunk, and it was hoped that the pit
 could be sunk to the full depth of the old channel. After sinking
 14 feet through brown bedded carbonaceous loam, full of badly pre
served shells and plant remains, the weather became so unsettled
that there was a fear of the pit caving in, or becoming flooded, before
the work was completed.      Boring tools were therefore used, and a
further depth of V7\ feet of alluvial loam was penetrated before the
gravelly sand below was reached.      At the base of the alluvium was.
found a foot or so of hard black loam with freshwater shells and
fragments of Jurassic fossils derived from the boulder clay. As the-
quicksand below could not be penetrated without the expenditure of
more time and money than could fairly be devoted to such unsatis
factory work, the boring was then abandoned.
   In working out the material afterwards, it became evident that-
from top to bottom the alluvial deposits below the Palaeolithic brick
earth belonged to one series, the same plants occurring throughout.
We have therefore only two deposits to deal with — a stony brickearth
yielding little or nothing but Palaeolithic implements, and a series of
ancient alluvial deposits below full of plants and shells, but, as far as
known, without trace of man.       The mammalian remains all come,      I
am informed, from the whitish marly silt which occurs locally
immediately below the Palaeolithic brickearth.     They are mostly in
Mr. W. Ransom's collection, and were determined by Mr. Sanford.
The remainder of the animals and plants, with the exception of two
species of mollusca, were obtained in the trial-pit just described.
For the determination of the fishes,   I must thank my colleague, Mr.
E. T. Newton ; for the mosses Mr. W. Mitten ; for the mollusca and
flowering plants   I am responsible.

                    Mr. Mitten writes of the mosses, that " all these are
inhabitants of a sylvan temperate region                   and none point
to a different enviroument from that now existing ; they are not
arctic." The occurrence of Naias marina, now only found in Britain
 in two of the Norfolk Broads, is singular, though the plant was
 evidently more common in former times than at the present day.
 It has now been discovered in the pre-glacial deposits of Norfolk and
 Suffolk, beneath Paleolithic remains at Hitchin, and in a submerged
peat of Neolithic date at Barry Docks, in South Wales.
     The resemblance of the Hitchin Palaeolithic brickearth to the
 Palaeolithic brickearth of Hone, and the similarity of the old alluvia
 beneath, both in fossil contents and in the physical changes they
 suggest, is so striking that one is compelled to correlate them bed
 by bed. If, however, this correlation be correct, it is evident that
 the intermediate deposit full of leaves of Arctic willows, so con
 spicuous over part of the area at Hoxne, is missing at Hitchin. At
 each locality the same story is told.        Some time after the passing
 away    of  the ice the land stood higher than now, so that the streams
 had a greater fall and valleys were cut to a somewhat greater depth.
 Then the land sank and the valleys became silted up with layer after
  layer of alluvium, to a depth of at least 30 feet, the climate remain
  ing temperate.     The next stage, when an arctic flora reappeared, is
  only represented at Hoxne.       The third stage in the infilling of the
  valleys is shown in the curious unstratified decalcified brickearth
  with scattered stones and Palaeolithic implements, identical in char
  acter at Hitchin, Hoxne, Fisherton, and other localities, which
  irresistibly suggests a mingling of wind-transported material and
  rainwash.
     It may be pointed out that if this hypothesis of the origin of the
  Palaeolithic brickearth during the reign of " steppe " conditions be
  accepted, it will account for the non-correspondence of the ancient
  channels with the present valleys, a thing very difficult to explain if
  the infilling were caused by ordinary fluviatile action.    If the Palaeo
  lithic brickearth is equivalent to the Palaeolithic loess of the ancient
  deserts in central Europe, we can understand how during this period
  of cold drought the smaller streams ceased to flow and their valleys
  became so filled with rainwash and dust that when a moister climate
   recurred the streams had to seek new channels.

" Luminosity             and Photometry."             By John Berry Haycraft,
       M.D., University College,                    Cardiff.       Communicated by
       Professor SCHAFER, F.R.S.                    Received February 9, — Read
       March        4, 1897.
   The luminosity of            the spectrum was        determined by what may be
                                       " minimal effective stimulus."
termed the method of the                                                        Through
the partition separating two dark rooms from each other a hole was
drilled 1 mm. across ; this was covered with a                  piece of ground glass.
From a diffraction grating in room A spectral                     rays of ascertainable
wave-length were cast upon the ground glass. The observer in
room B was placed upon a graduated railway, and moved towards
or from the spot of light until he could just see it, and no more.
The distances at which various parts of the spectrum were just seen
were thus determined, and their relative potencies calculated by the
law of inverse squares. Under the above conditions — the eye being
in the condition of dark adaptation — the green near E is the most
potent, and the violet half of the spectrum is more potent than the
red. These results agree with those obtained by Captain Abney who
also worked with the dark adapted eye.
    The experiment was then repeated, the room B being white
washed, and lit with gas light, and the eye of the observer, therefore,
in the condition of light adaptation. Under these conditions the
yellow is the most potent, and the red half of the spectrum more
potent than the violet.
    In the following experiment the eye was in the condition                               of

 light adaptation for strong stimuli, and passed gradually into the-
 condition of dark adaptation as the stimuli became feebler.                  Tiny-
  discs of coloured paper were pasted on a black background, and
 the distance determined at which these spots could just be seen.
 The room in which both the discs and the observer were placed
 was illuminated by a graduated gas burner reading from twenty
 candles downwards.           For low luminosities when the quality of
the flame changes, the burner was raised towards the ceiling to
 measurable     distances.

          ,, very low illuminations        . .    Green, yellow, blue, red.
     The potency of different portions of the spectrum was also deter
mined by the method of flicker photometry.                A semi-disc, rotated by
an electromotor between the source of light and the slit of the spec
troscope, repeatedly cut off the light entering the instrument.                The
rate of rotation of the semi-disc was varied by the use of a graduated
resistance, and the rate could be accurately determined.                  At a low
speed of     rotation    the  spectrum       flickered,  except  at  its ends ; the
position of these two ends was determined. On increasing the speed
of rotation, the flickering centre was narrowed, and another two
points were obtained. From a number of such observations a curve,
giving the potency of the spectrum to produce flickering, was con
structed. With a dim spectrum the green, near E, is the most
potent, and the violet half of the spectrum is more potent than the
red.    On increasing the luminosity of the spectrum, the apex of the
curve shifts from the green into the yellow, and the red half becomes
more potent than the violet. Flicker curves from coloured papers,
observed at different luminosities were also obtained.              The graduated
gas-burner was here           utilised,   and throughout these experiments,
gas-light was used as the source of light.                  The curves obtained
by flicker photometry, and those obtained by the method of the
minimal effective stimulus, strikingly resemble each other.                    The
nature of the flicker effect is discussed, and the curves obtained by
the above methods are given in a paper shortly to appear in the
'
   Journal of Physiology.'

52     Mr. W. Heape.          The artificial Insemination    of Mammals
" The artificial Insemination ot Mammals and subsequent
       possible Fertilisation or Impregnation of their Ova." By
       Walter Heape," M.A., Trinity College, Cambridge. Com
       municated by Francis Galton, F.R.S.                 Received January
       15,— Read February 11, 1897.
    My attention was first drawn to this subject in consequence of the
results obtained during an investigation, with which I have been
occupied during the last three years, upon ovulation in the rabbit.
    I found that " heat " alone was not sufficient to cause ovulation
in the virgin rabbit, but that 9J to 11 hours after copulation ovula
tion almost invariably took place.         I then endeavoured to determine
whether the act of copulation or the presence of spermatozoa in the
female generative organs were independently sufficient to induce
ovulation in does which were on " heat," and I have made a consider
able number of experiments for that purpose, an account of which                 I
                                                  I
hope shortly to publish. Amongst them made efforts to inseminate
                                        "
artificially virgin does when on heat." Seminal fluid was injected
into the vagina of several of these animals, and in certain of them
spermatozoa were subsequently found in the uterus and fallopian
tubes. In no case, however, did the presence of spermatozoa thus
artificially introduced induce ovulation, and it would seem that the
presence of spermatozoa alone is not sufficient for the purpose.
    Again, in a case where copulation took place, and where the
 os uteri of the doe was obstructed so as to stop the passage of sper
 matozoa into the uterus, ovulation did not take place, and thus it
 would seem that the act of copulation is not of itself sufficient for the
 purpose.
     Such experiments as       I have already made do not entirely satisfy
 me, but so far as they go they point to the conclusion that both
 copulation and the presence of spermatozoa in the nterus are neces
 sary to induce ovulation in the virgin rabbit when she is on " heat."
     Ott (No. 24) experimented on sixteen rabbits, and claims to have
 induced gestation in one of them by artificially introducing sperma
 tozoa through the body-wall into the peritoneal cavity near the
 ovary. His description is not very clear, but it would appear prob
 able that he used for the experiment a doe rabbit which had kindled
  shortly before, and it is asserted by Weil (No. 39) that ovulation
  takes place spontaneously at such times in rabbits.             This is a very
  interesting point, but 1 will not allude to it further here, as it
  properly concerns questions of ovulation and the maturation of ova
 which I propose to treat at length elsewhere.
    * With this is incorporated on account of experiments performed by Sir Everett
 Millais, Bart., and communicated by him to the author.

            and subsequent possible Fertilisation of their  Ova.       53
   Certain other mammals,       however, differ from the rabbit in tho
matter of ovulation.      Sobotta (No. 34) has shown that mice ovulate
prior to the act of copulation, and Tafani's (No. 36) researches point
to the same conclusion for rats, though whether the animals used for
these investigations were virgins or not is not stated.
   Spallanzani (No. 35), Pierre Rossi (No. 27), and Sir Everett
Millais's experiment on bitches, to which I refer below, show that
the act of copulation is not necessary to bring about ovulation in
these animals ; certain other writers have shown that the same is
true for the mare, and the researches of various medical experts
demonstrate a similar possibility for the human female.
   According to Hausmann (No. 12), sheep do not ovulate unless
copulation takes place, but it is not improbable that many, if not
most, of the lower mammals will be found to ovulate independently
of the act of coition.     In order to prove this fact, as my researches
on the rabbit will show, other evidence must be sought for than the
fallacious evidence of the appearance of the so-called corpora lutea
in the ovaries (Pouchet, No. 26).
    The possibility of artificially inseminating mammals in which
ovulation takes place independently of coition, has seemed to me well
worthy of notice, and the following short account has been written
for the purpose of drawing attention to a subject which has appa
rently been much neglected, and with the hope that it may induce
observers to record anew experiments of which I have been unable
 to find records and facts bearing upon it which are not already
known.      The importance of the subject is not, I think, fairly recog
nised, but    I believe that a fuller knowledge of what is known about
it will show that it is a matter of great interest both from a scientific
and a practical point of view.
    It has been ascertained that if spermatozoa be placed artificially
in the vagina of certain female mammals at the right season, they
 may conceive ; it has been ascertained also that if spermatozoa be
 placed artificially within the uterus of certain individual mammals
 which have failed for particular reasons to breed by natural means,
they may become pregnant in consequence ; and there is little
donbt that an extended study of the subject will throw light on the
physiological relations of coition and insemination, ovnlation and
fertilisation, and on certain of the causes which induce sterility in
 mammals, which will be of great interest to physiologists and of
great value to practical breeders.
    There is another, a wider but more problematical direction in
 which a fuller knowledge of the possibilities of artificial insemination
                             I
 may induce experiment ; mean the crossing of varieties or of species
 that will not naturally breed together.
    I am not aware of any proof that any mammalian spermatozoon is
                                                                E 2

 54    Mr. W. Heape.         The artificial Insemination     of Mammals
 precluded from fertilising any mammalian ovuni. The indiscriminate
 crossing of mammals is sufficiently guarded against naturally by the
 variation in size, in habit, and in the formation of the generative
 organs of the different species ; it remains to be proved that the sper
 matozoa of one species will not fertilise the ova of other species
 and that the maternal organ will not receive and nourish the hybrid
 embryo.
    I would here draw attention to the use of the word " inseminate."
 The terms " fertilisation.
                                " or " impregnation " have
                                                               very generally,
though as       I believe erroneously,   been   used to  denote the fact that
 the male generative substance has been introduced onto or into the
generative organs of a female plant or animal, and it has even been
 assumed by some authors that the female herself has thos become
" fertilised," or " impregnated."          This assumption, has probably
given    rise  to some   confusion,   those  who believe in telegony may*
likely enough, be influenced by it. As far as is known, the female
absorbs no essential part of the male elements with which she is
supplied, although it may be found that she does so. However
that may be, the female herself is not fertilised by means of pollen or
spermatozoa, and her ova are not necessarily impregnated in conse
quence of the introduction into her generative organs of the male
element.      It has seemed necessary, therefore, to make a distinction
between the introduction of seminal fluid into the female generative
organs of animals and the subsequent possible fertilisation of their
ova, and for that purpose      I  have used the word " inseminate," which
can thus be applied to animals in precisely the same way as the word
" pollenate " is applied by some botanists to denote the placing of
pollen on the stigma of a plant.
   Some time about the year 1770, Spallanzani (No. 35) made experi
ments on the artificial insemination of various oviparous animals
and subsequently was induced to attempt a similar experiment on a
mammal. He chose a bitch of the " Barbet " breed for the purpose
and kept her in a room for a long time, feeding her himself.
   She came " on heat
                            "
                               in due time and after the bleeding stage
was over, showed strong desire for coition.             Spallanzani then ob
tained from a young dog of the same breed, 19 grains of seminal
fluid, and this, he says, he injeoted without delay into the "matrice"
of the bitch by means of a small pointed syringe, taking care to keep
the instrument the same temperature as the seminal fluid, viz.,
about 30° Reaumur.          Two days after the injection the period of
" heat" was finished ; twenty days later the abdomen seemed swollen,
and on the twenty-sixth day the bitch was set at liberty.            The ab
dominal swelling increased,        and   sixty-two days after the injection
was administered she gave birth to three pups.
   On the 12th January, 1782 [according to Tarnier (No. 37), sixteen

          and subsequent possible Fertilisation oj their Ova.          55
months after Spallanzani had completed        the experiment mentioned
above], Pierre Rossi (No. 27) repeated this experiment. He also
                   " bitch for the
chose a " Barbet                    purpose. When she appeared to be
          "         "
coming on heat he locked her up in a room, to open which two
keys were necessary ; one of these he handed to M. Nicholas Branchi,
Professor of Chemistry in the University of Pisa, and the other he
held himself.
    On the 25th January the bitch was ready for coition and sperma
 tozoa was injected into her in the same way as Spallanzani describes
 his experiment. The injection was repeated on the 26th, 28th, and
30th of the same month. On the 1st February " heat " ceased, on
the 26th the abdomen was swollen and the mammae enlarged, and
the bitch was set at liberty. On the 27th March, sixty-two days
after the first injection, she littered four young.
    The care with which both, but especially the latter, of these
experiments was conducted, leaves little room for doubt that the
 bitches produced young in consequence of artificial insemination.
    It is a matter for surprise that such extremely interesting experi
 ments did not stimulate research in the same direction.          They do
not, however, appear to have done so, at any rate I can find no
reference since Spallanzani's day until quite recently, of any experi
 ments on the artificial insemination of the lower mammals.
    The human female, on the other hand, has been made the subject
-of like experiments by various medical men.        Hunter (No. 14), in
 1 799, seems to have been the first to advise the artificial insemination
 of woman in order to insure pregnancy.           In the case which he
records, the operation was performed in consequence of the fact that
the husband of the woman suffered from hypospadias, and the
seminal fluid was merely injected into her vagina. It is recorded that
success attended the operation and that the woman became pregnant
and bore a child.
    Since Hunter's day various medical men have practised artificial
insemination on women who were supposed to be sterile, with more
or less success. Their method has been, to inject spermatozoa into the
uterus of the woman by means of a specially devised instrument and
in that way to overcome certain defects or obstructions in the female
generative organs ; such as flexion or constriction of the canal of the
cervix ; rigidity of the cervix ; hypertrophy of the lips of the external
os which may effectually close the orifice ; inability to retain the sper
matozoa in the vagina owing to violent muscular contraction, or to
retroversion of the uterus (Sims, No. 33) ; a want of sufficient mus
cular power ; abnormal structure or size of the cervix or os uteri
which prevents the free action of the functions of the cervix
 [_"aspirations," Courty (No. 3)] abnormal or excessive vaginal secre
                                 ;
 tions, >fcc.

 ftb   Mr. W. Heape.      The artifieiul Insemination  of Mammals
    Such defects as these may effectually prevent conception by
 natural means, since spermatozoa placed in the vagina may thus be
prevented from ascending to the uterus and fallopian tubes and
from meeting there a newly discharged ovum, hut they may be over
come by placing the spermatozoa directly into the uterine cavity.
    The great difficulty of ensuring success with women would seem
to be due to our ignorance of the time of ovulation.      I will not refer
to this matter further here, having considered it somewhat fully else
where (No. 13).
    The performance of the operation on women presents no great
difficulties and writers on the subject are agreed on this point.
Spermatozoa is collected, either direct from the male, or from the
vagina of the female immediately after coition, and is injected into
the cavity of the uterus by means of a syringe, to which is attached
a fine tube which the operator passes through the canal of the cervix.
    Tarnier (No. 37) credits Grirault with having operated on forty
 women who were positively declared to be sterile, of which number
eighteen bore children in consequence, and his seems to have been
the most successful record. I have given at the end of this paper a
list of the authors who deal with the subject, and it will not be
necessary to go more fully into this branch of it here, since the
writers record nothing which is of further general interest.
    In recent years both bitches and mares have been snccessfully
inseminated by artificial means.
    Sir Everett Millais, who is a noted breeder of Basset hounds, has
made a very remarkable series of experiments of this kind on bitches
in his own kennels, and he has most kindly supplied me with an
account of them and placed the details at my disposal for publica
tion. His method is to collect spermatozoa from tho dog and inject
it by means of a syringe into the generative canal of the bitch ; it
seems probable that the syringe does not reach beyond the vagina
and that the spermatozoa is thus deposited at the further end of that
organ, from whence it finds its way into the uterus by the same
means employed after natural insemination.           These experiments
were not undertaken in order to overcome barrenness ; hence it
was quite sufficient for his purpose to inject the spermatozoa into the
vagina.
    Experiment 1. — In 1884 Sir Everett Millais published (No. 19) an
account of the first experiment he made.        Ho inseminated artifici
ally a Basset hound bitch with spermatozoa obtained from a dog of
the same breed, with the result that the bitch gave birth to pups,
which were, however, born dead.
    Experiment 2. — In 1885 he artificially inseminated three Basset
hound bitches, the semen being obtained from a single emission of a
dog of the same breed, and each bitch receiving one-third part of it.

           and subsequent possible Fertilisation of their Ova.        57
All   these   bitches pupped successfully, one having a single puppy,
another five puppies, and the third seven poppies.
    Experiment 3 (1887) was a failure; tho bitch used for this
experiment invariably refused to allow a dog to serve her when " on
beat," and although she offered no objections to the performance of
artificial insemination she failed to conceive.
    Experiment 4 (1891). A Bloodhound bitch was artificially insemi
nated with material obtained from the Basset hound dog " Floroal ;" a
single puppy was the result, and it resembled anatomically its sire.
    Experiment 5 (1891) was not satisfactory, a miscarriage taking
place.
   Experiment 6 (1891) was a failure; the bitch was a noted bad
breeder and failed to conceive.
    Experiment 1 (1891) was a failure ; the dog used was a very old
one and it is possible the failure was due to him.
    Experiment 8 (1891) was also a failure, and in this case also the
bitch used was a bad breeder, having only produced one puppy in her
life.
   Experiment 9 (1892). The Basset hound bitch "Antoinette" was
artificially inseminated with semen from the dog " Floreal," and a
litter of seven puppies was the result, one of them, " Syringa," being
as he says, " the best puppy I ever bred."
    Experiment 10 (1893). A Bloodhound bitch was artificially insemi
nated with semen taken from a Basset hound and immediately after
wards she was served naturally with a dog of her own breed,
" Dandy." This bitch littered eleven puppies, eight of which were
pure bred Bloodhounds, and three were half-bred Basset and Blood
hounds.
    Experiment 11 (1893). The Basset houud bitch
                                                      " Bud" was arti
ficially inseminated with semen from the dog " Floreal," six puppies
resulting.
    Experiment 12 (1893). A Bloodhound bitch was inseminated arti
ficially with semen from the Basset hound " Nicholas."          She had
twelve puppies, all resembling their sire anatomically.    As this bitch
was dying in labour, these puppies were delivered by Caesarian sec
tion, and seven of them were reared.
                                                   " Garnet," was arti

One bitch puppy, " Bella," was born ; she resembled anatomically
her sire, and she has since been bred from.
    Experiment 14 (1894). A Basset hound bitch, "Juno IV," was
artificially inseminated with semen from a Basset hound dog cham
pion,
        " Forrester," and eight puppies were born in consequence.
    Experiment 15 (1894). One of the half-bred bitches obtained by
Experiment 12 was artificially inseminated with, semen from the dog
 " Floreal," and she littered nine puppies.

    Experiment 17 (1896).        The artificial insemination of another
Basset hound bitch has resulted in the birth of puppies.
    Nineteen bitches were artificially inseminated in these seventeen
experiments, and only four of them failed to conceive. Of these four,
one bitch invariably refused the dog, two bitches were known to be
uncertain breeders, and the fourth was injected with semen obtained
from an old dog and it is possible the failure to breed in this case
may be due to the dog and not to the bitch.
   This remarkable series of experiments, extending over twelve
years, is of very great interest. All possible care was taken by the
owner, an experienced breeder, whose kennels are admirably organised,
that no error should creep in, and it may be confidently stated as a
result of them —
    First, that artificial insemination of bitches can readily be per
formed ; secondly, that pregnancy can be as readily induced by that
means as by the natural method of coition ; and, thirdly, that a
single emission of spermatozoa by a dog can be made use of to
inseminate artificially several bitches, all of which may be expected
to bear pups.
   Another interesting fact which is demonstrated by these experi
ments is the facility artificial insemination affords of obtaining crosses
between animals which, on account of the great difference in their
size (as in Basset and Bloodhounds) cannot readily be obtained by
natural means ; while a further matter of interest, of no little import
ance to students of heredity and telegony, is the demonstration of the
possibility of inseminating a single bitch with the semen of two or
more dogs of different breeds at the same time, and of inducing
her by this means to produce a variety of crosses in a single
litter.
    Gautier (No. 7) also claims to have artificially inseminated a
bitch, bat he gives no details of the operation, and          I have been
unable to find records of any other experiments of this nature on
dogs.
    With regard to horses, Gautier (No. 7) cites Dr. Le Bon as
responsible for a quotation from a book written in the year 700 of
the Hejira, from which it appears possible that artificial insemination
of mares was not unknown to the Arabs in those days.
    He describes how the owner of a valuable mare " on heat," armed
with a handful of cotton-wool which had been saturated with the
discharge from the vagina of the mare, upproached by stealth a
valuable stallion belonging to a member of a neighbouring hostile

            and subsequent possible Fertilisation         of their Ova.        59
tribe, and, having sufficiently excited the animal with the scent of
the material he had brought, collected from him spermatozoa, which
he introduced on his return into the vagina of his mare, and obtained
thereby a foal.
    The Btory as it stands is sufficiently improbable, but it would seem
almost as improbable that such an incident as is here described could
 have been invented or imagined in those early days, and, in view of
 the fact that artificial insemination of mares is actually practised
 now, though in a very different manner, the improbability of this
 story is, to some extent, decreased.*
    The only modern evidence       I have been able to obtain regarding the
artificial insemination of mares, comes from the United States.
    A writer on " Breeding Mares," in ' The Horseman ' (No. 1), 1894,
 speaks of the artificial insemination of mares as of established use
 fulness, giving positive results.
    He gives as an example his experience on a farm where the stallion
            faulty formation," and the mares were not " settling."
 was of
          "                                                                   At
 the time of his visit four mares were in season ; by his advice one of
 them was served by the stallion, and the other three were artificially
 inseminated with semen taken from the vagina of this first mare.
    The result of the experiment was that the mare which was actually
 served by the stallion failed to become pregnant, while the three
 which were artificially inseminated were all got with foal. Subse
quently, the writer adds, twenty-five mares on this same farm,
 which had previously missed getting with foal in the ordinary way,
 were operated on, and twenty-three of them became pregnant in
consequence.
    A writer       " Artificial Impregnation," in the same paper
              on                                                         (No. 2),
 1895, quotes a letter from a breeder in Harrison, 111., dated August,
 1894, from which it appears that the previous season this gentle
 man had seventeen mares which had refused to " stand to the horse."
All   of them had refused for two years past, some for several years ;
these mares were artificially inseminated and nine foals were in con
sequence produced.
    In this article it is recorded that one mare, sixteen years old, which
had repeatedly failed to produce young in the ordinary way, was
operated on in July, 1893, and bore a filly in June, 1894; while a
jennet, twenty-five years old, which had not bred for six years, foaled
a colt in June, 1894, after artificial insemination in June of the pre
vious year.
    There can be little doubt of the bona fides of these reports, but in
   * Note, February 11. — In connection with this story  I should hare added here,
that the spermatozoa of a dog was sent to me by post, during the early spring of
1 806, and, when examined eighteen hours after it was obtained from the dog,     I
found fully half of the spermatozoa active and vigorous.
                                                                                   y

60     Mr. W. Heape.       The artificial Insemination of Mammals
order to confirm them, Professor Pearson, Veterinary Professor at
the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, was applied to, and
Mr. Francis Galton very kindly forwarded to me a letter from Pro
fessor Pearson, in which he states that the artificial insemination of
mares is practised on a number of stock-farms in America with fairly
satisfactory results ; and further, he adds, he himself has performed
the operation and attained success.
     The usual method adopted is, to allow the stallion to cover a mare
in the ordinary way, then, immediately after coition, to pass a hand
into the vagina carrying therein the nozzle of a specially constructed
syringe, to depress with the tips of the fingers the ventral wall of
the vagina at its anterior end, and draw up into the syringe the
seminal fluid which will collect in the depression so formed. The
same mare can then be inseminated by inserting the nozzle of
the syringe through the external os uteri and forcing some of the
semen into the uterine cavity, then the syringe can be withdrawn,
and other mares which are " in use " can be inseminated with the
 remainder of the semen in a similar way.
     Another method is also in use in the United States, and in this case
 gelatine capsules are used instead of a syringe ; these capsules are
 filled with spermatozoa from the vagina of a mare which has been
 covered ; they are then closed and gentlj- forced through the external
 os into the uterus and allowed to remain there ; the heat of the body
 melts the gelatine, and the semen is set free.
     It is possible by either of these methods to inseminate several
 mares with semen obtained from one single act of coition, and in this
 way the usefulness of a valuable stallion may be vastly increased.
     The above operations on mares were conducted for the purpose of
 overcoming certain causes which induced sterility, and for this
 reason the semen was introduced directly into the uterine cavity.
 What these causes actually were is not stated, but it is obvious that
 certain defects which prevent mares from breeding in the ordinary
  way can be overcome by artificially introducing the spermatozoa of
 n horse into their uteres.
     The causes of sterility in mares are, apparently, very various.
  Fleming (No. 6), in the couple of pages which he devotes to the
 subject, briefly refers to many of them.     Here we are only concerned
  with the causes which prevent the passage of live spermatozoa from,
  the vagina into the uterus of an otherwise normally constituted
  animal.
     An abnormal condition of the cervix uteri is more common than is
 generally known, according to Fleming ; occlusion of the os, due to a
 spasmodic contraction of the muscles of the cervix during coition ;
  rigidity of the cervix ; hypertrophy of the tissue of the os ; and the
  formation of false membranes, which serve to close the entrance to

           and subsequent possible Fertilisation  of their Oca.       61
the uterus ; are all causes which may be overcome by the method of
artificial insemination described above.
    Then, again, abnormal vaginal secretions may kill the spermatozoa ;
and another not uncommon cause of sterility in the mare, not men
tioned by Fleming, is the inability of the vagina to retain the semen
after coition ; in such cases the withdrawal of the horse is imme
diately followed by ejection of the semen from the vagina. This
fault may be due either to violent muscular contraction of the vagina,
or to an abnormally short vagina which is stretched by the penis
during coition, and which springs back again rapidly when that
organ is withdrawn. Artificial insemination is readily applicable
also in the latter case; the semen is collected in a basin as it falls
from the vagina, is rapidly drawn up into a syringe, and injected
into the uterus in the way described above.
    With regard to the number of cases of sterility in mares, there is
no doubt that the percentage varies in different years, and that some
seasons appear to be more favourable for breeding than other
 seasons.   According to the evidence obtained by the Royal Com
mission on Horse Breeding (Nos. 29, 30, 31, 32) it is probably correct
to estimate that about 40 per cent, of breeding mares which are put
to the horse fail to produce offspring each year.
    This is a very considerable proportion, and it would appear highly
probable th3t breeders of valuable animals would gladly adopt a
 method of reducing the loss occasioned by the infertility of so large
a proportion of mares, provided they could be assured that harm
cannot be done to breeding stock by the process, and provided
 also that the offspring so obtained should be as healthy and vigorous
 as that got in the ordinary way.
    The operation itself is perfectly simple, and cannot possibly do
 harm if conducted by a qualified person ; it causes neither pain nor
 inconvenience to the mare.
    With regard to the offspring begot by this process,    I have no evi
 dence bearing on their vigour or health, and no doubt it is important
 to the breeder to know this. The best way of solving the question
 would be to use thoroughbred mares for the experiment, and to
 subject  the foals so obtained to the same rigorous tests usually
 accorded to such animals ; their health, vigour, and stamina would
 by this means be readily and justly judged.
    By the kindness of Lord Rosebery I was enabled late last spring
 to superintend the artificial inseminatiou of the thorough-bred mare
 "Myra." This mare has proved an uncertain breeder, and during
 the whole of last breeding season she had failed to stand to the
 horse. She was covered in my presence, and the seminal fluid drawn
 up from her vagina into a syringe ; some slight difficulty was at first
 experienced in passing the nozzle of the syringe through the         os,

(52     Mr. W. Heape.              The artificial Insemination         of Mammals
owing probably to hypertrophy of the lips of the os, but the
difficulty was readily overcomo without annoyance to the mare and
she was inseminated.              Unfortunately the experiment failed and she
has not proved to be with foal.
    Whether the failure in this case was due to abnormal vaginal secre
tion, with which, of course, the semen was mixed when injected into
the uterus, or to the absence of ova, or to faulty powers of gestation,
I   have no means of knowing.                    Many experiments are needful in
order to enable one to form a satisfactory opinion on such points ; but
there is good reason to believe that, with experience, they may be
determined, and it is greatly to be hoped that breeders will be found
who are willing to allow such of their stock as are unsatisfactory
breeding animals, to be treated in this way before finally discarding
them as useless.
    Cows are frequently sterile for reasons similar to these detailed for
the mare, hypertrophy of the mucous membrane of the os uteri
and consequent closure of the cervix canal being a common cause of
sterility in these animals.
    It is said that artificial insemination can be performed on cows as
readily as it can on mares, but I have seen no published account of
experiments on cows.

"The Comparative Physiology of the Suprarenal Capsules."

       F.R.S. Received February 18,— Read March 11, 1897.
          (From the Physiological Laboratory, University    College, London.)
    Notwithstanding the belief of Cuvier, " qu'il               etaifc probablement
reserve a l'anatomie comparee d'expliquer le veritable usage des cap
sules sunvnales,"         this method of comparative investigation has
been bat     little employed in the attempt to discover the functions of
these organs.
    It has, in fact, been doubtful        as  to what are to be regarded as
suprareuals and what are not, in certain of the lower vertebrates,
especially in fishes. Thus it has been suggested that the lymphatic
" head-kidney " of Teleosts may represent these bodies Weldon,
                                                                            (
19, 20) ; even the presence or absence of suprarenals in any given
order has often been a matter of considerable doubt.                      I   have, in
previous papers (15, 16, 17, 18) endeavoured to clear up some of
these points, and have described the anatomy and histology of the
suprarenal capsules in fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, and I hope in
the present communication to give some experimental confirmation
of the correctuess of the opinions I had previously maintained from
histological considerations.
    It will be advisable to prefix a few words about the comparative
anatomy of the suprarenal capsules.               Suprarenals of sorne sort are
probably present        in  most,  if  not   all,  vertebrate animals. Iu the
Cyclostomata this is at present doubtful,* so that it is not until
 we come to the Elasmobranch fishes that we find with certainty any
 thing in the way of suprarenals.             Here we meet with two kinds
of structure concerning which there has been much discussion. In
 the first place, we find a series of paired bodies arranged segmentally
on the intercostal arteries, and extending the whole length of the
abdominal cavity.         They are situated in close proximity to the sym
pathetic nervous system.           Secondly, we have a single or paired,
yellow, rod-shaped organ lying between the two halves of the kidney
and near the dorsal aspect of this organ. This is the " interrenal
                                                                                      "
 of  Balfour (1).
    The histology of these two organs I have described elsewhere (Joe.
cit.), and also I have expressed my belief that the paired segmental
bodies correspond to the medulla of the suprarenals of higher verte
brates, while the interrenal body corresponds to the cortex. That
this was the case was surmised long ago by Leydig (6, 7), and it is
  * See, however, Collinge and A'inccnt, '
                                           Anat. Anz.,' vol. 12, Nos. 9 and 10, 1806.

         The Comparative Physiology      of the Suprarenal Capsules.        t>5
experimental      evidence in favour of this view which I now wish to
put forward.       Before doing so, however, it will be well to state here
that, so far as I have been able to make out, one only (viz., that
 which corresponds to the cortex) of the two suprarenal constituents
 is present in Teleostean fishes.          The same probably applies to
 Ganoids.
     With regard to      the development of     the suprarenals   it is only
 necessary to note that many observers believe that the medullary
 portion is derived from, or at any rate, developed in connection with,
 the sympathetic nervous system (Balfour, l),and it seems clear from
 the researches of Mihalkovics (8) that the cortex is developed from
 the germinal epithelium.
     The researches of Oliver and Schafer (9, 10, 11), followed by
 those of Cybulski and Szymonowicz (2, 3, 4, 13, 14), have shown
 that the medulla of the suprarenal capsules of mammals and the
  suprarenal capsules of birds and amphibians (Szymonowicz, 14)
  (presumably the medulla only also in these), produce a remarkable
  and characteristic rise of blood-pressure, when an extract is injected
  into the circulation of a living animal. But, so far as I know, no one
  has previously tested the effects of extracts of the suprarenal bodies
  of fishes.
      The following experiments were accordingly undertaken at the
  suggestion of Professor Schafer, to whom I am indebted for advice
  and assistance on many points connected with the research.           I  have
  already published      a preliminary   notice  (17), giving the   results   of
  initial perfusion experiments.       I have now repeated and confirmed
  these perfusion experiments, and, in addition, have tested the effect
  of the materials in question upon the arterial system of mammals.
                                                                              —
      Effects of Extract of Fishes' Suprarenals upon the Arterial System.
   The methods employed have been :      —
      1. The perfusion of normal saline solution or Ringer's circulating
  fluid containing the extract to be tested, through the blood vessels of
   large toads after the brain and spinal cord had been destroyed by
   pithing.
      2.  The injection of the extracts into the blood-vessels of a living
   mammal and recording in the usual way the blood-pressure tracing
   with the mercurial kymograph. Dogs and cats have been used in
   these experiments.
      The suprarenals employed in this research have been obtained
   mainly from Scyllium canicula among the Elasmobranchs and from
   Anguilla anguilla as a representative of the Teleosts, but I have also
   used Scyllium. caiulus, Acanthias vulgaris, Galeus canis, and others in
   the first-named order, and Gadus morrhua and several other species
   of Teleosts. The effects produced upon blood-pressure wero practi
   cally identical in the corresponding organs of different species.

    66                              Mr. S. Vincent.
       The extracts employed were obtained in various ways. Some were
   prepared by pounding the glands with sand and normal saline in a
   pestle and mortar, and subsequently filtering.           Others were alcoholic,
   while still others were got by boiling for a short time a certain
   quantity of the material in a known amount of normal saline and
   filtering.     In all cases care has been taken to obtain the solution
   free from particles before injection or perfusion.
       For intravenous injection an extract of 1 in 25 of the fresh, moist
  gland has been usually employed. I have not ascertained the mini
  mal effective dose, but 1 c.c. of such an extract (= O04 gram of
  the fresh gland) from the active glands produced a powerful effect.
       The results obtained by these two methods are quite harmonious.
  I   had anticipated the possibility that the extract from a fish might be
  inactive upon a mammal, but it will be seen that this anticipation
                                                                     "
  was unfounded.         There is in all cases, where. " medullary      substance
  has been injected, very striking evidence of contraction of the
  arterioles throughout the body.             This was made manifest when
  using dogs or cats with the mercurial kymograph by an enormous
  rise of blood pressure (see fig. 1). In the perfusion experiments
  upon toads the result was seen in an almost complete cessation of
  flow of fluid through the blood-vessels         (see Experiment 1). When
  " cortical " substance was employed little or no effect in these direc
  tions was obtained (figs. 2 and 3, and Experiments 1 and 2).                It is
 true there        was  always   a  slight rise  of  blood-pressure  or  a  small
 diminution of flow of fluid when extract of interrenal was used
  (Experiment 1 and fig. 2), but an explanation of this is,            I  believe,
 readily to be found. The extracts from the suprarenals of Teleosts
 have always given negative results when tested by both methods
  (see Experiment 2 and tig. 3).
      T/tc effect of the active principle upon the arterioles is due to a direct
 action upon the muscular tissue of the blood-vessels, and is not in auy
 way connected with the action of the central nervous system. This
 is perfectly clear from the fact that the effects are well marked in the
 toad when brain and spinal cord have been destroyed by pithing.
 Oliver and Schafer found this to be the case with mammalian
suprarenal extract, though Szymonowicz and Cybulski maintain
the contrary. The results of Oliver and Schafer have since been
completely confirmed by Velich.*
      Fig. 1 shows the most typical effect ; the lever rises gradually at
first, then afterwards almost vertically.            In some cases the pressure
was too high to be recorded, as the mercury escaped from the end of
the manometer.           The effect passes off after a variable period, and
the blood-pressure returns to normal.                There is no need to give
further details, but it will be sufficient to say that the experiments

of Elasmobranchs correspond precisely in physiological action to the

     difference between the two results.
        With extracts of        the   suprarenals of Teleosts no effects whatever are
    produced,      Fig. 3 shows a blood-pressure curve unaffected by the
     injection  of   extract of suprarenals of eels to the same amount as was
     previously employed in other experiments.                    Subsequent employment
     of mammalian suprarenal extract in the same experiment produced
     its proper effect.
        Thus we have negative evidence of a physiological character that
     the interrenal body of Elasraobranchs corresponds to the " corpuscles
    of Stannins," the known suprarenal bodies in Teleosts, a conclusion
     both Diamare (5) and I myself (5, 17) had arrived at from anatomi
     cal and histological considerations.

   Perfusion Experiments.
                           — These have been performed upon large
toads.    A cannula was tied into one aorta, the ligature also including
the other.    A snip was made in the sinus venosus, and then normal
            —
saline (0'6 0-9 per cent.) or Ringer's circulating fluid was perfused
through the blood-vessels from a funnel placed about 9 to 12 inches
above the animal.     The toad was held in a suitable holder, and the
fluid which ran through was collected in graduated cylinders and
measured at the end of every five minutes.        have performed eleven    I
of these experiment with practically uniform results.        It will only
be necessary to give the details of two typical ones.
   In other experiments an extract made from the lymphatic " he»d-

kidney of different Teleosts was perfused, and also one made from
muscle of various fishes.     Both these always gave negative resulto
when properly filtered.
   In Experiment 1 it will be noticed that the interrenal gives a very
definite result, though not so marked as that of the medullary
glands.    This point will be referred to again immediately.         It is
clear from Experiment 2 that extracts of the suprarenal bodies of
 Teleosts are inactive as regards the flow of fluid through the blood

     There seems no reason to doubt that the active material in the
"                           " of Elasmobranch fishes is the same as that in
   medullary glands
the medulla of mammalian suprarenal, but so little of the material in
procurable for chemical analysis that I have found it impossible to
compare its reactions with that obtained from the higher animals.
 It is worth noting, however, that the extract in water or alcohol is
of a pale brown tint, exactly resembling that of the medulla of
 mammals.* But that this brown pigment is not the active substance
    * These glands become dark brown when treated with a solution            of bichromate

        The Comparative Physiology         of  the Suprarenal Capsules.          71
is  clear from the fact that when the material (in spirit) is kept for
some time, this brown colour increases in intensity, although tin-
extract may become quite inactive. I have found extracts in 80 per
cent, alcohol become quite inactive after a lapse of two months.* The
brown coloration appears to be the result of the oxidation of a
chromogen previously existing in the extract.
    It will have been observed that in the foregoing experiments the
extract of the interrenal body produced a certain effect upon blood,
 pressure ; this I  believe can be entirely explained as the result of
more or less admixture with " medullary glands."               The latter are to
 be found close by the side of the former, so that it is practically
 impossible to remove it without some of them adhering.                   In my
 later experiments I tried to avoid this contamination by very careful
 removal of the interrenal, and, although I have not succeeded by
 this means in getting an extract of the interrenal quite inactive, yet
 I find that the more carefully it is removed, the less effect is pro
 duced by an injection of its extract. . Thus I found the rise of blood-
 pressure due to interrenal to be much less when I had changed knife
 and forceps after removal of the medullary bodies, so as to avoid con
 veyance of the active principle in this manner.
    Another explanation might be urged.              The Polish physiologists
 find that a slight rise of blood-pressure is produced by an extract
obtained from cortex only, and if this were the case it is conceivable
 that my results, in the case of the interrenal, are due to this slight
 specific action. But, when the greatest care is taken to avoid con
 tamination, Oliver and Schafer find the cortex quite inactive.
 Besides, the " cortical
                           "
                               glands of Teleosts give no effect and there
 can be little doubt that these are strictly homologous to the inter
 renal of Elasmobranchs.
    The morphological conclusion that the two kinds of gland in
 Elasmobranch fishes really correspond to the cortex and medulla of
 mammalian suprarenal is not without its physiological significance.
The cortex is always much more abundant than the medulla in
 mammals, resembles a secreting gland in many points of structure,
 and has possibly a function distinct from the medulla. The anatomi
cal union of the two constituent portions may be in some sense
 accidental.
                                   Conclusion*.
    1. The suprarenal capsule of the mammalia corresponds to two
distinct glands in Elasmobranch fishes, the medulla corresponding
in structure and function to the
                                           "                       " suprarenal
                                              paired segmental
of potassium, and this constitutes a ready means of displaying them in a dissection
(Semper). This test probably applies to "medulla" throughout the vertebrata.

bodies     ("medullary glands" they may be called), while the cortex
corresponds to the interrenal body.
    2. In Teleosts the medulla appears to be uurepresented, the known
suprarenal bodies ("corpuscles of Stannius ") consisting entirely of
cortical substance, and corresponding in structure, and most prob
ably in function, to the interrenal body of Elasmobranchs.
    3. The same is most probably true of Ganoids, althongh                          I am
guided here solely by histological evidence ;                 I  have not been able to
obtain sufficient and suitable material for physiological investigation.
    Thus it appears from these researches that two primary groups
                                                                                   " but
of the class Pisces (Teleosts and Ganoids) have no " medulla
only
       " cortex."*          So far as I know, the only piece of work published
on the physiology of the suprarenal capsules in fishes is that of
Pettit (12). This observer has made out a true physiological com
pensatory hypertrophy of one suprarenal in the eel after the other
one has been removed. This renders it probable (what indeed was
suggested by histological appearances)                   that this " cortical gland "
has a secreting function.              Pettit looks upon this organ in the eel as
the fundamental type of the suprarenal capsule, but it appears to me
much more probable that it represents cortex alone.

                                  (Abstract.)
    In attempting    to arrive at definite conclusions with regard to the
origin and      destination  of some of the afferent and efferent tracts
which exist in the medulla oblongata, the following experimental
procedures were adopted.
    1. Section or destruction of the lateral region of the medulla
 between the ascending root of the fifth nerve and the inferior olive.
    2. Division of the restiform body.
    3. Division of the direct sensory cerebellar tract of Edinger.
    4. Severance of Deiters' nucleus from its connections with the
medulla.
    5. Section of the posterior columns and their nuclei in the
medulla.
    The first of these procedures was followed by degeneration of two
efferent tracts which could be traced throughout the whole length
of the spinal cord, the one occupying the antero-lateral region, and
the other being closely related to the crossed pyramidal tract, a.s
regards position. In addition to this, afferent fibres degenerate from
 the seat of lesion, some of which pass to the cerebellum by way of
the restiform body, others course through the medulla and pons
 external to the superior olive and on the ventral side of the emergent
 roots of the seventh and fifth cranial nerves to eventually reach the
 middle lobe of the cerebellum by way of its anterior peduncle.
 Situated internally to the tract just described is another bundle of
 more scattered fibres, close to the outer end of the fillet, with the
 fibres of which system they remain intimately associated in their
 further course towards the mesencephalon, and can be traced to the
 region of the anterior corpora quadrigemina.              Owing to destruction

 74     Dr.  J.  S. R. Russell.   The Origin and Destination of
of a large number of the arciform fibres by the lesion, degenerated
fibres were traced to the opposite inter-olivary layer, and well marked
degeneration of the opposite fillet, consequent on this, could be traced
to the region of the corpora quadrigemina.       So too, fibres passing to
the inferior olives were interrupted by      the lesion, and degenerated
in consequence.
   Division of the restiform body, unattended with accidental com
plication, resulted in degeneration of afferent fibres to the cerebellum,
and of efferent fibres to the formatio-reticnlaris,      and the inferior
olives ; no tract in the spinal cord being found degenerated after
this lesion.
   In dealing with the results of section of the direct sensory cere
bellar tract it is insisted that this structure ought to be regarded as
totally distinct from the restiform body, and it is further pointed
out that it is most difficult to sever this connection of the cerebellum
without injury to Deiters' nucleus, which is imbedded in the fibres of
this tract.
   No efferent tracts were found degenerated other than those con
sequent on injury to Deiters' nucleus, and no afferent fibres were
found degenerating from this nucleus to the nucleus globosus in the
cerebellum.
    Severance of the nucleus of Deiters from its connections with the
medulla resulted in degeneration of an efferent tract passing through
the formatio-reticularis   of the same side of the medulla, to form a
well marked antero-lateral tract on the same side of the spinal cord,
extending to the lumbo-sacral region. Other degenerated fibres pass
to both posterior longitudinal bundles, and others beyond these
structures to terminate in the opposite formatio-reticularis.          Of
those which enter the posterior longitudinal bundles, some have a
caudal course and reach the anterior columns of the spinal cord, on
both sides, to terminate in the lower cervical region ; while others
pass cepharwards and can be traced to the region of the quad-
rigeminal bodies, where they appear to terminate.               Some de
generated fibres pass from the seat of lesion across the raphe to the
region of the opposite superior olive, some of them appearing to enter
this structure, while others become intimately associated with the
opposite fillet, and pass with this structure to the region of the
anterior corpora quadrigemina.
   Section of the posterior columns and their nuclei in the medulla
was performed with a view to control certain of the other experi
ments, but it was found that beyond degeneration of fibres passing
to the cerebellum in the restiform body, and of the arcuate fibres to
the opposite interolivaiy stratum, with consequent degeneration of the
opposite fillet, none of the degenerations previously described in con
nection with the other lesions were met with.

certain Afferent and Efferent Tract* In the Medulla Oblongata.         75
   In view of certain recent experimental observations responsible for
calling into question the existence of a direct anterior pyramidal
tract, evidence is adduced in support of the existence of this struc
ture ; and the various direct efferent tracts met with in the spinal
cord are fully discussed.
   Among the conclusions based on the results of this experimental
inquiry, the following are to be found : —
   1. The descending antero- lateral tract, which degenerates in the
spinal cord after a lesion of the lateral region of the medulla, is prob
ably the same as that met with after injury to Deiters' nucleus, and
is probably identical with that described by Marchi as degenerating
after lesions of the cerebellum, Mott after .injury to ground fibres and
some of the cranial nuclei, and Biedl after section of the restiform
body, its real source of origin being Deiters' nucleus, as contended by
Ferrier and Turner.
   2. The degenerated fibres which reach the anterior columns of the
upper part of the spinal cord through the posterior longitudinal
bundles, after a lesion of Deiters' nucleus, are quite distinct from the
above tract, and probably belong to some system of internuncial fibres
similar to those traced by Boyce to the anterior columns of the
spinal cord, by way of the posterior longitudinal bundles, after
hemisection of the mesencephalon.
   3. The direct descending tract of degenerated      fibres met with in
the spinal cord in close relationship to the fibres of the crossed pyra
midal tract, after a lesion of the lateral region of the medulla, is
probably identical with a similar tract described by Boyce after hemi
section of the mesencephalon, and by Biedl after section of the resti
form body and ascending root of the fifth nerve ; the proximity of
Boyce 's columnar tract to the latter structure accounting for its
probable inclusion in Biedl's lesion.
   4. Fibres derived from the restiform body proper, and degenerating
candalwards after section of this structure, do not form an efferent
tract in the spinal cord.
   5. There is no evidence that the
                                      " direct sensory cerebellar tract "
of Edinger is composed of afferent fibres, but, on the contrary, it
appears to be an efferent tract from the nucleus globosus to the
nucleus of Deiters, as suggested by Ferrier and Turner.
   6. One of the afferent tracts met with after a lesion of the lateral
region of the medulla corresponds so closely in position and distribu
tion with the afferent anterolateral tract of Gowers that it is highly
probable that they are identical, and accordingly that the observa
tions of Mott and of Auerbach are correct in this connexion.
   7. Another efferent tract which degenerates after the lesion of the
lateral region of the medulla, and which is related to the fillet in its
course to the region of the quadrigeminal bodies, is probably the

    The paper first states briefly the link which connects this branch
of archaeology with astronomy, namely thus : — The great temple
 functions were celebrated at early dawn, the principal annual func
tion being on the day when the sun, rising above the visible horizon,
shone along the axis of the temple, through the eastern door, upon
the Statue of the Deity in the sanctuary, the axis of the temple
having been so directed at its foundation — an institution which
seems to have originated in Egypt, but which was, from the earliest
 times, adopted in Greece.     But as some time was required by the
 priests for preparation for the ceremony, in the absence of clocks,
the rising or setting of an heliacal star would have to be observed
from the sanctuary to give warning of the sun's approach ; and it
would be the case, roughly, that when such star could be just seen
either at its appearing in the east, or just before its disappearance
in the west, it would give about an hour's time for preparation.
The data for the calculation are : the latitude, the amplitude given
 by the direction of the temple's axis and the altitude of the visible
 horizon.    From these the sun's right ascension and declination are
 deduced, then the place of a star having been found suitable for
 acting as a warning star — which could not have been always possible
 without original contrivance — the processional movement of such star
 will then give the period which has elapsed since it was in accurate
 heliacal correspondence with the sun.
    In the paper are recorded some observations of the heliacal visi
 bility of stars chiefly before suurise, and the different angles of solar
 depression which seem to me to be required for stars of different
 magnitudes, and particulaily as to the visibility of the Pleiades in
 twilight.
    Then the elements of orientation of a number of temples are
given, viz., four from Athens, which were not included in the former
 series, a new determination of the ancient Heraeum near Argos, the
 former having been taken before the site was completely cleared ;
 of the temple of Apollo at Delphi, of which the site is very

               Temples and the Dates    of their Foundation.           77
peculiar; but the temple is shown to have apparently followed the
general rule, and that when rebuilt about three hundred years after
the first foundation, the orientation was corrected so as to follow the
precessional movement of the star.
    In the examples of Greek remains in Calabria, of which six
examples are given, are two cases of orientation to the winter sol
stice, and an instance is afterwards given from Pompeii (originally
a Greek city) of orientation to the summer solstice — of these
extremes     I have found no examples in Greece itself. One of the
examples of    the winter solstice, from the ancient city of the Locri, is
remarkable as being taken from foundations lying underneath those
of a later temple with very different orientation and a different
heliacal star.     The winter solstice temples were warned by the set
ting, and the summer solstice temple by the rising, of the same star,
fi Geminorum.
    The dates of the earliest of the Italian temples follow, at an
interval of nearly nine hundred years, that of the foundation of the
earliest of those in Greece.       The temples in Sicily are rather later
still, which would be the natural development, and are also in
remarkable accordance with what is known by historical tradition of
the Greek civilization of the island.
     From Thucydides B. VI are derived the dates at which Hellenic
 colonies founded, or occupied, the following cities: —

78        Phenomena, $v.,     of Heat-contraction of Skeletal Muscle.
   It  is known from Diodorus that the great temple-building                 period
at Agrigentum commenced after 480 B.C., and further, the temple
the fourth on the list was incomplete as respects its roof in 406, and.
was     never finished afterwards.            It was a huge temple, and the
orientation date for the foundation has great architectural prob
ability.      After a shock to its prosperity in 406, the city partially
recovered, and six years afterwards may have been able to found the
small temple with which            I   have closed the above list.         Also the
orientation date of the temple at Paestum coincides exactly with a
passage in Herodotus in which, although he does not mention the
temple, he speaks of the celebrity of a Posidonian architect.

    In carrying out      some experiments to determine the changes in
 length of a muscle when subjected to varying loads and temperatures,
 we have paid particular attention to those changes produced from
 the onset of heat-contraction          up to a higher temperature. We have,
 for the particular study of these changes, always employed a sar-
 torius preparation of a frog immersed in diluted defibrinated blood,
 which was gradually heated in a water bath.               The changes in length
 were recorded photographically.            The   necessary tension was applied
 by means of a very weak spiral spring.
    If the load be low — we have usually employed one below 1 gram —
 the record shows four separate contractions.              These are : —
    (1)    A  contraction commencing at about 32° C., and ceasing at
             about 40° C.
    (2)    A oecond commencing at about 46° C., and ceasing soon after
             50° C.
    (3)    A third   commencing       at about 56°    C,  and ceasing soon after
             60° C.
    (4)    A fourth commencing at about 63°             C,  and extending up to
              75° C.
    If   we contrast the temperatures of these contractions with those
given as the points of coagulation of the proteids of frog's muscle
plasma by v. Fiirth, we find that the first three agree in all points

with the proteids termed by v. Furth soluble myogen-fibriu, myosin,
and myogen respectively. The fourth corresponds with the tempera
ture at which white fibrous and yellow elastic tissue contract when
heated.
    We have concluded from this and many other facts that the
contractions produced by heat are at basis caused by the heat-coagu
lation of the different proteids.
    We have obtained corresponding results with mammalian muscle ;
here the contraction at 32 — 40° does not occur, and soluble myogen-
librin is absent from the muscle plasma.

    The extensive employment of the focus form of Crookes' tubes as
the most efficient known means of generating X-rays, has rendered
advisable the more complete investigation of the cathode ray dis
charge in tubes of this description.
    Hitherto, the usual method of investigating the characteristics of a
cathode ray discharge apart from its mechanical properties, and
beyond what is visible to the unassisted eye, has been by allowing the
rays to fall upon a screen of some brightly fluorescent material, such
as glasses of various descriptions, or screens covered with fluorescent
salts.    With all of these the maximum amount of fluorescence
appears to be produced by such comparatively weak cathode rays,
that in some cases the special effects produced by the more powerful
rays seem to be more or less entirely masked, while the well-known
phenomenon of the fatigue of fluorescent substances, when exposed
to the more active rays, conduces to the same result.
      Surface Luminescence of Carbon when   exposed to Cathode Bays.
    I have found in some cases that by replacing the usual screen,
made of or covered with fluorescent material, by one of ordinary
electric-light carbon, much appears which was previously invisible.
When a concentrated stream of powerful cathode rays are focussed
upon a surface of carbon in this manner, a very brilliant and dis
 tinctly defined luminescent spot appears on the surface of the carbon
at the point of impact of the rays, the remainder of the carbon
 remaining black. This luminescent spot seems to have a very close
relation to the fluorescent spots on glass and on other fluorescent
materials under similar influence. The effect is evidently a purely
surface effect, as when the cathode stream is rapidly deflected b}

means of a magnet, the luminescent spot on the carbon moves with
no perceptible lag.    Farther, though, as is also the case with glass,
the whole of the carbon becomes gradually heated to a considerable
extent if much power be employed for a long period of time, these
luminescent spots are instantaneously produced on carbon of very
considerable brilliancy with but a comparatively low power. Again,
just as glass is known to become fatigued under the influence of
cathode rays, so that after a time it refuses to fluoresce so brightly
as before, so carbon is similarly fatigued, though only after having
been very strongly acted upon.       Carbon, like glass, also recovers its
property of giving   a  surface luminescence to some extent, though it
does not seem to entirely recover, at any rate at all rapidly.
    That the rays which produce the luminescence of the carbon are
the same rays that cause fluorescence of the glass can be proved by
deflecting the rays from the carbon on to the glass by means of a
magnet.
    As it is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to obtain carbon
 plates which do not contain hydrocarbons and other volatile matter
 which are rapidly given off and reduce the vacuum very quickly
 when the carbon becomes at all heated, it is necessary to keep the
 tube connected to the mercury pump, so that the vacuum can be
restored after each experiment. This arrangement was followed in
 all the experiments described below, except where specific mention is
 made to the contrary.
       Apparent form of  the Cathode  Ray Discharge in a Focus Tula.
    As is well known, in tubes of the ordinary focus type with a single
 spherical  concave   cathode,   the rays coming off normally to the
 cathode surface appear to converge in more or less of a cone to a
 focus, and if the vacuum be not too high, to diverge again immedi
 ately in another cone upon the other side of the focus. At higher
  vacua the rays, after passing the focus, do not appear to diverge
 again at once, but seem to form themselves into a description of
 thread which connects the convergent and divergent cones, and is
 longer or shorter according as the vacuum is higher or lower.        The
 angle of the divergent cone appears, however, to be always propor
 tional to that of the convergent cone. The focus, or perhaps man:
 correctly, the point at which this thread commences, seems always to
 be more distant from the cathode than the centre of curvature of the
 latter, but the variation in this respect seems to be less and less the
 higher the exhaustion. This is no doubt due to the mutual repulsion
 of the rays, and accords with the assumption that the rays consist
 of charged particles, which travel more and more rapidly the higher
 the exhaustion.    Probably for the same reason, cathodes that are

                   Sonie Experiments   toith Cathode Ray*.            81
only slightly concave, focus further in proportion beyond their-
centres of curvature than do deeply concave cathodes, for the same
vacuum
             Apparent Hollounwsx of  the Divergent Cone of Rays.
     When the divergent cone is thrown upon a thin platinum disc, as
in the ordinaiy focus tube, and sufficient electric power — say, from a
10-in. Ruhmkorff coil — is employed, the platinum quickly attains to
a red heat.     With platinum, either the whole disc becomes uniformly
heated, or in the event of the diameter of the cone of rays where it
strikes the platinum being small compared with the area of the
platinum, that portion of the platinum covered hy the base of the
cone becomes uniformly heated to a higher temperature than the
 remainder.      This is as much as can usually be seen with platinum,
 though rather more is sometimes visible with aluminium ; but if
 instead of either metal the disc is made of ordinary electric-light
 carbon,   I  have found that the luminescent portion of the carbon,
 instead of comprising the whole disc, or consisting of a uniformly
 heated circle, will in some cases take the shape of a brilliantly lumi
 nescent and apparently white-hot ring, with a well-defined dark, and
seemingly quite cold, interior. As the dimensions of the cone of rays
 are increased or decreased by decreasing or increasing the vacuum,
 the luminescent ring will be found to increase or decrease corre
 spondingly in diameter, at the same time being brighter when small
  than when large. Further, when the ring is very small it will
  usually have a very brightly luminescent central spot, with a dark
 intervening portion between this spot and the ring, and when the
  vacuum is further increased the ring will gradually close in upon the
 spot nntil only the latter remains.
     Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4 show diagrammatically these hollow effects, as
  produced by spherical aluminium cathodes, 1'125 in. diameter and
 0-708 in. radius of curvature, for four different degrees of vacuum,
  1 being the lowest and 4 the highest exhaustion.      The upper portion
 of each of these figures represents the general appearance of the
 cathode discharge between the spherical concave aluminium cathode
  C at the top, and the carbon anti-cathode B at the bottom, as accu
  rately as it is possible to represent evanescent coloured appearances
  in monochrome. The other appearances, due to the dark space and
  fluorescence of the glass, are omitted for the sake of simplicity.
  Beneath each of the elevational views of the cathode discharge will
  be found a plan view of the carbon anti-cathode, showing for each
  condition of vacuum the effect of the cathode discharge upon the
  carbon anti-cathode, in forming a brightly luminescent hollow ring,
  gradually decreasing in diameter as the vacuum is increased, until
  it centres on a point, as already mentioned.

 82                       Mr. A. A. C. Swinton.
    It may  farther be remarked that the diameter of the luminescent
ring may be increased or diminished, or finally reduced to a point,
without altering the degree of vacuum, by moving the anti-cathode
away from or towards or finally into the focus of the cathode stream,
the appearance of the ring in each of these cases being practically
similar to those shown in the figures for a uniform distance with
varying vacuum. When the anti-cathode surface is not at righr
angles to the line of the discharge, the ring, in place of being cir
cular, takes the proper form of a conic section.      The holding of a
magnet near the tube distorts the ring from a circular shape and
moves its position on the carbon.
   From these experiments it appears that the diverging cone of
cathode rays acts as though it were not of uniform density through
out its section, but, at any rate in some instances, as if it were com
pletely hollow.    This fact does not appear to have previously been
noted.
           Apparent Holhrwness of the Convergent Cone of Rays.
   The apparent hollowness of the divergent cathode ray being thus
established, it was thought desirable to ascertain whether the same

                   Some Experiment*   with Cathode   Hays.            83
 condition   of affairs exists in the converging beam of rajs between
 the cathode and the focus.       Owing to the well-known difficulty of
getting any discharge      to pass when the distance botween the elec
trodes is less than the thickness of the dark space, and to the dis
turbing effect which the anti-cathode screen is found to have when
 brought within the focus of the cathode, especially with high vacua,
this question was found much more difficult to decide than that of
 the hollowness of the divergent cone.       However, that the conver
 gent cone also acts under certain circumstances as though it were
 almost completely hollow, and acts generally as if it had a consider
 able tendency towards hollowness at low vacua, was also finally fully
determined.      The lower portions of figs. 5, 6, and 7 show the bright
ring   appearance     upon the carbon anti-cathode at two different
degrees  of   exhanstion,   B being higher vacua than B', and with the
anti-cathode at the three different distances from the cathode within
the focus of the latter, as shown in the upper part of each figure.
As will be observed in this case, the degree of vacuum is found not
to appreciably affect the dimensions of the figure, though it should

foe  stated that the vacua in each case were comparatively low, as
vacua as high as those employed when the anli-cathode was outside
the focus, gave no results at all.      As will be seen, however, the
 diameter of the luminescent ring is affected by the degree of
 proximity of the anti-cathode to the cathode, being larger when the
distance is small than when it is great; while in every case there is
a decided tendency towards hollowness, though usually with some
slight internal luminescence and with a bright central spot, while in
one case, when the anti-cathode was very close to the cathode and
the vacuum was comparatively high, the ring is seen completely
hollow, and there is no central spot.
    A convenient form of tube for showing the apparent hollowness of
both the divergent and convergent cone of cathode rays is shown in
fig. 8, where the anti-cathode disc B, made of electric-light carbon,
is supported upon a small carrier which slides upon the bottom of
the tube, and is connected to the anode terminal D by means of two
aluminium wires, each of which have a ring at their extremity
through which they respectively pass.         As the carbon, under the
action of the cathode rays, gives off hydrocarbon vapour, it is neces
sary, as already mentioned, to try all these experiments with the
tube connected to the mercury pump ; but with this connection made
 through a slightly flexible mercury joint it is possible by inclining
 and gently tapping the tube to bring the anti-cathode to any desired
 position either near or far away from the. cathode.    For experiments
 upon the divergent cone, it is not necessary that the anti-cathode
 screen should be connected to the anode terminal, and, consequently,
 the sliding aluminium wires inside the tube are not required.      They
 are, however, necessary when observations are to be made on the
 convergent cone between the cathode and the focus, as the anti-
 cathode screen when placed within the focus must be connected to
 the anode, or it appears to get negatively charged and acts itself as
 an additional cathode, throwing cathode rays in all directions.
    It may here be mentioned that the fatigue of the carbon already
 alluded to renders necessary some precautions in carrying out the
 above-mentioned experiments, as otherwise the observer may be
 misled into thinking that a beam of cathode rays is effectively
 hollow when this is not the case, owing to the centre of the carbon
 covered by the beam having been fatigued by some previous experi
 ments.     By taking the precaution, however, of deflecting the
  cathode beam by means of a magnet on to various portions of the
 carbon screen, such errors may be avoided.       It should also be noted
  that these hollow effects appear only to be obtained with fairly short
 focus cathodes, such ae are usually employed in X-ray focus tubes,

 in a focus tube still further, and more
 especially in order to discover whether the
 various rays from the cathode cross one
 another at the focus, or diverge again with
 out crossing, and also in order to discover
 whether there is any twist or rotation of
 the   rays,   similar to what has been ob
 served   in the case of rays focuseed by mag
 netism,* a tube was constructed similar to
 that used in the previous experiments, with
 a carbon anti-cathode which was also the
 anode, fixed at the opposite side of the
 focus from the cathode, with the focus
 about equally distant between it and the
 cathode.    The peculiarity of this tube con
 sisted in the fact that a sector of the alumi
 nium cathode, equal to one-eighth of the
 total area of the cathode, had been entirely
removed, as shown at C, fig. 9.          It was
expected that on using this tube, with the
proper degree of vacuum to form a well-
defined ring on the anti-cathode screen, that

.the amount of the cathode cut away, would be found wanting; and
 that by the position of this gap in the ring it would be possible to
 ascertain whether the rays crossed at the focus, and whether there was
 any rotation. What actually was observed is shown for three different
 conditions of vacuum in fig. 9, B being for the highest, and B" for
 the lowest vacuum.      As will be seen, the expected gap in the ring
 was obtained, but with the unexpected addition that the dimensions
 of this gap, instead of being only one-eighth of the circumference of
 the ring, was seven-eighths of the circumference.         In fact, the
 amount of ring shown corresponded not with the seven-eighths of
 the remaining cathode surface, but with the one-eighth of the cathode
 that had been removed.     The portion of ring that did appear was of
 a length corresponding exactly to the arc of the removed sector of
 the cathode, according to its greater or lesser nearness to the centra
 with different conditions of vacuum ; and as the portion of ring was
 in each case exactly in line with the portion of cathode that had been
 cut away, it would appear that there is no rotation of the cathode
 beam as a whole, that the rays do cross at the focus ; and, further,
 that when the hollow convergent cone      is, asit  were, split in this
 manner, some unexplained action, similar in effect to the existence of
a  circular surface tension, causes the gap to widen out and the

without, however, altering
its diameter.
    In order to farther investi
gate the matter another tube
was made, as shown in fig. 10,
in which the concave cathode
was complete; but the in
terior of the tube was fur
nished with a small movable
piece of aluminium, A, which
by shaking could be moved
up and down the tube be
tween the cathode C, and
 anti-cathode B, and which,
 while not quite reaching the
 centre of the tube, would fill
 up very nearly one quarter of
 the circular sectional area of
 the latter.
     With this arrangement of
 tube, with the aluminium                             M
 obstacle placed just at the
 focus, as shown in fig. 11,
 the point of the obstacle just
 missing the cathode rays, a
 complete ring was formed on
  the carbon anti-cathode. On
 moving the obstacle slightly
 into the divergent cone, ex
 actly one quarter of the ring
 on the anti-cathode failed to
 appear, as shown in fig. 12,
 and on the obstacle being
 further moved in the same
 direction the result was not
 altered, as shown in fig. 13.
    As in each of the latter
 two cases there was no dis
 placement of the gap in the
 ring, the above showed that
 there is no rotation of the
 divergent cathode cone.

    Experiments were next tried with the aluminium obstacle, moved
so   that its point just entered the converging cone of cathode rays,
when a small portion of the ring was cut out, but on the opposite
 side, as shown in fig. 14, this confirming the previous experi
 ments, which showed that the rays cross ono another's paths at the
 focus without rotation.      Upon moving the aluminium obstacle a
 little nearer to the cathode, so that its point entered still further into
 the convergent cathode beam, one half of the ring disappeared, as in
 fig. 15, while when the obstacle — which, it should be remembered,
 blocked only one quarter of the circular area of the tube —was
 brought close up to the cathode, only about one quarter of the ring
 remained, as in fig. 16.
     Further experiments were tried with the aluminium obstacle both
 in the divergent and convergent cones, but with the tube exhausted
 to different degrees of vacuum, the result being as shown in
 figs. 17 and 18, in which in each case B shows the highest vacuum
 and B" the lowest, from which it will be observed that when the
 obstacle was in the divergent cone, a portion of the ring was cut off
 exactly proportional to the angle subtended by the sides of the
 obstacle ; while when the obstacle was placed in the convergent

cone, a much larger proportion of the         ring was cut off in each case,
this being much more marked with                a high vacuum when the
diameter of the ring was small, than with a low vacuum when the
diameter of the ring was large.
    Convergent and Divergent     Cones produced    by Magnetic Focussing.
   In order to discover whether       the apparent hollowness of the con
vergent and divergent cones of cathode rays as above observed, when
the focussing was performed by means of a spherical cathode, was in
any way due to the concave form of the cathode or to the fact that
the rays were converging or diverging, experiments were tried with
a tube having a flat aluminium cathode, the rays being caused to
converge to a focus by means of a powerful electro-magnet in the
manner described by the writer in his paper on " The effects of a
strong magnetic field upon electric discharges in vacuo." *
   The arrangement is shown in fig. 19, the carbon anti-cathode
screen, B, being movable, and not connected to the anode D, which
was contained in an annex to the tube. By increasing or decreasing
the power of an electro-magnet M, by moving it nearer to or further
away from the tube, and by moving the anti-cathode screen up and
down the tube, the cathode rays could be focussed on the anti-cathode
screen so as to form a circle of any desired size, the focus, which
appears to be exactly on the pole of the magnet, being, of course,
always beyond the anti-cathode.
   In order similarly to investigate a divergent cone of cathode rays
magnetically produced, a circular coil of wire, E, was employed
instead of the magnet in the manner recently described by Professor
Fleming.f This coil, which had 72 turns of No. 18 S.W.G. size
wire, was supplied with 20 to 25 amperes of current from a storage
battery. It focussed the cathode rays at a point exactly central to
its own plane, from which they again diverged on to the anti-cathode
screen.
   With convergent and divergent        cones of rays produced magnetically
in the above manner, there      was no difficulty in showing that, under
suitable conditions, these cones acted as if they were hollow, giving
bright rings of varying sizes, sometimes with and sometimes without
bright central spots, upon the carbon anti-cathode screen, exactly
similar in appearance to those obtained with the concave cathode.
   Further observations were as follows : —
   In some instances, two concentric hollow rings were observed,
especially with a low vacuum, when the magnet was suddenly turned

rays accurately upon the carbon, a small bright spot appears at first ;
as the vacuum goes down this point becomes larger and fainter, but
still solid. Suddenly it becomes hollow and brighter ; then, as the
vacuum falls still further, the ring becomes solid again, though
larger and more faint than before ; finally it disappears. After this
stage it can be reproduced momentarily, without alteration to the
vacuum,  by switching the magnet on and off suddenly, when it is
usually hollow, but sometimes solid.
                   The Convergent Cone at Higher Vacua.
     As has been mentioned, the carbon anti-cathode screen was found
useless   for investigating the convergent cone of cathode rays at
anything but a very low vacuum, by the reason of the well-known
difficulty in getting any discharge to pass when the distance between
the electrodes is less than the thickness of the dark space, and for the
further reason that if the anti-cathode screen was not connected to the
anode, it became itself negatively charged 'and acted as an additional
cathode when brought into the space between the cathode and the
focus.
   Under these circumstances, it was thought that possibly some
additional information might be obtained with regard to the form of
the convergent cone at high vacua, by making the concave cathode
itself of carbon.   A tube was therefore constructed having a concave
carbon cathode, the diameter of which was 1 inch, and the radius
of curvature 0'75 inch.    The appearance of the cathode with this tube
is shown for a fairly high vacuum in tig. 20, in which the cathode
itself is shown in section, so as to let the form of the discharge be
better seen. As will be observed under this condition of vacuum,
which was too high to show any divergent cone, the cone of conver
gent rays appears to be contracted in diameter at its base, and to come
off from the ceutral portion of the cathode only, the , remaining
surface of the cathode being apparently inactive.      This was found to
be still more the case at higher vacua, as will be seen from fig. 21,
which shows in a similar manner the form of the cathode discharge
in a tube exhausted to a very high vacuum. In this case, as will be
observed, the whole of the cathode rays appear to come off from a
very small spot in the centre of the cathode.         Further, that this
small spot   is,
               at any rate, the source of most,  if not all, activity, was
evident from the fact that  it became luminescent exactly in the same
manner, but in a less degree, than had previously been observed witli
a carbon     surface upon which cathode rays were concentrated.
Whether this surface luminescence of the cathode carbon at the point
where the cathode rays leave     it  due to the violent tearing away of
                                      is
particles of carbon, or to some other cause,    it    difficult to say, but
                                                     is

                 Some   Experiments   with Cathode Rays.              93
 the fact that at high vacua the cathode rays come off entirely or, at
 any rate, almost entirely from only a very small portion of the centre
 of the cathode, explains the observed fact that within limits large
 cathodes have no advantage over small cathodes in X-ray tubes.
    During the carrying out of the above experiments with a carbon
 cathode, very bright sparks were occasionally seen coming off the
 cathode and passing throngh the focus, and it was consequently
 thought that possibly by placing two concave carbon cathodes facing
 one another, such particles, by being caused to rebound backwards
 and forwards continuously between the two, might render the form of
 cathode stream visible at very high vacua when the stream itself
 becomes otherwise invisible.
    With this view, a tube was made as shown in fig. 22, in which
 two concave carbon cathodes CC, similar to those employed in the
 last experiment, were placed exactly opposite one another, so that a
 prolongation of the focus of either one would pass through the centre
 of the other. The anode, D, was placed in an annex, as shown in
 the illustration, and the two cathodes were connected together by
 means of a wire outside the tube.     At a very high exhaustion, this
 tube gave very beautiful effects, and showed clearly the fonn of the
 cathode discharge at a degree of exhaustion when it is usually in
itself quite invisible.   Immediately on the current being turned on
and the discharge passing, a straight and thin stream of bright golden
coloured particles of apparently incandescent carbon passed between
small luminescent spots at the centres of each cathode, as shown in
fig. 23. This did not last for more than a second, when, owing
no doubt, to the rapid fall of vacuum, the appearance changed to that
shown in fig. 24, and the incandescent particles of carbon could
be seen passing backwards and forwards along the convergent and
                                                                         -

divergent   cones   of cathode  rays, which, at the lower vacuum,
proceeded from both cathodes, and spluttering in the centre, where
the particles going in opposite directions collided. This appearance

lasted for some seconds, becoming gradually fainter as the vacuum
fell. By re-exhausting the tube with the pump, however, the
original appearance shown in fig.           23, as also the appearance
shown       in fig. 24 could be produced as often                as   desired.
Apparently the particles of carbon become heated to incandescence
either by the action of the cathode rays upon them while they arc
flying through space, or by their friction in passing through the
residual gas, and possibly by their mutual collisions, for in the
stage shown in fig. 24, when the cathodes themselves show no
luminescence,      the flying particles appear       to be most intensely
luminescent when in the centre of the tube.             It may be mentioned
that after this experiment had been repeated several times, the glass
of the tube became perceptibly blackened, which, taken with the fact
that a similar tube with cathodes of aluminium showed no stream of
bright particles, goes to show that the particles consist of carbon
torn off the surfaces of the cathodes.
                          The Production of X-Ttays.
   The tube, fig. 22, with carbon cathodes was found to produce
feeble X-rays, which, when observed with a fluorescent screen,
appeared      to come either from the fluorescent glass of the bulb or
from the travelling particles of carbon.
    In order to ascertain whether it is necessary that the cathode rays
should fall on solid matter in order to produce X-rays, another tube
was constructed, similar in all respects to that shown in fig. 22, with
the exception that the two cathodes where made of aluminium.
    It was thought that with this tube the opposing streams of cathode
rays might possibly produce X-rays at the point where they met.
 This does not, however, appear to be the case, as though this tube,
 when exhausted to so high an extent that the alternative spark in
 air leapt fully 8 inches, gave X-rays in considerable quantity, these
 rays appeared to come entirely from portions of the glass of the tube
 that were covered with green fluorescence,            and not at any rate
 appreciably    from   the central point between    the   two cathodes, where
 the opposing streams of cathode rays would meet one another.
     It seems, therefore, that X-rays can only be produced by cathode
 rays when these strike solid matter.
     In conclusion I wish to mention     how much      I   owe in carrying out
 these experiments to the assistance of Mr.      J.   C. M. Stanton and Mr.
 H. Tyson Wolff, who have made and exhausted all the tubes, and to
 whom     I  am also indebted for many valuable suggestions.

    The magnetic curves during the past year have been quite free
 from any very large fluctuations.         Some of the principal variations
 that were recorded took place on the following days : —-
    January 3—9, 19—20, 30—31 ; February 1—4, 13—14, 28—29 ;
 March 4, 26—28; April 21—25; May 2—3; June 16; September
 18 ; October 9 — 12 ; November 7 — 8 ; and December 3 — 4.
    The earthquake of December 17 was shown slightly on the Declina
tion curve, but more distinctly on the Horizontal Force curve, though
the disturbance on the latter curve only equalled that due to a change
of 0-00004 in the Horizontal Force in the C.G.S. units.
    The hourly means and diurnal inequality of the magnetic elements
for 1896, for the quiet days selected by the Astronomer Royal, will
be found in Appendix I.
    The mean values at the noons preceding and succeeding the selected
quiet days are also given, bnt these of course are not employed in
calculating the daily means or inequalities.
    The following are the mean results for the entire year : —

  98            Report of the Kew Observatory Committee.
      As in 1895, a Table of recent values of the Magnetic Elements at
  the Observatories whose publications are received at Kew was con
  tributed to ' Science Progress,' appearing in the August number. A
  similar table, but containing more recent data, will be found in
  Appendix Ia to the present Report.
      With the consent of the Committee, an analysis of the non-cyclic
  effects in the Declination, Horizontal Force, and Vertical Force
  results for the selected "quiet days" of the six years 1890 to 1895
  was drawn up and discussed by the Superintendent, and appears as
  the Report of ' the B. A. Committee for the Comparison and Reduc
  tion of Magnetic Observations,' Liverpool, 1896.
      At the request of Professors von Bezold and Eschenhagen, the
  Observatory participated in a combined scheme of eye observations
  of the Declination and Horizontal Force at intervals of five seconds
 during an hour on each of the four days February 27, 28, and
 March 12, 13.       On the two last occasions use was made of a very
  delicate declinometer with quartz fibre suspension, specially devised
  by Professor C. V. Boys, F.R.S., enthusiastic assistance being given
 by Messrs. Cooper and Sansom, students at the Royal College of
  Science, South Kensington.
      Owing to the erratic behaviour of the limelight employed to
 illuminate the declinometer mirror, the results were unfortunately
 less successful than might have been desired.
     The Magnetic Instruments have been studied, and a knowledge of
their manipulation obtained, by Commanders Smyth and Heming and
 Lieutenants Mouro and Somerville, of the Royal Navy.
     Information as to magnetic data or experimental details has been
supplied to Professor Riicker, Dr. E. Atkinson, Lieutenant-Colonel
Gore (Trigonometrical Survey of India), Captain Lyons, R.E., and
Captain Schiick, and the two latter gentlemen compared their in
struments with the Observatory standards.

    The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature of Air and Wet-bulb,
Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain, have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year, and tho
standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records
duly registered.
    The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations, with

               Report  of the Kew Observatory Committee.            99
notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual,
to the Meteorological Office.
   With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, data have been
supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society, the
institute of Mining Engineers, and the editor of ' Symons' Monthly
Meteorological Magazine.'
   During the year there occurred the death of Mr. E. Dagwell, an
assistant principally occupied in the Meteorological Department; his
connection with the Observatory had lasted sincc 1881.
   Slectrograph. — As a result of experimental investigations made in
the present and preceding year, several important changes have been
made in the water-dropping apparatus. A new water reservoir and
overflow tube have been obtained, and the jet has been brought
much nearer the electrometer. The auxiliary battery having con
siderably deteriorated, it was sent to the makers on November 20,
and the instrument in consequence remained out of action until the
end of the year.
   Determinations of the scale value were made on March 30, June 27,
July 27, and October 24, by direct comparison with the Portable
Electrometer, White No. 53.
   Inspections. — In compliance with the request of the Meteorological
Council, the following Observatories and Anemograph Stations have
been visited and inspected : — Yarmouth, North Shields, Alnwick
Castle, Fort William, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Deerness (Orkney)
by Mr. Baker; and Radcliffe Observatory (Oxford), Holyhead, Fleet
wood, Stonyhurst, Armagh, Dublin, Valencia, and Falmouth by Mr.
Constable.
                         III.  Solak Observations.
   Sun-spots.  — Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 161 days, and
the groups numbered, after Schwabe's method.
   Particulars will be found in Appendix II, Table IV.
                        IV.   Experimental  Work.
    Fog and Mist. — The observations of a series of distant objects,
referred to in previous Eeports, have been continued. A note is taken
of the most distant of the selected objects which is visible at each
observation hour.
    Atmospheric Electricity. — The eye observations referred to in last,
 year's Report have been discussed (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 60,
 1896, p. 96).    Some further experiments have been carried out on
                                                                         /*

 100          Report   of the Kew Observatory Committee.
similar lines, and in particular comparisons have been made of the
potential at the spot where the jet of the water-dropper breaks up
with that at a station outside the immediate influence of the Observa
tory buildings.
   Aneroid Barometers. — A large number of experiments have been
made in continuation of those mentioned last year, and the readings
have been reduced.      Further experiments are contemplated. In the
meantime the results are being worked up by the Superintendent.
   Nocturnal Radiation. — The observations with minimum thermo
meters referred to last year hare been continued.
   Platinum Thermometers. — Observations have been made from time
to time of the readings of six platinum thermometers in ice and
steam, and of certain of the number in sulphur vapour and in molten
silver, special attention being paid io changes of zero.
   A series of comparisons of mercury and platinum thermometers
at temperatures above 100° C. has been made, the thermometers
being immersed in a well-stirred fusible metal bath, kindly lent by
Mr. C. T. Heycock, F.R.S., and Mr. Neville.       The comparisons were
initiated by these gentlemen, who visited the Observatory during
several days in January.
   Early in the year a platinum resistance thermometer was buried
underground along with two iron resistance thermometers of a typo-
invented by Professor H. Callendar, F.R.S., and Mr. E. H. Griffiths,
F.R.S. Daring the year readiugs of earth temperatures have been
taken usually twice a day, and a report on the behaviour of the
instruments has been submitted to the Meteorological Council, on
whose behalf the experiments were undertaken.
   Small inconsistencies in the behaviour of the resistance box used
with the platinum thermometers having been brought to light, the
Committee have arranged with Dr. Harker, late of Owens College,
Manchester, to investigate the matter, so that the defect may be
remedied.
   Photographic Test for Lenses. — Difficulties having been repeatedly
met with in applying the present tests for curvature, astigmatism,
and definition, experiments have been made which may lead to
replacing or supplementing these tests by direct observations and
measurements     on a photographic  plate.

102            Report  of  the Kew Observatory Committee.
  The number of instruments rejected in 1895 and 1896 on account
of excessive error or for other reasons was as follows : —

  Five Standard Thermometers have been supplied during the year.
  There were at the end of the year in the Observatory undergoing
verification 10 Barometers, 962 Thermometers, 22 Sextants, 30
Hydrometers, 2 Air Meters, and 1 Sunshine Recorder.
              VI. Rating of Watches      and Chronometers.
   The high standard of excellence to which attention was drawn in
last year's Report has been fully maintained, and there has been a
marked increase in the number of watches which have obtained the
highest possible form of certificate — the class A especially good —
(involving the attaiument of 80 per cent, of the total marks), no less
than 96 being so classed.
   The 583 watches received were entered for trial as below : —
   For class A, 400 ; class B, 115 ; class C, 50 ; and 18 for the subsi
diary trial. Of these 14 passed the subsidiary test. 118 failed from
various causes to gain any certificate; 25 were awarded class 0
certificates, 111 class B, and 315 class A; of the latter, 96 obtained
the highest form of certificate, class A, especially good.
   In Appendix    III will be found a table giving the results of trial
of the 96 watches which gained the highest number of marks during
the year. The first place was taken by Messrs. Stauffer, Son, & Co.,
London, with a keyless, going-barrel, chronometer-watch, No. 147,545,
with the " Tourbillon " escapement, which obtained 89'4 marks out of
a maximum of 100.          The performance of the first 4 watches on
                          "            "
the list, embracing 1       Tourbillon   movement, 2 Bar-levers, and 1
"Karrusel," is very fine, and the marks obtained are unusually close.
   Owing to considerations of space, it is intended to publish in
future annual Reports particulars as to the first 50 watches only
which come up to the standard of 80 marks and over.                   If a
larger number should reach that standard, they will be mentioned in
a full list which will bo sent for publication        to the horological
journals.
   It is intended shortly to suspend the class C test for watches.

                Report of  the Kew Observatory Committee.             103
    ifarine  Chronometers. — During the year, Gl chronometers have been
entered for the Kew A and B trials, of which 51 were certificated,
and 10 failed to pass.
    The new gas boiler for the watch oven has been very successful,
and the difficulty of regularly maintaining the temperature at about
90°   F. has been greatly reduced, and a considerably higher tempera
ture could be easily obtained.
    The improvements to the refrigerator mentioned in last year's
Report have also proved      oF cousiderable advantage.
    The   mean   time standard clock " French " has had new seconds
contact pieces, &c., fitted to it by Dent & Co., and has been fixed in
a new position in the South Hall, where the daily range of tempera
ture is but small.
                            VII.  Miscellaneous.
    Paper. — Prepared photographic paper has been supplied to the
Observatories at Hong Kong, Lisbon, Mauritius, St. Petersburg,
Toronto, Oxford (Radcliffe),and Stonyhurst, and through the Meteo
rological Office to Aberdeen, Batavia, Fort William, and Valencia.
    Anemograph and Sunshine Sheets have also been sent to Hong Kong
and Mauritius, and papier Sa.re to Coimbra.
    Exhibition at Glasgow. — A selection of photographic curves from
 the   various self-recording instruments, along     with photographs of
clouds and of sun spots, was shown during the       summer at an exhibi
 tion promoted by the Corporation of Glasgow.       The exhibits have all
heen safely returned.
    Souse, Grounds, and Paths. — These have         been  kept  as  usual
 throughout the year.
     Dines' Pressure Tube Anemometer. — A self-recording tube anemo
 meter belonging to the Meteorological Office was erected on the roof
early in December. Its vane is approximately at the same level as
 the cups of the standard " Robinson " Anemometer.
     Ships' Compasses. — The test applied to ships' compasses has been
 revised and extended, with the kind assistance of Captain E. W.
 Creak, K.N., F.R.S., so as to bring it more into line with that
 approved by the Admiralty ; and it is intended shortly to put the
 new regulations into operation. With a view to doing so, an appa
  ratus has been obtained from Mr. A. W. Dover, similar to that em
  ployed at Deptford, for determining the accuracy of the compass
  bowl and card and the strength of the magnets.
     Travellers' Azimuth Compasses. — Special experiments, approved by
  Mr. Francis Galton, Chairman of the Committee, have been applied
  to a variety of old and new compasses, submitted on behalf of the

104                   Report of the Kew Observatory Committee.

submitted.
    Library. — During the year the Committee lost the valuable services
of Mr. R. S. Whipple, son of the late Superintendent, who had acted
as Librarian and Accountant.        The vacancy thus occasioned on the
staff has been filled by the appointment of Mr. G. E. Bailey, pre
 viously employed in library and bursarial work at King's College,
 Cambridge.
   The number of publications received during the year was much as
usual.    Volumes 14 to 36 of the 5th Series of the 'Philosophical
            '
Magazine have been purchased to fill a gap.
   Audit, Sfc. — The accounts for 1896 have been audited by Mr. W. B.
Keen, Chartered Accountant, on behalf of the Royal Society, and
by Mr. R. H. Scott on behalf of the Committee.
   The present system of book-keeping having now been in operation
for two years, the comparison of the expenditure of the present and
previous years, suspended in 1895, has been resumed; it will be
found on the opposite page.
     The Committee found themselves in a position to purchase in
November £400 India 3i per cent. Inscribed Stock.
                         Personal Establishment.
   The staff employed is as follows   : —

   The results given in the following tables are deduced from the
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration. These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the
S-inch Unifilar Magnetometer bv Jones.
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
No. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3£ inches in length.
   The Declination and Force values given in Tables      to      are                              I   VIII

Report of Magnetical Observations at Falmouth Observatory
      for the Year 1896. Latitude 50° 9' 0" N. and Longit.udo
      5° 4' 35" W. ; height, 167 feet above mean sea-level.
   These observations have been made by instruments purchased from
the Goverument Grant Fund administered by the Royal Society.
   Photographic curves of Magnetic Declination and of Horizontal
Force variations have been regularly taken throughout the past year,
with the exception of three days in December, and the magnets have
worked satisfactorily throughout.
   The results obtained from tho Vertical Force Magnet aro not
sufficiently reliable for publication.
   The scale values of the instruments were determined on 1st
January, 1897. The following values of the ordinates of the photo
graphic curves were then found : —
      Declination,   1   cm. = 0° ll--7.
      Bifilar, 1 cm.   o  H. =  0-00050 C.G.S. unit.
   The principal magnetic disturbances recorded during the year
occurred on the following dates : — January 3, 4, 5, 31 ; February 2,
4, 28; March 4, 26, 27, 28; April 22, 23, 24; May 2, 3, 17, 18, 20;
June 16 ; July 3, 4, 5 ; August 1,2; September 18 ; October 11, 12 ;
December 3, 4.
   Observations     with the Absohite Instruments          have   been made
monthly, of which the following is a summary : —
        Determinations of Horizontal Intensity, 34.
                  „            Inclination,           34 sets of four.
                  „            absolute Declination, 34.
   Following the method adopted in the five previous years, it is
intended that the observations be reduced, and that the Declination
and Horizontal Force curves for five quiet days in each month of the
year — selected by the Astronomer Royal — be tabulated and prepared
for publication, in accordance with the International scheme. The
results will be printed in the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society's
                                                    '
Annual Report, and also in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society.
   The following are the principal results of the magnetic elements
for the year 1896 : —
        Mean Westerly Declina(ion, 18° 47''5.
        Mean Inclination,                67° 5'-0.
        Mean Horizontal Force,           0-18554 C.G.S. unit.

 128              Report  of Magnetical   Observations  at
    The Declination and Horizontal Force are deduced from hourly
readings of the photographic curves, and so are corrected for the
diurnal variation.
    The Inclination is the mean of the absolute observations, the mean
 time of which is 3 p.m.
    In Table V, X is the mean of tho absolute valnes observed during
the month (generally three in number), uncorrected for diurnal
variations and for any disturbance.     Y is the mean of tho products of
 the Dips and X.
    The results in the following tables, Nos. I, II, III, IV, are deduced
from the magnetograph curves which have been standardised by
 observations of deflection and vibration.        These were made with
 the Collimator Magnet marked 66a, and the Declinometer Magnet
 marked 66c in the Unifilar Magnetometer (No. 66) by Elliott Brothers,
 of. London.    Table No. V is deduced from these observations.       The
temperature correction (which is probably very small) has not been
 applied.
    The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Dover,
 of Charlton, Kent, No. 86, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3^ ins.
in length, the results of which appear in Table VI.
    The Declination and Horizontal Force values given in Tables to    I
 IV are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in tho
fifth report of the Committee of the British Association on com
paring and reducing magnetic observations, and the time given is
 Greenwich mean time, which is 20 min. 18 sec. earlier than local time.
    The following is a list of the days during the year 1896 which
were selected by the Astronomer Bx>yal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
.employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

 The Magnetic Hut in the garden has been painted inside and out,
 and tho Magnetic Chamber thoroughly drained, to prevent the

 recurrence of flooding during periods of excessive rainfall.     The
 Photographic curves were suspended for four days in November
owing to the presence of workmen in the chamber.
    The Committee appointed by the British Association in 1895 to
 make a comparison of tho Magnetic Standard Instruments in use at
 the several Magnotic Observatories in the Kingdom presented their
Report at the Liverpool meeting of the Association, held August,
1896'.   Referring to Falmouth, the Committee, of whom Professor
A. W. Riicker, M.A., F.R.S., was chairman, state inter alia : — " The
work of the Falmouth Observatory is hampered by want of funds.
The ~Vertical Force recording instrument has never worked properly,
and appears to want extensive alterations.    The Observations made
by the Superintendent, Mr. E. Kitto, are of a very high order of
excellence, and it is to be hoped that the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic
Society, by which the Observatory was founded, will be able to
ensure the maintenance of the Magnetic Observations under the best
conditions."

    On the occasion of the discussion on " Variation in Plants and
 Animals," which took place on February 25, 1895, it occurred to me
 that it might be useful to give an illustration of the amount of
 change which had been effected in a plant by continuous selection
 under cultivation in a comparatively short time. I, therefore, placed
 upon the table an example of the wild and of the cultivated form of
 the garden "cineraria" (C. cruenta).
    The choice of this species was purely accidental. It was, however,
 violently impugned. It was contended that the garden cineraria was
 not the result of the development of a single species, but that it was
 of multiple origin, and the result of the intercrossing of several.    It
 was further contended that its change from the wild form had not
 been gradual, but by discontinuous steps or " sports."     Neither con
 tention seemed to me well founded. But 1 admit that, owing to the
 lapse of time since the so-called
                                      " improvement " of the cineraria
 commenced, it is impossible to give formal proof that the process has
 been what I described.      Mr. Darwin met with the same difficulty.
                 "
 He remarks : We know hardly anything about the origin or history

                                                  however, well known, he
regarded them as the result of accumulation by selection of successive
slight variations. But he also tells us that "the chance will be
infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow,
varying, and insensible changes."
   It seemed to me important, therefore, to obtain the history of some
cultivated plant which would not be open to the objections urged in
the case of the cineraria.

cultivated in Europe at Lille in 1731,f having been introduced from
 Persia. There must have been some error as to its origin, for
Boissier points out that the species          not found in that country.

is  known to have been a variety with white flowers.             As will be
 shown, the forms now in cultivation have been derived from           white- a

Lille plant.

   Early in the century some colour variations were in cultivation.
 Several as well as the typical C. persicum were figured in the ' Flore
              '
des Serres in 1877 (t. 2345).              These record the amount of change
from the wild type which had heen accomplished in a centory and a
half.    One striking seminal sport (C. persicum, var. laciniatum) is
                   '                         '
figured in the Botanical Register in 1827 (t. 1095).                    It is remark
able for spreading corolla-segments broader than usual, and cut at
the edges. It does not appear to have been perpetuated, but in some
degree it anticipated some of the remarkable modern developments.
   I  am informed by Mr. James Martin, the accomplished propagator
of Messrs. Sutton, that the recent remarkable development of the
cyclamen began about 1860, and, at any rate in their hands, started
with the old " crimson and white."               It will be seen from the accom
panying figures how little this differs from the wild type. Fig. 1
                                         Fio. I.
represents a flower of the latter from a plant imported by Messrs.
Sutton from Syria after six years of cultivation.                   It is not appre
ciably   altered.      Fig.  2  represents     a  flower   of  their   "crimson and
white ;
         "  it only differs from the wild type in having shorter, broader,
and less twisted corolla segments.
   In considering the progress which has been made since 1860
under the skilful hands of Mr. Martin and others, it is important
to bear in mind that there is no question of hybridity. Cyclamen
latifolium has resisted every attempt to cross it with any other
species.     We are dealing then with the evolution under artificial

     Mr. Martin strongly insists on the principle laid down by Mr.
 Darwin from De Vilmorin, that "the first step is to get the plant
 to vary in any manner whatever." - As Mr. Martin puts it, " the
 breeder must work with nature."              It is his practice to seize the
 .smallest deviation, even so small an indication as the slightest differ-
 once in a cotyledon of a germinating seed.                The first direction of
 work would, however, for commercial purposes, be to develop the
  size of the corolla.       Figs. 3 and 4 show two stages which have been
 reached    by progressive selection from
                                                       " crimson and white."
 Messrs. Sutton have sent me photographs of the largest flowers
 hitherto produced by them.            Fig. 5 is copied from one of these.
  The vertical depth is 3 in. This is more than double that of the
 form with which they started; the increase in breadth of the
  segments     is at least six times.       This represents the continuous
  work of forty years.          As the work was not done for a scientific
  purpose,  the   whole   of  the progressive steps have not been preserved
  or recorded. Only saleable stages have survived.                But Mr. Martin
  emphatically denies that they have been attained by other than pro
  gressive selection or that they have been reached by leaps and
  bounds. In developing any particular character it is, to use his
  own words, always done by a " ladder," i.e., continuous self-fortilisa-

tion and selection.       The stage shown in fig. 3 owes its preservation
to its having    retained   fragrance. Beyond this stage fragrance has
been lost.
   An interesting question is whether there is any limit to the ex
tent to which an organ can be developed, and if so, what p It is to
be hoped that Mr. Martin will continue his work in this direction
and strive, if only as a matter of scientific interest, to increase the
sizo of the corolla to the maximum possible.           The only check will
probably   be   found  to  be the general  balance ox nutrition.

                               Spreading.
   I was much struck to find amongst a magnificent series of speci
mens, kindly sent me by Messrs. Sutton, forms with the segments
of the corolla spreading instead of reflexed (fig. 6).  I have received
even   more  striking examples    from    Messrs. Hugh Low.      This is
remarkable because, as    I have already pointed out, the latter is a
distinctive generic character in Cyclamen.       Although the alteration
in the appearance of the flower is enormous, the structural change is
slight. It is merely a matter of direction of growth.       It amounts,
however, to the loss of a generic character and a reversion to a more
generalised type.    The change is therefore essentially atavistic.
   I was unable to obtain from Mr. Martin any explanation of how
this particular variation had come about, but he informed me that it
had been of frequent occurrence.      Spreading flowers had always been
destroyed as departing from a desirable type.         More recently, on
account of their orchid-like habit, they had taken the popular fancy,
and had b;en preserved.

                                 Doubling.
   Even in the wild type there is a tendency to a slight multiplication
of the corolla segments.    Mr. Martin has worked upon this, and has
produced flowers such as shown in fig. 7. He seems to think that
there is no limit to which this multiplication cannot be carried prac

tically, and hopes in time to produce " mop-headed       flowers like a
chrysanthemum.      The  so-called doubling of flowers, as in the rose,
is a teratological phenomenon, and is due to the conversion of
stamens into petals.    But in Cyclamen this ia not the case.        The
 stamens, which are normally equal in number to the corolla seg
ments, are also multiplied.    Although a quinary symmetry is general
in the Primulacece, Trientalis, a near ally of Cyclamen, ordinarily ex
hibits a considerable range in the number of parts of the flower.
Here again Cyclamen, under artificial conditions, shows a reversion
to a more generalised type.

                                      Colour.
    There is evidence that seminal variation ns regards colours occurred
 at least as early as 1820, but the modern forms with large coloured
 flowers, according to Mr. Martin, originated in a different way and
can bo traced back to the old crimson and white.                     That preserves
the crimson ring round the throat, bat is otherwise an albino. There
is nothing remarkable in this. Any species in nature may produce
white flowers ; albinism is in effect the commonest of all variations.
" Giant white " (figs. 4 and
                                 5) is a pure albino, in which the crimson
ring has been suppressed.
    The modern coloured forms were obtained in the first instance by
selecting forms in which the coloured ring showed a disposition to-
spread into the white corolla segments.             The first indication would
be a scarcely perceptible streak.           By selection from self-fertilised
plants   the streak was  widened    into  a stripe. Continuing the process,
the stripes united, and a uniformly coloured flower was obfained.
    The more striking colours, such as that of " Vulcan," which is a
dark crimson, were, however, obtained not by progressive selection,
but amongst the progeny of cross-fortilised plants.
    I learn from Messrs. Hugh Low and Co. that coloured varieties,
of course when self-fertilised, come true from seed. This is in accord
ance with a well-known principle.*

favoured me with the following detailed account of the mode in
which the strain has been developed and improved. I quote it in his
own words : —
    " Les Cyclamen Papilio que j'ai obtenus sont issus direotement des
Cyclamen persicum, var. giganteum.
    "II  y a environ une douzaine d'annees je remarquais parmi mes
semis de Cyclamen une plante qui attira mon attention par l'extreme
beaute de son feuillage dentele et marbre.      En examinant la plante, je
vis qn'elle portait une grande quantite de boutons ; ceux-ci etaient de
forme plus arrondie et plus courte que ne le sont generalement cenx
des Cyclamen persicum.         La plante fut mise a part; quand elle
commenca a fleurir, elle m'etonna par la forme bizarre de ses fleurs.
Ces diverses circonstances m'engagerent a en recolter les graines.
    " L'ann£e suivante j'obtins quelques jeunes plantes.        Au moment
de leur floraison, elles purent etre comparees a la plante mere.
    " Les plus parfaites de ces plantes f urent choisies pour servir de
porte-graine, et leurs fleurs furent fecondees entre elles.         L'annee
suivante je fus assez heurcux pour constater un nouveau progres ;
mes gains surpassaient leurs parents que j'avais conserves.              On
pouvait apercevoir, dans ces semis aux caracteres persistants, le point
de depart d'une race nouvelle.
    "Jo continual dans cette voie ; au bout de quatre ans, j'etais en
possession de quelques sujets fort remarqnes.         Les petales des fleurs
etaient aroples et plus longs ; ils se redressaient comme les ailcs
d'un papillon qui s'apprete a prendre son vol.
    " La race se caructerisa chaque annee davantage.
    "
      Encourage par le resultat tleja obtenu, je m'occupai a rechercher
la diversity des coloris.   Apres quatre annees je ne possedais dans mes
semis que des plantes a fleurs rouges; j'avais en triant les sujets
pour la reproduction toujours ecarte les fleurs les moins brillantes.
 11 s'agissait maintcnant    d'obtenir des fleurs a couleurs pales.      Des
efforts   nonveaux  furent  fait dans  cette voie; je  vis au  bout de deux
ans apres apparaitre la premiere fleur aux petales blancs et a onglet
rouge; des lors les croisements se multiplierent au point qu'apr^s la
nenvieme annee la perfection des formes et des coloris est telle que
tons ceux qui voient mes Cyclamen Papilio sont unanimes a recon-
naitre leur meVite et leur perfection des fleurs."
    In this case the basis of the new strain was found in a marked
variation or '' sport."    The deviation from the type could not, how
ever, have been very marked.            The most remarkable feature in
"Papilio" as now developed       is the curled and toothed margin of the
corolla segments.    These peculiarities repeat characters which occur
elsewhere in the order.       In Soldanella the toothing is conspicuous ;
curling occurs in cultivated varieties of Primula sinensis.            It is

 there was a   correlation between the toothing of the corolla segments
and of the leaves.
                                 Cresting.
    The most remarkable form which has made its appearance under
cultivation is that in which a plamose crest has developed on the
inner surface of each corolla segment.         This is shown in fig. 10,
                                  Fio. 10.
which represents the " Bush Hill Pioneer," raised by Messrs. Hugh
Low and Co. I quote the account of its development with which
they have been so good as to furnish me : —
   " This
           interesting variety was first observed in our nurseries some
four years since, but how it originated we are unable to say.
   " At that time, the only peculiarity about the variety was a very
slightly raised rib running part of the way up the petals, and showing
mo tendency to branch.      This was, however, considered sufficiently
curious to follow up, and we seeded it with its own pollen.
    " The young plants from this showed a decided improvement, the
rib in some cases showing a marked tendency to branch. The best
varieties (ten in number) were again fertilised with their own pollen,
and the plants now being exhibited by us have resulted, although
needless to say, they are among the finest obtained up to the present
though all show a further improvement, every flower having a well-
branched feather on the petals.
    " We have this
                       year found some colour in one plant, and we

146                          Mr. W. T. Thiselton Dyer.
believe we shall have no trouble in obtaining crested flowers in a
variety of colours."
    The corolla segments of Cyclamen have no mid-rib. The appearance
of such a structure is a reversion to the original leaf-type.                        The
development of a crest from a mid-rib carries reversion very far back
indeed.        The branching of a leaf-strncture in the plane in which it is
expanded is common enough ; branching in a plane at right angles
to this is rare.              Leafy outgrowths frequently occur from the
mid-rib in the cabbage.*                 In this case the structure of the leaf
approximates to that of a stem, of which, indeed, the leaf may be
regarded as a modification.
    An interesting fact with regard to this singular variation is that
it has appeared more than once, and independently. It first occurred
in 1885, but seems afterwards to have been lost sight of.f It has
also occurred in a red-flowered form in France,               J  in which case it was
also perpetuated by seed.
    I have not succeeded in discovering any similar structure in any
primulaceous plant occurring in a wild state.                      Dr. Masters, how
ever, informs me that it has been observed in cultivated forms of
Primula sinensis. The tendency thus seems to be latent in the order,
though why it should be so I am unable to explain.
    Some theoretical interest appears to me to attach to the rapid
development of so striking an ornament of a corolla segment.                        Such
appendages          are frequent enough in orchids, and are regarded as
adaptations to cross-fertilisation by insects.              Their gradual evolution
 might be thought to require a long period of time ; but in the
present case we have definite evidence that such a structure may be
 developed by selection with great rapidity.
                                          Conclusion.
     1.   The facts which        I  have stated appear to me to establish the
 result that when once specific stability§ has been broken down in a
 plant, morphological changes of great variety and magnitude can be
 brought about in a comparatively short space of time. This appears
 to me to have a very important bearing on the rate of evolution.
 Mr. Darwin quotes Lord Kelvin as insisting " that the world at a
 very early period was subjected to more rapid and violent changes in
 its physical condition than those now occurring;" and he adds,
 " Such
             changes would have tended to induce changes at a corre-

 may be effected      with   considerable          rapidity    cannot,    I think, be
 denied.
    2. It is further, I think, abnndantly proved in the present cast-
 that, though sudden variations do occur, they are, as far as we know,
 slight as long as self-fertilisation            is adhered to.         The striking
results obtained by cultivators have been due to the patient accumu
lation by selection of gradual but continuous variation in any
desired direction.
    3. The size which any variable organ can reach does not appear to
be governed by any principle of correlation.                  Large flowers are not
necessarily accompanied       by  large      leaves.     Under     natural conditions
size is controlled by mechanical limitations and by the principle of
economy.      Nature cannot afford to indulge in anything unnecessary
for the purpose in view.f
    4. The general tendency of a plant varying freely under artificial
conditions seems to be atavistic, i.e., to shed adaptive modifications
which have ceased to be useful, and either to revert to a more gene
ralised type or to reproduce " characters which are already present
in other members of the same group."J                       This conclusion must,
however, be accepted with       caution,       for  we  must    remember that in a
case like the present we are only acquainted with variations which
have been preserved with a particular end in view.
                    "
    5. The case of    cresting" shows that the plant still possesses the
power to strike out a new line and to develop characters which
would even be regarded as having specific value, as in the total
change which has been effected in the form of the leaf in Primula
 sinensis.  If such a race developed any degree of sterility with other
 races it would have satisfied Huxley's criterion for the artificial
production of a new species.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Sir John Eric Erichsen, Bart., Surgeon Extraordinary            to tho
Queen, who died un September 23, 1896, will, without doubt, take
rank amongst the most distinguished surgeons of the century. There
must be very few of the present generation of practitioners of furgery
in English-speaking countries who have not come under his influence,
at any rate indirectly ; for his book nn the Science and Art of
Surgery, which made its first appearance in 1853, at once took a
foremost place as the principal text-book of that subject, a place
which in successive editions, to the number of ten, it has maintained
ever since.    Nor has it failed to be translated into most European
languages, and even, it is said, into Chinese
   Erichsen was descended, on the father's side, from a Danish family,
whose importance is still testified in Copenhagen by the palace
which bears the same name.       On his mother's side he sprang from a
Somersetshire stock — the Govetts. He was born on July 19, 1818,
in Copenhagen, but was educated in England.          After the termina
tion of his school    career, he  entered   as a  student at University
Colloge. where Liston was then the chief surgeon, and where also he
came under the strong personal influence of William Sharpey, who,
as in so many other cases, early discovered the scientific bent in young
Erichsen's character, and was instrumental in directing it into a
useful field. Having, like many other professional men, more leisure
in the early period of his career than he ever had in the later,
Erichsen devoted himself to the study of physiology, and for a
time taught the subject at the Westminster Hospital Medical School.
He acted in 1844 as Secretary to the Section of Physiology of the
British Association, and was the working member of a small com-
mittee appointed by the Association to undertake an experimental
enquiry into the mechanism and effects of asphyxia, and the pre
vention and treatment of that condition.         His researches on this
subject  were  published   in 1845, and  his labours were recognised by
his bQing awarded a gold medal, of the value of 50 guineas, by the
Royal Humane Society.
   In those days, no edncation in medicine and surgery was considered
complete unless it had been supplemented by residence in Paris, and
attendance upon the cliniques of the great French physicians and
surgeons.    Accordingly we find Erichsen pursuing his studies in
 that capital, and, amongst other things, present on tho first occasion
 of the performance of a colotomy, by Amussat.
   vol. LIl.                                                     b

   Erichsen had not for long leisure to devote to scientific pursuits,
for, owing partly to his exceptional ability, partly to extraneous
circumstances, his advancement     in the profession of surgery was
very rapid.   Liston had died suddenly, from aneurism, in 1847, and
his place was filled for a short period by Syme, who soon, however,
returned to Edinburgh. Mr. Richard Quain then became surgeon
to the hospital, and with him was associated as Professor of Surgery,
Mr. Arnott, at that time senior surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital.
The position of assistant surgeon, which was rendered vacant by
Quain's advancement, was filled by the appointment of Erichsen.
This position he only held for two years, for at the end of that time
Arnott resigned his chair and the surgeoncy to University College
Hospital, and Erichsen was appointed by the Council of the College
to succeed him. This was in 1850, and at the early age of thirty-two.
How abundantly the choice of the Council was justified is shown by
the brilliant success which attended his teaching. It is not too
much to say that the reputation of the School of Medicine at Univer
sity College, as a training place for practical and scientific surgery.
is due in no small measure to his influence.
   Erichsen held the Piofessorsbip of Surgery for sixteen years, and
then exchanged it for the Chair cf Clinical Surgery, which he held
for another nine years, so that he was for a quarter of a century
occupying a leading position in the teaching of surgery in one of the
first medical schools in the kingdom.      Apart, therefore, from the
indirect influence exerted by his writings, the direct influence he
exerted in the training of students for the medical profession was
considerable. And it must be recorded of him that, unlike many a
brilliant surgeon of his time, he regarded, and taught his pupils to
regard, surgery as a science to be studied rather than simply as an
art to be displayed —a line of thought which has been pursued with
conspicuous success by the most eminent of those pupiL, the preoent
President of this Society,
   Although essentially an all-round surgeon, and one whose opinion
in any branch of surgery was regarded, and rightly so, as of more
than average weight, there were one or two branches to which
EricbsMi more especially devoted his attention,    Early in his career
he took up the subject of aneurism — always one of great interest to
him — and contributed several articles dealing with its pathology and
treatment. Later, he turned his attention to the important, and at
the time ill-understood, subject of the results of railway injuries,
a subject upon which he was for many years the acknowledged
 authority.
    Erichsen possessed a singularly attractive personality, with a
courteous and winning niahner, which reflected the kindly nature
within, and a dignified presence, without a tinge of pomposity. His

                                      Ill
language, whether in public or private utterance, was always well
chosen, his manner of speaking cleat- and to the point, his material well
arranged.     These qualities, although he possessed no particular gift
of eloquence, made it always a pleasure to listen to him. A pror
minent characteristic of the man was his tact in dealing with difficult
situations, and, it may be ndded, with difficult people.   He was always
ready, when appealed to, to afford assistance by advice, or even in a
more material way, to his friends and professional brethren who might
stand in need of such assistance, and many a young man has bene
fitted by his thoughtful liberality.      Small wonder that he was highly
regarded in the profession of which he was so distinguished an orna
ment, and by the colleagues and pupils with whom he was so long
and so honourably associated.      His eminence in surgery Was acknow
ledged by the Royal College of Surgeons, in 1880, in electing him to
occupy the presidential chair, and at the International           Medical
Congress, in 1881. in his selection to preside over the section of
surgery at the meeting in London.          He was also President for three
 years of the Royal Medical and Chirurgkal Society. He was a
member of the Royal Commission on Vivisection, which sat in 1875,
and was the first Inspector for England and Scotland under the Act
which resulted from the sittings of that Commission. He was
elected a Fellow of this Society in 1876. He contested the Univer
sities of Edinburgh and St. Andrews, in 1885, in the Liberal interest,
but without success. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from
the University of Edinburgh, on the occasion of the tercentenary
celebration, and was besides the recipient of numerous honours,
culminating in the somewhat tardy recognition of his merits by the
 Government in creating him a baronet, in 1895. But the honour
which he, perhaps, chiefly prized was that which his Alma Mater
Hid him and herself in electing him, in 1887, to the important
and dignified position of President of the Council of University
College, a position which he occupied until his death, to the manifest
advantage of both the College and the Hospital, with which his
whole career had been so closely interwoven.
    Erichsen was married, in 1842, to Mary Elisabeth, daughter of
 Captain Thomas Cole, R.N. They had no children.          His wife died in
 1893, aud was buried at Hampstead Cemetery, and he was himself
 hiid to rest in the same grave, on September 26, 1896.
                                                               E. A. S.
    Samuel James Augustus Salteb, or James Salter, us he always
 called himself, came from a medical family at Poole, various
 members of which achieved distinction in medicine or in science.
 He was born in 1825, and received his medical education at King's
 College. How well he spout his pupil days may be gleaned from

                                            IV
  the  fact that     ho  graduated as M.B. at the London            University, and
 acted as one of Fergusson's house- surgeons.                His uncle, Mr. Thomas
  Bell, the eminent zoologist, was one of the few highly trained dental
  surgeons of his day, and induced his nephew to join him in partuer
  ship, as also in the conduct of the dental department of Guy's
  Hospital.      The foundations of his fortunes were thus laid, to the
  detriment, it must be feared, of his work in science.                Immersed as
  he was in pmctice he still found time to interest himself in scientific
  pursuits, and was an active member of several societies, medical and
  other.
     He was also the author of a paper in the ' Philosophical Transac
        '
  tions on the "Structure and Growth of the Tooth in Echinus," and
  in 1863 became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He had become a
  Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1853.
     His work 'Dental Pathology and Surgery,' 18T4, at once secured
  him a leading place, but the time expended in its preparation had
 been so great that it is to be feared that the work was hardly issued
 before it was out of date*
     Salter had a good general knowledge of botany, and it is to him
 that we owe the discovery of a fnct the full significance of which is
 not worked out yet. This consisted in the discovery of perfectly
 formed pollen grains within the tissue of the nucellns of the ovule,
                                                 '
 as recorded and figured in the                    Transactions of the Linnean
 Society,' vol. 24, 1863, p. 143, pi. 24. Whether the megasporange was
 developed or not, we do not know, nor what were the precise cells
 engaged in forming pollen grains in this extraordinary position.                  It
 is to be hoped that some future investigator may be able to supply
 information on these points. That the condition is not confined to
 passion flowers we know from having seen a like state of affairs in
 Rosa canina.
     On qnitting his profession, Salter retired also from London life
 into the country, where he occupied himself with rural pursuits and
 horticulture, and amnsed himself with heraldry and archaeology.
     Personally, he was most amiable, and so stocked with gene-al
 knowledge that he was a delightful companion and ready to afford
 help where help was needed.            He married late in life, but his wife
predeceased him by a year or two.              He died March, 1897.
                                                                       M. T. M.
    * This, his only book, wa« rather the expansion of the writer's notes and experi
ences over a long series of years than a complete systematic treatise on the subject,
und so had a kind of personal character.       And although, after the manner of so
many of the scientific writers of that day, he sometimes plunged into wurm con
troversy, and not always, as things have turned out, on the right >ide; yet his
work remains of solid value as a record of original and thoughtful observation, and
as such is still frequently quoied in the text -books of to-day.          C. S. T.

            The Cultural Evolution        of Cyclamen latifolium.                147
sponding rate in the organisms which then existed."*                   That changes
may be effected with considerable rapidity cannot,                      I think, be
denied.
   2. It is further,  I   think, abundantly proved in the present case
that, though sudden variations do occur, they are, as far as we know,
slight as long as self -fertilisation is adhered to.                   The striking
results obtained by cultivators have been due to the patient accumu
lation by selection of gradual but continuous variation in any
desired direction.
   3. The size which any variable organ can reach does not appear to
be goveraed by any principle of correlation.                Large flowers are not
necessarily accompanied by large          leaves.     Under       natural conditions
size is controlled by mechanical limitations and by the principle of
economy. Nature cannot afford to indulge in anything unnecessary
for the purpose in view.t
   4. The general tendency of a plant varying freely under artificial
conditions seems to be atavistic, i.e., to shed adaptive modifications
which have ceased to be useful, and either to revert to a more gene
ralised type or to reproduce " characters which are already present
in other members of the same group."J                     This conclusion must,
however, be accepted with caution, for we must remember that in a
case like the present we are only acquainted with variations which
have been preserved with a particular end in view.
   5. The case of
                   " cresting" shows that the plant still possesses the
power to strike out a new line and to develop characters which
would even be regarded as having specific value, as in the total
change which has been effected in the form of the leaf in Primula
sinensis. If such a race developed any degree of sterility with other
races it would have satisfied Huxley's criterion for the artificial
production of a new species.

                                     I. Introduction.
    The study of stellar spectra from the time of Rutherfurd to the
present shows us that only a very small number of groups is in
question. We seem to be in presence of an evolution in which only
a very few variables are in operation, and in my opinion the pheno
mena suggest that the only variable of paramount importance is
temperature.
    In working out the classification of stellar spectra, which                  I  com
municated to the Royal Society in 1888, the course pursued was to
study the flutings and lines of the various elements given in the
existing lists and to fill up gaps in them by fresh experimental work
with the view of finding the necessary criteria.
    The question, however, was complicated by the discovery in stellar
spectra of many lines, the origin of which could not be stated.
     Some time has now elapsed since my classification was published.
In the meanwhile the attempts to trace the origin of the unknown
lines have been continued, and the discovery of terrestrial sources of
helium, and probably other gases, has thrown a flood of new light
upon stellar chemistry.
    I  propose in the present paper to trace the history of the criteria
now at our disposal in the study of the phenomena of the hottest
stars and to give the results of my latest researches.                   In the present
communication, thus limited in scope, we are only concerned with
spectral line phenomena, and it is important that some of the main
points connected with line spectra in their relation to celestial bodies
should be referred to by way of introduction to the later results.
                        The Criterion    of Long and Short Lines.
     In November,        1872,*   I  showed that when an image of an electric
spark is thrown on the slit of a spectroscope the lines are seen of

different lengths, and I indicated by means of photographs how very
definite these phenomena were. The adoption of this method of
work enabled me to establish that when a metallic vapour is sub
jected at any one temperature to admixture with another gas or
vapour, or to reduced pressure, its spectrnm becomes simplified by
the abstraction of the shortest lines and by the thinning of many
lines.
    In  the same paper,     I  pointed out that
                                                       " these observations have
an important bearing upon the solar spectrum, for the reason that,
as is well known, all the lines known to exist in the spectrum of an
element supposed to be present in the sun's atmosphere are not in all
cases reversed" (p. 261).          Maps were given which showed "that
invariably the reversed lines are simply those which are longest in the
spectrum.   ...   It supplies us at once with the true test to apply to
the reversal of solar lines and a guide of the highest value in
.spectrum     observations of the chromosphere and photosphere"
(p. 264).
    In another communication,* in November, 1873,                  I added that
" the test formerly relied on to decide the presence or absence of a
metal in the sun (namely, the presence or absence of the brightest
and strongest lines of the metal in question in the average solar
 spectrum) was not a final one; and that the true test was the
 presence or absence of the longest line, being that which remains
 longest in the spectrum when the pressure of the vapour is
reduced."
    In this paper   I  gave a photograph of the spectrum of iron pro
duced when an image of a horizontal arc was projected on to the
 vertical slit of a Steinheil spectroscope.            A spectrum of long and
-short lines is obtained in this way, precisely as in the case of the
 spark, except that the phenomena are much better seen. The long
 lines represent the vapours which extend furthest from the centre
of the arc, the short lines those which exist only at the centre.
    On the strength of the criterion thus established, I was enabled
to announce the presence of many metallic elements in the sun's
atmosphere.
       Some Short Lines indicate -he Effects         of High Temperatures.
    It was generally assumed in the first instance that the short line
 were true products of the greater heat of the core of the arc.
    Subsequent work with the jar spark, in 1876 1 and 1878,+ showed
 that at spark temperatures some of the shorter arc lines behaved

differently from others.        Among these lines may be mentioned the
 two lines of calcium producing the solar lines S and K and two
 lines of iron at 4924' 1 and 5018'6 (XXR). These lines were enhanced
 in intensity on passing to the temperature of the spark, while a large
 number of similar lines disappeared, and it was found that the lines
 thus enhanced in intensity were of considerable importance in the
spectrum of the solar chromosphere.
    These facts seemed to show that short lines might be produced by
two causes : (1) the increased temperature of the core ; (2) the rapid
breaking up of the solid metal used as poles into various complex
molecular groupings as the vapours passed from the core to the outer
edge of the arc.*      This last action was apparently responsible for by
far the greater portion of the short lines.
                          Flame, Arc, and Spark Lines.
    In  1879   I attempted to carry the matter further by volatilising
those substances which give us spectra in a Bunsen flame and
passing a strong spark through the flame, first during the process of
volatilisation, the substance being put into the flame just below the
platinums, and then after the temperature of the flame has produced
all the simplification it is capable of producing,* the substance in
this case being introduced into the base of the flame.             The passage
from flame to spark represented a stronger case than the passage
from arc to spark, and the view that the above-named two causes
were at work was greatly strengthened by the observation of mag
nesium, lithium, and other metals recorded. In the first place, the
differences observed         in dealing with different quantities were
attributed to the fact that " the more there is to dissociate, the more
time is required to run through the series, and the better the first
stages are seen."
    Further, lines invisible in the flame spectrum when the spark was
not passing were rendered visible by the passage of the spark. The
blue line of lithium about X 4602 and the line of magnesium about
X 4481 may be given as examples.                Some of the flame lines were
dimmed or became invisible at the time of the production of the new
lines. The lines intensified by the spark in the flame were the same
as those enhanced on the passage from the arc to the spark.
    This strengthened the view that the result of a higher temperature
was to produce an important change in the spectrum, and it was con
ceivable that in a space entirely heated up to the highest tem
perature the spectrum would consist entirely of the enhanced lines.
    The employment of the flame in the experiment just referred to
suggested a series of observations at flame temperatures with a view

of determining     exactly   the difference between          the    flame and arc
spectra.
   The general result of this line of work was to show that there was
a step  similar in kind to that from arc to spark between the flame
and arc.    To take iron as a case in point, a few lines only constitute
the spectrum of the flame.          The number is enormously increased on
passing to the arc, but none of the flame lines are dropped.
    A very important fact to be borne in mind is that the intensities
of the lines common to the flame, arc, and spark differ greatly at the
three temperatures, so that the three stages of flame, arc, and spark
Hues are generally recognised.
   II. Application or the Early Results to the Investigation of
                                Stellar Spectra.
                                General Remarks.
    In attempting    to assign origins to the lines seen in the spectrum
of the sun or stars,     it is clear, from what has been stated, that we
shall not get a perfect matching with terrestrial lines, either in regard
to the intensities or lengths of lines, unless the terrestrial lines in
question are those seen at a temperature closely approximating to
that of the particular part of the sun or star in which the vapour
 which produces the absorption exists.
    In the atmosphere of the stars we have probably the closest
approximation open to our observation of that equally heated space
condition to which     I have previously referred.
    The question arises whether we have any means, independently of
the line phenomena we are now discussing, of determining whether
the effective absorbing region of the stellar atmospheres are at the
 same temperature or whether they vary.                  And in the latter case,
 can we go    further and arrange them approximately in the order of
 temperature   ?
            First Indications of Relative Stellar Temperatures.
     On this point I wrote as follows in 1892* : " Au erroneous idea
 with regard to the indications of the temperature of the stars has
 been held by those who have not considered the matter specially.               It
 has beeu imagined that the presence of the series of hydrogen lines
 in the ultra-violet was of itself sufficient evidence of a very high tem
 perature. The experiments of Cornn.t however, have shown that
 the complete series of lines can be seen with an ordinary spark with-
 ont jar. Hence the high temperature of such a star as Sirius is not

154                      Mr.   J. Norman Lockyer.
indicated by the fact that its spectrum shows the whole series of
hydrogen lines, but by the fact that there is bright continuous radiation
far in the ultra-violet."
    We shall not go far wrong in supposing that the star with the
most intense continuous radiation in the ultra-violet is the hottest,
independently of absorbing conditions, which, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary, we must assume to follow the same law
in all.
   An inquiry into the facts placed at our disposal by the stellar
photographs taken at Kensington, shows that there is a considerable
variation in the distance to which the radiation extends in the ultra
violet, and that the stars can be arranged in order of temperature on
this basis.
   Judged by this criterion alone, some of the hottest stars so far
observed are 7 Orionis,         f  Orionis, at Virginis, 7 Pegasi, 1/ Urs»
Majoris, and Tauri. Of stars of lower, but not much lower, tem
                 X
perature than the above, may be named Rigel, £' Tauri, a Andromeda;,
/3 Persei,                  /3 Tauri.
            a, Pegasi, and
            Comparison   of Terrestrial and Stellar Line Spectra.
    Having, then, this independent determination of relative tempera
ture, we are in a position to study the results of the comparison of
terrestrial and celestial line spectra.
   As the variations of spectra with temperature are very striking in
the case of iron, calcium, and magnesium, the spectra of these sub
stances afford a ready means of checking the relative temperature of
the absorbing region of stars as determined by a consideration of
the extension of the continuous radiation into the violet and ultra
violet.
    But, before the results of such inquiries can be properly used, some
general considerations have to be passed under review.
                The Loci of Absorption in Stellar Atmospheres.
    Assuming that the most valid absorbing vapours in any particular
 star are all near one temperature, we can proceed to investigate the
 origins of the spectrum lines by first getting a clue as to the probable
temperature from the extent of continuous spectrum, and then
inquiring into the presence or absence of the lines which are longest
 in the spectra of various substances at that temperature. If, how
 ever, the absorptions take place at different levels in the atmosphere
 of a star, the proper spectrum of each substance to be thus investi
gated can only be determined by a comparison of the stellar with
 the terrestrial lines of the substance under varying temperature con
ditions.

                  On the Chemistry   of the Hottest Stars.             155
    This method of looking for the longest lines will fail in the case of
 stars which are hotter than our hottest spark.       In such case, there
fore,   we  must necessarily rely on a comparison  with lines which, from
our study of the spectra at different temperatures, would most pro
bably be longest in the spectrum at a temperature higher than any at
which experiments can be carried on.
    It is in connection with such an inquiry as this that the study of
the conditions of the sun's atmosphere is of supreme importance.         It
is obvious that a knowledge of them must be of the utmost value in
enabling us to apply a well-established series of facts, gathered in the
case of the star nearest to us, to the phenomena presented by the
more distant bodies.
   Observations of eclipses, especially those of 1882 and 1893, provide
us with a series of results with which to approach the question of the
absorption phenomena presented by the stars, and we have seen that
the whole question of the classification of stars depends absolutely
upon their absorption phenomena.
    Now in many of these bodies the atmosphere may be millions of
miles high.     In each star the chemical substances in the hottest and
coolest portion may De vastly different ; the region, therefore, in
which the absorption takes place, which, spectroscopically, enables us
to discriminate star from star, must be accurately known before we
can obtain the greatest amount of information from our inquiries.
   The loci of the various absorptions in a mass of gas such as a star
of the highest temperature, have not yet been sufficiently studied.
    I may say that for some time I was of opinion that in the sun
many of the darkest lines indicated absorptions high up in the atmo
sphere, for the reason that the bright continuous spectrum of the
lower levels might have an important effect upon line absorption
phenomena by superposing radiation, and so diminishing the initial
absorption. The observations of the eclipse of 1893, however, indi
cate that this opinion is probably only strictly true when the strata
of the sun's atmosphere close above the photosphere are considered.
    If we are justified in arguing from a star with a photosphere as
well developed as that of the sun, to one in which it is in all prob
ability much less marked, in consequence of a much higher tempera
ture, then we must consider that the absorptions which mark out the
various star groups are more conditioned by the temperatures of the
hottest regions merely than by the thickness of the absorbing atmo
spheres, or by the densities of the various vapours. Another con
sideration to be borne in mind is that if the atmospheres are in part
composed of condensable vapours, and not entirely of gases permanent
at all stellar temperatures, condensation must always be going on
outside at the region of lowest temperature.
    At this point it is important to consider the conditions of that part

15(5                     Mr.  J.  Norman Lockyer.
of the sun's atmosphere where it is known beyond all question that
certain, but not all, of the absorptions which produce the Fraunhofer
lines take place.
    In my paper on the eclipse of 1893,* I referred at length to this
point.      The matter is so important that I do not hesitate to quote
what    I then said in the present connection :
    "As a result of solar spectroscopic observations, combined with
laboratory work, Dr. Frankland and myself came to the conclusion,
in 1869, that at least in one particular, KirchhofFs theory of the
solar constitution required modification.              In that year we wrote as
follows : —   f
    " ' May not these facts indicate that the absorption to which the
reversal of the spectrum and the Fraunhofer lines are due takes
place in the photosphere itself, or extremely near to it, instead of in
                                                     '
an extensive outer absorbing atmosphere ?
    " In an early observation of a prominence on April 17th, 1870, I
found hundreds of the Fraunhofer lines bright at the base, and
remarked that a ' more convincing proof of the theory of the solar
constitution put forward by Dr. Frankland and myself could scarcely
have been furnished. 'J
    " During the
                    eclipse of 1870, at the moment of disappearance of
 the   sun, a similar reversal of lines was noticed ; we had, to quote
 Professor Young, ' a sudden reversal into brightuess and colour of
 the countless dark lines of the spectrum at the commencement                     of
 totality.'   On these observations was based              the view   that there was
 a region some 2" high above the photosphere, which reversed for
 us all the lines visible in the solar spectrum ; and on this ground the
                           '
 name ' reversing layer was given to it.
    " Continued observations, however, led me, in 1873, to abandon the
 view that the absorption phenomena of the solar spectrum are pro
 duced by any such thin stratum, and convinced me that the absorp
 tion took place at various levels above the photosphere. I need not
                                                         '
 give the evidence here ; it is set forth in my Chemistry of the Snn.'§
 On the latter hypothesis the different vapours exist normally at
 different distances above the photosphere, according to their powers
 of resisting the dissociating effects of heat.||

                                                                    '

appears, occasionally noted as widened in spots ; while, last of all,
we get, very long, very delicate relatively, two lines constantly seen
widened in spots, and another line, not seen in the spark, and never
yet recorded as widened in spots.'*
   " Similar observations in the same part of the spectrum were
made by Professor Turner in 1886.f                His observations were made
under less favourable conditions than those in Egypt, and in the
absence of statements as to the relative lengths of the lines observed,
it is impossible to utilise them.
   " This is one of the most important points in solar
                                                                      physics, but
there is not yet a concensus of opinion upon it.                  Professor Young
and others, apparently, still hold to the view first announced by Dr.
Frankland and myself in the infancy of the observations, that the
Fraunhofer absorption takes place in a thin stratum, lying close to
the photosphere."
   I next proceeded to discuss the numerous photographs obtained
                               I
during the eclipse, and gave a map showing that there was only
the slightest relation between the intensities of the lines common to
the Fraunhofer and the eclipse spectrum, and further, that only a
few of the Fraunhofer lines are represented at all.                 Not only this,
but in the eclipse photographs there are many bright lines not
represented at all among the Fraunhofer lines.
   The chromosphere, then, is certainly not the origin of the Fraun
hofer lines, either as regards intensity or number. From the eye
observations made since 1868, there is ample evidence that the
quiescent   chromosphere spectrum indicates a higher temperature
than that at which much of the most valid absorption takes place ;
in other words, that the majority of the lines associated with lower
temperature are produced above the level of the chromosphere.
    The eclipse photographs, however, at the same time afford evi
 dence by the relative lengths of some of the lower temperature lines
that we need not locate the region which produces them at any
great height above the chromosphere.
    The solar evidence, then, is that most of the line absorption is
 produced in, and not very far above, the chromosphere. This is a
 conclusion we are bound to accept in a discussion of' the origin of
 stellar absorption in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
    We have no right to assume that the absorption will be pro
 duced at the top of the atmosphere in one star, and in the bottom
 in another, when the atmospheres are once relatively quiescent.

    III. Recent Photographic Investigations on the Spectra of
                     Metals at High Temperatures.
   At the time at which the earlier inquiries to which 1 have already
referred were made, it was only possible for the most part to deal
with eye observations of the heavenly bodies.                  The results were,
therefore, limited to the visible spectrum.
   During the last few years           I  have been fortunate enough to
obtain photographs of the brighter stars and of the sun's chromo
sphere during eclipses ; it became of importance, therefore, to extend
the observations of terrestrial spectra into the photographic regions
for the purpose of making the comparisons which were necessary for
continuing the inquiry.
                                      Iron.
   The facts with regard to changes in the spectrum of iron were
shown by my early experiments to be not much less striking than
those noted in the case of calcium, magnesium, and other metals.
   For the last twenty years I have devoted special attention to iron,
and noted many stellar and terrestrial coincidences.               I shall begin
my   account  of the new   work by dealing        with  that  metal.
   Among the iron lines are two triplets, or sets of three lines, giving
an example of repetitions of structure in differents parts of the
spectrum ; one of them is less refrangible than G, and the other
                                        I
falls between h and H. In 1878 wrote as follows : —
   " In
         many photographs in which iron has been compared with
other bodies, and in others, again, in which iron has been photo
graphed as existing in different degrees of impurity in other bodies,
these triplets have been seen almost alone, and the relative intensity
of them as compared with the few remaining lines, is greatly
changed. In this these photographs resemble one               I took three years
ago, in which a large coil and jar were employed instead of the arc.
In this the triplet near G is very marked ; the two adjacent lines
more refrangible near it, which are seen nearly as strong as the
                                                         I
triplet itself in some of the arc photographs possess, are only very
faintly visible, while dimmer still are seen the lines of the triplet
between   H  and  h."*
   It was also pointed out at the same             time that the lines of iron
appearing in the chromosphere did not make their appearance in
the order of their lengths in the arc.
   For the new inquiries      I  have employed two storage cells giving a
current of 7 amperes at 8 volts, with an Apps Intensity Coil giving a
spark of 10 inches and a jar capacity of between 40 and 50 gallons.
   To clear the ground, it was important to determine whether the
                       * '
                           Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 28, p. 172.

                   On the Chemistry       of  the Hottest Stars.     159
  generally observed dropping-out of lines in the spark depends upon
  the diminished quantity of incandescent vapour as compared with
 that in the arc.
     With the brilliant spark obtained under the new conditions there
 is little difference betweeen arc and spark with regard to the num
 ber of lines.   Hence it may be concluded that the small number of
 lines previously recorded in the spark spectrum was not an effect of
 increased temperature, but one due to the small quantity of vapour
  produced by the use of a small coil.
     The next point was to inquire if the photographic region of the
 spectrum reveals lines which are the equivalents of those at 4924'1
 and 5018'6 (Rowland's scale), which I had previously shown to be
 enhanced in passing from the arc to the spark spectrum.*
     Seven additional lines were detected in the photographs at the
 following wave-lengths on Rowland's scale.

    These have been confirmed by a reference to the map of the
spark spectrum of iron published by Dr. McClean,t and attention
was drawn to those at 4584-0 and 4233-3 in my paper on the arc
spectrum of electrolytic iron.J
    All these appear as short lines in the arc spectrum, so that the
view that the short lines which appear in the arc spectrum can be
divided into two categories,           one including the lines which are
brightened in the spark, and the other the lines which are not so
enhanced, is confirmed.
    Having thus established that there are differences between the arc
and spark spectrum, and that these differences are not due to the
different quantities of vapour in the two cases, it must be concluded
that a difference of temperature is the main cause of change.
    Including the flame spectrum then, four distinct temperature
stages are indicated by the varying spectrum of iron : —
    (1) The flame spectrum, consisting of a few lines only, including
the well-known triplets and many strong lines in the ultra-violet.
    (2) The arc spectrum consisting, according to Rowland, of 2000
lines or more.

   (3) The spark spectrum, differing from the arc spectrum in the
enhancement of some of the short lines and the reduced brightuess
of others.
   (4) A spectrum consisting of the lines which are intensified in the
spark. This we can conceive to be visible alone at the highest tem
perature in a space efficiently shielded from the action of all lower
ones, since the enhanced lines behave like those of a metal when a
compound of a metal is broken up by the action of heat.
   A complete list of the iron lines seen at the different temperatures
would be too long to reproduce here, so that the following statement
of intensities is limited to the lines enhanced in the spark. The be
haviour of these lines under the different conditions of experiment
is as follows : —

     The arc and spark spectra are photographically     compared in

    I next proceed to consider the results obtained in the case of
calcium.
   Among the chief observations of the spectrum of this metal are
those made by Thalen, Kayser and Runge, and myself.
   Thal6n chiefly confined himself to a study of the spectrum at the

                  On the Chemistry     of the    Hottest Start.         161
temperature of the spark, the observations of Messrs. Kayser and
Rnnge have been limited to the arc spectrum, while my own investi
gations have included all conditions of temperature available in
laboratory experiments.
    As   I showed in 1876,* the most characteristic low temperature
line is that at X 4226'9, while the H and K lines are pre-eminent at
high temperatues. The new work with the spark from the large
intensity coil and large jars has shown that all the lines recorded by
 Kayser and Runge in the arc spectrum appear also in the spark spec
 trum, but with the exception of H and K, and two lines at wave
 lengths 3706'18 and 3737'08, which do not appear to have been
 previously recorded in the spark, they appear with reduced relative
 intensities.
    These two nitra-violet lines are enormously enhanced in the spark,
 as will be seen on reference to the comparison photograph of tho arc
 and spark spectra given in Plate 1.
     As in the case of iron, four temperature steps can be recognised.
     (1) The flame spectrum, in which the blue line 4226'9 is predomi
 nant, H and K, and a few other lines being very feeble.
     (2) The arc spectrum, in which the H and K lines are of about
 the same brightuess as the blue line, while other feebler lines also
 appear.
     (3) The spark spectrum, in which nearly all the lines of the arc
 spectrum are seen, but with reduced intensities, except in the case of
 H and K, which remain very bright, and two lines at 3706-18 and
 3737-08, which are also very bright.
     (4) A spectrum consisting of the two lines at 3706' 18 and 3737-08
 and the H and K lines, corresponding to a temperature higher than
 the average temperature of the spark, as before explained.
     The complete spectra actually recorded are shown in the following
 table (p. 162).
                                  Magnesium.
     Among other substances        investigated      in my earlier work was
  magnesium.
     I  showed in 1879f that in the flame spectrum the two less re
  frangible members of the b group were seen associated with a less
  refrangible line at 5210, making a triplet with them, while a line in
  the blue at wave-length 4571'3, and a series, of flutings were also
  seen ; on passing the spark, the blue line of the flame disappears, as
  well as the flame companion to b, while two new blue lines make
  their appearance at wave-lengths 4481-3 and 4703-3.
     Among the spark lines is one at .V 4481, of which I had previously

                                                              " This is a

winged line, but it appears short. Thalen makes it of the same in
tensity as the two at 4703'5 and 4586-5 ; but while this is excessively
bright to me, 4703'5 is faint and 4586-5 invisible." Taking b as
                                          I
having a length denoted by 4, gave the length of this line at 4481
as 1 ; I also stated that it was not seen in the spectrum of the
chloride, although the b group was distinctly seen. The line at
4481 has not to my knowlege been recorded by any observer as
present in the arc spectrum, but a recent photograph shows it as a
rather feeble line in the arc between poles consisting of magnesium.

   Using the large coil and jars, the line has also been photographed in
  the spectrum of the chloride ; indeed all the lines recorded in the
  arc by Kayser and Runge have been photographed in the spark
  spectrum of the metal.
      The work with the large jars has also resulted in the detection of
  another line of magnesium about wave-length 4395 which does not
 appear in the arc spectrum, and the line about 4587-4 observed by
 Thalen also shows itself feebly.        The former of these is fairly bright
 and seems to be closely associated with 4481.
      Again there are four distinct temperature steps, namely :
      (1) The flame spectrum, represented by lines at 45 71 '3 and b, a
 triplet in the ultra-violet commencing with a line at 3734, and two
 timings, one commencing at 5210 and the other at 5006'5.*
      (2) The arc spectrum, comprising b, a line at 4352'18, and another
  triplet in the ultra-violet commencing with 3838'4, 4481 being almost
  invisible, while 4395 and 4587 are quite invisible.
      (3) The spark spectrum, including all the arc lines, but with
 4481 intensely bright, 4395 fairly bright though short and 4587'4
 rather feeble.
      (4) As 4481, 4395, and 4587-4 are much intensified in the spark
 spectrum, we can conceive a fourth stage at a still higher temperature
 when magnesium would be represented by these lines alone.                    The
 complete spectra       of  magnesium   under   the  three   conditions  at which
 observations can be made are indicated in the accompanying table
  (p. 164).
      The arc and spark spectra, as photographed with the moderate
 dispersion to which reference has already been made, are shown in
 Plate 1, the three enhanced lines being indicated as in the case of iron
 and calcium.
 IV. Application of the recent Investigations to Stellar Spectra.
     In order to study     the presence or absence of the enhanced lines in
the spectra of the stars, the Kensington series of stellar spectrographs,
in which the dispersion is not greatly different from that of the
metallic spectra, has been employed.
     Although this discussion has specially dealt with the hottest stars,
it is necessary to include references to the cooler ones in order to con
trast the behaviour of the high temperature lines with those which
are characteristic of low temperatures, and further to compare the
appearances of the lines at different stellar temperatures.
    a. Orionis is taken as a typical case of a relatively        cool star which
   * Messrs. Liveing and Dewar have ascribed      these flutings to compounds of
magnesium     'with hydrogen and oxygen respectively, but whether they are due to
compounds or to the metal itself is immaterial for my present purpose.

  Starting with a Orionis, wo find that only two of its more promi

As there are so many lines in the spectrum of this star,    possible                                       is it
that these may be only chance coincidences, and this          the more                                        is

   Passing to 7 Cygni, the iron lines confirm the idea that the tem
perature is higher than in a. Orionis.   Here the enhanced lines of iron
are stronger than the arc lines representative of the second stage of
temperature ; that is, the temperature is approaching the fourth stage
(see Map I).
   In a Cygni,    where,  to judge by the extension of the spectrum
towards the violet, the temperature is much higher, the enhanced
lines of iron are among the strongest in the whole spectrum. At the
same time, some of the stronger lines of the stage 2 spectrum, in
cluding the triplets, also appear, but they are very feeble as compared!
 with the lines of stage 4 (see Map I).
   Here, then, we probably have absorbing iron vapour at a tempera
ture very nearly approaching the fourth stage. If this result be con
firmed, we at once get an explanation of the great differences of
intensity between the lines in a Cygni which coincide with iron lines.
and those which appear in the spectrum of iron as observed terres
trially with an unshielded arC.
   7/ Leonis represents a stage of temperature a little higher than
that of a. Cygni ; here the second stage iron lines have disappeared
altogether, and the enhanced lines appear alone (see Map I).
   At the higher temperature of stars like Rigel, the enhanced iron
lines also appear without any trace of the familiar iron spectrum
typified by the triplets (see Map I), and there seems to be little doubt
that we are here in presence of iron vapour at a transcendental tem
perature corresponding to the fourth stage to which        I have drawn
attention.
       f
   In Tauri, the iron lines are almost identical with those in Rigel
(see Map 1).
                                                             •
   At the still higher temperature of Bellatrix, all visible traces of
the iron spectrum have vanished from the photographs.
                   General Results with regard to Iron.
   The general result of the investigation of the enhanced iron lines
in stellar spectra confirms the view that the absorbing regions of the
hottest stars exist at a higher temperature than any attainable in
laboratory experiments, the spectrum of iron consisting solely of
those lines which are enhanced in passing from the arc to the spark.
At the same time, some of the lines in the spectra of the hottest
stars formerly classed as unknown are now shown to be due to
iron.
   The fact that even the enhanced lines themselves disappear from
the spectra of stars approaching, or at, the acme of stellar temperature
raises another question to which reference will be made later.
    As I pointed out in a preliminary note on the occurrence of these

                  On the Chemistry      of   the Hottest Stars.        1(57
lines,* " the enhanced lines may be absent from the spectrum of a
star, either on account of too low or too high a temperature.        In the
case of a low temperature, however, iron is represented among the
lines in the spectrum, but at the highest temperature all visible
indications of its presence seem to have vanished.              This result
affords a valuable confirmation of my view that the arc spectrum of
 the metallic elements is produced by molecules of different com
plexities, and it also indicates that the temperature of the hottest
stars is sufficient to produce simplifications beyond those which have
been produced in our laboratories."
    The facts which are graphically represented in Map I indicate
that so far as these stars are concerned the results, with regard to
stellar temperature determined by a study of the iron lines, are
identical with those to be gathered from the extension of the radia
 tion spectrum into the violet. Independently of the extensions of
 spectrum into the violet for different stars, then, the relative tem
 peratures may be determined by a study of the iron lines. Thus, a
 star, in the spectrum of which iron is represented by traces of the
 triplets characteristic of the arc spectrum as well as by the enhanced
 lines, must be cooler, so far as the absorbing iron vapour is concerned,
 than one in which iron is represented by the enhanced lines alone.
 Similarly, we must conclude that a star in which iron has no repre
 sentative lines is hotter than one in which the enhanced lines appear
 without the arc lines.      In practice the iron lines furnish a much
 more convenient indication of stellar temperature than the continuous
 spectrum, for the reason that in the case of iron no special photo
 graphs are necessary, while for an investigation of the continuous
 spectrum special photographs of stars with very carefully controlled
 exposures have to be taken.
                                     Calcium.
    The calcium lines in the spectrum of a. Orionis indicate that we
 have   in that case a temperature not greatly differing from that of
 the second stage ; the blue line which is characteristic of low
 temperature, as well as H and K, being very strongly developed (see
 Map I).
    On passing to the stars of successively higher temperatures which
 have already been studied      in the case of iron, it will be seen from
  Map I, that the blue line has disappeared at the temperature of
 a Cygni, while the H and K lines persist with gradually reduced
 intensities up to the hottest stars. The intensities of the H and K
 lines as compared with the blue line fully bear out the results as to
 the order of temperature of the stars which has been derived from a

 comparison of the continuous radiation spectra, and also from the
appearances of the iron lines.          Unfortunately, the Kensington photo
graphs of stellar spectra which have so far been obtained do not
extend far enough into the ultra-violet to permit a complete investi
gation of the varying appearances of the two ultra-violet enhanced
lines to which      I  have called attention in an earlier part of this
 communication.         Both of them appear in the spectrum of Sirius,
however, which is certainly a hot star, though not one of the
hottest.
    Still the facts are sufficient to show that although H and K appear
in some of the stars without any traces of the other calcium lines,
there can be no hesitation in accepting them as due to calcium, as
in all such stars a very high temperature is independently indicated
by the great extension of the continuous spectrum into the ultra
violet and by the iron lines previously discussed.
                                      Magnesium.
    Magnesium furnishes us with very definite indications of the four
stages of temperature, and the discussion of its representative lines
in stellar spectra is therefore very important.
    In a. Orionis, the b group is strongly developed, while 4481 is
absent.     In the map, the ultra-violet triplet commencing with 3834 is
taken as typical of the second stage spectrum, but the photographs of
the spectrum of a Orionis which have been obtained do not extend
far enough to enable the presence or absence of this triplet to be
ascertained. Another line, at 4352' 2, which appears at the second
stage of temperature is, however, probably present in a. Orionis.
                                                           I
    The flame line 4571'3 is also present,* and have also shown the
probable presence of the two flutings of magnesium in the spectrum
of a. Orionis and similar stars.f In a Orionis, then, the most effective
absorbing magnesium vapour is at a temperature not greatly
different from that of the flame, but the prosence of 43522 indicates
 that the temperature must be slightly greater. It is important to
remember, however, that on the meteoritic hypothesis, different parts
of such a swarm as a Orionis may have widely different temperatures,
as some of the collisions may be end-on while others may be mere
grazes, so that a mixed spectrum of high and low temperature lines
might be expected.
    Taking 7 Cygni, as before, to be considerably hotter than a. Orionis,
as indicated not only by the length of continuous spectrum but by
the iron and calcium results, there is a considerable change in the
lines representative of magnesium.                The flutings have quite dis
appeared and the spark line at 4181 appears as a well-marked line.

Some of the arc lines,       including 4352-2 and 4167-8 remain, so that in
the absence of a record of the ultra-violet triplet, it may be concluded
that the absorbing magnesium in 7 Cygni is probably at a tempera
ture not differing greatly from that of the spark, that is the third
stage of temperature.          The wave-length of the new spark line about
4395 is not yet known -n ith sufficient accuracy, on account of its
great breadth, to justify its use in this inquiry. The actual appear
ance of the magnesium lines in 7 Cygni thus confirms the conclusion
with regard to the temperature of this star which has already been
derived from the discussion of the lines of calcium and iron.
    In the case of a. Cygni the most prominent magnesium line is the
spark line at 4481.       The b lines, the ultra-violet triplet commencing
with 3838-4, and the line 43522 are also present, while 4571-3 and
4167'8 are absent, or very feeble. The great intensity of 4481, which
is only a short line in the spark, indicates that the temperature is,
in all probability, a little higher than that of the experimental spark,
that is, intermediate between the third and fourth stages.
    Passing to 17 Leonis, 4481 is a little less intense than in a. Cygni,
while the line at 4352 is considerably reduced in intensity as com
pared with a. Cygni. A temperature a little higher than that of
 a. Cygni is therefore indicated.
     In Rigel, where the temperature is higher than in 1/ Leonis, 4481
 is one of the few strong lines recorded in the spectrum, and it
 appears without the other Mg lines.
     The same is true of if Tauri and Bellatrix, except that 4481 is now
 reduced in intensity.         These varying appearances are indicated in
 Map    I.
     The study of magnesium thus perfectly accords with what we have
 learned as to relative stellar temperatures from a discussion of the
 lines of iron and calcium.
           General  -Results   with regard  to  Calcium and Magnesium.
    Map    I indicates that in the case of the stars so far discussed, the
 same order of temperature is arrived at by a consideration of the
 lines of calcium and magnesium as that deduced in the first instance
 from the relative lengths of continuous spectrum, and afterwards by
 an inquiry into the presence of the enhanced iron lines. Four indica
 tions of stellar temperatures are therefore now available, namely, the
 extent of the continuous radiation, the lines of iron, the lines of
 calcium, and the lines of magnesium.
     The enhanced lines of calcium and magnesium, unlike those of
 iron, do not disappear from the spectrum in the case of the hottest
  stars yet studied, but they become very feeble, so that an approach
  to disappearance is indicated.

 V. On the Occurrence of the Lines of the Cleveite                        Gases  and

                      Important Position of      the Cleveite Gases.
     So far     I  have considered the high temperature lines of certain
 metallic elements, and their comparison with lines existing in the
 stars.      It is now important to refer to the permanent gases, which
 we now know to exist, both in stars and nebuhB.                   I refer to hydro
 gen and the cleveite gases.            These appear in the stars which, on the
                                      I
 grounds previously stated, hold to be of highest temperature, and
 for this discrimination we can rely better on the cleveite gases than
 on hydrogen, for the reason that the latter is much more widely
 distributed qua temperature.              There are not many groups of stars
 which do not indicate the presence of hydrogen, while, on the other
 hand, the cleveite gases only occur conspicuously in one.
    It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of the discovery of
terrestrial sources of helium and the gas I have provisionally named
gas X* in its bearings upon the spectra of the hotter stars, since it
explains many of the strongest lines in such spectra, as I showed in
papers communicated to the Royal Society on May 8 and May 9,
 1895.f
    Professor Vogel arrived, afterwards, at the same conclusion.              J
    Thus a considerable number of the stellar lines was removed from
                       "
the category of unknown lines." ,
                       Varying Intensity of     the Cleveite Lives.
    Tf the varying intensities of the helium lines are studied in the
 case of the stars which have so far been considered, it is found that
 the lines become stronger as the temperature increases.                 Thus, from
 the merest trace in a Cygni the lines of helium are gradually intensi
fied in passing through 7 Leonis, Rigel, if Tauri, and Bellatrix,
which, as we have already seen, are in order of increasing tempera
ture. This is illustrated in Map II, which also shows the behaviour
of the lines belonging to that constituent of the cleveite gases which
I  have provisionally called gas X.
                    Varying Intensity of     the Lines of Hydrogen.
    The lines of hydrogen make their appearance                  at a much lower
stage of temperature than those of the cleveite gases, but, like the
   * For greater clearness in the
                                        sequel, and because the lines of helium  are
stronger than those of gas X, I shall often refer to helium alone,

                                     The Cleveite Gases.
   Dealing with the stars already considered, a comparison of the
metallic and cleveite gas lines indicates that as the former die out
the latter are strengthened.
    The cleveite gas absorption first makes its appearance, very feebly,
in the stars in which the enhanced lines of magnesium and iron are
strongest, as in a. Cygni.              Then, as the temperature increases, as
demonstrated by the expansion into the ultra-violet of the continuous
radiation, the lines of the cleveite gases become stronger as the
metallic lines thin out.
   At the highest temperature, taking Bellatrix for the present as a
typical case, the principal helium lines are almost as strong as the
lines of hydrogen, while the enhanced lines of iron have quite dis
appeared, and those of magnesium and calcium nearly so.                                 These
Tariations are indicated in Map III.

  Map       III. — Comparison          of metallic lines with lines of cleveite                          gases       in stars of
                                            increasing temperature.
  It       will befrom the map that there

in the case of the metallic and the cleveite gas lines, and that in
those stars where the separate investigations of the metallic and gas
lines overlap, the same arrangement of stars results in both cases,
but there        is    a complete inversion in the behaviour the gas as compared:              of
with       the metallic      lines.  We seem to be in presence of a chemical
change, iron being finally replaced by helium.
                                                      Hydrogen.
   The dark lines of hydrogen make their appearance in stars of
comparatively low temperature, such as a. Orionis, in which the
second stage metallic lines are very strong.    In these stars the
hydrogen lines are thinner than some of the metallic ones.

                   On the Chemistry     of the Hottest Stars.             1 7&
     With  increased temperature, in the case of the stars so far con
 sidered,  the lines of hydrogen steadily increase in intensity up to the
 highest temperature, as typified by Bellatrix.       Meanwhile, as we have
 seen, the second stage metallic lines gradually thin out, while the
 enhanced lines become stronger up to the temperature of % Cygni,
 and ultimately all the lines of iron have disappeared, and magnesium
 and calcium are only represented by traces of their enhanced lines.
    When the lines of the cleveite gases first become visible, as in
 a Cygni, the lines of hydrogen have already become the strongest in
 the spectrum, but at still higher temperatures, the intensification of
 the lines of hydrogen is less rapid than that of the lines of the
cleveite gases. In none of the stars now considered do the hydrogen
 lines reach their maximum development, as stated before.               This
point will be considered    later  on.
 VII,   The Tkjii'ekatvre     Ranges     of the Metallic      and  Cleveite
                                  Gas Lines.
    Since there are regular sequences in the intensities of both the
 metallic and cleveite gas lines in passing through stars of gradually
increasing temperature, it is important to compare the behaviour of
 the lines of the different substances between the limits of the
temperature range I have chosen for discussion.
    The metallic lines characteristic of the fourth stage of tempera
ture behave differently in the case of different metals, although all
the comparisons have led to the same general conclusion with
regard to the temperature of the absorbing vapours in any particular
star.
        The Lower Limit in   the case  of the enhanced Metallic Lines.
    In the case of calcium, the   enhanced   lines, namely H and K, appear
faintly at the temperature of the oxy-hydrogen flame (Stage 1), and
are strongly developed at the arc temperature (Stage 2).                 The
appearance of H and K as strong lines in a Orionis is therefore to be
expected.
    In the case of iron, the enhanced lines do not occur       at all at the
first stage of temperature, and only very feebly at the second.        They
would therefore not be expected at the low temperature of a Orionis,
and, as a matter of fact, unlike H and K they first appear as well
developed lines in a. Cygni.
    Magnesium behaves almost exactly like iron in regard to its
enhanced line (4481), since, absent from a Orionis, it appears as a
prominent line in a. Cygni.

174                      Sir.  J.  Norman Lockyer.
       The Upper   Limit in   the case of  the enhanced  Metallic Lines.
    A somewhat similar difference of behaviour is noted when the
phenomena       at the higher temperature limit are studied.              The
enhanced lines of calcium       and  magnesium      do not quite vanish even
when the temperature of Bellatrix is reached, but they become very
thin. With iron the case is different ; the enhanced lines vanish
entirely in Bellatrix, and are very much thinner than the enhanced
lines of calcium and magnesium in the spectrum of Rigel.
    From this it will be seen that H and K appear even at the first
stage of temperature, and survive up to the upper limit of Stage 4.
The magnesium line, 4481, does not appear until the third stage of
temperature is reached, but survives to the upper limit of the fourth
stage.     In the case of iron, the enhanced lines, like that of magnesium,
do not appear until the third stage is reached, but, unlike it, they do
not survive the upper limit of the fourth stage.
                              The   Cleveite Gases.
    The lines of the cleveite gases do not appear in stellar spectra
until the temperature is high enough to exhibit the enhanced lines of
magnesium and iron with their greatest intensity.           At this stage the
gas lines appear only very feebly, but, unlike the metallic lines, they
gradually increase in intensity up to the highest temperature, as
represented by Bellatrix.
    The range of the cleveite gas lines is therefore shorter than that of
 the enhanced lines of iron and magnesium, and the order of intensity
 is inverted.
                                     I
    It is important to note, and shall return to this point, that while
 the cleveite gases are represented by absorption lines in the spectra of
the hotter stars only, hydrogen gives visible indications of its presence
in stars at nearly all stages of condensation.
                              General   Conclusions.
    These observations indicate individual peculiarities of the spectra
of the different substances.         Some appear to be longer lived than
 others, and, further, the important spectral changes in the case of
 different substances      do     not occur at the same temperature
 The differences of behaviour in the case of the enhanced
 lines of iron, magnesium, calcium, hydrogen, and the cleveite
gases are illustrated       diagrammatically      in Map IV.        It will be
 seen from the map that there are two substances with a long range,
 calcium and hydrogen, the former being succeeded by the latter as
 the temperature increases ; one of intermediate range, magnesium,
  which remains visible up to the highest temperature, and two of

former being interpolated about half way up the long stages of
calcium and hydrogen, and the lines of the cleveite gases near the top.
    The map also indicates the relative temperatures at which the
changes in the spectra of different substances take place.
    With special regard to iron, it may be noted that the fundamental
change in its spectrum occurs at about the temperature of a. Cygni,
while the enhanced lines of calcium are unaffected at that tempera
ture.

    In my previous investigations, both visual and photographic, of
stellar spectra, I was led to conclude, in opposition to Vogel's view,
that some stars are becoming hotter, while others are becoming
cooler.*
   I first suggested a temperature curve in 1887, f on the left side of
which are placed stars of increasing temperature, while the cooling
stars occupy the right hand side, the highest temperature occupying
the highest part of the curve.

    The evidence for this separation of the stars into two series
 .depended partly upon differences in the spectra of stars which, it
  was thought, from other considerations, had about the same mean
  temperature.    I showed that some of the principal stars might be
 ,arranged as follows, in order of ascending temperature, the hottest            of
   hem being placed at the top of the list,

    Arcturus is bracketed with the sun, because I have shown that its
 spectrum is like that of the sun, line for line.f
    The later discussion of the Kensington photographs of stellar spectra
 fully justified the classification of stars suggested by the previous
 inquiry into the visual spectra, and the general view that there are
 bodies of increasing as well as bodies of decreasing temperature
 was also greatly strengthened.

    In what   has gone before,     I have dealt only      with stars of increasing
temperature, and more particularly with those near the top of the
-temperature curve.
    I now pass to the discussion of those stars which, the previous
 investigations indicated to be cooling bodies.
    The stars included in the inquiry are as follows, the coolest being
placed at the bottom of the list, Bellatrix, for the present being
taken as representative of the hottest stars : —

   Map V indicates the variations of the metallic lines in this series of
stars, and it will be seen that at the highest temperature magnesium
and calcium are represented by their enhanced lines alone ; with a
fall of temperature the enhanced lines of iron are next added, and,
later, the arc lines of all three metals ; at the lowest temperature,
the enhanced line of magnesium disappears, while those of iron are
either absent or very weak ; the enhanced lines of calcium, on the
other hand, being relatively strong in the arc, remain.

    These phenomena are illustrated in Map        III   by photographs of
 the spectra of typical stars.
    The facts recorded in the photographs of each star are as follows : —
    Starting with Bellatrix, magnesium is solely represented by the
 enhanced line at 4481, which is relatively feeble, calcium by the
 H and K lines, also feeble, while there are no indications of iron
 at all.
    Passing next to /} Persei, 44S1 and the H and K lines are in
 tensified, while the enhanced lines of iron are added.
    In 7 Lyrae, all the enhanced lines of magnesium, calcium, and iron
 are strengthened.
    A further intensification of the enhanced lines occurs on passing to
 Sirius, but here the characteristic arc lines of all three substances are
 added, indicating a temperature intermediate between that of the
 experimental spark and that at which the enhanced lines appear
alone.
    With a further slight fall of temperature, represented by Castor,
 the enhanced lines become slightly stronger, as do also the charac
 teristic arc lines.
    At the still lower temperature of Procyon there is a marked
increase in the intensity of the characteristic arc lines and a decrease
in the intensity of the enhanced lines, except in the case of H and K,
which, as already pointed out, are strong lines in the arc.
    Finally, at the temperature of Arcturus, or the sun, the enhanced
lines of magnesium and iron are either very faint or entirely absent,
while H and K remain visible for the reason already stated, and the
arc lines of all three metals become very strong.
                            Cleveite Gas Results.
   The appearance of the lines of the cleveite gases in the stars of
decreasing temperature already considered is restricted to /3 Persei
and 7 Lyrae.     An attempt is made to show their changes of intensity
in Map VI, which also includes Bellatrix as representative, for the
present, of the highest temperature.
   Starting with Bellatrix, the lines of the cleveite gases are very
strong, while, on passing to the cooler stars, they rapidly become
weaker, as the enhanced metallic lines continue to get stronger.       In
fact, the lines of the cleveite gases disappear at a comparatively early
stage, long before the absorbing metallic vapours are cool enough to
show any traces of the characteristic arc lines.
   In Ii Persei, as shown on the map, the cleveite gas lines are much
weaker than in Bellatrix, while in 7 Lyroe they are on the verge of
disappearance.     No certain indications of the cleveite gas lines have
been found in Sirius, Castor, Procyon, or Arcturus. A special search

                    On the Chemistry     of  the Hottest Stars.          181
                         The Absorptions    not Identical.
     Early in my researches     I pointed out* that the absorption pheno
  mena    in stellar  spectra need not be identical at the same mean
  temperature on the ascending and descending sides of the curve,
  since, on the meteoritic hypothesis, there must be a tremendous
  difference in the physical conditions.
      In a condensing swarm, the centre of which is undergoing
  meteoritic bombardment from all sides, there cannot be the equi
  valent of the solar chromosphere ; the whole mass is made up of
  heterogeneous    vapour at different temperature?, and moving with
 different velocities in different regions.
     In a condensed swarm, of which we can take the sun as a type, all
 action produced from without has practically ceased ; we get rela
 tively a quiet atmosphere and an orderly assortment of the vapours
 from top to bottom. But still, on the view that the differences in
 the spectra of the heavenly bodies chiefly represent differences in
 degree of condensation and temperature, there can be, cm fond, no
 great chemical difference between bodies of increasing and bodies of
 decreasing temperature. Hence, it is exceedingly probable that at
  equal mean temperatures on opposite sides of the temperature curve,
 this chemical similarity of the absorbing vapours will result in many
 points of resemblance in the spectra.
     The identical behaviour of the enhanced metallic and cleveite
 lines on both sides of the curve shows us that we have here a pre
 viously undreamt-of test to apply to this question, and it is impor
 tant to make sure of this ground before I proceed to apply it to others
 opened up and rendered clearer by the new investigations.
                               The Neiv Criteria.
    With the photographs at      present available, the test can be applied
at    three stages of temperature, the stars of equal mean temperature
being determined by the relative intensities of the enhanced and arc
metallic lines. When several stars of the same mean temperature
are thus brought together, it 'soon becomes evident that they are
divisible into two groups, which differ considerably in other respects.
To take one instance, the average temperature of the absorbing iron
vapour is about the same in c Pegasi as in Arcturus, since the spectro
scopic difference between these stars, so far as the line spectra are
concerned, is very slight.        But the continuous absorption in the
violet is much greater in c Pegasi than in Arcturus, while the metallic
lines are also somewhat broader. The difference between the stars,
therefore, does not appear to be d ue alone to a difference of temperature.

General Conclusion          as to Spectroscopic Differences on the Two Sides of
                                          the Curves.
    The facts thus brought together indicate that at each of three very
distinct stages of temperature there are two groups of stars showing
spectroscopic differences.            Generalising from these, it may be stated
that stars at about the same temperature, as judged by the iron lines
on the ascending side of the curve, differ from those on the descending
side.
    (1) In the greater continuous absorption in the violet or ultra
violet, especially at the lower stages of temperature.
    (2) In the relative thinness of the hydrogen lines at the higher
stages of temperature.
    (3) In the greater intensity and thickness of the metallic lines,
whether of low or high temperature.
    (4) In the relatively greater thickness of the lines of the cleveite
gases at these stages of temperature in which they appear.

                  On the Chemistry     of the Hottest Stars.          183
              The probable Physical Causes of the Differences.
    I  submit that the differences found are precisely those we should
 expect on the meteoritic hypothesis.         I deal with the differences
 indicated seriatim.
    1. The Inequality    of the Continuous Absorption.
                                                         — I have already
 pointed out that in the case of a swarm there must always be cooler
 vapours mixed with the hotter ones in the most valid absorbing
 regions.   It is these cooler vapours which produce the absorption in
 the violet and ultra-violet.
    In a condensed mass of vapour they can only exist at the limit of
 the atmosphere where their absorption is reduced in consequence of
 the low pressure.
   2. The smaller thickness of the Hydrogen Lines. — The difference in
 thickness of the hydrogen lines is also sufficiently accounted for by
the difference of absorbing conditions.        In the stars of increasing
 temperature, consisting of uncondensed meteoritic swarms, the inter
 spaces will be largely occupied by hydrogen at a high temperature,
and the radiation of this gas will tend to mask the absorption pro
 duced by that in the immediate neighbourhood of the incandescent
 meteorites which merely graze.       In the condensed stars with photo
 spheres, any masking    effect of this kind must be very much less pro
nounced, so that the hydrogen lines will be broader than in the
 spectra of uncondensed swarms. I have shown in a previous part of
this paper that the hydrogen lines are more constant, in regard to
 their intensities, than the lines of other substances in the stars of
increasing temperature, and this greater life of the hydrogen mole
cule seems to explain the fact that the hydrogen lines are specially
picked out after passing to the downward side of the temperature
curve when a state of quiescence is reached.
   It should be remarked that the great distention of the hydrogen
lines in the hotter stars which have begun to cool does not necessarily
indicate a great thickness of absorbing hydrogen, since, in the case
of the sun, the very broad H and K lines are produced by an absorb
ing region of small thickness in comparison with the sun's diameter.
   3. The greater thickness of the Metallic Lines. — In the case of a
swarm, the thickness of the effective absorbing gases and vapours in
the line of sight will be very much greater than the effective thick
ness in the case of an atmosphere surrounding a photosphere, even if
the masses and average temperatures be the same in both cases.       The
light proceeding from the central parts of the swarm must pass
through the whole depth of vapours filling the interspaces, and on
this account the absorption lines would be more intense in the case of
a swarm.     The greater intensities, and to some extent the breadth of
the metallic lines, are thus explained, for since the metallic vapours

 184                      Mr.   J.  Norman Loekyer.
 will not fill the interspaces to the same degree that the hydrogen does,
 there will be no masking of the dark lines by radiation.
    4.   The Widening and Thinning of certain Lines.— In consequence of
 the great difference    of velocity and direction of the meteorites enter
 ing   s swarm, the spectrum lines involved will in general be broader,
 and therefore dimmer, so        far as this cause is concerned, than in stars
 where bombardment has ceased. Such a broadening was specially
 noticeable in the spectrum of Nova Aurigae, as I pointed out in a
 paper communicated to the Royal Society on February 11, 1892.*
    The conditions, however, may vary considerably in different cases,
 according to the character of the parent nebula.                  In the case of a
 swarm which originally had a spiral structure, the chief movement
 will be very similar to one of rotation ; if the axis of rotation be
 directed towards the earth, such a movement will produce little or
 no effect on the widths of the lines, but if the axis be not so placed,
 different amounts of broadening would be produced, according to the
 inclination and radial velocity.        In these cases, lines which would be
sharp at the edges when there was no movement, would remain
sharp at the edges when broadened and dimmed.
    When the original nebula was of less regular form, the influx of
meteorites towards the centre will take place in a greater variety of
 directions, so that the broadening effects will be less regular.
    Actions of this kind, in addition to those already referred to in 3,
are probably to some extent responsible for the generally greater
breadth of the metallic lines in bodies of increasing temperature as
 compared with those in cooling stars of the same mean temperature.
    f Tauri is an interesting case in point. While the lines of
hydrogen are quite sharp and not very broad, those of the eleveite
gases are greatly distended and relatively dim.                 In this case, there
fore, it would appear that the eleveite gases are more involved than
hydrogen in the highest temperature collisions.                   In ft Lyrae, also,
the bright lines of the eleveite gases are more intense than those of
hydrogen, and here we have another indication that these gases are
among those chiefly involved in the spectral phenomena at the
highest temperature ; further, there is direct evidence that there are
at least two bodies in the system of ft Lyrae, and the variability is
probably due to collisions between the outlying meteorites.
   It may, on the other hand, be that the lines in the spectra of some
cooling stars may be broadened as an effect of rotation, as suggested
by Professor Pickering in the case of a Aquilee.                   My own photo
graphs show that the spectrum of this star is almost identical with
that of ft Arietis, except that all the lines are broadened. In this
and similar spectra, such as a. Ophiuchi and a. Cephei, the broadening
is accompanied by a reduction in intensit}'.

   5. The greater thickness of the Lines of the Cleveite Gases. — The
action which produces the lines of the cleveite gases, whatever it be,
only commences shortly before the highest temperature is reached,
and the importance of helium in the spectrum grows very quickly.
 When the action has ceased, the helium lines rapidly lose their
importance, whilst the absorbing hydrogen continues for some time
to become more effective.
   The complete discussion of these differences cannot be under
taken until the criteria for stars at the apex of the temperature
curve have been further investigated.
X. Are we is Presence        of the Highest     Stellar Temperatures?
   I have shown in § IV that our highest terrestrial temperatures only
carry us up to a temperature approximately represented by 7 Cygni.
   We have no right to assume that the small number of stars as
yet studied put us in presence of the highest stellar temperatures.
   In the present communication I have of set purpose left on one
side for future treatment those stars which apparently are at the
very apex of the temperature curve, for the reason that in these
stars we are involved in unknown lines.         These require a special
study ;   other stellar   photographs   have  to  be examined, a work
which will require some time, and new photographs have to be taken.
   In all probability, among the stars already known there are others
besides Bellatrix which are hotter than J' Tauri and Rigel, as deter
mined by the continuous spectrum and by the metallic lines in the
way already explained ; although the known gas lines are of nearly
similar intensity, these stars show distinct differences among them
selves, and other criteria for their arrangement in order of tempera
ture must, therefore, be looked for.
   At this stage the only remaining known metallic lines are prob
ably magnesium 4481, and the K line of calcium; these, however,
are so feeble that tlieir variations are too much dependent on the
quality of the photographs to be trustworthy criteria, and the same
remark applies also to the measurement of the extension of the
spectrum into the ultra-violet.    There are, however, several lines, as
yet of unknown origin, which are strong in some of these stars and
weaker in others, and the appearances of these afford useful criteria
for classifying tht'se stars. But, before we attempt to use these
lines to see whether any higher temperature than that of Bellatrix is
indicated, it is important to consider whether we are justified in
regarding these unknown linos as gaseous instead of metallic. This
question is now being studied, and until it is settled it is not wise to
attempt to discuss the upper temperature limits of those substances,
such as hydrogen and the cleveite gases, the lines of which increase

in importance with the increase of stellar temperature in the stars                     I
have so far discussed.
    For instance, if such hotter stars were found we might expect that
 either hydrogen or the cleveite gas lines would thin out and then
 disappear first, as the iron lines thin out in Rigel and disappear in
 Bellatrix, and that they would be replaced by other lines.
    As a matter of fact, the hottest stars under discussion do contain
other lines besides those of hydrogen and the cleveite gases.
          XI. Bearing        op  the New Results on the Dissociation
                                        Hypothesis.
                                § 1. Historical Statement.
    It was     iu 1873 that     I first called the attention of the Society to the
very remarkable facte which had been even then got together regard
ing the possible action of heat in the sun and stars.                         Referring
more especially to the classification of stars by Rutherfurd and
Secchi,     I  wrote as follows : — *
    " have asked myself whether all the above facts cannot be
      I
grouped together in a working hypothesis which assumes that in
the reversing layers of the sun and stars various degrees of ' celes
tial dissociation ' are at work, which dissociation prevents the coming
together of the atoms which, at the temperature of the earth and at
all artificial temperatures yet attained here, compose the metals, the
metalloids, and compounds."
    Subsequently in a private letter to M. Dumas, who took the
keenest interest in my solar work, I wrote,
                                                            " II semble
                                                                           que plus one
4toile est chaude plus son spectre est simple."
    I also pointed out the close relation of hydrogen to calcium,
magnesium, and other metals (it was on this ground that I had
named the substance which gave D3, which always varied with
hydrogen, helium), and the absence of all other terrestrial gases
from the solar spectrum. An interesting discussion at the Paris
Academy of Sciences was thus concluded by M. Dumas : —
    " En resume,
                          quand je soutenais devant l'Academie que les
elements de Lavoisier devaient 6tre considered, ainsi qu'il avait etabli
lui-meme, non comme les elements absolus de l'nnivers, mais comme
les elements relatifs de l'experience humaine ; quand je professais,
il y a longtemps, que I'hydrogene etait plus pres des metaux que de

                    On the Chemistry         of the Hottest Stars.             187
   At that time (1873) no         Anted   metallic spectra, with the exception
of hydrogen, had been recognised, and I stated that my work had
not revealed any.*        From that time to the present the area of inves
tigation has been extended by leaps and bounds : hundreds of
thousands of facts have been accumulated.                  I propose, therefore, to
inquire in this concluding part of my communication whether my
early attempt to group the facts available nearly a quarter of a
century ago still holds good.
   Before, however, I refer to the results of the new work contained
in this memoir, having special reference to the stars, it will be neces
sary to give a very hasty sketch of some of the main conclusions
derived from solar research, the more especially since the stellar
 work was taken up with a view of testing the views arrived at from
a special study of the sun.
   When I began spectroscopic work in 1865, the general idea was
that the spectrum of a chemical substance was one and indivisible —
that it could not be fundamentally changed by temperature.
   In a paper communicated to the Royal Societyf in 1874, I alluded
to the evidence showing that this opinion was erroneous, and that
metals, inclnding hydrogen and, as recently had been shown, potas         J
sium and sodium possessed fluted spectra, the line, fluting, and con
tinuous spectra indicating different molecular complexities which
could be dissociated by heat and electricity.
   In 1878    I went further, § and showed that the solar phenomena
could only be explained by assuming that the changes in the various
intensities of lines in the line spectrum itself indicated successive
dissociations.    I    pictured the effect of furnaces of different tempera
tures, and  I  wrote as follows : —
   " It is abundantly clear that if the so-called elements, or, more
properly speaking, their finest atoms — those that give us line spectra
— are really compounds, the compounds must have been formed at a
very high temperature.           It is easy to imagine that there may be no
superior limit to temperature, and therefore no superior limit beyond
which such combinations are possible, because the atoms which have
the power of combining together at these transcendental stages of
heat do not exist as such, or rather they exist combined with other
atoms, like or unlike, at all lower temperatures.                Hence association
will be a combination of more complex molecules as temperature is
reduced, and of dissociation, therefore, with increased temperature,
there may be no end."||

   In the   same year I also studied the changes in the line spectra in
relation to the changes observed when known compounds were dis
sociated,   and after discussing certain objections I submitted the con
clusion that the known facts with regard to the changes in line
           " are
spectra            easily grouped together, and a perfect continuity of
phenomena established on the hypothesis of successive dissociations
analogous to those observed in the cases of undoubted compounds."*
                         Special Reference      to Solar Work.
   Neglecting the flutings in the extreme red, which are due to our
own atmosphere, the only fluting known to exist in the solar spec
trum is one which I ascribed to carbon in 1878. f
   Hence the solar work has had mainly to do with line spectra.
With regard to these, the following anomalies on the ordinary view-
are given as specimens of the many which have been recorded.
   1. Judging by the lines seen in their spectra, the order in which
the elements thin out as the cooler parts of the sun's atmosphere are
reached has no relation to their atomic weights, either old or new.
This order is
                                           Ca
                                           H

   2.   Inversion    of intensity    of lines      seen under different circum
stances.!
   1  showed     in 1879 that there was no connexion whatever between
the spectra    of  calcium, barium, iron, and manganese and the chromo
sphere spectrum beyond certain coincidences of wave-length.                 The
long lines seen in laboratory experiments are suppressed, and the
feeble lines exalted in the spectrum of the chromosphere.                 In the
Praunhofer spectrum, the relative intensities of the lines are quite
diffi' .ent from those of coincident lines in the chromosphere.
    3. The simplification of the spectrum of a substance at the tero-
 peiatnreof the chromosphere. To take an example, in the visible
 region of the spectrum, iron is represented by nearly a thousand
 Fraunhofer lines; in the chromosphere it has only two representa
tives.

   4.  In sun  spots we deal with one set of iron lines, in the chromo
sphere with another.
   5. At the maximum sun spot period the lines widened in spot
spectra are nearly all unknown; at the minimum they are chiefly
due to iron and other familiar substances.
   6. The up-rush or down-rush of the so-called iron vipour in the
sun is not registered equally by ail the iron lines, as it should be on
the non-dissociation hypothesis. Thus, as I first observed in 1880,*
while motion is sometimes shown by the change of refrangibilitv of
some lines attributed to iron, other adjacent iron lines indicate a
state of absolute rest.
   Laboratory work without stint has been brought to bear, with a
view of attempting to explain the anomalies to which attention has
been directed.
   It is desirable to refer briefly to some of the work undertaken in
relation to the anomalies in question.
   1 . Experiments    on calcium to determine cause of inversion of the
intensities of H and K.
   2. Experiments on magnesium to explain the inverted intensities
of the lines in the Fraunhofer spectrum.
   3. Experiments on iron to explain the Italian observations of the
chromosphere which proved the presence of only two lines of iron in
the part of the spectrum ordinarily observed.
                         Some Special Experiments.
   Qalcinm. — In 1876 I produced                evidence     that the working
hypothesis    that  the  molecular      grouping      of calcium  which gives a
spectrum having its principal line at 4'226-9 is noarly broken up in
the sun, and quite broken up in the spark, explained the facts, which
are that the low temperature line loses its importance and practically
disappears from the spectrum of the sun, in which H and K are In-
far the strongest lines. f
   I  summed up the facts regarding calcium as follows :J " We have
tbe blue line differentiated from H and K by its thinness in the solar
spectrum while they are thick, and by its thickne-s in the arc while
they are thin.      Wc have it again differentiate*! from them by its
absence in solar storms in which they are almost universally seen,
and, finally, by its absence during eclipses, while the H and K lines
have been the brightest seen or photographed."
   I  afterwards attempted to carry the matter further by photograph
ing the spectra of sun spots. In all cases H and K lines were seen

reversed over the spots, just as Young saw them at Sherman, while
the bine calcium line was not reversed.* The oldest of these photo
graphs which has been preserved bears the date April 1, 1881.
    The experimental results in the case of calcium, therefore indi
 cated that the cause of the inversion of intensities in the lines of a
 substance under different circumstances is due to the varying degrees
 of dissociation brought about by different temperatures.
    Magnesium. — 1 have already referred to the results which I obtained
in 1879,'f by passing a spark through a flame charged with different
 substances.    In the case of magnesium the effect of the higher tem
 perature  of the spark was very marked, some of the flame lines being
 abolished, while two new ones made their appearance, one of them at
 4481.    The important fact was that the lines special to the flame did
 not appear among the Fraunhofer lines, while those of the spark did
appear.
    Here again the experiments pointed to varying degrees of dis
 sociation at different temperatures as the cause of the non-appearance
 of some of the magnesium lines in the Fraunhofer spectrum.
    From these experiments the results of which were subsequently
 mapped in relation to the various heat-levels indicated by solar
 phenomena, I drew the following conclusions in 1879 : —
    " I think it is not too much to hope that a careful study of such
maps, showing the results already obtained, or to be obtained, at
varying temperatures, controlled by observations of the conditions
under which changes are brought about, will, if we accept the idea
that various dissociations of the molecules present in the solid are
brought ahout by different stages of heat, and then reverse the pro
cess, enable us to determine the mode of evolution by which the
molecules vibrating in the atmospheres of the hottest stars associate
into those of which the solid metal is composed.           I put this sugges
tion forward with the greater confidence, because I see that help
can be got from various converging lines of work."J
   Iron. — The anomalies which have heen noted in the case of iron
led me to undertake some experimental work with the sparks pro
duced by quantity and intensity coils with and without jars in the
circuit.§ The outcome of these experiments was to show that the
chromospheric representatives of iron were precisely the lines which
were brightened on passing from the arc to the spark, while the
lines widened in spots corresponded to a lower temperature.
   Attention was at the same time drawn to the gradual simplifica
tion of the iron spectrum by increased temperature as we pass from
the arc through the spots to the prominences.

   It  seemed perfectly clear then that in the sun
                                                            " we were not

with iron itself, but with primitive forms of matter contained in
iron, which are capable of withstanding the high temperature of the
sun, after the iron observed           as such, has been broken               up, as
 suggested by   Brodie."*
   On this view, the high temperature iron lines of the chromosphere
 represent the vibrations of one set of molecules ; while the lines
 which are widened in spots correspond to other molecular vibrations.
 Similarly, the idea of different molecular groupings provides a
satisfactory explanation of the varying rates of movement of iron
vapour indicated by adjacent lines, the lines being produced by
absorption at different levels and at different temperatures.
                    § 2. How the Hypothesis has fared.
                               The  Main Points.
   Only some of the views have received general acceptance, those
referring to the breaking up of the solid metal giving a continuous
 spectrum into smaller molecular groupings giving fluted and line
spectra.
   My view as to the subsequent dissociation of molecules, when once
 the line spectrum stage has been reached, is still rejected by many.
 For myself, 1 am not surprised at this. In a question of such tran
 scendent importance, caution must be redoubled ; an absence of work
 and expression of opinion in such a line of inquiry with questions of
 pure science only involved, is almost inherent to the nature of the
investigations.
   The chemist has little interest in an appeal to celestial phenomena,
and astronomers do not generally concern themselves with chemistry,
The region investigated by the chemist is a low temperature region
dominated by monatomic and polyatomic molecules. The region I
have chiefly investigated is a high temperature region, in which
 mercury gives us the same phenomena as manganese.                         In cases
where the two regions overlap, vapour density determinations and
other work have been in harmony with the spectroscopic results, e.g.,
 the changed density of iodine at changed temperatures.
   Another, but less direct, argument in favour of dissociation, inde
pendently of the changes in the intensities of the lines, was based
upon some observations I had made in an attempt to work out a
spectroscopic method for the detection of impurities.                   I noted the
presence of what I termed "basic lines,"             that   is,   short lines which
                                                                "              " had
remained common to two or more spectra, after                      long lines
been eliminated as being due to impurities.
   I  now refer to these different points seriatim.

    I take the    change      of the continuous spectrum successively into
flutings and lines first, and in justification of the statement that in
this matter my view is now generally accepted, 1 give the following
 quotations from Schuster and Eder and Valenta: —

spectra)   are   due    to different   molecular    combination     I consider to be
pretty well established, and analogy has led me (and Mr. Lockyer
 before me) to explain the continuous spectra by the same cause; for
 the change of the continuous spectrum to the line or band spectrum
takes place in exactly the same way as the change of spectra of
different orders into each other.*

    With regard       to the view that the line spectrum integrates for us
the vibrations     of several sets of molecules, as I have already stated
this is not accepted. The number of objections is legion, and it is
impossible to refer to all of them here.              But, at the same time, the
opinion of some of those workers who have approached the subject
from hoth points of view is, I think, coming round to my side, and I
shall briefly refer to one or two instances, the first bringing confirma
tion from a new line of inquiry.
                       The effect of Pressure on Wave-length.
    Messrs. Humphreys and Mohler have recently made, at the Johns
Hopkins University, a series of experiments upon the effects of
pressure on the wave-lengths of metallic lines.J Using an electric
arc inclosed in a cast-iron cylinder, the}7 have observed the spectra
at pressures varying up to fourteen atmospheres.
    The general effect of pressure was to broaden the lines and to
bring out the reversals, hut cadmium was found to be an exception.
With one exception, all the measurements actually made of the

 as much as the blue line at 4226-9.
    Referring to the exceptional behaviour of calcium, Professor Hale
                                    " seems to
 points out that the result                       support Lockyer's views as to
 the dissociation of calcium in the arc and sun," * and further states :
 " It would thus
                       appear that the temperature of the dissociation of
calcium    is between     that of the Bunsen burner and that of the oxy-
coal gas flame.       The high molecular weight of calcium has hitherto
conflicted with our belief in the presence of this metal in promi
nences.     If, however, it be granted that dissociation can bo brought
about by temperatures even lower than that of the arc, the difficulty
is very greatly lessened."
    In an article which       I   wrote in ' Nature ' on this work,f I pointed
            "
out that it would be very interesting to see if the strontium line at
4607 behaves like the calcium g in relation to the lines at 4077 and
4215, representing H and K."
    This prediction has been confirmed in a paper by W. J. Hum-
phreys,J on " The effect of Pressure on the Wave-lengths of lines in
the Spectra of certain Elements," in which the author gives a table
of the shifts measured on the strontium lines mentioned above.
When working with pressures varying from 6 to 12 atmos., the shift
of the line at 4077 was always approximately half that at 46')7.
    There can be little doubt that other enhanced lines will follow
suit.
                               The Question of Series.
    The other branch of new work to which I refer is the investiga
tion of " series " of lines in spectra, which was practically started by
Balmer in 1885, and in which, since 1888, we owe so mnch to the
labours of Messrs. Kayser and Runge and Rydberg.
    I stated in 1878 that the spectrum of a substance was the integra
tion of the spectra of various molecular groupings.
    Messrs. Ruuge and Paschen first showed in 1890§ that the spectra
of lithium, sodium, and potassium were the integration of the spectra
of various " series." Later they have shown that lead and other
metals follow suit.
    Before Balmer's formula was employed, rhythmic structure in
spectra had often been noticed.               Thus, in 1869, Mascart        wrote as
follows : —

    " II  semble  difficile que la reproduction d'un pareil phenomene
soit un effet    du hasard : n'est-il pas plus naturel d'admettre que ces
groupes de raies semblables sont des harmoniques qui tiennent a la
constitution moleculaire du gaz lumineux ? II faudra sans doute un
grand nombre d'observations analogues pour decouvrir la loi qui r6git
ces harmoniques."
    I wrote thus on     this subject in 1879 : —
    "I   am at present engaged in investigating this question of rhythm,
and I have already found that many of the first order lines of iron
may probably arise from the superposition or integration              of a num
ber of rhythmical triplets.          All this goes to show how long the
series of simplifications is that we bring about in the case of the so-
called elementary bodies by the application of a temperature that we
cannot as yet define.
    " Indeed, the more one studies spectra in detail, and especially under
varying conditions of temperature which enable us to observe the
reversal now of this set of lines, now of that, the more complex be
comes the possible origin. Some spectra are full of doublets ; others,
again, are full of triplets, the wider member being sometimes on the
more, sometimes on the less, refrangible side.            Doublets and trip
lets, as a rule, reverse themselves more freely than the irregular
lines in the same spectrum — which particular doublet or triplet will
reverse depending upon the temperature."*
    A series of spectral lines may be defined as a sequence of lines, the
intensity of which decreases with the wave-length, and the number
of vibrations of which may be determined by the formula —
                                  A + B/n* + C/»\
where n is given the integers from three upwards, and the constants
A, B, and C are determined for each element separately.
    The fact that lines must close up to one another, as the violet end
of the spectrum is reached, indicates that the character of a " series "
is best brought under notice in the ultra-violet end of the spectrum.
In the visible part of the spectrum the lines forming " series " are
too far apart to be recognised as belonging to series.
    As soon as it becomes apparent that a set of lines in the violet
seems to form a series, computation will at once give the lines that
belong to it in the visible part of the spectrum.
    So far there has been no definite pronouncement touching the
question of temperature or the possibility that each series may repre
sent vibrations of similar molecules, but this question has recently-
been advanced in an instance which to many will carry conviction
with it.

                           On the Chemistry        of the   Hottest Stars.                195
     Professor Pickering nnnounced last month that the star f Puppis
 contained, in addition to the usual series of hydrogen lines, a second
 series of rhythmical lines, which he supposed to be due to a new
 element.         On further inquiry, it was found that the lines were closely
 :illied to the hydrogen series, and that it was probably due to that
 substance under conditions of temperature or pressure as yet un
  known.
     His basis for this statement was founded on the fact that the
  wave-lengths of the now series could be directly computed by sub
 stituting for the value of n in the formula which gave us the known
  hydrogen series even numbers instead of odd ones.*
     Now, this new series of hydrogen has, so far as we know, only
 been seen in one other star, namely, 29 Canis Majoris.
     Professors Pickering and Kayser both concede that this new form
 of hydrogen is due most probably to a high temperature, so that we
 should expect to find it in the bright-line stars, which, on the rneteo-
 ritic hypothesis, give us the effect of the highest temperature, due to
  the possibility of end-on collisions without the shielding effects of
                                                                   " that this series has
  gaseous envelopes.             Kayser expressly states,f
 never been observed before, can perhaps be explained by insufficient
 temperature in our Geissler tubes and most of the stars."
     It seems as if the two series are of the " subordinate " type, and
 that the principal series is still wanting, because in subordinate
 series the lines for large values of n lie very near to one another, the
 principal series on the other hand terminates more in the ultra-violet.
 It seems, therefore, probable that one or two of the many unknown
 lines recorded in stellar spectra may belong to the principal series of
 hydrogen, but that they have not as yet been identified as such.                       J

   If   we are dealing in this case with a single molecule of hydrogen
vibrating in a previously unknown way in consequence of a higher
temperature, why is it that the molecules of other bodies do not put
on similar transcendental vibrations and appear in the same stars so
that we shall get new forms of the other chemical elements ? The fact
that we do not do so is, I claim, an argument in favour of the view
that the principal and subordinate series are produced by molecules
of different complexities, and that the finer molecules can alone
withstand the action of the highest temperatures.
    In this way we can easily explain the visibility of the new form of
hydrogen in connection only or mainly with the lines of the cleveite
and other similar gases (for there is already evidence of the existence
of other similar gases) in the hottest stars.
    From the admirable work done on such substances as lithium and
sodium,       which apparently are reduced to their finest atoms at
relatively low temperatures, we are bound to consider that when
the research includes the complicated spectrum of iron that that
also must follow suit ; but it is already obvious that a principal and
two subordinate series will never do ; there will be a very long series
of series involved.
   Now these series must include both the arc. and the enhanced
lines, and as these are visible each without the other in stars of
different temperatures, in one case associated with the cleveite gases,
in another without them, we have another argument in favour of
molecular complexity.
                           Statement    of some  Opinions.
    1  am glad to know that attention          has recently been drawn to the
variations in the appearance of the magnesium lines in the celestial
bodies      by Dr. Scheiner, of the Potsdam Observatory, who is not
apparently acquainted with my work of 1879 ; he accepts the idea
that the variations furnish us with a precise indication of stellar
temperature,* and he is now employing it in the work of the obser-
vatory.f
   *  '
        Astronomical Spectroscopy,' Frost's Translation, p. viii.
   f  Dr. Scheiner points out that in the spectra of nearly all stars of Class la
                               "
(Group IV) the line at 4481 generally appears as a broad line — in some spectra
as strong as the hydrogen lines — but its intensity decreases just in proportion a?
the number of lines in the stellar spectrum increases, so that it is hardly of the
average intensity in the solar spectrum, or other spectra of type Ila, and the
author is unablo to deteot it in the spectrum of a Orionis." My prior work, dating
from 1879, being probably unknown to Dr. Scheiner, Messrs. Liveing and Dewar
are credited with the discovery of the peculiar behaviour of this line in laboratory
experiments, and it is added that

     " Moreover       the appearance of the great brilliancy of the             richly
lined     spectrum with a high tension jar spark, the capillary                  being
heated, and especially the interchange of a great number of new
lines which were dim before, and also the change of single lines into
double ones ; these are such that would harmonise well with
 Lockyer's theory of dissociation of the elements, if one is prepared
to bring into the discussion the possibility of the dissociation of the
chemical elements."]
     I am   glad to be able to quote the following opinion of Mr. Crookes,f
 to which I attach great weight : —
     " Until some fact is shown to be uureconcilable with Mr. Lockyer's
 views, we consider ourselves perfectly justified in giving them our
 of Class IITa (Group II) is something like that of the electrio arc, while that of
 the stars of Class Ila is higher, and that of stars of Class la is at least as high as
 the temperature of the high-tension spark from a Leyden jar. This view receives
 striking confirmation in the precisely opposite behaviour of the magnesium line at
 X 4352'18.    First becoming visible in the spectra of type la (Group IV), which
 have numerous lines, it is strong in the spectra of type Ila (Groups      III  and V),
 and increases so as to be one of the strongest lines as we pass towards type Ilia
  (Group II). Now, as was found by Liveing and Dewar, this line exhibits just the
 same peculiarities in the laboratory ; in the spark spectrum it is hardly recognis
 able, in (he arc spectrum it is very strong."
     The association of 4352 with 4481 in the hottest stars, if the stellar line really
 coincides with the magnesium line 4352, suggests that this is perhaps the last
 surviving line of the lower temperature spectrum when a very high temperature is
 reached, but there is nothing in the appearance of this line in the spark spectrum
 with large jars which would lead us to expect a behaviour similar to that of 4481.
 It is not impossible, then, that the faint line near 4352 in the hottest stars is not a
 magnesium line at all.

by reference to observed phenomena."
    I am anxious to refer here also to the opinion expressed by my
 friend and colleague, Professor Roberts- Austen, whose researches
 have mostly been carried on at high temperatures : —
    " Mr. Lockyer has, however, since done far more : he has shown
that the intense heat of the sun carries the process of molecular
 simplification much farther ; and, if we compare the complicated
spectra of the vapours of metals produced by the highest tempera
tures available here with the very simple spectra of the same metals
as they exist in the hottest part of the sun's atmosphere, it is diffi
cult to resist the conclusion that the atom of the chemist has itself
been changed.       My own belief is that these ' atoms ' are changed,
and that iron, as it exists in the sun, is not the vapour of iron as we
know it upon earth."*
                                 The Basic Lines.
    With regard to the basic line part of the inquiry, I think I shall
not be going too far in saying that it has been universally rejected,
and chiefly on the ground that some lines which appeared coincident
at the dispersion I employed appeared double with higher disper
sions. I have pointed out in the ' Chemistry of the Sun (p. 377) that
                                                                    '
this is not a sufficient answer, but           I  have left aside this branch of
the inquiry for some years in the hope that some chemist would
take up the question of spectroscopic impurities out of which it
grew.
    But it is evident that this basic line point of view, even though it
be considered a less direct attack on the problem than others,
assumes a much more important and definite position in the light of
the new work.        I will not go into this question at length now, but
will content myself by asking whether one actual demonstration of
dissociation will not take a form very like that which the chemist
has taken to be a demonstration of the existence of impurities.

necessary to enable me to group together harmoniously and con
tinuously solar phenomena are weakened or strengthened by the
study of the new field of investigation opened out by the recent

                   On tlie Chemistry  of the  Hottest Stars.         199
    In  approaching this new part of the subject, it is necessary to
proceed with great cantion, since the things observed are different.
 The solar work has consisted in observing different parts of the sun,
the star work puts us in presence of the total effects both of radia
tion and absorption in the case of each body observed.
                           A Possible Objection.
    But in limine there is an objection to meet which may possibly be
put forward by those unfamiliar with these inquiries.
    It is that there is no relation whatever between the sun and stars,
 that there is no evolution, and that the various spectral differences
 are due simply to the fact that the relative percentage composition
varies from sun to star and from star to star, so that some stars may
be composed entirely of the cleveite gases, others of hydrogen, others
 of calcium, others of iron, others of carbon, and so on.
    Those who hold these views and deny that an evolntion is going
 on have to explain the following facts : —
    1. While the number of chemical elements known at the present
 time is about seventy-two, the number of well-marked groups of stars is
only seven, and this number includes the nebulae.
    2. It is not sufficient to suppose differences due to a variation of
the number of chemical elements present in different stars, as there
may also be any number of possible variations in the percentage
composition.     On this ground an infinite variety of spectra might
be expected, but, as already stated, the number of well-marked
groups is seven.
    3. Each particular kind of star spectrum is always associated with
 the same degree of stellar temperature as determined by other con
siderations.     With differences of chemical composition, different
spectra would occur with equal temperatures.
    4. The Sun, Capella, and Arcturus, and other cooling stars,
enormously separated in space, contain the same spectral lines with
almost identical intensities, so that not only do they contain the
same " elements," but they contain them in absolutely identical pro
portions.     The earlier and hotter stages of such stars could not
therefore have consisted of different mixtures.
    5. All the blood-red stars, which it is generally acknowledged are
near the point of extinction, have identical spectra.
   6. The facts in this paper already given show that the differences
recorded in stellar spectra do not come from a different percentage
composition of the elements present, but arise from the action of
different temperatures on the same molecules.
   Until the above facts are explained       I must hold that the argu
ment is complete that we do get the same elements represented by

200                     Mr.  J. Norman Lockyer.
different spectral lines in different stars when the apparent differ
ences are such as to suggest the objection to which            I am now
referring.
    It is not a question of the absence of elements, but of the
absence of certain molecular complexities of each element, which
separates the spectrum of the sun from those of the stars of various
orders.
      The Connexion  between  Chromospheric and Stellar Phenomena.
   The objection having been met, I now proceed to discuss the
connexion between the sun and stars, and in order to bridge the
gap which separates them, it is necessary to bring forward the very
latest solar results as a basis of inquiry.
    The chromosphere, which represents that part of the atmosphere
with which we have chiefly to do in the light of § 2, is well pour-
trayed in the photographs of the Eclipses of 1893 and 1896.            So
complete is the record, that it is quite sufficient for our present pur
pose, and is to be the more relied on since it represents it at the
same instant of time. I have elsewhere pointed out that Young's list of
chromospheric lines may be misleading because it is a summation of
results obtained at different times and of different conditions ; pro
minences even may be, and doubtless are, involved.         I have already
stated the order in which the various substances          thin out ; the
lengths and intensity of the lines are faithfully recorded in the
photographs.
    An examination of the eclipse photographs shows that the tem
perature of the most luminous calcium vapour at the sun's limb is
not far from that of the electric spark, the blue line being feeble as
compared with the H and K lines, which we have seen to be enhanced
on passing from the arc to the spark.
    Many of the characteristic arc lines of iron appear in the chromo
spheric spectra as photographed at the two eclipses, and those which
I   have recently shown to be enhanced in the spark are all present in
the chromosphere of 1896, and most of them in that of 1893.        In the
chromosphere of 1896, the enhanced lines are all of greater intensity
 than the corresponding Fraunhofer lines, and they are also relatively
 stronger, as referred to the arc lines, than they are in the experi
 mental spark.    Hence, incandescent iron vapour in the chromosphere
 must beat a temperature at least as high as that of our hottest spark,
 and certainly higher than that of the iron vapour which is most
 effective in the production of Fraunhofer lines.
    The characteristic spark line of magnesium at wave-length 4481
 is not represented in the chromospheric spectra of 1893 and 1896,
 but other lines which are common to the arc and spark were recorded

                   On the Chemistry   of  the Hottest Stars.          201
in both. Taking the magnesium lines by themselves then, they
would suggest a temperature lower than that of the spark, but re
membering that 4481 is only a short line in the experimental spark,
it may be that its absence from the chromosphere is not so much due
to low temperature as to the admixture       of the magnesium with other
 vapours.
    The intensities of the lines of calcium, iron, and magnesium, there
 fore, all accord with the view that the temperature of the region of
the chromosphere in which these vapours exist is not less than that
of the electric spark.
     The possible  action of heat on the Sun's present Chromosphere.
    Having these unimpeachable series of facts to go upon, we have
 first to consider what would happen if the temperature were raised.
 We have seen that there are, in fact, in the chromosphere many
 layers of vapours, that the thickest lines, H and K, are thickest at
 bottom, and that if we take the lines observed in the spectra of
 calcium, strontium, iron, magnesium, manganese, &c., the order of
 thinning ont has no known relation to the atomic weights of these
 substances, while taking the facts as we find them, we are certainly
  dealing simply with the power of resisting higher temperatures.
    Now, it is only possible to consider the results produced by a
 higher temperature on two hypotheses.           The first, the usual one,
that the   chemical  elements  are indestructible ; the second, that they
are not.
    On the first hypothesis it is difficult to say what change could
 take place which would alter the characteristics of the spectrum very
 widely.     We have a complex mixture of the vapours of metallic
 substances and gases with paramount calcium, hydrogen, and the
 cleveite gases. Temperature        cannot therefore vary the relative
 intensities of the lines.   H  and K must always remain predominant,
 iron must remain because it cannot be destroyed, and the quantity
of hydrogen and the cleveite gases present cannot be increased, their
 lines cannot therefore become more important in the spectrum.
    It is also clear that any change of relative density on the usual
 hypothesis cannot be brought about by an increase of temperatnre ;
 this, then, cannot alter, it cannot change the relative proportions of
chemical substances present in any layer, and therefore the relative
intensities of the lines which indicate the existence of the various
substances in the different layers.
    It may be said that in consequence of a more exalted temperature,
the hydrogen and cleveite gases may, for some reason or other,
 escape from among the metallic vapours, and form an upper special
 atmosphere of their own, in which, in consequence of its greater

202                     Mr. J. Norman Lockyer.
chemical simplicity, the lines of these substances will become more
important.    But this argument is not philosophical, because we have
no right  to assume such a change.      These gases already exist in the
order named in the sun at the temperature of the electric spark, and,
in fact, in the sun hydrogen and the cleveite gases give us no traces
of their existence at any great height above the chromosphere ; the
gas that does exist in these elevated regions is one about which we
know nothing, so far, terrestrially, and of which no trace has yet been
found in the spectrum of the hottest stars.
   The only change which we can imagine on the usual hypothesis, as
resulting from the increase of temperature, is that with the increase
in volume there will be a reduction in density, and all the lines will
be equally enfeebled.     But this is exactly what does not happen.
   If now we turn to the other hypothesis, that, namely, of dissocia
tion, we see at once, in the light of laboratory experiments, that with
every considerable increase of temperature in all such masses of
vapour and gas as that which now constitutes the solar chromosphere,
a fundamental change in the appearance of the spectrum must be
brought about, complex molecules would be broken up into simpler
ones, and the result of this action would bring new lines into the
spectrum, indicating the vibration of the molecules produced. Now
let us come to facts. Were the temperature of the chromosphere to be
increased, if dissociation takes place at this temperature, the dissocia
tion products must become visible, and we must look for them among
those lines which expand at the expense of those which contract and
disappear. Is any such experiment as this going on even at this
moment ?      The answer is beyond question.           The evidence is
complete that the temperature in the reversing layers of a Cygni is
higher than that of the reversing layers of the sun.        What do we
find ?    Of lines disappearing we have arc lines of iron, some
 thousands in number, calcium, magnesium, strontium, and so on.
 Of lines increasing in importance we have the small number repre
 senting the enhanced lines of iron, the lines of hydrogen, and some
 others which we cannot at present associate with the name of any
 known substance.     Here, then, we get a series of phenomena which,
on   the hypothesis we are discussing, is simply and sufficiently
 explained by the statement that on passing from the temperature of
 the sun to a Cygni, among other changes brought about, the
 complicated line spectrum of iron is giving way to a more simple
 one consisting of the enhanced lines.      Further enquiries show that
 the other metallic spectra are behaving in the same way. Looking
 for the lines which increase in importance, while the others are
 reduced, we find the lines of hydrogen increasing in importance.

                   On  the Chemistry  of the Hottest Stars.          203
                              The Orion Stars.
    Now  if we consider another change higher up in the scale of tem
perature, taking as the lower level a Cygni, at which we have arrived,
we have independent evidence that the so-called Orion stars are
hotter than such a star as a. Cygni.
    On proceeding to study the higher dissociating temperature at
work in the Orion stars, all the statements made with reference to
the changes likely to occur in the spectrum on the non-dissociation
hypothesis, strictly apply.      We cannot expect any change in the
relative intensity of the lines, and the appearance of the spectrum
cannot be f undamentally altered.
    On the dissociation hypothesis, on the other hand, if we find certain
lines indicating certain substances disappearing, and other lines indi
cating other substances making their appearance for the first time,
or if they were visible before, becoming much intensified, we shall
have an opportunity of studying the effects of the new dissociating
forces at work.
    Now is there any change      ?  The facts are that this increase of
temperature we are now considering reduces the quantity of iron and
calcium present, increases the amount of hydrogen present, and the
 lines of the cleveite gases now appear.
    Associating this with the former result, we get as distinct evidence
that an increase in the spectrum of the cleveite gases accompanies the
disappearance of the enhanced iron lines as that an increased develop
ment of the enhanced iron lines accompanies the decrease of the iron
arc lines.
    To take iron as an example, for the sake of simplicity, it will be
seen then that the actual stellar phenomena might have been pre
dicted up to a certain point, from a consideration of laboratory and
solar phenomena.      But the stars carry us further than our predic
tions ;  we   see the  gradual increase of hydrogen and cleveite gases.
The facts demonstrate that as temperature increases hydrogen
increases, and, together with the cleveite gases not obvious before,
finally replaces iron which has disappeared.
                           The Law of Continuity.
    I am bound to make this appeal       to the law of continuity.   The
verdict is that,   as in all previous human experience, a higher tem
perature brings about simplifications, and it is not strange that, as
onr horizon is expanded by new work, we find the same laws in
operation.     We have,    I hold, in these phenomena the work of dis
sociation carried on before our eyes in the hottest stars, to a point not
reached before, and the stars also tell us that this is beyond our

204                   Mr.   J.   Norman Lockyer.
laboratory possibilities, for the highest temperature      Ihave employed
only carries us to the heat level of 7 Cygni, in which star the cleveite
gases, if visible, give only very faint traces.    We are thus brought
finally face to face with the fact that iron is a compound, into the
 ultimate formation of which hydrogen, or the cleveite gases, or both,
enter, and thus the appearance of Ds in the chromosphere associated
 with the enhanced lines of iron is finally explained.           The stars
included in the present discussion do not enable us to say finally
 whether hydrogen, excluding the new form, or the cleveite gases,
are primordial among those at present known to us, but there is
 already evidence furnished by /9 Lyrae and £' Tauri, that that position
 will probably have to be accorded to the cleveite gases, dealing with
 those with which we at present are familiar.
    But the discovery of Professor Pickering of the new form of hydro
 gen, to which allusion has been made, must have a most important
 bearing upon this conclusion, especially      if,
                                                 as suggested by Kayser
 and myself, the principal series of hydrogen        still beyond oar ken,
                                                     is
 because this would indicate that even in the hottest stars so far con
 sidered, the temperature   isnot high enough to allow its molecule to
 exist uncombiued.
    My son, Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer,    isnow engaged upon this and allied
 problems    in  connection  with  other  series   he has discovered in
 Bellatrix, and the spectra of other stars at the apex of the tempera
 ture curve, including the detailed facts with regard to the appearance
 of the various series of the cleveite gases.
                    The ultimate Molecules involved.
   Itfollows from the preceding statements that, so far        as the power
of resisting the effect of temperature      concerned,
                                               is              the ultimate
molecules at present within our ken of the chemical            elements dis
cussed in this memoir may be arranged provisionally in         the   following
order — :
                Uncertain, probably  Gas X
                                      f
                   correct order.    He

                                          Fe
  The ultimate molecules of Ca, Mg, and Pe thus indicated may be
considered as representing the vibration of a proto-calcium, proto-
magnesium, and proto-ferrum in stars of medium temperature.

                            Front's Hypothesis.
    This result teaches as that Prout's hypothesis, though at the time
it  was promulgated it was a magnificent approach to the truth, cannot
be true absolutely, for two reasons.         (1) Gas X and helium take
precedence, in all probability, of hydrogen (exclnding the new form)
in the evolutionary series ; and (2) terrestrial hydrogen, as we know
it, is broken up molecularly before it can give us the line spectrum,
and it is the hydrogen that gives ns the line spectrum that makes its
appearance in stars in greater quantity as the enhanced iron lines
disappear in consequence of the action of a higher temperature.
                                Final Result.
    The above conclusions, based upon laboratory, solar, and stellar
evidence, all tending in the same direction, may be regarded as the
                                                                        "
result obtained so far in regard to the " celestial dissociation
which I pictured to myself in 1873.
    I  claim that each step in the work has demonstrated the truth of
that hypothesis more and more, and that we can now acknowledge
that the phenomena of the inorganic world are dominated by an
evolution not less majestic, although much more simple, than that
now universally accepted in the case of organic nature.
             XII. — General   Conclusions.    (March 20, 1897.)
    1. In a mixture of vapours at a particular temperature, a vapour
 which is not present in sufficient quantity to show all the lines of its
 spectrum will be represented by the lines which are longest in its
 spectrum at the particular temperature in question.
    Only some of the short lines in metallic spectra represent the
 effects of high temperature.
    2. Some of the substances which have been investigated, including
 iron, calcium, and magnesium, have probably a definite spectrum,
 consisting of a few lines, which can only be completely produced at a
 temperature higher than any which is at present available in labora
 tory experiments.     The lines constituting the new spectra are those
  which either only appear in the spark spectrum, or are lengthened in
 passing from the arc to the spark.     Such lines are termed enhanced
 lines.
    3.  In  the case of iron, calcium, and magnesium, there are four
 distinct teinpernture steps which are marked by spectral changes :
 (a) The flame spectrum, (6) the arc spectrum, (c) the spark spec
 trum, (d) a spectrum consisting solely of those lines which are
 enhanced in passing from the arc to the spark.

206                    Mr.  J. Norman Lockyer.
   4. The order of temperature of      certain stars, as determined from
a comparison of the extensions of      the continuous spectrum into the
violet or ultra-violet, is precisely   the same as that which follows
from a comparison of the metallic     spectra at the four stages of tem
perature.
   5. The variations of the metallic lines furnish the most convenient
means of determining relative stellar temperatures, for the reason that
photographs with special exposures are unnecessary.
   6. Having ascertained the relative temperature of a star in this
way, and assuming that all the absorbing vapours are at the same
temperature, the presence or absence of any other metallic substance
can be determined by looking for the lines which are longest in its
spectrum at that temperature. In the case of the hottest stars, the
fourth stage spectrum must be the term of comparison.
   7. Accepting the new results with regard to the lines enhanced in
the spark, several lines in the spectra of the hottest stars, for which
no origins could previously be assigned, can now be ascribed to
metallic substances at the fourth stage of temperature.
   8. The lines of the cleveite gases appear only iu the hotter stars,
as indicated by the extension of the continuous radiation into the
ultra-violet.   They increase in intensity with increased temperature
in certain stars.
   9. The order of stellar temperatures, determined from the increas
ing intensity of the lines of the cleveite gases, is identical with that
determined from the decreasing intensity of the metallic lines in the
case of those stars which show both series of lines.
   10. Different substances     are spectroscopically visible through,
different ranges of stellar temperatures. The hydrogen lines are
visible in stars ranging in temperature from that of a Orionis to that
of Bellatrix, while those of the cleveite gases do not appear below
the temperature of a Cygni.       The enhanced lines of calcium appear
at temperatures as low as a. Orionis, and persist, with reduced
intensity, to the temperature of Bellatrix ; those of iron do not
appear at temperatures lower than that of a. Cygni, and disappear
altogether at the temperature of Bellatrix ; while the enhanced line
of magnesium appears at the temperature of a. Cygni, and remains
feebly visible at the temperature of Bellatrix.
   11. It follows, then, that the enhanced metallic lines may be absent
from a stellar spectrum, either because the temperature is too low or
too high.
   12. In the case of those    stars which previous investigations have
 shown to be cooling, the metallic line phenomena are inverted.       The
 enhanced lines first become visible, then the arc lines ; while the
 enhanced lines disappear at a certain stage in the process of cooling,
 the arc lines continue to become stronger.

                     On the Chemistry  of tlie Hottest Stars.          207
    13. The lines of the cleveite gases show a .similar inversion on the
downward side of the temperature curve. Strongly represented in
the hottest stars, they thin out very rapidly in cooling stars, and dis
appear before the arc lines have begun to show themselves.
    14. Utilising the iron lines as a method of bringing together stars
of approximately equal temperature, it is found that at each stage
the stars are divisible into two groups, which, in accordance with my
previous work, correspond to increasing and decreasing temperatures
respectively.
    15. As determined in this way, stars of increasing temperature
differ from those of decreasing temperature at the same stage of heat :
 (1) in the greater continuous absorption in the violet or ultra-violet,
(2) in the generally greater intensity and breadth of the metallic
lines, (3) in the smaller thickness of the hydrogen lines, (4) in the
greater thickness of the helium lines at those stages in which they
are visible.
    16. These differences are all explained on the meteoritic hypothesis.
    17. There are stars, near and at the top of the carve, which cannot
be arranged in order of temperature by the criteria referred to in 15,
for the reason that the iron lines have disappeared, and the lines of
hydrogen and cleveite gases show little variation.
    18. The arrangement of stars about the top of the curve will
depend upon the conditioning of certain lines, at present of unknown
origin ; the necessary criteria, therefore, require further investiga
tion.
    19. The known facts     with regard to changes in the line spectrum
of  an element can be easily explained on the hypothesis of successive
dissociations analogous to those observed in the case of undoubted
compounds.
    20. Similarly, the differences in the lines representative of a metal
such as iron in the spectra of sun -spots, prominences, chromosphere,
or different   stars, are explained by supposing that there are different
molecular groupings at each stage of temperature.
    21. The change from a continuous spectrum to one consisting of
 flutings, and afterwards to one of lines, is now acknowledged to be
 due to the existence of different molecular combinations.
    22. The recent investigations of Humphreys and Mohler on the
 shifts produced in metallic lines, when the vapours are observed at
 different pressures, confirm my view that the line spectrum of a metal
integrates for us the vibrations of several sets of molecules.
                                                         "
    23. It is argued that the existence of " series        of lines in the
spectra of some chemical elements is another indication of molecular
complexity, each series probably representing the vibrations of similar
molecules.
    24. The behaviour of the magnesium lines in stellar spectra is

208              On the Chemistry    of the Hottest Stars.
ascribed by Dr. Schemer to differences of temperature, in accordance
with my experimental results of 1879.
   25. The experiments on the spectrum of mercury which have been
made by Eder and Valenta have revealed variations which, according
to them, favour the dissociation hypothesis.
   26. On varions grounds, the view that the differences in stellar
spectra represent fundamental differences of chemical composition is
untenable. The fact that many stars which are widely separated in
space give identical spectra, indicates that they not only contain the
same "elements," but that the "elements" exist in the same pro
portions in all.
   27. On the non-dissociation hypothesis, the action of heat on the
sun's chromosphere could not produce such a spectrum as that which
we know to be associated with hotter stars, since the relative pro
portions of different vapours could not be changed. The only change
 which can be imagined to take place on this hypothesis is a reduction
of intensity of all the lines due to reduced pressure.
   28. On the dissociation hypothesis, increased temperature would
bring about fundamental changes in the spectrum due to molecular
simplifications, and in this way the effect of an increase of tempera
ture on the sun's chromosphere, as indicated by hotter stars, can be
predicted, and receives a simple and sufficient explanation.
   29. The disappearance     of the enhanced iron lines in the hottest
stars, and the simultaneous intensification of the lines of hydrogen,
helium, and gas X, bring us face to face with the fact that iron is a
compound, into the ultimate formation of which one or all of these
gases enters.
   30. The ultimate   molecules of the chemical elements discussed in
the present paper may be provisionally arranged in the following
order of resistance to the effects of temperature : —
                          GaS * \ Doubtful   which.

                              Mg
                              Fe
   31. Each step in advance which has been made since 1873 has
demonstrated more and more that there is really such a " celestial
              "
dissociation    going on as that which I then suggested.
   In concluding this paper,      I am anxious to express my great
indebtedness to my assistants. For the photographs of the spectra
of stars and the new photographs of the spectra of metals under

                On the Chemical Constitution    of the Stars.          209
various conditions I have to thank Messrs. Baxandall, Shacklefcm,
Butler, and Watson. Mr. Baxandall is responsible for the wave
lengths and intensities of most of the metallic and stellar lines given
in   the paper, and he has also made the maps which deal more espe
cially with the metallic lines. The maps showing the occurrence of
the gaseous lines in stellar spectra have been made by Dr. W. J. S.
Liockyer, who has also contributed the part relating to series of lines
in spectra. To Mr. Fowler        I  am indebted for help in the general
supervision of the various branches of the research, and for assist
ance in the preparation of the paper.
       Note by Professor Schuster, F.R.S., " On the Chemical
                       Constitution of the Stars."
     I could have wished that the classification of star spectra had been
 the only question submitted to us for discussion. The subject is
 important and difficult enough in itself ; there are many points on
 which opinions might have been profitably exchanged, and I think we
 might have arrived at some general consensus of opinion which would
 have left us more fit to form a sound judgment on the fundamental
 questions brought forward in the second portion of Professor Lock-
 yer's paper, in which we are directly challenged to accept the disso
 ciation theory in its full generality.       Had Mr. Lockyer confined
 himself to bringing forward his hypothesis as ono which is legitimate,
  consistent, and deserving of attention, many of us would, I think,
  have agreed that he has made out a good case. But he claims his
  theory as the only one that can explain the facts, and dismisses as
  unphilosophical the only alternative which he discusses.        I think
 that in this he has gone too      far, and to bring matters to an issue I
  will put the case for the other side ; but before doing so I should
  like to express my concurrence in the general system of classification
  adopted in the paper.    No classification is likely to prove successful
  which does not constantly appeal to laboratory experiments, and do   I
  not think Professor Lockyer will have much difficulty in convincing
  the scientific world that he has made a very material advance by
  bis investigations of the " high temperature
                                                   " or " enhanced "
                                                                      lines
  of the metals.
     "The only 'change," according to Professor Lockyer, " which we
  can imagine on the usual hypothesis as resulting from an increase of
  temperature, is that with the increase in volume there will be a
  reduction in density, and all the lines will be equally enfeebled."
  With this remark I cannot agree. The main fact to be explained is
 the gradual displacement of hydrogen, which is predominant in the

   opinion several causes at work which might produce that effect. A
   glowing mass of gas may be either in thermal or in convective equi
   librium, and the spectroscopic appearance in the two cases will be
   profoundly different. In reality an intermediate state probably is
   arrived at, but there is good evidence to show that the state of con
   vective equilibrium is more nearly approached in our sun than in the
   hydrogen stars. We know as a fact that there are powerful convec
   tion currents near the sun's surface. There is in consequence an
   approach to a uniform distribution of matter and enormous differ
   ences of temperature in layers which                 are comparatively close
   together.    Those  who    have   not given   much    attention to this subject
   will hardly realise the differences of temperature brought about by
   convection currents.        On the surface of the sun the temperature
   gradient produced by convection currents would be equal to 20,000°
   for each 100 km. difference in level, so that an angular distance of
   one second of arc would correspond to a difference of 100,000°.
   Radiation and condensation will diminish this gradient, but that it is
   very large is sufficiently proved by the spectroscopic evidence.            Thus,
   according to the results of Messrs. Jewell, Mohler, and Humphreys,*
   the pressure in the reversing layer for hot calcium giving the H and
   K linen is about 6 atmospheres, while that for the cooler calcium
   vapour is about 3 atmospheres. With a gravitational constant 27
   times as large as that of our earth, a difference of 3 atmospheres can
   only mean a comparatively small difference in level. While, then, in
   the sun we must admit a more or less effectual stirring up of the
   constituents together with an accompanying rapid temperature
   gradient, the evidence is just the other way in the case of stars like
   7 Lyrae.   The spectrum of that star, according to Professor Lockyer,
   contains only the high-temperature lines of iron. This means not
   only that the reversing layer is very hot, but also that there are no
   rapid changes of temperature at different levels. It is impossible to
   imagine this hot layer of gas ending abruptly, it must be surrounded
   by cooler matter, which cannot be iron, as the low-temperature lines
   of iron do not appear.         In such a star there cannot be an effectual
   mixing up of the constituents, and hence the layers of gas will arrange
   themselves according to the laws of diffusion.              It would follow that
    hydrogen being    a   lighter gas     than  iron  will  be   chiefly represented
   in the cooler and outer layers, while iron will be found more particu
   larly in the inner and hotter parts. The relative proportion of
   different elements in different layers will be regulated partly by their
   density, but to a great extent also by the total quantities present in
   the star ; for the different gases will not float on each other as liqnids
   might, but the density of each gas will increase steadily from the
   surface to the centre. The chief difference, according to this view,

                      On the Chemical Constitution   of   the   Stars.             211
between     hydrogen and a solar star lies in the more or less effectual
              a
mixing up of the constituents.    If we could introduce a stirrer into
7 Lyrse there can be no doubt whatever that the low-temperature
lines of iron would make their appearance, while, on the other hand,
if we could stop all convection currents on tbe surface of the sun the
hydrogen which now lies under the photosphere would gradually
diffuse out and give greater prominence to its characteristic absorp
tion lines.
  In the face of the direct evidence of the absence of convection
currents in the hotter stars, it is not necessary for the purpose
of my argument to discuss why this is the case, but it can be seen
that diminished  gravity, diminished density, and consequently
increased  viscosity, will contribute to the effect, while effectual
radiation  will, owing to the smaller density, take place more evenly
through a thicker layer of the envelope, so that the principal cause
of convection currents will also be much diminished.     The explana-
tion      I
        have given does not differ materially from that brought forward
by Dr. Huggins in his address as president of the British Association
at Swansea.       I do not say that difficulties may not be raised against
it, but difficulties may be raised also against the theory of dissocia
tion, and there        especially one question which Professor Lockyer
                         is
must be prepared to answer.       Amongst the heavier metals, tellurium,
antimony, mercury, are not represented in the sun, but they are found
in Aldebaran.        To be consistent, we must,       we adopt the theory
                                                          if
of dissociation, assert that these metals are decomposed in the sun.
But    if understand Professor Lockyer right, he believes that with our
          I
strongest sparks we can exceed the state of dissociation which exists
in the reversing layer of the sun.     Take such a strong spark then from
a  pole of mercury, do you get lines of helium, or of calcium, or of
hydrogen         This seems to me to be almost a crucial experiment.
                  ?
Possibly,     of   course, we should get high-temperature          lines not
hitherto looked for, but present in the sun.           If so, the objection
would fall to the ground, but        this
                                       if     not the case, and
                                              is                     mercury
                                                                         if
at    high temperature refuses to be dissociated into simpler elements,
      a
a  most serious objection to the theory would have to be answered.
   With regard to the division of stars into those of rising and those
of falling temperature, some of Professor Lockyer's remarks lead me
to think that he has not followed the recent development of the
nebular theory. To him the nebular theory            still that of Kant and
                                                          is
Laplace, while Lane, Lord Kelvin, and Bitter have applied the
dynamical theory of heat to the treatment of gaseous masses, con
tracting under their own gravitation, and have clearly shown that a
radiating and contracting mass          not necessarily a cooling mass; on
                                         is
the contrary the interior of our sun         almost certainly rising in tem

SS12            On the Chemical Constitution        of the Stars.
He showed in the year* 1883 that the total amount of light emitted
by a star will, on the nebular hypothesis, first rise and then fall, and
he then suggested that the stars of Seccbi's Class IV were falling in
temperature, while those of Secchi's Class III were rising.            This is
the same distinction which Lockyer afterwards based on his meteoric
theory, and this division is therefore not dependent on the truth of
that theory.
    While  I think that we shall all admit that different stars are in
different   stages  of development, and that hydrogen stars will
ultimately approach more nearly to the state of our sun, it would be
unwise to push the argument of uniformity too far, and to say that
every star will pass exactly through the same stages.           Ritter, who is
favourably inclined to the dissociation hypothesis, t gives good reason
to believe that the sun's surface was never much hotter thau it is
now, and that the higher temperature of hydrogen stars is connected
with their greater masses. It is, in fact, impossible to admit that the
process of development should be quite independent of the total mass
of the star. It may be urged that Arcturus must have a mass much
larger than that of our sun, and its spectrum, according to Professor
Lockyer, is identical with that of the sun. But I suppose that that
statement only refers to the blue and violet region, for according to
Dr. Huggins, to whose early stellar photographs we owe so much, the
spectrum of Arcturus in the ultra-violet approaches that of Sirius.
   Further, though I am ready to agree with the general statement
that the chemical elements in the stars are the same as those in the
sun, and probably in not widely different proportions, I am not con
vinced that the difference in the spectra of stars, which Mr. Lockyer
ascribes to ascending and descending temperatures, are not due to a
real difference of constitution.
    We have no reason to believe that the nebulae of the present day
resemble our sun's ancestor.      Some of the stars which are now in an
early stage of development may be forming through the condensation
of matter which has been left over by others ; and it would not be
surprising if the youngest star did not agree in constitution with its
aged companions.
    I now pass on to say a few words on Mr. Lockyer's final con
clusions : — Most of us are convinced in our innermost hearts that
 matter is ultimately of one kind, whatever ideas we may have
formed as to the nature of the primordial substance.              That opinion
is not under discussion. The question is not whether we believe in
 the unity of matter, but whether a direct proof of it can be derived
 from the spectroscopic evidence of stars ; for that is what Professor
 Lockyer claims. It must be observed that even according to him,
                      * '

 we do not wituess in these stars the original formation of our
 elements ; for his own theory supposes the stars to be formed from
 condensing matter originally cool, in which the metals, as we know
 them, are already present. What we see in these stars, as I under
 stand his theory, is a case of atavism, a temporary relapse of our
 elements into their original state. That may be so.                It is in my
 opinion as I have already stated, a perfectly legitimate hypothesis,
 one that at present has not been disproved, and for which, as well as
 against which, a good deal might be said, but I cannot admit the
 claim, that it is demonstrated. Nor do I believe that it will be
 generally accepted until some direct experimental evidence is
 obtained. The resources of our laboratories are not yet exhausted ; and
 we have not arrived at the limit to which we can push the intensity
 of our electric sparks. If Mr. Lockyer is right we must look for
 ward to finding some trace of helium, or calcium, or hydrogen in the
 discharge taken from iron poles. When that is done, and not till
 then, will this theory be considered as proved.
         Additional Remarks by Mr.           J.  Norman Lockyer.
    Mr. Lockyer, in his reply, pointed out that it was not open to him
 to discuss the question of classification.           He had been asked to
 prepare a paper on another subject, for the proper consideration of
 which the question of classification had to be referred to. If Pro
 fessor Schuster, as he says he does, concurs generally in Mr. Lockyer's
 scheme of classification, he must acknowledge that there must be a
                                                            " on the two sides
 very great difference in the amount of " stirring
 of the temperature curve, and that powerful convection currents
 must exist in the hotter stars in which the temperature is rising ; and
yet as a matter of fact the line absorption is very similar in both
arms of the curve.
    Mr. Lockyer has nowhere claimed that his hypothesis is the only
one which can explain the facts, he only claims that it is simple and
sufficient.

   The galactic zones extend to 30° from the galactic piano.
   The object of the division into equal areas is to bring out roughly
any differences of distribution of the different types of spectra in
relation to the galactic plane.
   The areas A, B, C, D, and AA are included in the present series
of photographs.     Of these the first four constitute a complete hemi
sphere, symmetrically divided by the galactic plane, and the deduc
tions as to distribution have been made from them
   The stellar spectra have been arranged in series, and classed
separately in the respective areas to which they belong. It appears
at once that Secchi's Type I requires further subdivision into dis
tinct classes.    To effect this, a series of divisions in parallel to
Secchi's types have been adopted, in which Divisions I, II, and         III
correspond to Type I, and Divisions IV, V, and VI to Types         II, III,
and IV respectively.
   Classified tables of the stellar spectra are given, and previous
classifications by Secchi, Vogel, Pickering, and Loekyer are indicated
in separate columns.

of Division   I are  in the first stage of stellar development from the
gaseous nebulae.      Firstly, the correspondence of their absorption
spectra with the bright-line spectrum of the gaseous nebulae, as
shown by Campbell and others, is pointed out.             Secondly, it is
shown that the photographic spectra of the groups of stars involved
in, or connected with, the nebulae in the Pleiades and the great
nebula in Orion are helium spectra of Division I. Thirdly, it is
shown that the helium stars of Division I, and the gaseous nebulae
are similarly distributed in the galactic zones.
   The special characteristics of Divisions I, II, and  III  are discrimi
nated as follows : — Bright-line stars are classed in accordance with
their absorption spectra.
   Division I. — The Orion stars, or the helium type.         The general
characteristics are the spectra of cleveite gas and hydrogen.          The
K line of calcium is usually wanting.
   Subdivision (a). — There are, in addition, special lines, the source
of which is unknown.         The possibility is suggested of these being
due to oxygen.      Thalen's spark spectrum of oxygen is collatod with
the stellar spectra.
   Subdivision (b). — There are other special lines attributed to
calcium, barium, and magnesium. These lines are persistent in sub
sequent divisions, and mark the order of transition from Division I to
Division II. The helium lines gradually disappear.
   Division II. — Sirian stars, or the hydrogen type.      The character
            —
istics are : -Helium wanting       — Very strong hydrogen — The K line
usually sharply defined — A delicate line spectrnm due to calcium,
titanium, and faintly to iron— a Cygni belongs to this type, and
shows the characteristic line spectrum exceptionally distinct — The
ultra-violet spectrum is very strong.
   Division    III. — Proeyon stars, or the hydrogen - iron type.
Characteristics : — Strong hydrogen — Strong K — Usually a full iron
spectrum — The violet spectrum still strong, and the red weak — The
iron spectrum is collated with the photograph.         This division com
pletes the requisite subdivision of Secchi's Type I.
   Divisions IV, V, and VI are equivalent to Secchi's Types II, III,
and IV. Division IV is the solar type, and on account of our
knowledge of the solar spectrum it forms the basis of sidereal
spectroscopy.
   The block of space explored by means of the photographs is n
diameter about seven times the mean distance of first magnitude
stars from the sun. This is equivalent to about 255 light-years.

   We gather from this table that as the stellar types of spectra
become more advanced             they are found to be more evenly distributed
in space. The idea is suggested that stars of the solar type —
Division IV — started their career as helium stars of Division I,
before the condensation of the galaxy.
   The Procyon stars of Division              III  followed in the same way after
the galaxy was formed.              The paucity of stars of this type in the
lower polar region, coupled with their even distribution in the other
areas, suggests the idea that the sun itself is situated near the lower
 boundary of the galaxy.
   The distribution of the Sirian stars, Division II, is anomalous, and
further information is required as to their distribution in the
southern areas.

   The Orion stars — Division — are almost confined to the galactic
zones.     It has been already conjectured that they are still in the first
stage   of stellar development from the gaseous nebulae.
   It has been throughout assumed that the successive types or
divisions are merely the manifestations of the successive physical
states, through which every star naturally passes in the course of
its career.

         Experiments on the Flame Spectra     of Carbon Monoxide.     217
  " Experiments      on the Flame     Spectrum of Carbon Monoxide."
        By W. N. Hartley, F.R.S., Royal College of Science,
        Dublin.    Received March 6,— Read March 18, 1897.
     In  the investigation  of flame spectra at high temperatures, ' Phil.
  Trans.,' A, vol. 185, p. 676, Part I, 1895, it was found that carbon
  monoxide when burnt with oxygen gave faint lines or bands in its
  spectrum coincident with edges of some of the carbon bands which
  have been observed in the flame of coal-gas.      The experiments were
  made simply with the view of ascertaining what might he usually
  seen in a carbon monoxide flame, and looked for in a flame from a
  Bessemer converter. The spectrum was photographed with a fairly
 wide slit, and the exposure was of one hour's duration.      It was com
  posed almost entirely of a continuous band of rays, but there were
 very feeble indications of lines or the edges of bands which, after
  careful inspection, being barely visible, were just capable of being
 measured.     Their positions lay between wave-lengths 5945 and 4249.
 Other faint bands were seen at 6337, 6172, 4224, and 4183. These
 all lie within the region of coloured rays and apparently belong to
 carbon, but they were by no means considered an important feature
 in the spectrum.
     The exact nature of the carbon monoxide spectrum bears upon the
 researches of Professor Smithells (' Trans. Chem. Soc.,' 1894, p. 603),
 so that it seemed desirable to decide whether the lines observed were
 really due to carbon monoxide gas, or to some impurity which gained
 admission to the material burned, or to the flame produced by its
 combustion.     A little consideration showed that possibly carbon
 aceous dust, in other terms, organic matter floating in the air, might
 be concerned in the production of the feeble carbon bands, as the
 exposure was a long one. Again, as the gas was conveyed from the
gas-holders and also from the oxygen cylinders through tubes of
india-rubber, there was some amount of uncertainty as to whether
the tubes had not contributed to the gases some minute quantity of a
volatile hydrocarbon.      To obviate any such complication, a further
series of photographs was taken with a spectroscope slit of narrower
dimensions to obtain better definition.
    The gases were conveyed through patent flexible steel tubing
which had not been used for any other purpose. The flame was pro
duced by burning the carbon monoxide by means of a Deville blow
pipe fitted with a polished platinum nozzle.       Oxygen was conveyed
into its interior by a polished platinum jet. The image of the flame
was projected on to the slit, and the photographic           plates were
exposed from thirty-five to forty minutes.      One part of the spectrum

  was photographed more strongly than the rest, the slit being wider,
  so that any feeble lines not easily seen under the usual conditions
  might be made apparent. Two spectra were photographed, but one
  was rather too weak to justify conclusions drawn from its appearance.
                   Presence of the Water-vapour Spectrum.
     The second spectrum was sufficiently dense, and its examination
  disclosed the curious fact that it contained two groups of the water-
                                            '
  vapour lines (Liveing and Dewar,            Phil. Trans.,' vol. 179, p. 27).
  The strongest group in the carbon monoxide spectrum belonged to
  Section VI, wave-lengths 3428, 2472, 3548, and 3933, the last line
  corresponds in position with the solar line K. It is stated that the
  lines in this section are weaker than those in Section V of the oxy-
  hydrogen flame, which lie between 3063 and 3203-5.            Now, although
  these latter lines were photographed in the carbon monoxide they
  were of much feebler intensity than those in Section VI.
     The lines were identified by comparing them with those from the
  flame of the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe photographed with the same
  instrument, with which they were found to coincide. That both are
  obtained by the same process of combustion, but by gases from
  different sources and with groups of lines with different relative
  intensities, was thus established.
     There were no other lines visible, only a continuous band of rays.
     Possible Origin of  the Water-vapour Lines in    the  Carbon Monoxide
                                  Spectrum.
     As to the possible origin of these two groups of lines, it was at
  once conceivable that the water-vapour present          in the carbon mon
  oxide was the cause of their appearance.
     Another spectrum was then photographed, using on this occasion
  a four-prism instrument, but there is, unfortunately, no means of
  obtaining on one plate both groups of lines including those more
  refrangible than 3502.
     The gas was dried by passing it through pumice soaked in oil of
  vitriol. A continuous spectrum was visible, with very slight indica
  tions of some of the less refrangible of the water-vapour lines.           A
  further   trial was made of the  dried gas,   which  in  this case waa burnt
  from the interior or oxygen jet of the Deville blow-pipe, the oxygen
  passing through the platinum nozzle of the outer tube.              A steady
  brilliant flame burnt for fifty minutes. In this instance the two
  groups of the water-vapour lines were as distinct as before, with a
  continuous band of diffused rays, but no other lines or hands were
  seen. It may be remarked that damp weather prevailed during these
-

       Experiments on the Flame Spectra     of  Carbon Monoxide.     219
 experiments, and though dry oxygen surrounded the dry carbon
 monoxide gas, yet the moisture of the atmosphere may have contri
 buted the water-vapour.
    In the original photograph of the carbon monoxide there were no
 water-vapour lines apparent in the spectrum.          Their invisibility
 may be accounted     for by a want of definition, owing to their being
 photographed with a more widely open slit. That the relative
 intensities of the two groups of lines are not the same as in groups
 V and VI of Messrs. Liveing and Dewar's photographs, furnishes
 grounds for believing that they belong to the spectra of two different
substances. It is not improbable that one of these substances is an
oxide of nitrogen, for it has long been known that nitric acid is pro
 duced in minute quantity by burning hydrogen, and there is reason
to believe that it is also formed on the outside of a carbon monoxide
 flame, where a greenish-yellow tinge is observed.
    It has been suggested to me by Professor         Smithells that the
 existence of the water-vapour spectrum, in the circumstances just
described, may be a confirmation of the observation made by Dixon,
that carbon monoxide when dry will not burn in dry air (' Phil.
Trans.,' 1884, Part II, p. 629 ; see also Brereton Baker, ' Trans.
Ohem. Soc.,' 1894, p. 611). Smithells states, however, that it will
burn if the carbon monoxide is heated (' Trans. Chem. Soc.,' 1894,
p. 610).    This latter fact renders it possible for carbon monoxide to
burn    and  yet not show the water-vapour spectrum, since, though a
damp atmosphere may cause the gas to ignite, the flame will heat
the jet and thus the gas subsequently will be heated and burned,
although both it and the oxygen are dry. It may also serve to
account for the original carbon monoxide spectrum not exhibiting
the water-vapour lines.
    The water- vapour spectrum was always more feeble in the photo
graphs taken from the carbon monoxide flame under an exposure of
from thirty-five to fifty minutes than in the oxyhydrogen flame under
an exposure of only two minutes. This indicates the small propor
tion of the water or other substance present.
    The result of these experiments shows that the spectrum of
carbon monoxide consists entirely of a continuous spectrum decreas
ing in intensity towards the more refrangible part of the ultra-violet,
^bout wave-length 3000.       No carbon bands or any lines or edges of
bands were photographed which could not be accounted for as due
to other substances than carbon monoxide.

    The Prochiction of X Rays of Different Penetrative Values."
         By A. A. 0. Swinton. Communicated by Lord Kelvin,
          F.R.S. Received March 24,— Read April 8, 1897.
      As is well known, if the X rays coming from an ordinary Crookes
tube of the Jackson focus type be observed with a fluorescent screen
during the process of exhaustion, the penetrative value of the rays is
found to change as the exhaustion proceeds.
      First of all, at less than a certain degree of vacuum, no X rays are
produced.        Next,   as the vacuum is   increased, X rays commence to
 show themselves, but of a quality that will do little more than pene
trate the backing of the screen.        As the vacuum is further increased,
 the rays become more penetrative, and show the shadow of the bones
 iu the hand. As exhaustion proceeds further, a point is reached
 when the flesh of the hand seems to be almost completely transparent,
 while the bones are almost entirely opaque.          At higher vacua than
 this, the bones becoming more and more transparent, the contrast
 between bones and flesh becomes less and less, till at length, at the
  very highest vacuum at which the discharge will pass, the bones
 scarcely show at all, owing to their having become nearly as trans
 parent as the flesh, while the whole hand throws but a very faint
 shadow on the screen.
      Similarly, it is found that, at any given degree of vacuum, the
 penetrative value of the X rays is increased by increasing the power

of the Ruhmkorff coil, and thereby increasing the difference of the
electrical potential between the cathode and the anode portions of
the tube, as measured by the length of the alternative spark in air.
    Again, similar results are obtained without
alteration to the vacuum or to the power of the
-Ruhmkorff coil by varying the resistance of the
tube by means of a magnetic field.*
                                                                   rt\
    In this case the gradual strengthening of the
magnetic field produces a gradual decrease in the
resistance of the tube and of the difference of the
electrical potential between the cathode and
anode, and, at the same time, causes a gradual
diminution of the penetrative value of the X
                                                                   ^
rays.
   I  have further found that it is possible to vary
the penetrative value of the X rays produced in
a focus tube by simply altering the distance
between the cathode and the anti-cathode.
                                                                          /
   For this experiment the tube, fig. 1, was con
structed, in which the anti-cathode B of alumi
nium, faced with platinum, is connected to the                                    ~
anode terminal by a sliding steel rod, so that it
could be moved along the axis of the tube, and
the distance between cathode C and centre of the
anti-cathode B varied from 1 to 3 inches, the
anti-cathode being always outside the focus of the
cathode. The tube was exhausted to a degree
that gave a maximum contrast between the bones
and flesh of the hand when the anti-cathode was
midway between its two extreme positions, and
was then sealed off, so that the vacuum was not
varied during subsequent experiments. Upon the
anti- cathode being approached to the cathode, the
X rays immediately became of a more penetrative
value, just as though the vacuum had been in
creased, while, at the same time, the potential
difference, as measured by the alternative spark,
was found to have risen.           Again, when the anti-
cathode was moved in the opposite direction and placed at a greater
distance from the cathode, the potential difference fell, and the
X rays became less penetrative and similar to those produced at a
lower vacuum. In this way, without varying the vacuum, the pene-

trative value of the X rays could be increased or decreased as desired
within the limits of the focus on the one hand and the travel of the
anti-cathode on the other.
   Again,  I  have found that the penetrative value of the X rays can
be altered by employing cathodes of different diameters.
   Having noticed that focus tubes with small cathodes give X rays
of any given penetrative value at a much lower exhaustion than do
exactly similar tubes having cathodes of larger diameter, the tube,
fig. 2, was constructed, in which there are two cathodes, C and C,
both focussing upon opposite sides of the same platinum anti-cathode..
B. The two cathodes were of dissimilar diameter, C being 0'375 in.
diameter, and C 1'125 in. diameter. Both had the same radios of
curvature, namely, 0'75 in.
   On exhausting this tube with the smaller cathode, C, in use, and
the other not connected, a degree of vacuum was soon reached when
X rays began to be produced plentifully. Pumping was then sus
pended, and the negative connection changed from the smaller
cathode, C, to the larger, C. Under these conditions, no X rays could
be obtained, the vacuum being evidently much too low for the larger
cathode.     On continuing the exhaustion to the point when, with the
larger cathode in operation, X rays were produced, but of a low
penetrative value, the negative connection was removed from the
larger cathode, and the smaller cathode put into use. Immediately
it was found that the penetrative value of the X rays had increased
to an extent that could only be obtained with the larger cathode with
a very much higher vacuum.
   Throughout the experiments with this tube it was further found

      The Production   of X Rays of   different Penetrative Values.  225
  that the potential difference, as measured by the alternative spark in
  air, was much greater when the small cathode was in use than
  with the larger cathode.
     The penetrative value of the X rays produced by any given tube
  appears, therefore, to be dependent upon several conditions.
     1. The penetrative valne is higher for a high vacuum than for a
 low vacuum.
     2. It is higher when the electrical power applied is great than
 when it is small.
     3. It is higher when the resistance of the tube is great than when
 this resistance is reduced by magnetic means.
     4. It is higher when the distance between the cathode and anti-
cathode is small than when the distance is great.
     5. It is higher when the cathode itself is small than when it is
 large.
     6. It is higher when, as a consequence of one or more of the above,
the potential difference between the cathode and the anode portion of
the tabe, and consequently the electrical excitation of the cathode, is
great than when it is small.
    On the assumption that the cathode rays consist of negatively
charged molecules that are repelled from the similarly electrified
cathode with an initial velocity that depends upon the degree of
electrical excitation of the cathode, the above conditions are those
that would conduce to a high average velocity of the molecules at
the moment at which they strike upon the anti-cathode, and, at the
same time, to a high average difference of potential between the
travelling molecules and the anti-cathode at the moment of impact.
    At high exhaustions, not only is the electrical excitation more, and
the initial velocity of the molecules consequently greater, but, owing
to the smaller number of collisions with the other molecules of re
sidual gas in the tube, the average velocity of the molecules and the
amount of their negative charge have suffered less diminution by
the time they reach the anti-cathode than in the case of lower
exhaustions.
    Similarly, when more electrical power is employed, the electrical
excitation and the initial velocity of the molecules is increased, while
the employment of a magnetic field reduces the resistance and the
electrical excitation, and consequently reduces the initial velocity and
negative charge of the molecules.
    Again, when the anti-cathode is near to the cathode, the moving
molecules having a less distance to travel before they reach the
anti-cathode, have by that time lost less of their initial velocity and
charge by collisions than when the anti-cathode and cathode are
further apart.
    And, lastly, not only does a small cathode become charged to a

226     The Production     of X  Rays of different Penetrative   Values.
higher electrical potential than a large one, and consequently impart
a higher    initial velocity and charge to the molecules, but with a
small cathode the travelling molecules are more compactly arranged
than with a large cathode, and consequently are not likely to make
so many collisions and lose so much in velocity or electrical charge
during their transit.
   It would, therefore, appear that, whatever the precise cause, the
penetrative value of the X rays produced under any given set of
conditions is dependent upon the average velocity of the molecules
and the difference of potential between them and the anti-cathode at
the moment of impact, being higher the higher the velocity and the
greater the potential difference.
    Further, since the excitation of the cathode is not uniform, but
varying, so that different molecules have different initial velocities
and charges imparted to them, and since some of the molecules will
make fewer collisions than others, and some molecules will thus
strike the anti-cathode at higher velocities and iu a more highly
charged state than others, the same hypothesis will account for
X rays being more or less heterogeneous under all conditions.
    Finally, it appears that the penetrative value, as distinct from the
 quantity, of X rays is independent of the material of which the anti-
 cathode surface is made.       Experiments with a tube in which the
 anti-cathode was made partly of platinum and partly of aluminium,
 and so arranged that by inclining the tube the anti-cathode could
 be moved, and either the platinum or the aluminium part could be
 brought into use, show that, even with metals having such very
 dissimilar atomic weights, the penetrative value of the X rays pro
 duced was the same, though the quantity of the ray9 as measured
 by photographic action or by the brightuess of a screen of barium
 platino-cyanide was distinctly greater with the platinum.         Further
 experiments    with  other tubes fitted with anti-cathodes of aluminium,
 iron, copper, silver, and platinum confirm these results. The metals
 of high atomic weight form the most efficient anti-cathodes, and give
 a larger quantity of X rays, though the difference is not so great as
 might, perhaps, be expected.       All, however, appear to give X rays
 of the same penetrative value under similar conditions.
    I am indebted to the assistance of Mr. J. C. M. Stanton and of Mr.
 H. L. Tyson Wolff for the exhaustion and manufacture of the various
 tubes with which the above experiments have been made.

   The close    connexion between the cathode rays and the more
recently discovered Bontgen rays gives a new interest to the study of
the properties of the former, although, indeed, the two widely different
views that are held as to the nature of these rays render such mi
impetus unnecessary.
   One theory holds that the cathode rays are a stream of material
particles shot off from the negative electrode, and carrying with them
a negative charge, while the other theory ascribes the rays to a
phenomenon in the ether. Both theories have received a large amount
of support.
   Hertz* found that thin films of gold-leaf, when placed in the path
of the rays were sufficiently transparent to allow a slight phosphor
escence to be produced behind the films.
   This at first sight does not appear consistent with the view that
the cathode rays consist of a stream of charged particles, and that
the phosphorescence        is produced by the rapid approach of these
particles up to the surface of the phosphorescing substance.       Even
the thinnest films of gold-leaf could not allow the passage through
them of such material particles.
   But it has been suggested by Professor J. J. Thomsonf that under
the action of the cathode rays the thin film of gold-leaf itself acts us
a cathode, and thus from its further surface we have rays given off
similar to those given off by the primary cathode.
   If this be the true explanation of the phenomenon we would expect
these secondary cathode rays to be identical in their properties with
the primary cathode rays which produce them.
   Becently Lenard,    J  in a very valuable series of experiments, has
studied the secondary rays which are produced, and which are usually
called by his name, when the cathode rays fall upon thin films of
aluminium, and the results he obtains appear to be explicable by
the above-mentioned suggestion of Professor J. J. Thomson.
   The experiments described in tide paper have to do, partly with
these Lenard rays, and partly with the cathode rays themselves.       In
the first place experiments were devised to test whether the rays
produced by tbe incidence of the cathode rays on thin films carried
a negative charge as the cathode rays do.

    That the cathode rays do carry a negative charge has been con
clusively shown by Perrin,* and the method here nsed for testing
 the charge carried by the Lenard rays is the same in principle as that
 used by him on the cathode rays.
   A tube as shown in fig. 1 was constructed.
                                     Fig. 1.
   A is the anode and is connected to earth, C is the cathode.
   Inside the tube are fixed two short metal cylinders a and b. The
inner cylinder b has a small circular opening at d, facing towards the
-cathode, and is held in position by a stiff wire which passes through
the glass at E, and is connected to a pair of quadrants of an electro
meter.
   If then the cathode rays entering the cylinder b carry a charge
the electrometer detects it, even though the rays may not give up
their charge to the metal walls of the cylinder.
   The outer cylinder a, which has also a small opening at c facfng
the cathode, is kept connected to earth by means of a wire passing
through the glass at D, and thus protects the inner cylinder from
outside electrical action.
   S is a screen (shown in front view at SJ, made of a circular disk
of lead with the central part cut away, and the hole covered with a
thin piece, /, of aluminium about O'Ol mm. thick.
   The screen is mounted on a piece of iron, h, to enable it to be
moved about in the tube by means of a magnet.           The screen is of
such a diameter as to almost touch the glass all round, just allowing
freedom of motion under the action of the magnet.

    The wide side tube B is to enable the screen S to be pulled aside
entirely out of the path of the cathode rays whenever it is desired
to do so. The screen can easily be moved about by the magnet with
out disturbing the tube which is kept sealed on to the exhausting
pump.
    Wben the tube has been exhausted until the cathode rays are welF
developed, the screen is pulled into the side tube B, the cylinder b \(y
connected to the electrometer, and the coil turned on. The electro
meter shows a negative deflection, which rises rapidly to a point at
which it remains constant.          The passage of the discharge inside the
tube    breaks    down     to   some  extent the insulation between     the
cylinders a and 6, and as the negative potential of 6 increases the
rate of flow of negatively charged particles into it will diminish, until
a state is reached at which o is losing charge to a at the same rate
at which it is receiving charge by the flow into it of the charged
particles, and at this point the potential of b remains constant.
    In one experiment the deflection rose to 175 scale divisions, which
showed that a capacity of about 30C C.G.S. units had been raised to a
potential of 87 volts.
    Everything else remaining the same, an electromagnet is placed
with its poles on opposite sides of the tube between the cathode C
and the cylinder a ; when the magnet is on and the cathode rays
deflected off the opening c, the cylinder 6 receives scarcely any charge,
showing that the negative deflection previously observed is really
due to the charge carried by the negative rays.
    The screen S is now pulled from the side tube B, and placed in the-
path of the negative rays.
    When the coil is turned on, a negative charge, smaller then pre
viously, is still obtained in the cylinder 6, and this charge is again
not observed when the magnet is placed so as to deflect the rays
off' the screen, or so as to deflect the secondary rays from the screen
off the opening c.
    The screen was moved along the tube and the deflection measured
in different positions with the following result.

cylinder was raised to a potential 6/7 of that to which it was raised
 when the screen was away, and the cathode rays fell directly on the
 opening c. This must not, however, be taken as meaning that the
 now of charged particles into the cylinder was almost as great with
 the screen as without it, because the potential to which b can be
 raised depends, as we have seen, on the conductivity of the air
 between a and b, and this with the screen in position is probably
 much less than without it, so that the flow of charged particles in
 the first case is much less than the numbers would indicate.
    But the experiment does show that when the cathode rays fall
 upon a thin sheet of aluminium, we have a flow of particles away
 from the further side of the aluminium, which is deflected by a
 magnet, and which carries a negative charge.
    The Lenard rays, therefore, like the cathode rays, carry a negative
.charge.
    The negative potential to which the cylinder 6 is raised, depends
on the position of the screen in the tube, as shown in the table given
above.     The intensity of the Lenard rays at a will depend on the
 distance of the screen from o, and also on the intensity of the cathode
 rays falling upon the screen.
    When we consider the great amount of electricity carried by the
 negative rays (as we have seen, a few breaks of the coil charged
 300 C.G.S. units to 87 volts, and other experiments of a different
character on this point will be described later on) we can easily
 understand this stream of negatively charged particles away from
the further side of the thin screen.        This large negative charge
suddenly brought up to the screen and there stopped, must cause a
similar rash of negative charge away from the screen, especially as
the air in the tube is in a condition suitable for a discharge to pass
in it.
    The screen in this experiment was not kept connected to earth,
although in other similar experiments described below it was so con
nected.     Nor does this appear to be of much consequence, because
even if the screen is well earthed, the sudden rushes of negative
charge up to it will cause variations in its potential so that it will
not shifldthe portion of the tube on its further side.
    In the experiments described above, the negatively charged
secondary rays are collected inside the tube ; it is more convincing to
arrange the apparatus so that they can be collected outside the tube,
as in this case it is easier to screen the collecting cylinder from out
side electric forces.
    For this purpose a tube, as shown in fig. 2, was constructed.
    A circular brass cup, B, is made to fit closely on the end of the
 glass tube in which are fixed the terminals A and C.                The
 brahs eup has a small aperture e, 1 mm. in radius, in the centre

                      Cathode and   Lenard Rays.                       231

of its base. This hole is covered with a piece of oiled silk fixed on
with sealing-wax, and the brass cup is then fastened on also with
sealing-wax to the tube.  Oiled silk was used for the window because
with it no trouble is experienced in getting a piece thin enough, and
at the same time free from holes.       It easily bears an atmosphere
pressure on  an aperture 1  mm.  in radius.
   The brass cup is connected to earth and used as the anode ; C is
the cathode. A is an additional terminal which may be used as the
anode. The cylinders a and b are arranged as in the last experiment.
   When the openings are directed towards e, and not more than a
few centimetres from it, the electrometer shows a negative deflection
which slowly rises to a value at which it remains constant.
   The cylinder b, with electrometer and connexions, had a capacity
of about 250 C.G.S. units, and in one experiment was raised to a
potential of 11 volts. The cylinder is not charged      if,
                                                          by means of a
magnet,  the  cathode  rays  are thrown   off the window  e neither
                                                              ;         it
                                                                       is
charged if  the cylinders are tilted a little so as not to point directly
to e.  The   experiment was tried with a similar brass end of equal
thickness (1'5 mm.), but with no window in        it, and no charge was
obtained.
   The negatively charged rays given off from the window are soon
stopped by the air at atmospheric pressure, and no effect     obtained
                                                                  is
when    the cylinder is more than a  few centimetres from the window.
The experiment confirms that described above. The negative dis
charge from the window may be shown in another way.
   A plate of ebonite placed opposite the window at a centimetre or
                      is
two from it, and the coil turned on for a few seconds. The plate            is
then dusted evenly over with a mixture of sulphur and minium, and
tapped lightly to clear    of the powder which does not adhere to it.

    In Lenard's experiments he placed screen of aluminium between

 the tube in which the cathode rays were produced, and a second tube
 which could be exhausted independently of the first, and in this tube
 he observed the deflection produced by a magnet on the rays after
 they had passed through the aluminium, or, on our way of looking
  at  it,on the secondary rays produced in this tube by the rapid
  approach of the negatively charged particles, in rushes, up to the
  aluminium window.      Lenard found that     the conditions in the dis
                                              if
 charge tube remained the same, he could vary the pressure in his
 observing tube within wide limits without producing any change in
 the amount of deflection of the rays. This at first sight appears to
 show that the Lenard rays are different in character from cathode
 rays, because we know that when the pressure in a discharge tube        is
 diminished the cathode rays are less deflected by magnetic force.
     But when we diminish the pressure in a discharge tube wc at the
 same time increase the difference of potential required to make the
 discharge pass, and   if  we regard the negative rays as negatively
 charged particles shot off from the negative electrode, this increase of
 potential difference will increase the momentum given to these
 particles, and consequently they will be less deflected.  We may thus
 regard the change of pressure as changing the deflection not directly,
 but because   it  changes   the difference of potential between      the
 electrodes.
     We cannot test this view, experimentally, inasmuch as we cannot
  vary the pressure and keep the difference of potential constant, but
  we can keep the pressure constant and vary the difference of poten
  tial to some extent. If a spark gap        is  placed in series with the
  discharge tube, by increasing the length of the spark we may make
  the difference of potential between the terminals of the tube greater
  than that required to make the discharge pass, and      it   isfound that
  forcing up    the potential difference  in  this way does diminish the
  deflection of the cathode rays.
     In an experiment a cylindrical tube of 1'5 cm. radius was used with
  the cathode at one end.    A    central beam of cathode rays was de
  flected by a magnet on to tho side of the tube so as to form a well
  defined patch of phosphorescence.      When the spark gap was closed,
  this patch was at a distance of 38 mm. from the cathode.      Increasing
  the length of the spark gap up to 10 mm. was sufficient to make the
  patch travel away to 44 mm. from the cathode.
     This shows that without any change in pressure, an increase in
 potential differenceis  sufficient to diminish the deflection.
     Now in Lenard's arrangement a change of pressure in the observing
,tube has no effect on the forces producing the rays in that tube.
if   we regard them as produced by the rapid pulses of charged
 particles up to the aluminium screen.         The impulse starting the
 rays  is  not varied, and consequently we would expect no change in

                          Cathode and Lenard Rays.                      233
the curvature of the rays.           Of course in the denser medium we
would expect the ray3 to lose their velocity sooner by impact with
the gas particles, and Lenard himself found that in air at atmo
spheric pressure he could only observe the rays at a few centimetres
from the window, while at lower pressures he could observe them at
ranch greater distances.
     In one of his experiments       Lenard reduced the pressure so low in
 his second or observing        tube,  that he could not produce rays by
 connecting the coil directly to terminals in this tube.       The pressure
 was so low that the discharge refused to pass.         When the coil was
connected to terminals in the primary tube the rays, even at this low
 pressure, were propagated in the second tube away from the alu
 minium window.
     To explain this it is necessary to assume that the electromotive
 intensity produced by the impact of the charged cathode rays on
 the window is sufficient to produce discharge in the second tube,
 even when the coil connected            to terminals in this tube cannot
 produce discharge.       From    the first experiment described above we
 calculate that at a single break of the primary of the coil the
 atoms striking on a square millimetre of area of a screen placed in
 the path of the cathode rays at a distance of 12 cm. from the
 cathode, carried a charge of about 60 C.G.S. units. A charge of
 this magnitude, brought suddenly up to the screen will produce
 very great electrostatic effects, and the electromotive intensity pro
 duced in the second tube may be great enough to dissociate the
 molecules close to the window, and produce discharge.
      On the whole, the theory that the cathode rays are a stream of
 charged atoms explains satisfactorily the observed properties of these
 vays, and also the production and properties of the Lenard rays.
      Seeing that the cathode rays produce some of the most interesting
 of the phenomena presented by a discharge tube, it is important to
 get some idea of the amount of the current actually carried by the
 rays.     It is generally stated that the cathode rays play a compara
  tively unimportant part in the actual passage of the discharge, but
 although this may, to some extent, be true in the earlier stages of
  exhaustion, it is certainly not so at lower pressures.
      By making use of the fact observed by several experimenters that
  the discharge does not always take the shortest path between tbe
  electrodes, we can separate out a part of the negative rays from the
  remainder of the discharge, and measure this part directly with a
  galvanometer, and thus get an inferior limit to the fraction of the
  whole current carried by the cathode rays. The appearance of the
   tube justifies us in assuming that the part of the current we thus
   separate out and measure is carried entirely by cathode rays.

      A  tube of the form fig. 3 was constructed, with the terminals A
   and C about 40 mm. apart. This tube has a narrow side tube B, as
   in figure, the shortest distance between the terminals by this path
   being about 160 mm.
     £arti
                                    Tig. 4.
      As the tube is being exhausted the discharge at first passes by the
   shortest path from A to C, but when the dark space round the
   cathode C spreads out until it reaches the walls of the tube, a point
   is reached at which the positive column starts behind the disk A,
   and travels by the side tube B.
      The part between A and C which was formerly occupied by the
   positive column is now entirely free from glow, but there is still a
   stream of negative rays from C towards A. Of course, there is also
   a less intense stream of rays behind C, but still, if we measure the
   current carried by the rays from C to A, we have an inferior limit.
      The reason why the much longer path by the side tube B is the
   path of least resistance, seems to be, because by that path the posi
   tive column is enabled to approach closer to the negative electrode,
   the intensity of the cathode rays being less behind C than from C
   towards A. When the positive column is travelling by the side tube
   B, if we bring a magnet up to the tube between A and C, so as to
   deflect the cathode rays on to the side of the tube near C, the whole

discharge again takes the shortest path AC, so that a field of mag
netic force across the direction of discharge in this case diminishes
the resistance of the tube, by diminishing the length of it which is
occupied by the negative dark space and allowing the positive column
to lengthen out.
   A slight variation in the tube (fig. 3) enables us to measure the
current carried by the cathode rays in CA. The tube is made as in
fig. 4. C is the cathode, A and A> are both connected to earth, and
the anode of the coil is also to earth.
   At first the discharge passes between A and C, but when the proper
exhaustion is reached the positive column starts from A], and travels
round by the longer path.
    We can insert a galvanometer between A or A! and the earth con
nection, and measure the current through AC and AiC.
    The galvanometer used was a very sensitive one shunted with a
small resistance negligible in comparison with that of the discharge
tube.
    The results obtained were as follows : —
    Before the positive column changed from the large tube to the side-
tube B, no current could be detected in the latter. A very small
diminution of pressure causes the positive column to travel by AiC,
and now the current in AC was about 1/50 of that in AiC.
    The pressure was now gradually diminished and readings taken at
every step until very little glow was visible in AiC, while the phos
phorescence in AC was steadily increasing.
    The ratio of the current in AC to that in AiC meanwhile steadily
increased, until finally it was 1/4.
    These numbers show that even at a pressure at which there is
little phosphorescence a considerable fraction (more than 1/50) of
the whole discharge was carried away from the cathode by the nega
tive rays, while at lower pressures these rays carried a large portion
of the discharge.
    The fact that the negative rays travel in straight lines away from
the cathode, independently of the position of the anode, and there
 fore, in a discharge tube in which the anode is not in the line of the
rays, do not directly convey their charge to the anode, does not
 necessarily prove that the part of the discharge which they carry
 away from the cathode is small.
    In such a tube there will be an excess of negative electricity at the
 point where the cathode rays are stopped by the glass, and this
 makes its way to the anode by a current in the gas, which is a good
 conductor when the primary discharge is passing.

for the oscillations of a rotating mass of liquid, an equation for the
tidal oscillations of the ocean is obtained in a form similar to that
employed by Laplace. t From this equation it is deduced that if the

oscillations is expressible as a series of zonal harmonics in the

the C's and obtain an equation for the determination of the periods
of free oscillation of zonal type. This equation will in general be of
a transcendental character, and will be expressible by means of non-
terminating continued fractions. The convergence of the continued
fractions which occur is, however, very rapid so long as the depth of
the water is not materially less than that which occurs on the earth,
and this fact enables us to approximate to the roots numerically by a
process of trial and error with great facility. The type of oscillation
as indicated by the height of the surface-waves is then determined
by calculating the ratios of successive C's by means of the formula
(a). Numerical results are given in the paper for four different
values of h, corresponding to depths of about 7260, 14,520, 29,040,
and 58,080 feet.    For these depths, the longest periods of free oscil
lation of symmetrical type (corresponding to even values of the
suffixes n) are found to be —
18 hrs. 3 mins.,   15 hrs. 11 mina.,      12 hrs. 29 mins.,  9 hrs. 52 mins.,
while for the unsymmetrical types the longest periods are —
30 hrs. 29 mins.,   25 hrs. 28 mins.,       21 hrs. 0 mins., 16 hrs. 52 mins.
   3.  If we retain the 7's in the equations (a), these equations will
serve to determine the C's in terms of the 7's, and thus to evaluate
the height of the forced tides resulting from a given disturbing force.
The most important application is that in which all the 7's are zero
except 72, and where X is small in comparison with 10. The method
 of procedure is then similar to that adopted by Professor Darwin* for
 the discussion of the long-period tides, and the numerical results are
found on comparison to agree with his, but the analytical form in
which they appear is different. The series of zonal harmonics by
which the tide-heights are expressed always converge with greater
rapidity than the power-series of Professor Darwin, while we have
the additional advantage of being able to include in the analysis
the effect of the gravitational attraction of the water. Some further
 numerical results relatively to the forced tides in an ocean of variable
 depth are also given in the paper.

 when the period of the disturbing force is prolonged. This cir
cumstance, which at first sight appears to be at variance with the
general laws of oscillating systems, has been explained by Professor
Lambf as a consequence of the fact that the system is capable of
free oscillations of infinitely long period, or free steady motions.

ocean currents, and   it is therefore of interest to examine the nature
of the free steady motions which could exist on a rotating globe. Tt
is shown that so ldng as the depth is uniform the only steady motions
possible are those in which the particles of water move along paral
lels of latitude, while, if the depth be variable, the stream lines of
the possible steady motions coincide with the lines

where h denotes the depth and p the sine of the latitude.
    5. These currents differ materially from the actual currents of the
ocean, and the difference is probably to be explained from the fact
that the density of the water has been treated as uniform, whereas
the density of the ocean varies from point to point in consequence
of differences of temperature, salinity, &c. These variations of den
sity have been claimed by some authorities as the sole cause by which
ocean currents are maintained, but as free currents could exist, and
would almost certainly be excited by such causes as the winds, even
if there were no variations in the density, it is improbable that such
is the case, though there can be no doubt that the density-variations
play an important r61e in modifying the possible forms of the free
steady motions, and thus determining the course which the currents
pursue.

    6. Though these currents have been described as                   they
could not exist in nature without some disturbing force in con
sequence of the action of viscosity.       If, however, the coefficient of
viscosity of the water be sufficiently small, a very small amount of
disturbing force will be sufficient to excite and maintain them. As
an example of the manner in which they could be maintained by a small
disturbance, an attempt is made to estimate the effects of the unequal
distribution of rainfall and evaporation over the surface of the earth.
It is shewn that this cause will give rise to a slow current from the
poles towards the equator of quite insensible amount, and not changing
from time to time; but, in addition to this flow, there will be set up
currents along the free stream lines which, in the absence of friction,
would increase uniformly with the time. When the water is viscous,
the latter currents will, however, eventually attain a magnitude equal
to that which they would acquire in a period equal to the modulus of
decay of the type of motion set up, after which they will remain
 steady.    Such currents might attain a magnitude comparable with
the actual currents of the ocean if the modulus of decay of any of the
types of current motion be as long as twenty years, and as this value
for the modulus of decay is not improbable, it is concluded that such
 causes as the unequal distribution of rainfall are sufficient to give
 rise to currents quite comparable with those which exist on the
 earth.

     A   typical returning boomerang resembles in general outline a
symmetrical arc of a hyperbola, and is about 80 cm. in length
measured along the curve. At the centre, where the dimensions of
the cross section are greatest, the width is about 7 cm., and the thick
ness 1 cm.
     Of the two faces, one is distinctly more rounded than the other ;
in addition the arms are twisted through about 4°, in the same manner
as the blades of a right-handed screw propeller.
     Such an implement, if thrown with its plane vertical, will describe a
circular path of 40 or 50 metres in diameter, rising to a height of
from 7 to 12 metres, and falling to the ground with its plane of rota
tion horizontal at a point somewhere near the thrower's feet.
     The flight may be regarded as a case of steady motion, of which
 the circumstances gradually vary. In the more complicated, as well
as the simpler, paths, observation makes it clear that everything
depends on the changes in direction and inclination of the plane of
the boomerang, and that the character of these changes is always the
same ; if they can be explained theoretically, the peculiarities of the
motion may be accounted for.
     Since the effects of the different forces at work are conflicting, it
is necessary to adopt quantitative methods, even if the degree of
 accuracy attainable is not high ; accordingly ratios comparable with
a tenth are treated as small, and their squares neglected.
     If we regard the boomerang as a thin, slightly distorted lamina,
and integrate over it the forces indicated in S. P. Langley's paper on
 " Experiments in Aerodynamics,"* we can obtain equations of motion.
 From these, treating the motion as steady (to the first approxima
 tion), we may deduce the values of the angular velocities on which the
 direction of the axis of rotation depends.          Five cases are worked out
 numerically,    and   the various effects of the  "rounding"    and " twisting''
 agree in character with the experimental facts ; the discrepancies in
 actual magnitude are not larger than might, from the nature of the
  case, have been anticipated.
      The theoretical results may be further tested by applying them to
 determine the conditions favourable to the production of other
  flights in which, after the first circle, a loop is described, either in

      In a note read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society (May
   13, 1895)   I  stated, as the result of some preliminary experiments,
v. that when air, originally saturated with aqueous vapour, undergoes
   sudden expansion exceeding a certain critical amount, condensation
   takes place in the form of drops throughout the moist air, even in
   the absence of all foreign nuclei.
      The present paper contains an account of the measurements which
   were afterwards made of this critical expansion in air and other
   gases, as well as of further phenomena          which have since been
   observed in connection with the condensation of aqueous vapour from
   the supersaturated state.
      Two diffeient forms of expansion apparatus have been used. Both
   were designed to enable a given sample of the saturated gas to be
   suddenly expanded as often as might be desired without any risk of
   foreign nuclei entering.      All such nuclei originally present were
   removed by repeatedly forming a cloud by expansion and allowing it
   to settle, till expansions of moderate amount ceased to cause any
   visible condensation. In both forms of apparatus a definite expansion
   of any desired amount could be produced. They were designed to
   give an exceedingly rapid expansion, the rate at which the volume
   was increasing being greatest, too, just before the expansion was
   completed, when the temperature was lowest and the influx of heat
   from the walls most rapid ; so that, as indeed appears from the con
   stancy of the results obtained, the theoretical lowering of temperature
   must have been very nearly reached.
      The two machines, in spite of the fact that the volume of the air in
   the first was twenty times as great as that contained in the second,
   gave identical results.     The larger machine was only used in the
   experiments   on  air.

            in the presence   of dust-free Air and other Gases.      241
    If air, initially saturated and free from all foreign nuclei, be sud
 denly allowed to expand, a rain-like condensation results if the ratio
 of the final to the initial volume, vtjvit exceeds 1252; no condensa
 tion taking place except on the walls of the vessel with smaller
 expansions.
    When vi/vi exceeds' 1'252 the condensation continues to be rain
 like, showing over quite a wide range no visible increase in the
 number of the drops with increasing expansion, till a second quite
 definite limit is reached when v^|i^ lies between 1'37 and 1'38. With
 expansions greater than this the condensation is cloud-like, the num
  ber of the drops which are formed increasing at an enormously rapid
 rate with increasing expansion. If vijv> be made successively greater
 and greater, a very definite series of colour phenomena is observed as
this ratio is increased from 1'38 to 144, indicating a very rapid
diminution in the size, and corresponding increase in the number of
the cloud particles with increasing supersaturation. Only the smaller
apparatus was used in the experiments on the cloud-like condensa
tion, the time taken for the expansion to be completed being much
shorter than in the other.
    Experiments were made upon the condensation phenomena in the
presence of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine and carbonic acid.
    Of these, all except hydrogen were alike in showing the two forms
of condensation, each requiring a definite degree of supersaturation
to produce it.
    Chlorine is too far removed from the condition of a perfect gas to
enable the lowering of temperature and resulting supersaturation to
be calculated.       This can be done, however, in the case of the other
gases.
    By  the supersaturation is here meant the ratio of the actual density
of the vapour when the expansion has just been completed, and the
minimum temperature has therefore been reached, to the density of
the vapour in equilibrium over a flat surface of water at that
temperature.
    We may summarise the results obtained with the various gases,
including air, as follows : —
    In order that rain-like condensation may result in the presence of
any of these gases, except hydrogen, the expansion must be sufficient
to cause the supersaturation to exceed a certain value, amounting,
when the final temperature is — 6° C., to between 42 and 4'4, and
diminishing with rising temperature.
    In order that cloud-like condensation may take place in the pre
sence of any of these gases, including hydrogen, the expansion must
be sufficient to cause the supersaturation to exceed a certain value,
amounting, when the final temperature is about — 16° C., to 7-9.
    When the supersaturation reached lies between these limits rain

242       Condensation  of Vapour in tlie presence of dust-free Air, §c.
like condensation results in all the gases, except hydrogen, in which
 scarcely any trace of condensation is seen when the supersaturation
 is even slightly below 7-9.
     A statement of the effect of the Rontgen rays upon condensation
in the presence of air was given in a note read before the Royal
 Society, on March 3, 1896. The rays have the offect of greatly
increasing the number of the drops, the minimum expansion required
to cause condensation being unaltered.
     Experiments have been made upon the effect of these rays when
 hydrogen is substituted for air. Their effect on the moist hydrogen
 is to introduce nuclei, which only require the supersaturation to
 reach the same limit as is required for rain-like condensation in air
 and the other gases, in order that condensation may take place upon
 them.      In all these experiments the X-rays had to pass through
 glass to reach the gas, and must have been thereby very much
 reduced in intensity, yet their effect in the case of hydrogen was
  quite noticeable when the bulb producing them was 120 cm. from the
  expansion apparatus.'
     The nuclei which bring about the rain-like condensation are equiva
 lent, in their power of helping condensation, to water drops of
 8'6 X 10-s cm. in radius, that is, water drops of this size would just
  be able to grow in vapour supersaturated to the extent actually
 required to bring about condensation. This number is calculated on
  the assumption that Boyle's law holds for the supersaturated vapour,
  and that the surface tension retains its ordinary value even in such
  small drops. It must, therefore, only be considered as a rough
  approximation.
'
     On the same assumptions, the nuclei which are able to act as centres
  of condensation when the supersaturation is sufficient to cause the
  cloud-like condensation, are equivalent to drops of 6-4 x 10-s cm., or-
  less, in radius.  They are present, as wo have seen, in all the gases
  tried, when saturated with aqueous vapour, and are exceedingly
  numerous. It is probable, therefore, that they are actually small
  water particles, such as one would expect to come into existence
  momentarily through encounters of the molecules.
     The nuclei which bring about the rain-like condensation are always
  fevr in number, and they appear to be entirely absent in hydrogen ;
  their number, therefore, depends on the nature of the gas. They are
  probably, therefore, of a different nature from those which come
  into play when the supersaturation is great enough to cause the
  cloud-like condensation.

           striking instances of " long conduction

transection over the bulbospinal axis the funiculus gracilis be excited,
e.g., at the calamus scriptorius, the excitation evokes movement .(con
traction, relaxation) in the idiolateral hind limb.      If instead of /.
gracilis the funiculus cuneatus be excited the movement (contraction,
relaxation) is in the idiolateral forelimb.       The movement in the
hind limb is in the monkey usually adduction and flexion of hallux,
in the cat flexion of knee, hip, or ankle. In the monkey the forelimb
movement is usually flexion and adduction of pollex, often with exten
sion of the other digits ; in the cat, more usually flexion of elbow
with protraction of the shoulder. The movements which occur are,
however, various, and I will here only add that those from the

abdominal muscles, those from         cuneatus the diaphragm

   The reaction is at once annulled on severance of the dorsal columns
at any one of the above levels, although at the same time the ventro
lateral columns and the grey matter remain intact.
   The reaction from the left /. gracilis is annulled by severance of
the left dorsal column, that of the right by the severance of the
right.
  The    reaction can almost always be obtained — although incom
pletely — by mechanical excitation, e.g., by compression with ivory
forceps, often even by a mere touching with the forceps.
   That the "conduction involved in the reaction does not implicate
the fibres of the pyramidal tract— which at first instance sug
gest themselves as a source of fallacy — seems clear in light of the
above.    That supposition is also, and I think finally, excluded by
the following observation.         I
                                  have found the " long intra-spinal
reflexes," like sub-cerebral rigidity (" decerebrate tonus," *) locally
abolished, or greatly depressed by total severance of the sensory
spinal roots belonging to their own region of terminal discharge.
Thus, to take an instance given in my former paper, if the right
forepaw be stimulated the paths of "short spinal conduction"*
from it lead to discharge of its own flexors of elbow, extensors of

conduction" from it lead to discharge of the muscles of the idiolateral
hind limb. To evoke from the forepaw movement of the contra
lateral hind limb is relatively difficult ; this contralateral movement
is less commonly and less easily obtained, and when obtained lesa
vigorous, less prolonged, and usually commences later than the
idiolateral.    But     in the instance taken, the series of afferent

idiolateral limb it is extremely difficult, often impossible, to then
obtain by this facile long spinal path any discharge at all on the
side of the transected afferent roots, although that side is usually
peculiarly accessible.     T find that similarly severance       of the dorsal
 (afferent)  roots  in  their  extraspinal   course   greatly impairs the re
 action from the /. graciles and /. cuneati.       Thus, if when flexion of
 right knee or right hallux is being regularly evoked by excitation of
/. gracilis at the top of the cord, the extraspinal dorsal (-afferent) roots
 of the right pelvic limb be severed, the reaction, until then regularly
 obtained, disappears or almost disappears. The section of right hand
 roots annuls the right hand reaction, but not the left hand, and con
 versely. On the other hand, the flexion of knee, or of hallux, or of
 elbow obtained by excitation of the Bolandic cortex or of the lateral
 column (pyramidal tract fibres)                 is,
                                           as has been shown in        previous         a

law of the "polarisation               dynamique       des  nevrons" put forward by
 Ramon-y-Cajal* and V. Gehuchten.f                      It offers, however, no contra
 diction to what JamesJ has termed " the law of forward direction ;"
 it only emphasises that that law predicates the existence of at least
 two links in its conduction-gear.
     The reaction is therefore in my view an extreme illustration of
 double (antidrome, doppelsinm'ge) nervous conduction.                           After du
 Bois' fundamental observation with frog's sciatic and the electrical
 sign, it has been Kiihne's sartorius experiment^ and Babuchin's||
 reversed discharge in the electric organ nerve-fibre, which have laid
 a satisfactory foundation for double conduction in peripheral nerves.
 But between those experiments and these, the subject of this note,
 there are, it is true, differences. In the latter, («) propagation occurs
 over relatively huge distances and (/3) the reaction occurs within
 the field of the central nervous system.                  These differences need not,
however, negative the relationship of the phenomena.                          They render
it the more       instructive.
    It is obvious that there must be opportunity for detection of anti
drome conduction in parts of the central nervous system besides the
dorsal spinal columns. Thus, on exciting, especially with electric
currents, the mammalian metencephalon (vermis cerebelli) and isthmus
rhombencephali,% subsequent to ablation of the parts above,                         I have
seen movements produced in the limbs and trunk, and also inhibitions
occur. Thus, in instance of the latter, inhibition of the tonic extensor
spasm of the fore and hind limbs combined with contraction of the
flexors of knee and elbow, such as is seen under local spinal reflex
action.**        It will have to be determined whether in such cases as
the former we have not before us instances of antidrome conduction
along ascending paths. The antidrome phenomenon, while of valuable
assistance when recognised, may, if uurecognised, give rise to very
misleading inferences. Its methodic use should place in our hands a
fresh instrument of value for neurological research.

   In a former     number* of these ' Proceedings'      I drew attention to the
occurrence of reflex reactions evoked by mechanical and electrical
excitation of individual eye-muscles and of their nerve-trunks.                   I
was later somewhat surprised when, after the sensory nature of the
structures originally termed muscle-spindles (Kuhne) had been
proved,t I was unable to find in the eye-muscles any examples of
these structures.     J I     had expected to find in those muscles, on
account of the great delicacy of their control and co-ordination, and
in view of the well-known richness of their innervation, a field pecu
liarly favourable for the examination and study of " spindles." It
appeared to me possible, however, that spindles if of a very simple
type, e.g., containing a single muscle fibre not enveloped in a distinct
capsule, but with simply an unthickened perimysial sheath and with
out any circumfusal lymph space, in short if reduced to a far simpler
type than     I  have ever met actually existent, might, although present,
yet escape recognition.            I turned, therefore, to the production of
degeneration      for  further    information.
   I   had noted that the intrafusal muscle-fibres, of the " red "
variety as they are, undergo when the nerve-trunk of a muscle has
been severed, a much slower course of alteration than do extra-fusal
muscle fibres,§ i.e., I found no pronounced degeneration for even two
years following section.            I therefore cut through n. ocwlomotorius at
its origin, and examined the resultant degenerations in the eye-
muscles which it innervates and in their individual nerve-trunks.
The degenerative process was allowed scope for various periods.
This method of test failed, however, to give me distinct results
because (1) the muscle-fibres of the eye-muscles (in monkey) exhibit
normally a certain variable amount of fatty granulation, simulating
degenerative change ; and because (2) the resultant chaDges in the
muscle-fibres, although the fatty granulation distinctly increased,
did not even after a period of sixty days show the clearly distinctive
characters     I had hoped.

muscular, the Wallerian degeneration did clearly demonstrate a
result of importance.        With the exception of a few minute fibres, of
variable number, derived perhaps from the ciliary ganglion, all myeli
nate nerve-fibres in all these eye-muscles were degenerated.                There
fore these eye-muscles       derive  the   vast   majority   of  their  myelinate
nerve-fibres from n. oculomotorius.         The sensory innervation of these
muscles does not therefore seem derivable from the Vth cranial pair.
 In accord with this      I  found (a) that severance of both trigemini
caused no obvious impairment of the movement of the eye-balls, (/3)
 that the combined severance of both nn. trigemini, and of both optic
 nerves even after section of the encephalic bulb did not severely
 depress the tonus of the eye-muscles. Now we know that section of
 the sensory spinal roots belonging to muscles does very severely
 depress the tonus of them.
                           I
     At the same time was struck with the long distance to which
 many of the nerve-fibres in these muscles travel forward toward the
 .ocular tendons of the muscles.       I was the more impressed with this
 fact because direct examination proved that the region of the dis
  tribution of motor end-plates in these muscles is almost confined to
  the middle portion of the fleshy mass of the muscle.                Further in
  vestigation of the course and destination of the nerve-fibres at the
  tendon end of the muscle revealed them (both in cat and monkey)
  undergoing terminal subdivision, and in very numerous instances
  passing beyond into the bundles of the tendon itself. The termina
  tions of many of these nerve-fibres lie within the tendons ; many
  recurve again toward the muscular fibres, and end just at junction of
  muscle-fibre with tendon bundle. The nerve-fibres in so terminating
  frequently become thick — as I have described in the case of muscle-
  spindles — with shortened internodes.
      The terminal arborisation which the nerve-fibres finally make is as
   a rule small as compared with the end-arborisation of ordinary
                               "                   "
   Kuhne-Ruffini "spindles or the Golgi tendon-organs," but closely
   resembles in numerous instances the form of arborisation of the
   latter.
      In   my former communication        I wrote* — " The question therefore
   arises whether the above cranial nerves (Illrd and IVth) are not in
   reality sensori- motor."    In view of the additional observations now
   recorded   I think it must be conceded that nervus oculomotorius is
              not a merely motor nerve, but although purely
                                                                       " muscular"
   perhaps
   may be sensori-motor.
      My observations have included also the IVth cranial pair, and
   with like result.   Investigation of the Vlth cranial pair is also in
   progress.

possession by it of sensorial end-organs, and of afferent nerve-fibres.
This point is not without importance, because examination of various
muscles has led me to the conclusion that the " spindle-organs " are
absent from the following muscles : — From all the orbital eye-muscles,
from the intrinsic muscles of the larynx (though Pacinian corpuscles
occur in these as in various other muscles), from the intrinsic muscles
 of the tongue, and from the diaphragm.             It is notable that all these
muscles belong to that set which are innervated by nerve-fibres of
rather smaller calibre (Gaskell) than those supplying the skeletal
 muscles generally, that is to say, are innervated by the non-gang-
lionated splanchnic efferent nerves of Gaskell.

    On the Breaking-up of Fat in the Alimentary Canal under

       fessor of Pathological            Chemistry, University           College,

  (From the Department of Pathological Chemistry,    University College, London.)
    In  a previous paper* I discussed the simple absorption of milk fat
from    the alimentary canal of dogs, and compared the results with a
series of dogs in which the pancreas had been previously removed.
 Fasting dogs fed on milk absorbed no less than 21 to 46 per cent. of
the total fat given in seven hours, while in those where the pancreas
had been entirely removed some two days previously, there was,
during that space of time, no evidence of any absorption whatever
from the alimentary canal.
    The fact that no marked absorption of fat occurred in dogs after
the extirpation of the pancreas seems to confirm the old view that
the pancreatic secretion was necessary for absorption.
    This alleged action of pancreatic juice in preparing fat for its
absorption from the alimentary canal, is usually supposed to be due
to the secretion containing, firstly, a fat-splitting ferment, which, by
breaking up part of the neutral fat into free fat acids and glycerine,
leads to the first stage of emuisification ; and, secondly, alkaline
sodium carbonate, which combines with some of the freed fat acids
to form a soap, thus rendering the emuisification of the fat a simple
matter — as can easily be demonstrated in a test-tube — and at once
facilitates its absorption through the intestinal walls.

250                Dr. V. Harley.     On the Breaking-up
    The manner in which altered or emulsified fat may traverse the
intestinal or mucous membrane is not discussed in the present paper,
but only the manner and degree of breaking up of ingested milk fat,
and the part played in such a process by the pancreas.         My former
paper showed that there was a great decrease in the absorption of
fat when the pancreas was removed, and it is my present purpose to
show how much of this is due to the absence of either the fat-
splitting ferment, or of the alkaline sodium carbonate of the
pancreatic secretion.
     It is not necessary here to again draw attention to the extracts from
 the literature of this complicated subject, which I quoted in the
previous paper, and which showed that there was reason to believe that
 neutral fat not only could split up fat acids and glycerine in the
absence of pancreatic secretion, but even form soaps.         The present
research has for its object the precise determination of this point.
    The results obtained may therefore be divided into a normal and a
 pathological, i.e., according as to whether the pancreatic secretion is
 present or absent.     Thus : —
     1. The normal splitting up of fat in the various parts of the
alimentary canal in dogs on a milk diet.
     2. The effect of removal of the pancreas on the splitting up of fat
in dogs on a milk diet.
     Before discussing the results, it will be as well to give briefly the
 method employed.
                           Method of Investigation.
      1. Operative  Procedure. — The animals were in all cases treated in
 practically the same manner. The
                                         " normal "
                                                     dogs were allowed to
  fast for a period of four days, during which time the rectum was
  washed out with a copious warm water enema, glycerine being after
  wards given so as to aid the expulsion of the water. In the cases
  where the influence of the pancreas on the breaking up of fat was to
  be investigated after two days' fast, the pancreas was entirely removed
  under ether, and then the animals allowed to fast another two days,
  during which time the bowels were again washed out.
      A given quantity of milk was administered in the morning, and
  seven hours later the dogs were killed by means of chloroform.
   The abdomen was quickly opened, and ligatures applied to the
   oesophagus, the pylorus, just above the caecum, and as low down as
   possible round the rectum. The contents of each part of the alimen
   tary canal thua isolated were theu carefully collected and separately
   analysed.
       The milk given in each case was concentrated to a convenient
   quantity by boiling ; a specimen of this was analysed, so that the

                    of Fat in  the Alimentary Canal.                  251
absolute composition of the fats present in the milk at the time of
administration was accurately known, and could be compared with
that in the various parts of the alimentary canal.
   2. The Chemical    Analysis. — The substances collected from each
separate part were dried at 90° C., and then placed in a Soxhlet's
apparatus and extracted with ether until the ether was unable to
extract any more soluble matter. The ether extract was then dried
and re-dissolved in absolute ether of sp. gr. O720, and filtered
through a fat-free filter paper into a weighed vessel, in which it was
dried and afterwards weighed.
   The ether residue thus obtained was then treated with a watery
solution of sodium carbonate, which converted the free fat acids into
soaps, and after again drying, the neutral fat, cholesterin, &c., was
again extracted with ether and weighed. The difference between
this and the first weighing was taken as equal to the quantity of free
fat acids present.
   In some few cases quantitative estimation of the cholesterin was
made by saponifying the neutral fat extract with alcoholic sodium
hydrate, evaporating to dryness, and then extracting with ether.
This being repeated until saponification with alcoholic sodium hydrate
no longer removed any neutral fat, and it was found that the ether
extract consisted of cholesterin alone.
   The original substance which had been extracted with ether was
treated with dilute hydrochloric acid so as to liberate any fat acids
from the soaps that might be there present.         It was then dried at
-90° C, and when completely dry was again extracted with ether.
The quantity of ether extract thus obtained represented the fat acids
present in the form of soaps.
   The total fat was, therefore, obtained by adding the quantity of fat
ttcids obtained from the soaps to the former ether extract.
   To facilitate the comparison of the results in the experiments they
are given in tabular form, and the analysis of the diet in each part of
the alimentary canal is divided into groups, i.e., neutral fat, ?at acids,
and fat acids combined as soaps.
   The neutral fat includes the cholesterin, which was not in the
majority of cases separately analysed, as the quantitative analysis of
.cholesterin is very much more difficult in practice than it is in theory,
since the entire saponification of the neutral fats, so as to separate
them thoroughly from cholesterin, is a tedious matter and requires
frequent repetition if one desires to get really accurate results. In
those few cases -in which the analysis of cholesterin was carried out,
the quantity found was so extremely small that it in no way inter
fered with the general results obtained if the entire extract was
 regarded as neutral fat.

    In Table    I  it is  seen that the total quantity of fat given is dimi
nished in      the stomach to almost a third during the seven hours of
digestion, so that of the 9-471 grams of fat that had been given in
the milk only 3-508 grams were found, the rest having passed
through the pylorus.              The composition of this fat is, however,
entirely changed, for while the milk fat contained 99'85 per cent, as
neutral fat, that in the stomach was only 76-82 per cent.
   We see, further, that the neutral fats have disappeared from the
stomach more rapidly than the others as, although 9-456 grams of
neutral fat were given, only 2'691 grams remained.
   The formation of free fat acids is very marked, for whereas the
milk only contained 0'12 per cent, the stomach contained as much as
21-92 per cent. This speaks strongly in favour of Ogata and Marcet's
view that neutral fat can be broken up into free fat acids in the
stomach, unless one is to believe that the fat acids had been retained
in the stomach, and that the increased percentage was obtained by
some condition allowing the passage of the neutral fats and not the
fat acids from the stomach.               But it may further be seen that this
would not account for the increase in the free fat acids, as the total
quantity of fat acids given was only 0-012 while the stomach con
tained no less than 0'768.            It may, therefore, be regarded as con
clusively established that the excess of fat acids was formed from
the neutral fat of the milk in the stomach itself.
   More remarkable is the proportion of fat acids combined as soaps.
 For the milk itself contained only 003 per cent, of fat acids in the
form of soap, while the stomach contained 1'26 per cent.                             That
there had been an absolute formation of soap and not any increase

                     of Fat in the Alimentary Canal.                  253
 by the mere passage of the neutral fat from the stomach is proved
 by the fact that the total quantity of such soaps given was onlyO003,
 while the stomach at the end of seven hours contained 0'044 gram.
   It is thus shown beyond question that the stomach is not only
capable of breaking up neutral fat into free fat acids and glycerine,
but that some of these free fat acids are able to find in the gastric
secretion an alkaline substance with which they can form soaps even
in the acid stomach contents.
   Turning next to the contents of the small intestine, we find that
the total fat is very small in quantity, there only being 0845 gram,
of which 0'214 gram remain as neutral fat, so that only 25-33 per
cent, of the total fat remains in the small intestine as neutral fat.
Fat acids, on the other hand, are very greatly increased, 7101 per
cent, of the total fat being present as fat acids. The absolute quantity
of fat acids present in the small intestine is only 0600 gram ; that
is to say, really less than was present in the stomach.     The percent
age proportion of the soaps is also increased over that of the stomach,
being 3'66 per cent., although the total quantity present is somewhat
less than what was present in the stomach, being only 0031 gram.
   In the large intestine we find that the total fat is only slightly less
than that present in the small intestine, being 0'791 gram. This is
composed of 0296 gram of neutral fat, that is to say, somewhat
more than was present in the small intestine, and making the per
centage of neutral fat present in the large intestine as much as
37-42.    The free fat acids are only 0'445 gram, and the percentage
is also decreased to only 56'26 per cent. ; that is to say, the per
centage of fat acids present in the large intestine is greater thai
that present in the stomach, but not so large as that present in the
small intestine.
   The soaps, on the other hand, are increased, being 0-050 gram,
and constitute a percentage of 6'32 ; so that the amount of soap
present in the large intestine is almost double that present in the
small intestine and five times that in the stomach.
   In this the second normal animal (Table II) as much as 43-13 per
cent, of the total fat given had left the stomach during the seven
hours' digestion, so that the stomach only contained 12'970 grams of
the 22'806 grams of fat given in the milk.
   On examining the composition of the total fat present in the
stomach we find that it has undergone a marked change, since, of
the milk fat given, no less than 96-69 percent, was present as neutral
fat, while the stomach contained 81'12 per cent., the total neutral
fat having diminished from the 22'05 grams given in the milk to only
10'52 grams. Hence 15'57 per cent, of the neutral fat given had
been changed into some other form during its Beven hours' sojourn in
the stomach.

       As regards the free fat acids, the milk given contained 0'744
   gram, i.e., 3'25 per cent, of the total ether extract was obtained as
   fat acid, which is far more than nsual, and is probably in part due to
   the fact that the milk stood in the laboratory for some time previously
   to its being boiled for the experiment.
      The stomach contained 2'436 grams of fat acids, i.e., 18-78 per
   cent, of the total fat was present in the stomach as free fat acids.
   The percentage of the neutral fat had diminished, while the percen
   tage of the fat acids had increased.           The fat acids, combined as soaps
   in the stomach, remained exactly the same as the quantity originally
   given, but since the percentage had increased from 0'06 to O'lO, it is
   not at all likely that that alone of the components of the total fat
   had wholly remained in the stomach, so that we may consider that
   this case is no exception, and that the stomach formed not only fat
   acids but also soap.
      In the small intestine only 0-977 gram of fat was found, and since
   no less than 9'836 grams had passed through the pylorus during the
   period of digestion, either 8'859 grams had passed on into the large
   intestine or had been absorbed.              The total fat contained only 0-349
   gram as neutral fat, so that the percentage had fallen to 35'85 per
   cent, (the milk given contained 96'69 per cent.).               The free fat acids
   amounted to O608 gram, that is 62-19 per cent, of the total fat.
      As originally the milk only contained 3'25 per cent, of fat acids,
   wc can conclude that no less than 5894 per cent, of the neutral
   fat had been converted into fat acids in its passage as far as the
   ceecum.     The fat acids present as soaps had increased to 0'02 gram,
   which raises the percentage of fat acids present as soaps to no less
   than 2-06, an amount which closely resembles that present in the
   foregoing case.
      In the large intestine we unfortunately cannot follow the changes
   in this experiment, as the neutral fat and free fat acids and soaps

were lost in the process of separation.            We, however, see that only
0'402 gram of the total ether extract was left in the large intestine,
so that 8'457 grams of the fat had really been absorbed during the
seven hours' digestion ; that is to say, as much as 85'98 per cent,
of the total quantity of -fat that had traversed the pylorus.

   In Table     III  the total fat given was 12-027 grams, and after seven
hours' digestion 8116 grams remained in the stomach. The stomach
had consequently discharged 3'911 grams of the fat into the intes
tines (i.e., 32'52 per cent.).
   The fat that remained in the stomach during the seven hours had
undergone similar changes to those already described in the former
two experiments. The neutral fat had decreased from H'533 grams
in the milk given to 6'061 grams. Thus, while the milk fat contained
95'89 per cent, as neutral fat, the stomach only contained 74-67 per
cent., so that at least 21 '22 per cent, of the neutral fat given had been
split up in the stomach into free fat acids or traversed the
pylorus.
   The free fat acids on the other hand had increased very markedly ;
for whereas the milk contained but 0'455 gram the stomach con
tained 2-012 grams, the percentage composition having thus changed
from 3-78 to 2481.
   The soap had also increased in quantity in the stomach from
0-039 gram, in the milk given, to 0-043 gram, which altered the
percentage composition from 0'33 to 0-52 per cent.
   Thus, in all three experiments we have confirmation of the fact
that neutral fat is split up into free fat acids while in the stomach
itself, and that some of these free fat acids formed soaps.
   With regard to the small intestines we find only 0'623 gram of
ether extract was present, while we know that 3'91 grams had

256                Dr. V. Harley.      On the Breaking-up
passed through the pylorus during this time.          Of the total fat only
0'080 gram was found as neutral fat, so that its percentage            pro
portion amounted to only 12-84 per cent., no less than 61'83 per
cent, of the neutral fat having been broken up since it traversed
tho pylorus.
    The free fat acids increased to 0'522 gram, therefore the percen
tage of the total fat present as fat acids was 83-46.        As originally
only   3- 78 per cent, of the total fat was  in the form of free fat acids,
therefore 79'68 per cent, of the neutral fat has been broken up into
free fat acids in its passage along the stomach and small intestine,
and as the stomach contained 24'81 per cent., therefore 55'87 per
cent, of the free fat acids had been formed in the small intestine.
    The quantity of fat acids present as soap in the small intestine
was only 0'021 gram, but the total quantity of fat being so small the
percentage    was 3 '70.
    It  would thus appear as if 2-37 per cent, of the ether extract
had been converted into soap in its passage from the mouth to the
caecum, and since 0'19 per cent, was found in the stomach, 2-18 per
cent, had been formed in the small intestine.
    The large intestine contained 0741 gram of total fat, of which
0'229 gram remained in the form of neutral fat, and the percentage
of the neutral fat was 30-9l, i.e., somewhat higher than that found
in the small intestine, although less than half the percentage in the
stomach. The free fat acids left in the large intestine were 0'452 gram,
i.e., 61-03 per cent, of the total ether extract present, the quantity is
therefore less than is present in the small intestine, but higher than
that in the stomach.
    The fat acids combined as soap in the large intestine were
O059 gram, so that the percentage was 8-06 of the total fat.
    With regard to the absorption of fat, in this case we see that
where 12'027 grams were given only 9-479 were regained after seven
hours' digestion, so that at least 2'548 grams had been absorbed, i.e.,
21 per cent, of the total given during the seven hours' digestion.
However, as no fat is probably absorbed from the stomach, we ought
only to calculate the percentage absorption from the 3-911 grams
which had passed into the small intestine, i.e., 65- 16 per cent, of this
had been absorbed.
The Splitting up of Fat in various parts of the Alimentary Canal         in
     Dogs on a Milk Diet and in which the Pancreas had been removed.
    Having shown the manner in which fat is broken down in the
intestines of dogs under normal circumstances, we can now consider
the changes that occur in the fats when milk is given to dogs in
which the pancreas has been previously removed.

                        of Fat in   the Alimentary Canal.                      257
   In the following experiments, as has been already said, the
pancreas was removed on the second day of fasting, and the animals
allowed to fast still further two days after the operation, the rectam
being washed out with copious warm water enemas, as by this means
it was hoped to rid the intestines of any residue of pancreatic
secretion which might otherwise be present, and at the same time
that the washing out would diminish the bacteria of the large
intestine to a considerable extent.
    In the four following dogs in no case was there, by analysis, any
evident absorption of fat from the intestines during the space of four
to seven hours. At the same time, the fact that the quantity of fat
found equalled or surpassed the quantity of fat given at the end of
this time, is no definite proof that no absorption of fat took place
from the large intestine. In all probability there was some absorp
tion, as the lymphatics shone out as white lines and had not the
appearance of those normally present in fasting animals, though
they were not so prominent or filled as was the case in normal dogs
 during the same period of digestion. The remarkable fact that the
quantity of fat was equal to, or in excess of, that given will appear to
be explained by the character of the intestinal excretion, or so-called
secretion, which has now been practically demonstrated to be always
 present by Hermann, Ehrenthal, Berenstein, and Fr. Voit, which is
in all probability a substance rich in fat and very much more profuse
than we are ordinarily led to believe.

   In   Table   IV   the total quantity of fat given was 7-G02 grams, and
alter the period of four hours, no less than 7'406 grams still
remained in the stomach, so that during four hours only 0'196 gram
bad entered the intestines, or but 2'58 per cent, of the quantity

258                  Dr. V. Harley.       On the Breaking-up
given had passed through the pylorus.            Further, since the small and
large intestines contained no less than l-902 grams, while only
0'196 gram of this had entered from the pylorus, at least l-704 grams
of this fat must be regarded as derived directly from the intestinal
secretion and not from the fat administered in the food.              Of course,
in this case, the fat might be partly derived from the bile, as,
although the pancreas had been entirely removed, the bile-ducts had
been in no way interfered with.          The fact that the dog had not only
fasted for four days but that it had had its bowels washed out daily,
would leave little doubt that this fat could not be residues of fat
 given five days previously.
    In investigating the various changes that the fat underwent during
 its sojourn in the stomach, only 4513 grams were found as neutral
 fat ; that is to say, 60'94 per cent, of the total fat still remained as neutral
 fat.    The milk contained, on the other hand, 96-68 per cent, as
 neutral fat, so that no less than 25-74 of the fat given had been split
 up during its four hours' sojourn in the stomach into free fat acids
 and glycerine.        The fat acids were increased to 2'727 grams, and
 this was no doubt due to the splitting-up of the neutral fat in the
 stomach, since only 0248 gram fat acids were given in the diet.
 The percentage of fat acids present in the stomach being 36'82, the
 quantity found in the viscus was ten times the amount present in the
 milk given.
     As regards the soap, it was increased to 0'166 gram, so that the
 percentage composition of the fat acids combined as soaps was 2'24
 as compared to the 006 per cent, of fat acids (combined as soaps)
 observed in the milk.
     From these facts       it is plain that   even after the removal of the
 pancreas     the stomach, as    in normal dogs, is capable of converting a
 considerable quantity of the neutral fat into fatty acids, and              still
 further forming soups.
     The small intestine contained 1'456 grams of fat, and, as has
  already been said, most of this was not derived from the milk given
  but partly from the excretion of the intestines ; however, it will be
  as well to examine its chemical composition in the same way as we
  have done in the normal dogs.
     Of this fat, 0'820 gram was found to be neutral fat, so that the
  percentage of neutral fat was 31'17.          The free fat acids were 0'452
  gram, the total quantity being increased to 56'55 per cent., and the
  soap had increased tc 12'48 per cent., the total quantity really being
  0'184 gram.
     We see that the quantity of fat acids had very much increased in
  the small intestine over that found in the stomach, even although no

0-444 gram, and of this 0-159 gram only remained as neutral fat.
The free fatty acids were only 0'271 gram, the percentage being no
less than 61-04, showing that the percentage of fat acids was greater
in the large intestine than either in the small intestine or in the
stomach.
    The soaps had fallen to only 0'014 gram, or 3'15 per cent., so that
they were really smaller than the quantity in the large intestine, but
larger than that in the stomach.

     In Table V      the animal was allowed to digest for six hours after
 the feeding. In this case the total fat given was 8'496 grams, while
 after six hours' digestion the stomach still contained 7-62-t grams ;
 hence only 0872 gram of the fat had passed through the pylorus
 into the intestines in this space of time.
     In the small and large intestines 1 '073 grams were collected, so
 that 0-201 of this must have been due to the excretion from the
 intestinal wall or derived from the bile.
     The stomach contained only 4'964 grams of its fat as neutral fat,
  and whereas the milk given contained 83-98 per cent. of its fat as
  neutral fat, the stomach only contained 65'11 per cent. This was
  due to the increase of free fat acids for the most part, but also to
  some extent to the formation of soaps.              The free fat acids present in
  the stomach were 2-573 grams, while the original milk only contained
  in all 1-352 grams, therefore 33'75 per cent, of the total fat was
  present in the stomach as free fat acids.
     The soaps also had increased in quantity.               The stomach contained
  0*087 gram, while the milk given only contained 0008, the per
  centage of fat acids present as soaps being thus raised to 1'14.
     It is clearly brought out in this experiment that there was a very

260                 Dr. V. Harley.           On the Breaking-up
great delay in the quantity of fat leaving the stomach during the six
hours, as compared with what was observed in the normal dogs.
   In the small intestine the total fat present was only 0-822 gram.
This is somewhat less than what we know has already passed through
the pylorus, for it was seen that 0'872 gram of fat had left the
stomach during the six hours.             The neutral fat in the intestine was
only 0-312 gram, so that        the   quantity had diminished to only 37'95
per cent., a little more than half of that present in the stomach.
   The quantity of free fat acids was 0'452 gram, the percentage
having increased to 54'99, almost double what was present in the
stomach. The fat acids present as soaps were 0-058 gram, bringing
the percentage composition of the soap to 7'06.
   The large intestine contained 0'251 gram of fat ; of this, a very
great part must be attributed to the intestinal excretion, and was
certainly not residue of the fat given. The neutral fat is only 0-082
gram, that is to say, 32-68 per cent, of the total fat only remains as
neutral fat when it has reached as far as the large intestine.
   The free fat acids amounted to 0'113 gram, so that the percentage
proportion was 45'01, this being less than that present in the small
intestine.
   The soap present was 0'056 gram, the total quantity being almost
the same as that present in the small intet-tine, but as the quantity of
total fat is very much smaller, the relative amount of fat acids com
bined as soaps reaches in the large bowel a very much higher point
than in any other part of the alimentary canal, being 22'31.
   In the next two dogs in which the pancreas was removed the period
of digestion allowed was seven hours in each case.

   In  the above Table      VI,  of 7191 grams of fat given no less than
 6554 still remained in the stomach,                 so that only 0637 gram had

 traversed the pylorus.           The small and largo intestines together con
 tained no less than 1'721 grams of fat, and therefore 1-084 grams
 of the fat had been excreted from the intestines or liver during the
 period of seven hours. This appears an enormous quantity when we
 compare it with the small amount in the case of Table V, in which
 only 0-201 gram was excreted in six hours.
    The stomach contained 2-708 grams of neutral fat remaining from
 the 6'877 grams of the neutral fat given in the milk.                Thus the per
 centage of neutral fat found was 41'32, while the neutral fat in the
 milk given was no less than 95'63 : hence 58'41 per cent, of the
 neutral fat given hod been split up into fat acids during seven hours
 in the stomach.
    The quantity of free fat acids was 3'828 grams, and the soaps had
increased to 0'018 gram, this constituting a percentage of 0'27.
    The small intestine gave as the percentage of neutral fat 43'64, as
compared with 41'42 present in the stomach.
    This is a very different thing to what is found in the case of the
normal dogs, where the fat acids in the small intestine were greatly
increased and the neutral fat much diminished, for here the free fat
acids were only 52'09 per cent., i.e., very slightly above the amount
of neutral fat present in the small intestine, and less than the fat
acids present in the stomach. The small intestine also contained no
less than 4-27 per cent, of fat acids in the form of soap.
    In the case of the large intestine the total quantity of fat present
was 0'644 ; of this, 0'175 still remained as neutral fat, the percentage
being 27'17, while 55'75 per cent, was present in the form of free fat
acids, and 17'08 per cent, of the fat acids had combined to form soaps.

   In Table     VII     the dog received a larger quantity of fat than
usual, and whether in consequence of this or through some other

262               Dr. V. Harley.       On the Breaking-up
reason,    there was, towards the end of the seven hours' digestion
diarrhoea which necessitated the collecting of some of the faeces
passed, and by reason of this there was a possibility of some slight loss.
    This case alone, of all the dogs in which the pancreas was
removed, indicated any absorption of fat, for out of the 12'027 grams
of the fat given 0'533 gram was not recovered.            It was, however,
perfectly obvious that in this experiment this deficit whs attributable
to loss in collection of the faeces, although everything to hinder
such an error was attempted.
    The stomach contained 9'358 grams of fat, of this no less than
0'177 grams was in the form of neutral fat         In fact, 98'07 per cent.
of the total fat was present in this case as neutral fat, while the
 rnilk given contained only 95'90 per cent.
    Tlie free fat acids in the milk given contained 0'4-55 gram,
 while in the stomach only 0'159 gram was found ; that .is to say,
 1'70 per cent, of the total fat only was present as fat acids in the
stomach.      Soaps also were 0'022 gram, and the percentage 0'023.
    In this dog alone, of either the normal dogs or those in which the
pancreas was removed, was there no indication of breaking up of
neutral fat into free fat acids in the stomach, as far as the total
 quantity of fat acids found in the stomach was concerned.              The
explanation    of this is very difficult.  It may  be due  to  the fact that
 the milk fat in this case had very considerably broken up before it
was administered, the milk being somewhat acid, and it had been
boiled down considerably in order to decrease the volume given.
The quantity of fat which had left the stomach during the seven
hours' digestion was no less than 22'19 per cent, of the total given,
that is, much more than occurred in any of the other dogs in which
the pancreas had been previously removed.          In fact, this out-flow is
more like the normal dogs.       It is, therefore, possible that the soaps
and fat acids which had been formed in the stomach had to a con
siderable extent left it, and if to a greater extent than the neutral
fat had thus caused the percentage of neutral fat to be higher than
that given.
    The quantity of fat in the large gut was more than in the small
intestine, and this also was exceptional, as in all the other cases the
reverse was found after seven hours, and it can be only explained by
the fact that on account of the milk being sour and the diarrhoea
which occurred, there was a hurrying along of the contents of the
alimentary canal.
    The quantity of fat in the small intestine was only 0'464 gram, of
which 0'075 gram was present as neutral fat ; that is to say, only
 16'17 per cent, of the total fat was present in the stomach as neutral
 fat.   The fat acids on the other hand were no less than 0*361 gram,
 that is 77'79 per cent, of the total fat present in the small intestine.

                          of Fat in   the  Alimentary Canal.                            263
    This result may not be due entirely to the breaking up of the fat
in the small intestine, but to the increased out-put of fat acids from
the stomach. The soaps equalled 6'04 per cent, of the total fat
present in the small intestine, although the actual quantity was only
0-028 gram.
    In the large intestine the quantity given in the table was not only
 that which was present in the intestine after death, but also that
 which was collected in the faeces, passed during the last hour or so
 of life. It contained 1'672 grams of fat, of which 0-668 gram were
 in the form of neutral fat, and 0'990 had been broken up into free
 fat acids.    So that 59-21 per cent, of the total fat was in the form of
 fat acids, and 39'95 per cent, only as neutral fat.
    The soaps were not very much increased, the total quantity being
 only 0'014, that is to say 0-84 per cent.
                                         Summary.
     When we come to compare the results found in the normal dogs
 during the absorption or milk fat with that in the dogs in which the
 pancreas has been removed, we see that there is not such a great
 difference as one would be led to suspect by the old teaching of the
 fat splitting action of the pancreas.
     For the purpose of comparison it will be better to tabulate the
  average results of the preceding experiments so that the normal
  results may be more readily compared with those in which the pan
  creas had been previously removed.               In this way it is easy to detect
  any real difference in the percentage quantities in the alimentary
  canal.

  264             Dr. V. Harley.      On the Breaking-vp
 in which the results of only two experiments were used, and the
 period of digestion was seven hours, except in one case of removal
 of the pancreas in which it was only six hours.
    As far as the stomach is concerned, the table shows that there is a
 slight increase in the quantity of fat acids in dogs in which the
 pancreas has heen removed, as the percentage noted was 31'29 per
 cent, of the total fat, while in the normal dogs which were employed
 as control, only 18'50 per cent, of the total fat was present in the
 form of free fat acids.    This would be in favour of a greater fat
 splitting-up activity of the stomach in dogs in which the pancreas
 had previously been removed. That a greater splitting-up action
 was really the cause of this increase is difficult to believe.  It would
 seem much more likely that the increased percentage of fat acid in
 the dogs without the pancreas was due to the greater retention of fat
 in the stomach, for in all cases in which the pancreas had been
 removed, the expulsion of fat from the stomach was very much
 delayed.
    The percentage quantity of fat acids present as soap in both the
 normal and the pathological dogs is practically equal, for in both
 cases no less than 0'63 and 0'55 per cent, of the free fat acids were
 present as soap in the stomach.
    The table therefore proves that both in normal dogs as well as in
those in which the pancreas has been removed, the stomach is capable
of not only splitting up neutral fat into free fat acids and glycerine,
but farther, that the free fat acids are capable of finding alkalis in
the stomach itself wherewith to form soaps.        The power of the free
fat acids forming soap is, however, extremely limited in the stomach.
   The principal fat-splitting action really begins, not in the stomcah,
but after it has left the pylorus.     That this should be the case in
normal dogs has long been held by all physiologists, and was con
sidered due to the action of the pancreas, and the degree to which
this occurs is shown in the table, according to which in the normal
dog at least 72-22 per cent, of the fat present in the small intestine
was in the form of free fat acids, only 24-67 per cent, being present
as neutral fat.    But also in the case where the pancreas had been
entirely extirpated, so that no pancreatic juice could possibly reach
the intestine, and the fasting had been sufficiently long to remove any
pancreatic ferments which might have been previously present in
the intestines, we still find a large increase in the quantity of the fat
acids present, the fat acids being no less than 61 '62 per cent, of the
total fat.   There can be no doubt, therefore, that even when no pan
creatic secretion has reached the intestines, a very considerable
quantity of the neutral fat is split up into froe fat acids in the small
intestine, although the quantity there formed is not so great as when
the pancreatic secretion has been able to add its share of work.

                   of Fat in   the   Alimentary Canal.                265
    The freo fat acids combined with soaps in the normal dog wore only
3'14 per cent, of the total fat present, while those dogs in which the
pancreas had previously been removed had no less than 579 per
cent.
    This is a most interesting fact, for in spite of the absence of the
alkaline pancreatic secretion, it is found that not only nearly the
 normal quantity of free fat acids are present, but a considerable
 increase of fat acids have formed soaps, so that the intestines have
been able to secrete a sufficiency of alkali substances to form soaps.
    The contents of the large intestine in the second group of cases
resemble each other far more closely. In fact, in the case of the free
fat acids, the quantity present in both the normal control dogs and those
in which the pancreas had previously been removed        is, for all prac
tical purposes, equal, the control dogs having 58-65 per cent, of fat,
iu the form of free fat acid, while those dogs in which no pancreatic
secretion had reached the intestines, 5332 per cent.           The effect
of the want of pancreatic secretion, although exhibited to       a   small
extent in the small intestine, and causing a diminution in the quan
tity of fat acids present, was no longer apparent in the large intes
tine.
    The quautity of fat acids present as soaps in the large intestine
varies, although not to a greater extent than was the case in the
small intestine. Those dogs in which the pancreas had been pre
viously removed contained 13-41 per cent, of the total fat in the form
of fat acids combined as soaps, while 7'19 per cent, only was iu this
form in those dogs which were used as control experiments.

    In a preliminary note on the " Dielectric Constant of Ice and
Alcohol at very Low Temperatures "* we have described the method
employed by us in determining the dielectric constants of ice and
frozen ethylic alcohol at the temperature of liquid air. One diffi
culty which presented itself in our initial experiments was that of
the construction of a suitable electrical condenser for use with frozen
liquids as dielectrics. The concentric-tube pattern of condenser used
by us in the first experiments on ice gave trouble by becoming
deformed under the expansive force of the water on freezing, and
the subsequent great contraction of the ice on cooling to the tempera-
of liquid air tended to break the contact between the metal plates
and the dielectric.       It was, in addition, difficult to clean out.
    In undertaking, therefore, a more careful study of the dielectric
constants of various frozen electrolytes at and above the tempera
ture of liquid air, the first experimental problem which arose was
that of the construction of a form of condenser which could be em
ployed with the selected frozen electrolyte as dielectric, and which
 should comply with the following conditions : —
    1. To allow any required and actual expansion of the dielectric on
freezing without deforming the condenser.
    2. To permit the subsequent great contraction of the dielectric
substance on cooling to the temperature of liquid air, without break
ing contact between the dielectric and the metal plates.
    3. To be sufficiently compact to be placed in a large vacuum tube
of liquid air.
    -4. To be rigid and have high insulation and be           able to be taken
apart and put together again quickly and accurately.
    After trying several arrangements, we were at last able to design
a condenser fulfilling the above conditions in a veiy perfect way,
and which has given in its latest form little or no trouble in work.
    This condenser, which we call a cone-condenser, is constructed as
follows : —
    It consists of two hollow cones turned out of hard brass (see fig.
 1), the outer cone being 14-9 cm. in length inside, 5-l cm. in diameter

inside at the top, and 2-6 cm. inside diameter at the bottom. The
 bottom of the outer cone is closed by a brass plate fastened on with
six set screws, and which plate carries a small ebonite steady pin
 1'5 cm. long and 3 mm. in diameter, screwed into the centre.               In
some instances a quartz pin is preferable, and can be used.
                               The inner cone is also closed at the bottom
                            and open at the top. The two cones were accu
                            rately ground together and, after finishing, were
                            thickly gilt.
                              The inner cone is 12'7 cm. in length and 4'8 cm.
                           in diameter on the outside at the top, and 2'6 cm.
                           across the bottom. The bottom of the inner cone
                           is closed by a thick plate having a recessed hole
                           in it, into which the above-mentioned ebonite
                           pin fits easily, and acts as a steady-pin to keep
                           the two cones coaxial.     To the top of the inner
                           cone is fixed, by means of a three-spoke carrier,
                           a vertical screw pin, and this screw passes
                           through a metal boss in the centre of an ebonite
                           bushing piece fixed in the middle of another
                           three-spoke carrier fastened by three removable
                           screws to the upper edge of the outer cone.
                              By means of a nut on the screw, the inner
                           cone can be displaced coaxially with the outer
                           cone, so as to leave between the cones a conical
                           space into which any fluid can be introduced.
                           A lock nut enables the inner cone to be fixed.
                              The inner and outer cone then form the two
                           plates of the condenser, and the fluid, or frozen

 of dielectric constant.
                           steady-pin is, therefore, only about one fifteen-
                           hundredth of the total exposed surface of the
condenser, and any correction for its dielectric constant may he
neglected. The weight of the whole condenser is 960 grams.
    The thickness of the walls of the two brass cones is about 2 mm.
in each case.
    It will be seen, therefore, that if any fluid is introduced between
the cones and frozen, any expansion thereby taking place lifts the
inner cone, but does not in any way deform the condenser.            If, then,
on cooling, a subsequent contraction takes place, the weight of the
inner cone makes it fall back and follow up the shrinking dielectric.
And to assist this a small spiral spring is placed around the
central screw between the three-spoke carriers attached to the inner

and outer cones. After the liquid is frozen, if desired, the nut work
ing on the screw pin may be loosened, the inner cone is then free to
follow up the contraction of the dielectric and always keeps up a
perfect contact between the metal cones and the conical layer of
dielectric.        The whole arrangement is perfectly rigid, and can be
taken to pieces, and put together again in exactly the same position
by releasing the three screws which attach the three-spoke carrier
to the outer cone.
    In order to determine the temperature of the frozen dielectric a
platinum wire thermometer was fixed in the interior of the inner cone
with the wire pressed against the wall of the cone, and was held there
by partly filling the interior of the inner cone with paraffin wax or
fusible metal. Leading-in wires were then brought out to enable the
resistance, and therefore the temperature of this platinum thermo
meter, to be instantly determined on a slide wire bridge.
    The condenser was then suspended in such a way by silk strings
 that it could be lowered into the interior of a very large vacuum
 vessel, 60 cm. deep and 7 cm. wide in interior diameter, and capable
 of holding several , litres of liquid air. The two cones of the con
denser were connected with the galvanometer, battery and vibrating
contact maker controlled by an electrically driven tuning-fork, just
as described in a previous communication.*

show   if the rapid  series of charges of the condenser  gives a current
exactly equal to the rapid series of dischargee. When this equality
exists we know that there is no sensible leakage current passing
through the condenser dielectric, or loss of charge during the interval
of time which elapses between two successive contacts of the vibrating
switch .
   This disposition of apparatus enabled us therefore very quickly —
   (1) To measure the capacity of the condenser when having any
          selected frozen liquid as dielectric at any temperature.
   (2) To measure the resistance of the above dielectric.
   (3) To determine the temperature of the dielectric layer.
   (4) To heat up the whole condenser slowly to any temperature
          above that of liquid air.
   (5) To determine whether there was any sensible leakage current
          through the dielectric.
   The usual method of procedure, after having filled the condenser
with the electrolyte to be examined, was to cool down the whole con
denser to the temperature of liquid air by slowly immersing it in
several litres of liquid air contained in the large vacuum tube. Then
it was raised out into the cold gaseous air lying above the surface of
the liquid air, in which position the whole condenser rose very slowly
in temperature from —185° C. up to the melting point of the dielectric,
and during this time observations for capacity, resistance, and tem
perature were successively and quickly taken at various temperatures.
   The great mass of the condenser favoured a very slow tempera
ture change, and thus assisted to keep all parts of the condenser at
the same temperature.
   The operation of measuring the dielectric constant of the frozen
electrolyte placed in the condenser consisted then in measuring the
current flowing through the galvanometer with a constant switch-
frequency, and charging voltage, when the condenser had the
selected electrolyte as its dielectric ; and then again when the
frozen electrolyte was melted out and the condenser put together
with the cones the same distance apart and at the same temperature
but having gaseous air as the dielectric.      As a matter of fact, each
time of experimenting one careful measurement was made of the
charge and discharge current through the condenser set up with the
cones a fixed distance apart and the cones cooled to the temperature
of liquid air, the dielectric being gaseous air of the same tempera
ture. The capacity of the condenser, when the vertical distance
separating the cones was 1'5 mm., was very nearly l/8000th of a
microfarad, with air as dielectric.      Under these circumstances the
multiplication    of  the observed galvanometer deflection by a factor,
after applying a correction for the capacity of the leads and vibrator,

             Dielectric   Constants    of certain Frozen Electrolytes.             303
suffices     to  reduce     the   galvanometer reading to the value of the
dielectric constant of the dielectric used referred to that of gaseous
air as unity.
    The galvanometer used in these experiments was a Holden-Pitkin
galvanometer with movable coil. The scale was placed 125 cm. from
the mirror, and the sensibility was such that an electromotive force
of 1'434 volts, acting through a megohm, gave a scale deflection of
3'6 cm.
    In making the measurements a careful watch was kept to see if
the charge current of the condenser was al ways equal to the dis
charge current ; and the moment the charge and discharge galvano
meter deflections differed by anything like a millimetre or two of
scale      deflection (the scale being 125 cm. from the galvano
 meter) the capacity measurements were no longer trusted.                        More
over, at intervals, a large resistance of several thousand ohms was
inserted in the galvanometer circuit to ascertain if there was any
 variation of deflection.          The absence of any change in deflection
 was also taken as the proof that no sensible leakage current was
 passing through the dielectric, and polarisation practically absent.
     From the construction of the condenser it will be seen that a con
 siderable vertical movement of the inner cone only changes the
 perpendicular distance between the surfaces of the cones by about
 one-tenth of the vertical rise. When a liquid is placed between the
 cones and frozen there is a change of distance due to the lift of the
 inner cone. We have, however, convinced ourselves by experiment
 that the change in the capacity of the condenser which may occur
 owing to change in the bulk, either expansion or contraction, of the
 dielectric cannot make more than 5 per cent, change in total capacity
 measured.       This is not more than may easily occur through unavoid
 able degrees of impurity in the dielectrics used.                     We have not
 thought      it necessary     to apply   a correction   for the  change in dimen
 sions of the dielectric thickness on cooling.*
     In reducing the observations a correction has been made for the
  capacity of the connecting wires and for that of the vibrating
 contact maker,f and in the following tables the reduced and cor-
    * There is also a correction due to the fact that some of the lines of electrostatic
  induction start from the inside of the inner cone and terminate on the carrier or
 other portions of the outer cone.     In other words the whole of the capacity of the
  system is not comprised between the opposed surfaces of the cones.         This, how
 ever, is not a large correction, as we have found that even if it is omitted we obtain
  results for the values of certain well-known dielectric constants closely agreeing
  with those of other observers. Our object in these experiments has not been so
  much to obtain great numerical accuracy of value as to determine the general mode
  of variation of the dielectric constant with temperature.

  Constant of Ice and Alcohol at very low Temperatures."

   rected value is given of the dielectric constant of the various

   in terms of our standard platinum thermometer P;.*
       The temperature at which the observations are interrupted in the
  case of each electrolyte depends upon the temperature at which
   sensible electric conductivity makes its appearance.             One of the
   most remarkable facts which has attracted our attention in these
  experiments is that electric conductivity in electrolytes which are
  frozen and then reduced to very low temperatures extends far down
  into the solid condition, but there is for each body apparently a
  temperature at which electric conductivity begins to increase very
  rapidly, so much so, that in some cases a rise of temperature of only
  two or three degrees makes all the difference between being able to
  measure the dielectric constant well by the above-described method
  and not being able to measure it at all.
      At the lowest temperatures reached, all the frozen electrolytes we
  have used appear to be practically perfect insulators, or, at any rate,
  to have enormously high electric resistivity, and then, as r.hey are
 gradually heated up, long before their melting point is readied, quite
  suddenly they begin to exhibit very sensible conductivity.          We have
 not attempted to interpret this result into the language of any
 theory of electrical conduction, but it is evidently a very important
 fact in connection with electrolytic conduction.
      Hence, in the above described observations, a point of temperature
 is reached for each frozen electrolyte as it warms up, at which, for
 the frequency of charge and discbarge (viz., 120 per second) we were
 using, further observation on the dielectric constant became impos
 sible, at least by the method employed.             Cases in which the true
 dielectric measurement is doubtful, owing to such incipient conduc
 tion, are indicated by a query.
      The following measurements have, then, been made on certain well
 known electrolytes frozen as described : —

    It will be seen that in each oi' the above three instances the
dielectric constant falls to a value, near to 3, at the temperature of
liquid air, bnt rises very rapidly in the case of the potassic cyanide
solution, less rapidly in the case of the copper sulphate solution, and
still less fast in the case of the ferric perchloride solution as the
temperature rises.
    As regards the electrical resistance, the following tables show
approximately the kind of variation which takes place, but these
figures are only approximations ; they include the leakage of the leads
and vibrating contact maker, which, though very highly insulated,
are not infinite in resistance.           Hence these figures merely show the

fall between -198° and -162°.
   Broadly speaking, it will be seen that in all the above cases, for
the electrolytes employed, the dielectric constant of the solution,
whether strong or weak, when frozen and reduced in temperature to
—200°, was represented by a number not very different from that of
the dielectric constant of pure ice at the same temperature ; and
hence it appears clear that the conductivity of the electrolytic solu
tion at the ordinary temperature, when liquid, exercises very little
influence upon the dielectric constant of the electrolyte when frozen
and reduced to the temperature of liquid air. It is clear, also, that

constant and the conductivity begin to increase with great rapidity,

   Fio. 5. — Curves showing the variation  of dielectric constant of frozen caustic
                         alkali solutions with temperature.
   On examining these values for the dielectric constants of the
frozen caustic alkali solutions, it will be seen that there is a remark
able difference between these last bodies and the other electrolytes
examined by us, in that the values of the dielectric constant of the
caustic alkalis are relatively very high at the low temperature of
liquid air. In this respect the 5 per cent, solution of caustic potash
is especially remarkable.        For the same temperature, viz., —185° C.,
and varying     concentrations,    the 5 per cent, solution of caustic potash
shows a maximum value for the dielectric constant of about 130,
whereas the dielectric constant of the sulphate of copper, chloride
of sodium, potassic cyanide, perchloride of iron, sulphuric and

hydrochloric acids at the temperature of liquid air all have values
not far removed from 3. The dielectric constants of the caustic
potash solutions thus preserve a high value until a very low tem
perature is reached.         It is, however, clear from the diagrams that
the curves representing these last constants are in each case bending
downwards, and a very moderate further rednction of temperature
would probably reduce the constant in these cases also to a low
value.
   We were desirous of seeing what effect the solvent had in the case
of the caustic potash, and accordingly prepared a 5 per cent, solution
of caustic potash in ethylic alcohol and examined this with the
following result: —

   The above observations are plotted in the short curve marked               K  in
fig. 5.
   It  is thus seen that the       5 per cent, alcoholic solution of caustic
potash behaves quite differently to the 5 per cent, aqueous solution
and has a much lower dielectric constant at — 185° C. The conduc
tivity of the alcoholic solution rises so rapidly just above — 185° C.
that the dielectric measurements cannot be carried up very far,
but as far as they go they show that the solution in water has
an immensely greater dielectric value than the solution in alcohol
at —200° and upwards.
   The observations we have          so   far made lead us to the following
conclusions : —

   (i) Frozen electrolytes at low temperatures are          capable of acting
          as dielectrics   even in the case of those substances which in
          the liquid state and in aqueous solutions have relatively a
          very high electrolytic conductivity.
   (ii) At temperatures not far removed below their freezing points,
          these electrolytes have dielectric constants of large value, and
          numerically of the order of that of ice or water at 0° C. or
          in some cases much larger.
    (iii) The majority of these high dielectric values so far as observed
          are reduced to very much lower values (near to 3) when the
          dielectrics are cooled to, and below the temperature of, liquid
          air.
    (iv) Certain aqueous solutions of potash retain their high dielectric
          values to nearly the liquid air temperature, but give indication
          of being reduced at lower temperatures to small values.
    (v) Frozen electrolytes at very low temperatures have very great
          insulating power, but recover sensible conductivity with great
          rapidity at temperatures far below their melting points.
    (vi) It appears probable that at the absolute zero of temperature
          all electrolytes become perfect non-conductors of electricity or
          have infinite resistivity, also that it is possible their dielectric
          constants may all be reduced to, and represented by, a number
          near to 2 or 3 at that temperature, that of a vacuum being
          taken as unity.
    We are engaged in examining as many electrolytes as possible at
low temperatures to test the validity of the above last inference. In
 conclusion, we have again to thank Mr. J. E. Petavel for much
 valuable assistance in the laborious work of taking these observations,
 a work which has necessitated frequently very considerable endurance,
 in consequence of the fact that such series of observations, when once
 begun, had to be continued often through the night without interrup
 tion until completed.

     In   another communication we have described the instrumental
  appliances we are at present using in investigations on dielectric

             Constants  of Pure Ice, §c, at Low Temperatures.                     317
constants at very low temperatures,* and there is, therefore, no need
to repeat these descriptions.
    In the present paper we give the results we have obtained for the
variation of dielectric constants at low temperatures when using
certain carefully purified bodies as dielectrics.
    As pure water is a standard substance the electrical constants of
which have been very carefully studied, we desired in the first place
to repeat our former experiments on the dielectric constant of ice,
using, however, very pure distilled water as the means of pro
curing it.
    Dr. Scott very kindly prepared for us in the Davy-Faraday labo
ratory a sample of pure water distilled in a silver still, and the gilt
cone condenser used was carefully washed out with this water.                     The
condenser was then kept full of this water for ten days, the water
being changed twice a day. During the day-time the condenser full
of water was kept at a temperaturo of 90° C. Having thus very
carefully purified the condenser it was again filled with the pure dis
tilled water, and this water frozen into ice by the aid of liquid air.
The whole mass of the condenser and the ice being reduced to
 — 185° C. by immersing the cones in a large vacuum vessel full of
two litres of liquid air, the condenser was then raised out of the
liquid air into the equally cold gaseous air lying above it in the
 vacuum vessel, and was allowed to warm up very slowly, taking
four hours thirty minutes to rise in temperature from —185° C. to
5°C.
    During this rise of temperature the dielectric constant of the ice
was measured      at various temperatures by the arrangements already
described, and also the resistance of the ice condenser.
    The corrected galvanometer scale deflection, when the condeuser as
used was filled with gaseous air at the ordinary temperature of
lo° C., was 3'73 centimetres, using a charging voltage of 100 volts.
This value is corrected for the capacity of the leads and for that of
the vibrator.     In the following table the temperature of the ice is
given in platinum degrees in terms of our standard platinum thermo
meter P2.

   In the     case of the last four observations       the discharge and charge
currents of the condenser were no longer quite equal, thus showing
that conductivity had begun to have influence prejudicial to the
accuracy of the measurements of the dielectric constant.

   It  is seen from the above figures that oar former observations on
the resistance of ice from ordinary distilled water are confirmed.
Above a certain temperature there is a relatively rapid increase
in the conductivity of the ice, as it rises in temperature.
   It was considered desirable to ascertain the difference made in
these values by using the ordinary distilled water of the laboratory
instead of this carefully purified distilled water, and therefore the
same experiments were repeated, using ordinary water, with the
following results : —

    Beyond this last temperature (—40-7) the observations are not
of much value. Sensible conductivity had hegun to make its appear
ance, and the measurements no longer gave the true dielectric
constant.
    These results are plotted in a second curve in fig. 1, marked
distilled water.     It is clear that there is in this case a well marked
maximum value for the dielectric constant at about — 65°, and that
above that temperature the dielectric constant falls again. We have
already pointed out that in the case of the ice from ordinary dis
tilled water, a very rapid increase of electric conductivity takes
place at or about — 90°, and the temperature somewhat precedes
the temperature at which the dielectric constant is a maximum for
the ice.       Other observers who have studied the variation of the
dielectric constant of water at temperatures above zero centigrade,
agree that beyond a certain temperature the dielectric constant
decreases with rise of temperature.             Thus C. B. Thwing ('Zeit-
schrift fur Physikalische Chemie,' vol. 14, 1894, p. 296) gives the
following values for the dielectric constant for water using a rapidly
oscillating electromotive force : —

   Drude and Heerwagen do not agree with Thwing in making the
dielectric constant of water a maximum at 4° C., but they all agree
that an increase of temperature decreases the dielectric constant of
water beyond that point. As we find an enormous decrease in the

           Constants    of Pure     Ice, fyc, at Low Temperatures.          323
constant in cooling ice from 0° C. to —185° C., it follows that there
is unquestionably some temperature at which ice-water has a maximum
value for its dielectric constant.       This temperature may, and probably
does, vary with the presence of slight impurities in the water, and
with the frequency of the electromotive force reversals.
   On examining the carves for perfectly pure water and for ordinary
distilled water, it will be seen that minute impurities, as well as
change of frequency, evidently have a considerable effect upon the
dielectric constant at any given temperature.
   This was additionally shown as follows : —
   Being desirous of trying the effect of varying the frequency of the
contact breaker, two sets of experiments were made with the care
fully purified distilled water, the condenser being reduced in tem
perature to —79° C. by the aid of solid carbonic acid and alcohol.

   It will be seen that the dielectric values are         all higher than those
given in the former table for the corresponding temperatures.
   We are disposed to attribute the differences between the values
obtained in the last set of observations and the first set to the fact
that the water became slightly contaminated with alcohol during the
process of freezing down the condenser in the carbonic acid and
alcohol. This view was confirmed by the observations taken with a
mixture of alcohol and water, which showed that such a mixture
rises in dielectric value as temperature increases more rapidly than
does the pure distilled water.
   Similar observations were taken with a double frequency of 250
and a charging voltage of 1'434.

   The dielectric constant is seen to rise with great rapidity very soon
above     the temperature of —190°. This is clearly connected with
the temperature at which the alcoholic mixture becomes plastic
previous to fusion.
   We attempted to obtain the dielectric curve of pure ethylic
alcohol, to compare it with that of water, but were stopped by the
fact that at a temperature very little above —200° the ethylic alcohol,
although still apparently in a solid condition, becomes possessed of
such an amount of conductivity that our method is no longer able to
give us the true dielectric constant.
   In contrast to this we have taken the dielectric constant of
pure glycerine (a triatomic alcohol), with the following results: —

   It   is seen that the glycerine acts as do all the other electrolytes so
far examined, its resistance falls as its dielectric constant increases.
   In order to examine and compare the behaviour of water and
glycerine with some non-electrolytic dielectrics, we selected for
examination nitrobenzol and ethylene dibromide.                       Of these bodies,
one, viz., mononitrobenzol, has, at the ordinary temperature and in
the liquid state, a somewhat high dielectric value.                      The following

    Ethylene dibromide, therefore, presents a remarkable contrast to-
  water or glycerine.       Its dielectric constant at ordinary temperature,
  15° C., has a value of about 5.
    It falls, on freezing, to nearly 3, and it continues, as seen by the
 above table, nearly constant down to the lowest temperature reached,
 at which it becomes 2'7.
    Its resistance also remains, when cooled down after freezing,
 exceedingly high and constant, the condenser resistance being over
 10,000 megohms between —200° and -30°.
    From a consideration of the values which have been fonnd for the
 dielectric constants of various bodies, it appears that the presence in
 a molecule of certain radicles such as hydroxyl and nitryl always
 cause high values of the dielectric constant in the liquid state.
 Hence we have examined one well-known nitro-substitution com
 pound, nitrobenzol, to determine how this value is altered by very
 low temperatures. The dielectric constant of mononitrobenzol is
 given by C. B. Thwing as 32-19, presumably at 15° C. Our values
 for its dielectric constant at low temperatures and when solidified
 are as follows : —

temperature, and very nearly equal to that of ice at —200°.

FlG.  2. — Curves showing the variation   of dielectric constant of ethylene dibromide
                         and nitro-benzol  with temperature.
   The    dielectric constant of the mononitro-benzol value falls on
solidifying at 3° C. from the high valne of 32 to a low value of
between 3 and 4 somewhat rapidly, and ultimately reaches 2'61 at
-185° C.
   In the case of these non-electrolytes, nitro-benzol and ethylene
dibromide, the electrical resistance remains practically constant and
exceedingly high during the rise of temperature from —200° upwards,
being thus in contrast with the behaviour of the frozen electrolytes
which, as shown, rise up very rapidly in conductivity at a certain
temperature.
   It should also be noted with regard to glycerine that other

  328      Profs. J. A. Fleming and      J. Dewar.     On the Dielectric
  observers    who have examined the dielectric constant of this sub
  stance at temperatures above 0° C. have found for glycerine a negative
  coefficient of temperature variation.       Thus W. Cassie (' Roy. Soc.
  Proc.,' vol. 46, 1889 ; also > Phil. Trans.,' A, 1890, vol. 181) finds for
  glycerine between 18° C. and 41° C., a negative temperature coefficient
  equal to — O006.      Hence within this range, increase of temperature
  decreases the dielectric constant of glycerine.      C. B. Thwing (' Zeit.
  f iir Phys. Chem.,' vol. 14, p. 293) gives the value 56'2 for the dielectric
  constant of glycerine at ordinary temperatures. Since at low tem
  peratures we find a positive coefficient, and much smaller values, it
  is clear that glycerine, like water, must have a maximum value for
  its dielectric constant at a certain temperature.      It is very important
  that this point should be examined more fully. Up to the present
  time electrical theory has offered no complete explanation of how it is
  that change of temperature has such profound effect in modifying the
  dielectric quality of certain kinds of matter. Ice, for instance, taken
  at —200° has about 2'4 times the dielectric power of the electro
  magnetic medium alone.        At — 60° from 50 to 100 times the power.
  At the absolute zero of temperature perhaps about twice the power.
  On the other hand, we may carry such a body as ethylene dibromide
  over the same range of temperature, without making any very
  sensible change in the degree to which the substance affects the
  electrical qualities of the space in which it exists.
      It is evidently, however, very closely a chemical question. Com
  paring the variation of many other physical qualities, suoh as density,
  refractive index, thermal conductivity, Ac., with dielectric constants,
  we see that the variations which occur in the latter by changes of
  temperature and changes of substance are much more akin to the
  wide differences which occur between bodies in chemical activity.
  The presence of certain chemical radicles, such as OH. CO, COH,
  NO2t has been shown by C. B. Thwing (' Zeit. fur Phys. Chem.,' vol.
  14) to be a most potent factor in determining high values for tho
  dielectric constant at ordinary temperature, but the remarkable
  behaviour of an aqueous 5 per cent, solution of caustic potaoh has
  shown us that questions of concentration and the nature of the
  solvent have to be considered as well, whilst the behaviour of all
  electrolytes at the very low temperature indicates that decrease in
  temperature destroys the influence of the radicle in this respect.
      One of the most interesting points is the evidence which now
  exists that water, glycerine, ethyl alcohol, and no doubt many other
  bodies, have a maximum value for their dielectric constants at certain
  temperatures.
      Thus W. Cassie ('Phil. Trans.,' A., 1890, vol. 181, p. 16) has
  shown that the curves representing the variation of the dielectric
  constant of glycerine, carbon disulphide, olive oil, benzol and tur-
\

           Constants  of Pure Ice,  fyc., at Low Temperatures.               329
pen tine  all have such a direction as to show that their dielectric
constants decrease with rise of temperature between + 10° C. and
 + 80° C.     We find that the constant for glycerine increases from
 — 185° C. to —100° 0., and hence it follows that it has a maximum
value for a certain temperature.
    This fact makes it necessary to be very cautious in drawing con
clusions as to the complete form of the dielectric curve from
observations made over a limited range of temperature.                  A some
what hasty generalisation of this kind has been made by R. Abegg
 (see Wiedemann's 'Annalen,' 1897, No. 1, p. 59).             He measured by
Nernst's method the dielectric constants of water, alcohol, and other
bodies from +10° C. down to —80° C. with such results as
follows : —

    He concludes that the dielectric constant of water would be 372 at
the absolute zero of temperature, and that of alcohol would be 80 at
 — 196°. As a matter of fact, both these constants have a value not far
removed from 3'0 at the temperature of liquid air, and it is highly
improbable that they increase again on further cooling.

dielectric values on compounds containing them when at temperatures

  In their paper "On Capacity and Residual Charge of Dielectrics
as affected by Temperature and Time,"* Dr. J. Hopkinson and Mr.
Wilson give measurements of the dielectric constant of glycerine for
high and low frequencies at ordinary temperatures. The value they
                                                                      '
obtain is 60 for high frequency and 50 to 60 for low frequency.
They also say that glycerine has no residual charge. We obtain an
almost identical value for a frequency of 120 at —50°, but below that
temperature the dielectric curve of glycerine, we find, runs almost
parallel to that of ice. It is difficult to understand why residual
charge (which in ice, the above-named authors say, is considerable)
should be the cause of high dielectric value at ordinary temperatures
in the case of one substance and not in the case of the other.

                                       (Abstract.)
   The author treats first of the extinction of the sensation of light
on the centre of the retina. He made his reduction of the intensity
of the light falling on the illuminated spot with a new piece of
apparatus, which consisted of a gelatine wedge bent so as to make an
annulus. He describes this wedge and its graduation, showing how
its readings can be utilised, they being proportional to the logarithm
of the intensity of light passing through it.
   It is found that the smaller the spot of illuminated surface the
less reduction in intensity of the light is required, and that the
 amount of reduction of the light falling on the spot which just pro
 duces no sensation of light is connected with the size of the spot by
a simple formula, I = xm, where I is the intensity and x the diameter
of the spot.   Further, he finds that it is the smallest diameter which
governs the necessary reduction in intensity and not the area of the

             On the Production  of the First Sound of the Heart.      331
illuminated surface.       Having experimented with the extinction of
light at other parts of the retina, he finds that it obeys the same
law. Since a large and a small area having the same actual illumi
nation appear to be of different brightuess, an investigation was made
of the relative luminosities of the two, and it was found that the two
were connected by a very simple law.
     The reduction of the intensity of a coloured ray to extinguish
all colour was next measured with areas of different dimensions,
and it was shown that again the intensity of the reduced light was
connected with the size of the spot by a simple expression similar to
that of the extinction of all light, but the exponential coefficient
differed, indicating that light and colour were not connected together
in the manner which might be expected.
     The author then deals with the question of colour fields, and finds
that all colour fields are of the same form, the extent depending
solely on the illumination and the area of the surface the image of
which falls on the retina.         He finds that there is a connection
between the intensity of the colour and the extent of the field which
can be expressed by a formula, as also can the connection between
the size of the spot of illuminated surface and the extent of field.
 He gives the curves of illumination for equal colour fields, and the
 curves of extent of field for every colour in the prismatic spectrum.
 Finally he makes an investigation into the relative sensitiveness to
 light of various points in the retina, and shows that there are
 " iso-lumes " or fields of equal sensitiveness which appear to be of
 the same form as the colour fields.
     He points out that there are difficulties in reconciling these
 results with either the Toung or Hering theory of colour vision, and
 suggests a modification in the accepted theory of light and colour
 which may explain the connection between the two.

     On the Mechanism by which the First Sound of the Heart is
         Produced."      By Sir Richard Quain, Bart., M.D., F.R.S.
         Received April 29,— Read June 3, 1897.
      It is a well-recognised fact that the action of the heart is accom
  panied by the emission of certain sounds, which are described as the
  first and second sounds of the heart. These sounds, which were
  observed soon after Laennec had discovered the use of the stethoscope,
  have been compared to the sounds produced by the utterance of the
  words lubb-dtip.      They have been studied with interest by the
  physicist, the biologist, the pathologist, and the clinical physician,
  by the latter especially, inasmuch as the changes produced by disease
  in the character of these sounds become of material assistance in the
                                                            2 a 2

332             Sir R. Quain.          On the Mechanism by which
diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the heart. An explanation of
the mechanism by which phenomena so distinct, so constant, and so
remarkable are produced, has been sought for by many observers
amongst the classes just mentioned.
   The second sound is the result of the sudden tension of the semi
lunar valves, caused by the resistance which these valves offer to the
retrograde flow of the blood from the aorta and pulmonary artery
respectively into the ventricles on the cessation of systole. The sound
is similar to that produced when a piece of tape or ribbon is suddenly
made tense.        It is needless to say more here on the subject of the
second sound and its causes, for the explanation just offered is, I
believe, almost universally accepted.
   The cause of the first sound is, on the contrary, still a subject much
discussed and undecided.              Many explanations have been offered at
various times of this phenomenon.                Professor Michael Poster, to
whose admirable exposition of the mechanism of the circulation I am
deeply indebted for guidance in working out the subject of this
communication, observes that " this sound presents many difficulties
in the way of a complete explanation."*              The difficulties result from
the number of events which occur simultaneously with the systole of
the ventricle and the occurrence of the sound.               It seemed to me to
be desirable, amidst such differences of opinion, to solve if possible a
problem which has its special interest and its special importance.
Two of the most striking events which take place during systole,
namely, the closure of the auriculo-ventricular valves and the mus
cular contraction of the ventricular walls, are regarded by many
authorities as the sources from whence the first sound proceeds. The
result of my investigations, on the one hand, leads me to the conclu
sion that neither of these explanations is satisfactory ; and, on the
other hand, enables me to indicate what I believe to be the real
explanation of the phenomenon. f
    A. The action of      the  auriculo-ventricular valves is not  the source of
                              the first sound nf the heart.
    The mechanism of these valves (the mitral and tricuspid) and
 their action do not possess the elements necessary for the production
 of such a sound.           The action of the valves commences when the
 blood, pressed from behind by the contraction of the auricles, flows
 into the ventricles.          It is there reflected from the walls of these
 cavities, and presses on the lamellae of the valves, which are thus
    * 'Text-book of Physiology,' 6th Ed. (London, 1893), p. 239.
    + I have to acknowledge with thanks the assistance rendered nie in arranging
 my notes of this memoir by my valued friend. Dr. Mitchell Bruce, during my
 recent severe indisposition.

                  the First Sound of   the Heart is produced.            333
brought face to face into close apposition, and are so far closed by
the mere pressure of the blood from behind.                As soon as the
ventricles are filled with blood the systole commences.         The apex of
the heart approaches the base.            At the same time the musculi
papillares    contract,  and  by  means   of the chordae tendinece, attached
to the margin of the valves, prevent the laminae of the valves and
the blood from being pressed backwards into the auricles.            In this
action — the simple apposition of the laminae of the valves, and the
 closure of the orifices by means of the musculi papillares and chordae
tendineae — there is no such tensive force exercised as would be
 sufficient to produce the loud and characteristic first sound of the
 heart.
     Further evidence on this point may be found in another direction
 — namely, in the fact that the first sound can be heard independently
 of the existence and action of mitral and tricuspid valves. Aware
 of the fact that in some of the lower animals, more especially in the
 reptile class, the anriculo-ventricular valves exist in but a very
 rudimentary form,       I  obtained permission to examine some of these
 creatures    in the  Zoological Gardens, and spent many hours on many
 occasions in the investigation, assisted by my valued friend Dr. John
 Sibbald, who was at that time my clinical assistant at the Brompton
 Hospital, and who is now Senior Commissioner in Lunacy in
 Scotland.       Having examined many animals, we finally decided that
 the python (Python solurus) afforded the best illustration of the
 occurrence of the first and second sounds of the heart. In the heart
 of that animal, of which 1 present two drawings, copied by permission
 from a preparation in the Hunterian Museum, it will be seen
 that the structures which represent the auriculo-ventricular valves
 are formed by a continuation of the septum of the auricles ; they
 are merely muscular flaps, destitute alike of musculi papillares and
 chordae tendineae, and are without means of producing valvular
 tension. I may here add that in an animal of a totally different
 class, namely, the kangaroo, the sounds were distinctly recognised,
  though the valves, as seen in the second drawing (copied also by
  permission from a specimen in the Hunterian Museum), are very
  rudimentary in character.
      Objections will no doubt suggest themselves to the view above
  expressed.      For example, the clinical physician will say, " am in
                                                                     I
  the daily habit of hearing a distinct murmur accompanying the
  systole in cases of diseased heart, and apparently replacing the first
  sound.     On examining the heart after death I find the auriculo-
  ventricular valves diseased, a condition with which I therefore connect
  the murmur."        It will at once be seen that we have here to deal with
  morbid sounds totally different in character, and totally different
   in the seat and mode of production, from the first sound of the

334            Sir R. Quain.        On  the  Mechanism by ichich
heart.      To make the explanation more simple, I will confine my
observations to two principal forms of mitral disease associated with
systolic murmur, namely, first, imperfection in structure with
distinct    regurgitation,     and, secondly, induration, roughness, and
irregularities  on  the  mitral    valve.
    (o) In mitral regurgitation consequent on disease affecting the
margins of the valves, the auriculo- ventricular orifice remains im
perfectly closed ; and when systole of the ventricle takes place, a
portion of the blood is driven backwards towards the auricle, the
remaining portion being sent forwards in its normal course towards
the orifice of the aorta. The murmur which is produced by the retro
grade flow of blood, permitted by the diseased valve, is beard at the
apex of the heart ; but at the same time the healthy first sound may
almost always be recognised at the base of the heart, over the aortic
valves.
    (6) In a second form of disease of the mitral valve, there may be
 roughness, induration, or other irregularities from the presence of
 deposits on the external surface of the laminae which meet the cur
 rent of blood going towards the aorta and flowing parallel with the
 surface of the valves.        A murmur is there produced audible at the
 apex, bnt also accompanying the current of blood towards the base,
 where it can be heard, often masking by its loudness the first sound.
 It is quite remarkable how slight the roughness or irregularity may
 be on the lamina* of the valves which produces a loud and definite
 murmur.      These murmurs, striking and characteristic as they are,
 are merely accidental complications which occur at the moment of
 the systole of the heart ; but they are unconnected with, and have
 no relation except in point of time to, the healthy first sound, which
 may be heard apart from, and independently of, them.
     The weight of evidence, then, is clearly against the possibility of
 the structure or the functions of the auriculo- ventricular valves being
  the source from whence proceeds the first sound of the heart.
     Two other phenomena occur synchronously with the systole of the
  heart, ' and consequently with the occurrence of the first sound.
  They are — (a) the contraction of the muscular walls of the ventricles,
  and (6) the propulsion and movement of the blood from the ventricles
  into the arteries.     I   shall first consider the supposed share which
  muscular contraction has in the formation of the sound.
  B. The muscular contraction of the walls of the heart during     systole is
                 not the source of the first sound of the heart.
     The sound produced by muscle during its contraction was first
  described by Dr. Wollastou.* He compared it to "a sound which
                        *  '
                             Philosophical Transactions,' 1810.

                  the  First Sound of       the  Heart is produced.            335
resembles      most nearly that of carriages at a very great distance
passing rapidly over a roagh pavement." * It is very difficult to
conceive the slight, soft, rolling sound produced by muscle in action
being convertible into the loud, booming first sound of the heart.
Yet the theory is accepted. If muscle during contraction could pro
duce so marked a sound, we should expect to find that the powerful
muscles of the neck attached to the base of the skull and those
attached to the jaw (being through the bones of the skull in direct
relation with the hearing apparatus) would give us some striking
evidence of the production of muscular sounds when they are thrown
into strong action. It is reasonable, too, to believe that such muscu
lar sounds must occur and be heard, if they exist, during the move
ments of the athlete or the boxer as well as during the performances
of the danseuse. But there is nothing of the kind.                 I have failed to
hear such sounds when listening to the powerful contraction of the
biceps, or on listening to the contraction of the shoulder muscles of
a strong cart-horse struggling with a heavy load in ascending a hill.
I could hear no other sound save the soft, rolling sound described by
 Dr. Wollaston.        Still many observers have argued that the contrac
tion of the walls of the heart differs from the action of the skeletal
muscles, and that it is this peculiar form of contraction which causes
the first sound.       They have adduced so many observations in favour
of this doctrine that it will be necessary to examine them.                    But
before doing so, for the sake of making my argument more clear,                   I
desire to point out that there is another event which occurs simul
taneously with the systole of the ventricle.             This is the propulsion of
the blood from the ventricles and its impact against the column of
blood resting on the semi-lunar valves.
    With a view to showing how large a share the sound of muscular
contraction has in producing the first sound, observers have cut off
altogether the supply of blood from the cavities, and on listening
during the contraction of the heart have heard a systolic sound.
Such were the old experiments of Ludwig and Dogiel, represented
as confirmed by Krehlf and by Kasem-Beck.J
    The conclusions which have been drawn from these experiments
are disproved by those conducted by my friend Professor Halford,
and described in his essay on " The Action and Sounds of the
Heart," published by Churchill (1860). He writes: "Large dogs
   * It is interesting to note that Dr. Wollaston, in examining the sound produced
by the muscles of his leg, made use of a wooden rod to convey the sound to hia
 ear. He may be thus said, in a measure, to have anticipated the principle of
mediate auscultation discovered by Laennec in 1816.        The muscular sound which
we now recognise is that accurately described by Wollaston.

336           Sir R. Quain.         On the Mechanism by which
.were obtained, and, as      in my preceding experiments, the heart was
exposed,   and   the circulation       kept up by artificial respiration.   A
stethoscope being applied to the organ, sounds were distinctly heard.
The superior and inferior ven» cavse were now compressed with a
bull-dog forceps, and the pulmonary veins by the finger and thumb ;
the heart continuing its action, a stethoscope was again applied, and
neither first nor second sound was heard. After a short space of
time, the veins were allowed to pour their contents into both sides of
the heart, and both sounds were instantly reproduced.            On the veins
being again pressed, all sound was extinguished, notwithstanding
that the heart contracted vigorously.             Blood was again let in, and
both sounds restored.           I have thus frequently interrogated the
                                                                            "
same heart for upwards of an hour, and always with the like result
(p. 25).
    These experiments of Professor Halford must be accepted as suffi
cient to refute the view of the German observers just quoted.
Another source of fallacy in making experiments of this kind<s that
a very slight stroke of the muscle or ventricle against the end of the
stethoscope is sufficient to produce a very loud and distinct sound,
resembling the first sound.         If the palm of the hand, for instance, be
pressed gently    over  the    ear,  and the back of the hand be touched by
a finger of the opposite hand, it will be felt how slight a stroke is
sufficient to produce a very distinct sound. Observers (Ludwig and
 Dogiel) have recognised the difficulty of isolating muscle from the
instrument conveying the sound, and they have placed the empty heart,
still contracting, in a jar containing defibrinised blood or warm water,
 from the side of which a neck is projected, covered by a thin layer
of india-rubber.     At eaoh contraction of the heart a distinct
sound, resembling the first sound of the heart, was heard.                But
 the flapping of the heart against the water was quite sufficient to
produce the sound which was conveyed to the ear ; aod I cannot see
 in such an experiment sufficient evidence of the sound of muscular
contraction being the cause of the first sound of the heart.
    Experiments of another kind have been employed to show that the
-contraction of the muscle is a source of the sound. Hurthle* and
 Einthovenf show graphically that the first sound begins with the
 very beginning of the systole, before the ventricle has got power
"to open the valves." This observation is entirely consistent with
the view   I am about to propose. The moment the ventricle begins to
 contract, the impact of the blood against the semi- lunar valves com
 mences, producing the commencement of the sound, not when the
 valves are thrown open. The valves being connected with the fibroid

                the First Sound of   the Heart is produced.          337
 ring surrounding the base of the heart, with which also the muscular
 walls are continuous, the sounds are conducted to the apex.
    Pathology confirms this view. It was observed by Dr. Stokes that
 in the course of typhus fever the first sound of the heart gradually
 disappears. After death it is found that the walls of the heart are
 softened ; and this morbid state has been accepted as a proof that
 muscular contraction is the cause of the first sound.           The real
 explanation is that the impulse of the heart is so feeble that it is
 unable to produce the sound at the valves. The correctuess of this
 view is confirmed by the fact, recorded by Dr. Stokes, that the last
 point at which the sound disappears is over these valves, and that it
 is at the same point that the returning sound is first heard.
    With the object in view of further investigating this subject, I
 requested my friend, Dr. Alexander Morison, to study the heart of a
 turtle recently killed by holding it close to the ear as one holds a
 watch when testing for deafness, and also by pressing it gently
 against the ear. With this intention, I gave him an introduction to
                                             "
 the proprietors of the " Ship and Turtle      tavern, where he had the
 fullest opportunity of carrying oat the investigation.
    Dr. Morison writes to me : — " An opportunity was afforded me of
 examining the hearts of two large turtles immediately after they
 were killed.   The heart removed from the body was easily provoked
 into active contraction by a gentle tap with the finger, the contrac
 tion being sufficient to expel blood from the cardiac cavity.        On
 placing the ear close to the heart whilst   thus  contracting, no sound
 could be heard ; on placing the ear lightly on the heart whilst con
 tracting, no sound could be heard. So far, therefore, as a turtle's
heart is concerned — no other that I know of has more vigour of
contraction after removal from the body — muscular contraction, as a
cause of cardiac sound, must be excluded."
    These facts and observations are, in my opinion, sufficient to prove
that the contractile action of the muscles of the heart is not capable
of producing the first sound of the heart.
    Having thus endeavoured to show that the cause of the first sound
is independent alike of auriculo-ventricular     action and of muscular
contraction of the walls of the heart, I proceed to consider a third
event, the most striking and important of all those which occur during
the systole of the heart, that is, the propulsion of the blood contained
in the ventricles into the pulmonary artery and the aorta, and
herein to indicate what seems to me to be the agency by which the
sound is produced.

338            Sir R. Quain.       On the Mechanism by ichich
C. The.   first sound of   the  heart   is caused  by the   impact   of the  blood
    driven  by the action  of the muscular walls of       the  ventricles against
    the block produced    by the  columns   of blood in the pulmonary artery
    and aorta which press upon the semi-lunar valves.
    I would adopt the explanation suggested by my valued friend, the
late Dr. C. J. B. Williams, that " sound is a phenomenon resulting
from resisted motion."         We hear it in the whistling of the wind in
the rigging of a ship ; we hear it when the waves break upon the
shore ; we hear it when the blacksmith strikes the anvil with his
sledgehammer ; we hear it in the gentle sounds of the iEolian
harp, and in the whispers emitted by the vocal chords when the air
passes over them from the trachea.           Let us examine the condition of
the circulation with regard to this particular point, namely, resisted
motion.
    In this inquiry I have derived most important assistance from the
admirable and elaborate researches of Professor Bell Pettigrew, F.R.S.,
first, on " The Arrangement of the Muscular Fibres in the Ventricles
of the Vertebrate Heart," published in the ' Philosophical Transac
        '
tions of the Royal Society, 1864, and, secondly, on "The Relations,
 Structure, and Functions of the Valves of the Vascular System,"
                     '                '
published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
1864. These refer especially to the left ventricle, but, at the same time,
it is to be observed that what applies to this ventricle applies, only in
a lesser degree, to the right ventricle.          Dr. Pettigrew explains the
manner in which the column of blood, projected from the heart into the
aorta, is formed by the union of three columns, an arrangement which
results from the mechanism of the heart as fully described by him.
These columns ultimately unite into one before reaching the orifice
of the aorta.     The columns have a spiral motion, which is the result
of the spiral arrangement of the musculi papillares, of the spiral
arrangement of the fibres composing the walls of the ventricle, as
well as of the spiral shape of the left ventricular cavity itself.          These
points, illustrating the character of the flow of the current, are
shown in the blood-cast from the interior of the left ventricle of a
horse which, by permission of the President of the Royal College of
Surgeons, I am able to submit to your examination.
    By this spiial, or what might be called "rifle,'' motion, the
blood is seen to be directed against the segments of the semi-lunar
valves, which are thereby hastily thrown apart, the spiral current
being continued for some distance within the aorta. The beautiful
rifle mechanism here described is constructed with the definite objects
of giving precision to the direction of the moving body against a
given point, and of securing greater velocity and force in that body —
the moving column of blood.             We have, in fact, here represented in

                    the   Firzt *So>mrf  of the Heart is i>roduced.                 339
nature — a matter of the deepest interest to the biologist — the
mechanism of the comparatively modern rifle.
    The resistance to the stream of blood issuing from the ventricle is
offered by the block formed by the column of blood resting on the
aortic valves. These in their action are described by Dr. Pettigrew
as " closed by a spiral movement, by which these valves are wedged,
and, as it were, screwed, more and more tightly into each other";
the movement here — the spiral movement— being caused by " the
direction of the sinuses of Valsalva, which curve towards each other
and direct the blood in spiral waves upon the mesial line of each
segment."*
   We find that various estimates have been given of the absolute pro
pelling power of the ventricles and of the resistance of the column
in the pulmonary artery and in the aorta respectively.                 For example,
Professor Michael Foster says : — " If we take 180 grams as the
quantity in man ejected at each stroke at a pressure of 321 metres
of blood, this means that the left ventricle is capable at its systole of
lifting 180 grams 3-21 metres high, i.e., it does 578 gram-metres of
work at each beat." t
   Different estimates of the propelling force are given by physio
logists, and the estimates of the resistance vary more even than the
estimates of the propelling power.              It will therefore suffice to say
that authorities are substantially agreed that the driving power and
the resistance are in the proportion of 4 to 3, the really important
point for our present purpose being the relation they bear to each
other.
    In the motion thus described and the resistance we have all the
elements for the production of a sound ; and a sound being produced,
we ask what it is.           The reply must be : the first sound of the heart,
the cause of which we now seek.
   If it be admitted that sound is a result of resisted motion, we have
in this instance a remarkable illustration of movement and resistance.
The movement of the blood with all the force, precision, and velocity
of a rifle or spiral movement, is directed against a fixed and definite
resistance, the moving power and the resistance being capable of
definite measurement and found to be quite sufficient themselves to
explain the source of the sound of which we are in search.                        This

340           Sir R. Quain.    On the Mechanism by which
explanation was first suggested to my mind many years ago by the
occurrence of a case of disease in which the aortic valves, being
completely broken down by disease, became inadequate to their
function.    A murmur of such intensity was produced that it was
audible at 2 or 3 inches from the wall of the chest without any
intermediate communicating body.         With a view to determine how
far this murmur might be conducted along the course of the cir
culation, I examined the femoral artery.            There I found that
the murmur was not conveyed to the ear, bnt a sound precisely
resembling the first sound was heard, a sound caused by the pressure
of the stethoscope resisting the motion of the blood in the artery,
which, the valves being destroyed, thus received the full force of the
ventricular contraction.    My attention was thereby directed to the
obstruction offered by the aortic valves in health to the blood in
leaving the ventricle.   I felt the case to be so interesting that  I sub
mitted it to a meeting of the Harveian Society ; and my observation
is recorded iu the Minutes of the meeting April, 1852.
    From that time to the present I have taken every opportunity of
investigating the subject.      Observations have been made on the
course of the circulation in the femoral artery under like circum
 stances by Durozioz, Moulie, von Bamberger, and others.             These
observations, however, have had reference more especially to the
 diagnosis of disease of the aortic valves, and I mention them here
only as indicative of interesting investigations having been made on
 the femoral artery in cases of diseased aortic valves.      The observers
named make no special reference       to the first sound  of  the heart in
 health.
    Objections may be offered to the explanation of the first sound of
 the heart here brought forward, founded on the fact that this sound
 is heard more distinctly at the apex of the organ, a point removed
 from the seat of the valves. The observation is perfectly correct, but
 the explanation is simple.    The muscular walls of the heart are con
 nected, as above described, with the fibroid ring which is intimately
 associated with the semi-lunar valves.     The sound produced at these
 valves is communicated to the apex of the heart through the fibroid
 ring and the muscular walls, which at the moment of systole axe
 tense and firm.    The sound thus conducted reaches that portion of
 the heart which is uncovered, and which is in contact with the walls
 of the chest. But, on the other hand, when opportunity offers it has
 been found that the sound in question is heard over the aortic valves
 more distinctly than in any other situation.      A remarkable case of
 this kind has been related by M. Cruveilhier, who was invited to see an
 infant just born presenting a complete case of ectopia of the heart.
 He says, " On examining the heart thus exposed, both sounds were

                the First Sound of the Heart is produced.                341
distinctly heard over the base, and not at the apex." He remarks,
"We must not forget that one element of the sound, that produced
by the shock of the heart against the chest-wall, is absent.''*
   Another point of interest is that which has already been alluded
to in the case of typhus fever, as described           by Dr. Stokes, namely,
that the sound disappears last over the semi-lunar valves, nud also
that the returning sound is first heard in the same situation.
   It is also an object of great interest to compare the characters of
the two sounds in relation to the seat of their origin at the semi
lunar valves. In the first sound we have the character of propulsive
force and sustained action, softer and more prolonged than the
second sound, which is sudden, sharp, and short, as if produced by
an abrupt mechanical disturbance.             These distinctions, which may
be readily recognised in various degrees              by careful observation,
serve to conviuce us that the sounds are both produced at the same
point : at the semi-lunar valves, each by its own single and simple
agency.
D.   Lastly, sounds resembling the first (and second) sound of the heart
    can be produced artificially in accordance with the view contained
    in the preceding  communication.
   The experiment is thus made : a sheep's heart of good size (or
that of a calf) may be used.         It must be carefully cleared from peri
cardium, leaving the large vessels and pulmonary veins as far as
possible intact. The orifices of the pulmonary veins must be laid
into one, so as to permit a sufficient opening into the left auricle
through which to divide the attachments of the mitral cusps and the
musculi papillares in the left ventricle, taking care in doing this
not to injure the aortic segments when detaching the cusp that lies
next them.      The coronary artery must next be ligatured, and also
the innominate artery where it springs from the aortic arch. The
right auricle and ventricle should be removed.           Through the opening
made by laying into one the orifices of the pulmonary veins a bone
nozzle should be passed.          It is well also to ligature the auricular
appendix and any points from which water may issue when the
ventricle is filled. To the posterior orifice of the nozzle rubber
tubing shonld be attached, communicating with a source of water
supply, placed on a higher level ; and another portion of rigid gutta
percha tubing, about 3 feet long, should be introduced into the aorta
(see diagram, fig. 1).        If now the ventricle be filled with water by
means    of the  tube  in   the  left auricle, the water will of course pass
into the ventricle and thence up the aorta, a portion of the water
resting upon and closing the aortic sigmoid valves.

systolic contraction, and allowed to relax in imitation of diastolic
relaxation, a sound closely resembling the first sound of the heart
will be produced when water is propelled from the ventricle into the
aorta, and another closely resembling the second sound when pro
pulsive movement ceases, and the sigmoid valves again close under the
superincumbent weight of water in the aortic tubing.                        As the fluid

rises in the gutta-percha tube, the pressure on the valves increases,
and the sound becomes more marked ; when the fluid on the other
hand diminishes, the sounds become less distinct.            If the heart be
placed     horizontally,  the sounds become   wobbly.    The   terminal piece
of small diameter of a binaural stethoscope gently placed over the
aorta at its commencement is most suitable for observing the cardiac
sounds in this experiment.
    The experiment here described, when first suggested by me, was
submitted, with the assistance of Dr. Sibbald, to my lamented friend
the late Dr. Sharpey, and to Sir James Paget, who were quite satisfied
that with the increase or diminntion of the column the sounds closely
resembled those of the heart in man, and that they became more or
less distinct in proportion to the quantity of fluid contained in the
tube.
    In conclusion,    I  may say that I was moved to undertake and con
tinue this inquiry by a desire to obtain a solution of what seemed to
be an insoluble problem, and also by a belief that a correct explana
tion of the cause of the first sound of the heart would be of practical
value in the study of the clinical phenomena of diseases of this
organ.
    I  would wish further to add that the explanation of the cause of
the     first sound of the heart given in this communication, being so
different from that hitherto accepted, may seem calculated to create
 difficulties in the diagnosis of valvular diseases of the heart. Closer
 consideration will show, however, this not to be the case, but that,
 like all accurate knowledge, it will be found to simplify, and not to
 confuse.       It will afford an explanation of the relations of certain
 morbid phenomena which are at present unintelligible, such, for
example, as that a systolic murmur may be heard at the apex whilst
the first sound is audible at the base free from murmur; and it will
 serve to encourage a closer study of the relation between muscular
contraction of the walls of the heart and the tension of the vessels of
 the system.

     1.   The following numerical data were calculated in the hope of

  parative correlation in the case of civilised and uncivilised races, and
  further of determining, if possible, any general law connecting rela
  tive sexual variation and relative sexual con-elation with the degree
  of civilisation, and so with what is probably inversely proportional
  to the degree of civilisation,             namely, the intensity of natural
  selection.
      The following two principles seem to flow from a study of varia
  tion in the organs of man : — *
      (a) Civilised man is more variable than uncivilised man.
      (6) There is a greater equality of variation for the two sexes in
            uncivilised than in civilised races.          Civilised woman appears,
             on the whole, to be slightly more variable than civilised man.
      Both these principles are in accordance with the intensity of the
  struggle for existence — and the amonnt, consequently, of natural
  selection — being greater for uncivilised than for civilised races, and,
  further, greater for men than for women in the latter races.
     The problem of correlation is, however, of a less simple character.
  While the action of selection can be shown theoretically to reduce
  variation, it by no means follows that it reduces correlation. Indeed,
  selection may increase, decrease, or reverse correlation at the very
  same time as it is reducing variation.t              We have then the following
  problems      to  guide  us in  our  treatment     of actual statistics : —
      (a) Is correlation more intense among civilised than among un
            civilised races ?
      (fc)  How     does the relative correlation of the sexes differ in
            civilised and uncivilised races ?
     (c)   Is  there any marked prepotency of either sex in the matter of
            correlation P
     These are the problems which the present calculations were                      de
 signed, not to definitely solve, but to illustrate.
     2. Unfortunately, measurements on living members of uncivilised
 races are not very numerous,              nor for the purposes of correlation
 generally very satisfactory.           There are numerous measurements of
 skulls    and   some   of bones,  but   the measurements for each individual
 race are, from the mathematical standpoint, but few in number.
 Hence, in the case of each determination of a coefficient of variation
 or a coefficient of correlation, the probable error will be large. It

              Variation in Man and Woman,'        by  K.   Pearson :

Death," vol. 1, pp. 256 — 377, where some      155  cases of human   variation  ior both
sexes are dealt with.
   ,f The theoretical discussion of the relation of selection to correlation forms the
subject of a memoir nearly completed.       Actually there is some evidence to show
higher correlation among the working classes than among the middle and upper
classes of a civilised commuuitv.

        Mathematical     Contributions to the Tlieory       of Evolution,    345
 is thus impossible to lay much stress on any individual relative
difference ; we are bound to consider only the general trend of our
results. In order, however, to make the probable errors as small as
 possible it is desirable in the case of correlation to make the coeffi
cients as large as possible. Now, for measurements on the skull,
 the correlation is small, but, for the long bones, it is large.          Hence,
the latter will give better results for comparative purposes, if the
 series be smaller than the former.              They have accordingly been
sele.cted for the present investigation.             In all cases the standard
deviations, coefficients of variation, and coefficients of correlation
 have been calculated without grouping by means of the formulae given
in a memoir on " Regression, Heredity, and Paumixia."*                      The
standard deviations and coefficients of correlation had their errors
determined by the formulae of the same memoir (pp. 266 and 275) ;
the coefficients of variation have for probable error, if n be the
 number of measurements in the series, and V the coefficient,
                         °-o745Ti[i+2(4r
or sensibly, 0'6745        ,— , since u/100 is of the order O05, for our pre
sent investigations.       It will thus be seen that the probable error of
a coefficient of variation can, like that of a standard deviation,
amount to a considerable percentage of its value if n be small. For
example, if n = 23 (case of the Aino women) it can amount to about
 10 per cent. ; while for n = 50 (case of the French men or women) it
will amount to 6-7 per cent. The probable errors of the standard
deviations will also in the two cases amount to 10 and 6'7 per cent,
respectively.    On the other hand, if n be as small as 23, the pro
bable error of the coefficent of correlation will only be 2'2 per cent,
of its value if r be as large as 0-9, and only 656 per cent, of its
value if r = 0'75.      On the other hand for n = 50 the probable errors
of r for the two cases of r = 0'9 and 0-75 are respectively 1'5 and 4-45
per cent.    It thus appears that if correlation be large, or even fairly
large, it can be determined with far less probable error than varia
tion.   The results for correlation are thus likely in the present ease
to be more significant than those for variation.
   3. As to the material itself the French measurements are taken
from a work by Dr. E. Rollet: ' De la Mensuration des Os longs
des Membres,' published in the
                                             '

taken having passed through the post-mortem room, the sex was
known without question.             The right member was always taken

except in the few cases where its length was not recorded. In these
cases in order not to diminish the already small series, the left
member was taken. Of the two measurements of the femur given
by Rollet the longer was taken.
    The measurements of the Aino bones were taken from a work by
                      '
Koganei in the Mittheilungen aus der Medicinischen Facultat der
K. Japanischen Universitat,' Bd. 2 — Tables, Tokio, 1894 ; and the
same rule observed.             The Japanese returns, while more extended
in the variety of bones measured than the French, yet contain
fewer individuals, and in many respects do not seem to us so
reliable as the latter.*             In both cases the maximum length of
femur, humerus, radius, ulna, fibula, and clavicle (Fi, H, Ri, U, Fib.,
and CI.) were measured.            For the Aino we have in addition to the
lengths (R> and T,) of the radius and tibia from centre to centre,
the length (F>) of head and neck of femur, and the scapular index
 (Sc.) or ratio of breadth to length of scapula. The Aino measure
ments give the maximum length of the tibia (T^ as well as the
length from centre to centre.                The French measurements give the
length of the tibia, excluding the spine and including the malleolus
(Ts). In order that our results might be of service to Mr. E. Warren,
who is dealing at length with the Libyan long bones, the radius
correlations for the Aino were calculated for R> and not for R„ as
they are in the case of the French.                       The results for French and
Aino are not strictly comparable in this case. The same holds for
the measurement of the tibia.                   Probably Rollet's T> measurement
corresponds more closely to Koganei's measurement No. 13 (T,)
than to his No. 14 (T2). Both T, and T, are greater, T, is less than
the fibula in length.
    We have dealt with the Aino T2 instead of Ti, however, for the
 purpose of comparison with the Libyans.
    The following tables give the chief results : —
    * One female humerus                                                          As it would

jected ; it was afterwards found to be described in the text as deformed.           The male
 humerus (No. 31) should be 279 and not 879 cm. long.                The female ulna, No. 4,
 (270 cm.)   has   been  rejected.    It   is out   of all  proportion to the corresponding
 humerus, as judged by      the  whole    range   of humerus     ulna measurements we have
 come   across.    Yet notwithstanding        its  disproportionately    large size, Koganei
 describes it (p. 127) as much bent.         The  male   fibula, No. 19, is excessive as com
 pared with either femur or tibia.       There did not, however, seem sufficient warrant
 for rejecting it. Its being a misprint or mismeasurement would account for the
 low values obtained for the >J Aino correlation             of fibula with femur and tibia.
 Without it the fibula-tibia correlation — 0'9492.

    5. Now the tables illustrate at once how little can be judged for
the problem of variation from any single measurement when the
series are so small, and the measurements do not entirely correspond.
We are forced to argue only from the general trend of the whole
group. On the other hand, with the exception of the clavicle and
scapular index, the probable errors in the correlation are sufficiently
small for fairly good inferences to be drawn.*                    We will deal first
with the general problems with regard to sex, and then with those
bearing on race.
   6. Sexual Ratios. — In all cases the sexual ratio for the mean length
of any bone is greater than unity.           Grouping both French and Aino
together, we have 17 series giving a mean sexual ratio for the long
bones in civilised and uncivilised man of l-088.                    This agrees well
with the value 1'089 determined for a series of rather different
                                                                           '
contents in the paper on 'Variation in Man and Woman                         (loc. cit.,
p. 374)   referred   to   above.    Turning to      sexual    ratio  in variation,     we
find, for French and Aino together, the value 0-976. The value as
   * So far as these relate to the nature of the correlation between individual long
bones, we have placed our results at the disposal of Mr. E. Warren, who is dealing
with the long  bones of the Libyan (?) skeletons.

 determined from about 155 series (loc. cit., p. 373) was 0973 ±
 0'007.     A special study of the long bones thus seems to confirm the
 result previously reached, that woman is, on the whole, slightly more
  variable than man.       Lastly, turning to the sexual ratio in correla
 tion, we find that in 14 out of 22 cases, woman is more highly
  correlated than man, the mean sexual ratio in correlation being 0-992.
  So far, then, as the present results go, they seem to indicate that
 man, while larger, is less variable, and less highly correlated than
 woman.
      When we take, however, race into consideration, there are
 additional factors which somewhat modify these conclusions.         In the
  first place there is, of course, no suggestion that the modern French
 are lineal descendants of the Aino, but it does not seem an improbable
 supposition that the French have at one time passed through a stage
 somewhat similar to that primitive condition in which we now find
 the Aino. Assuming this for the purpose, at any rate, of comparison,
 we find that the transition from the uncivilised to the civilised
 condition is accompanied by well-marked changes in the sexual
 ratios. They are as follows : —
     (i.) Man tends to gain in size on woman.
     (ii.) Woman tends to gain in variability on man.
     (iii.) Woman tends to gain in correlation   on man.
     In other words, primitive    man and woman, are more     nearly equal
-in size, variability, and correlation than highly civilised man and
 woman. Relative to woman, man's gain in size has been accompanied
 by a loss in variability and in the correlation of his parts.    So far as
 size and variability are concerned, these results are in accordance
 with the far wider series of measurements dealt with in the paper on
 '
    Variation in Man and Woman.' The result as to correlation was there
 suggested (loc. cit., p. 375) on very slight evidence.   Before we make
 any suggestion as to the bearing of these results on natural
 selection it will be well to examine the racial ratios.
     7. Racial Ratios. — In means both S and $ French are in every
 measurement larger than 3 and ? Aino, but the difference is greater
 for males than females. In variations the S and ? French have pro
 gressed in nearly all cases on the S and ? Aino (the tibia in the
 male and the ulna in the female are apparently exceptions).           But
 while the females have progressed less rapidly than the males in
 absolute    size, they have progressed more rapidly in variation.
 Lastly, in correlation the French males have more correlation than
 the Aino males in four organs, and less in six organs, the general
 mean result being almost equality of correlation.      On the other hand,
 the French females are only inferior to the Aino in one case, and the
 final result is a very sensible progress in correlation.     The general

         Mathematical      Contributions to the Theory          of Evolution.       355
conclusion would then be that, with increased civilisation, absolnte
size* and variation tend to increase ; while correlation, to judge
by the males, is stationary ; to judge by the females, tends to
increase.
    It will  be   found somewhat difficult to reconcile these results with
any simple applications of the principle of natural selection.                    In the
first place increased variation undoubtedly suggests a lessening of
the straggle for existence, and there can be no question that this
increase has gone on among civilised races (see ' Variation in Man
and Woman').           The lessening of the struggle has probably been
greater    for  woman    than man ; hence the principle of natural selec
tion might help to explain the preponderance of variability in civi
lised woman.         The increase in size with civilisation seems, on the
average, also incontestable.           But is it the effect of lessening the
struggle for existenco ? The possibilities may, perhaps, be summed
up as follows : —
     (a) The civilised races may have survived owing to their superior
size. It may be a result of the struggle in the past. To this must be
objected that the increase of size appears to be a progressive change
still going on, and yet increase of variation should show a lessening
struggle for existence.
     (b) The effect of suspending natural selection may be to increase
size. This would be a blow for paumixia, for we might naturally have
expected a regression to the smallness of the more primitive races.
 It would leave unexplained the apparently smaller progress of women
 as compared with men, for in their case we might argue from the
 variation that the struggle for existence is relatively less than in the
 case   of man.
     (c) The larger size of the civilised races may be due to better food
 supply and better physical training : in short it may be due, not to
 evolution, but to better conditions of growth. This hypothesis does
 not involve the assumption that acquired characters are inherited.
 Diminish the food supply and abolish physical training and the size
 would sink to the level at which natural selection had left it. Physical
 training in civilised races being usually more adequate in the case of
 man than of woman would, perhaps, explain why man has progressed
 more rapidly in size than woman. It seems impossible, taking varia
 tion as a measure of the intensity of selection, to reconcile the rela
 tive increases in size of man and woman with any direct effect of
 natural selection.
    * This is only generally true, not in every individual ease. The Freneh femur
 is longer than that of the Aino, of neolithic man, and of the ancient inhabitants of the
 Canary Islands.     On the other hand, the French femur appears to be slightly less
 than the Libyan, although the humerus is somewhat greater.         The French women
  appear in all long bones less than the Libyan women.

 3b<i      Mathematical      Contributions to the   Theory  of Evolution.
     8.   To sum up, then, the following results seem          suggested   by these
  measurements."
      (i.) Civilised man has progressed        generally on primitive man in
 -size,   variation, and correlation.
      (ii.) This progression can hardly be accounted for by increased
 selection     (because of the increased variation), nor by decreased selec
 tion (because it is inconsistent with the relative changes in male and
 female size).         It might possibly be accounted    for by decreased     selec
 tion and improved physical conditions.
     (iii.) Woman is more variable than man in civilised races.
     (iv.) Woman is more highly correlated than man in civilised
 races.
     (v.) In uncivilised races the sexes are more nearly equal in the
 matter of size, variation, and correlation than in the case of civi
 lised races.
     (vi.) It is impossible to say that civilised woman is nearer to the
 primitive type than civilised man, for while civilised man differs
 more from the primitive type than civilised woman, so far, probably,
 as absolute size is concerned, he has made only about half her
 progress in variation, and hardly any progress at all in corre
 lation.
     (vii.) The causes (e.g., lessening of selection) which tend to increase
variation may also increase correlation. In other words, the intensity
of the struggle for existence is not necessarily a measure of the
intensity of correlation.*
    The measurements made by Mr. Warren on the Libyans, the
results of which he has kindly favoured us with, are, on the whole,
fairly in accordance with the above conclusions. He finds for the
              Mean of the sexual ratio of the means       ....     1'092
                     „        ,,       ,,    the variations .     1'028
                    ,,        „        „     the correlations     1'008
    The corresponding quantities for the French are : 1-109, 0939,
0956, or, we concluded, that in passing from uncivilised to civilised
peoples, from Libyan to French, the men gain on the women in size-
here very slightly, and the women gain upon the men very markedly
in variation and correlation.
    These results are merely suggestions, but they may possibly serve
to emphasise the importance of a careful measurement of the long
bones of, say, 100 members of both sexes for a series of civilised and
uncivilised races. In the former case at least there does not appear to
be any real difficulty, except the need of co-operation, in obtaining
   * The mathematical theory of selective correlation shows that the close selection
of an organ, say the femur, may actually tend to reduce the correlation between
two other organs, say the humerus and the radius.

       Colony. Communicated by Sir James Crichton Browne,

   In  the  following pages it is proposed to communicate to the Royal
Society    the results of experiments made in South Africa on the
infectivity of the blood of animals affected with Rinderpest.           The
experiments      were all made  on  cattle kept under  conditions  in which
accidental spontaneous infection could with certainty be excluded.
These experiments had been concluded in 1896, before the arrival of
Dr. R. Koch in South Africa, and their results had been communi
cated to him on his arrival.
   1. The blood of an animal ill with rinderpest, when taken during
the febrile stage or previous to death, and injected subcutaneously or
intravenously into healthy cattle, produces the typical disease —
rinderpest, provided the blood is prevented from coagulating.
   2. The onset of coagulation and actual coagulation of the blood
exert a marked destructive influence on the virulence of such blood.
   3. The best method of obtaining virulent blood is to draw it asep-
tically from the jugular vein of an animal ill with rinderpest, and
to mix it immediately with a 1 per cent, solution of citrate of potash,
the latter previously well sterilised, in the proportion of 2 — 3 parts
of blood to 1 part of citrate of potash solution.       Such blood, as has
been shown, remains fluid.
   4. This citrate of potash mixture of blood proves virulent in the
first few days, generally not exceeding six days ; after six days'
keeping the virulence becomes rapidly weakened, so that after nine
days the blood mixture is altogether inert.
    5. Admixture of glycerine to citrate blood does not cceteris paribus
interfere with the virulence of such blood. Glycerine added to fresh
 blood does interfere with the virulence of the latter on account of
the coagulation of the blood.
    6. The nasal mucus of an infected animal when used fresh and
 rubbed into the nostrils of normal cattle, produced in all instances typi
 cal rinderpest.     We have never had a single failure in attempting to
 produce the disease by this means.         By keeping the nasal mncus,
even for a few hours, its virulence becomes markedly less.

   7. The condition of marked swelling of the lymphatic glands is
one of, if not indeed the most evident pathognomic feature of the
disease.   The contagium exists as a primary infection in the lym
phatic glands.
   8. A very mild attack of rinderpest, such as is produced by injection
of blood of greatly decreased virulence, does not convey absolute
immunity, this latter being produced in proportion to the severity of
the attack through which the animal had passed primarily.     An aniit al
seemingly affected may have a relapse of the disease, which may >^o on
to fatal issue or be mild in type, lending to recovery. Animals in
the latter case always acquire immunity of a high degree.

    The death of Dr. George Harley, F.R.S. (on October 27, 1896),
 has removed in the midst of active labour a distinguished physician,
 a true lover of science, a devoted husband and father, and, to the
 writer of the present biography, an old and valued friend.
    The subject of this notice was born at Haddington, on February 12,
 1829, and came from a race of famed ecclesiastical and literary men.
 The Harleys of Haddington played an important part in the old
 Roman Catholic times, the Rev. Dr. John Harley, of Magdalen
 College, Oxford, becoming, in 1553, the first Protestant Bishop of
 Hereford, and his cousin, the Rev. William Harley, the first legally
inducted Protestant clergyman in Scotland ; both were pupils and
 friends of John Knox. After this time the Harleys of Haddington
took to the law, and for a number of generations were lawyers of
considerable local repute.     George Harley's grandfather, Patrick
 Harley, born in 1717, was a lawyer, though better known locally as
 a poet and antiquarian.    His father, born in 1766, lived as a country
 gentleman,   at Haddington,    but died when George was only three
years old, leaving his education to his mother, who was a very
 talented woman, and her son inherited her abilities and originality.
    George Harley was educated at the Haddington Burgh Schools,
and at the age of 17 matriculated ae a medical student at the
University of Edinburgh.
    While at Edinburgh Harley bad every opportunity of acquiring
the rudimentary knowledge of his profession, of which he duly
availed himself. The Ediubnrgh University was then distinguished
as a school of medicine by an uurivalled staff of Professors.      John
Goodsir was not only an accomplished human anatomist, but also
learned in comparative anatomy, on which he frequently lectured,
and the writer of this notice, who attended his lectures, together
with George Harley, can testify to Goodsir's brilliant and fasci
nating delivery.    Rather narrow-chested, thin, tali, and with intel
lectual features, Goodsir, speaking in a broad Scotch accent, would
hold a large class in breathless interest on the history of the Medusae,
a subject on which he delighted to lecture.        Allen Thomson lec
tured on physiology, in which he excelled.     The microscope was not,
however, at that time so intimately connected with the study of
physiology as it was destined to become under Hughes Bennett,
who succeeded Allen Thomson.         In materia medica Dr. Christison,
afterwards Sir Robert Christison, lectured to a large class, capti
vating students by his extensive knowledge of the subject he dealt
with, and by his flowing and easy delivery. George Harley's eldest
daughter afterwards married the nephew of Sir Robert Christison.
In the Botanical Gardens, in spring and summer, Balfour would
meet his class three or four times a week, and address his students
with the impression that everybody ought to be a botanist, and

                                     VI
 that a love of botany should be innate in every one of his
 audience.     Alison, brother of the distinguished historian, was
 Professor of Medicine, a fine, rather stout and imposing gentleman,
 kindness itself to all the students, and painstaking        in hospital
 work.    It was reserved, however, to Hughes Bennett to introduce
 into clinical teaching the admirable method of examining patients
 which came into general use in the infirmary, and found its way
 by degrees into private practice.      The chair of pathology was held
 by Dr. Henderson, while Dr. W. Gairdner, of Glasgow, perhaps
the last of the survivors of the Edinburgh lecturers towards the end
of the forties, held an extra-academical class of pathology, and
delivered a set of well prepared and interesting lectures. In surgery
Professor Symes and Professor Miller occupied the highest positions,
 Symes as an admirable operator, and Miller as an excellent lecturer,
while Dr. James Simpson (afterwards Sir James) addressed several
times a week a crowded audience on midwifery and gyneecology,
subjects which particularly attracted George Harley's attention, as
we find him acting as house surgeon to the Maternity Hospital ; and
it was through Sir James Simpson that Harley obtained his first
appointment in London.
    Such were the eminent professors under whose tuition George
Harley acquired his earliest professional knowledge. Bat this was
not all : the society at Edinburgh into which Harley and other
students of medicine were admitted with true Scotch hospitality,
contributed in no little degree to the development of his social
and intellectual powers. Lord Jeffrey, the distinguished author
of " Essays and Reviews," and other Judges, such as Lord Murray,
 Lord Ivory, and Lord Fullerton extended a friendly hand to many
of the medical students, and asked them to dinner and evening
parties.
    While at Edinburgh, Harley became acquainted and made friends
with many students, who were destined to become distinguished
in after-life.    Most of them have now departed from this world,
amongst    whom    I might recall the names of Dr. Charles Murchison,
who died at an early age — had he lived, he would undoubtedly have
ranked amongst the most distinguished physicians of the time — and
Dr. Spencer Cobbold, F.R.S., well known for his labours on Entozoa.
   George Harley graduated at Edinburgh in 1850, at the same time
as the writer of this notice, and was duly capped before a large
audience.     There were that year about 80 students who obtained
their doctor's degree, while at the present time more than twice that
number are yearly added to the roll of the Edinburgh graduates.
   Before dismissing George Harley's career as a student, an indica
tion of his promptitude and determination of character may be
gathered from the circumstance that while acting as House Surgeon

                                  Vll
to  the   Royal Maternity Hospital, he successfully performed the
Cesarean section on a woman who had just died, and extracted a
living child, now grown up to be a- father of a family. The case was
read by Professor Simpson, at the Modico-Chirurgical Society of
Edinburgh, and published in the ' Edinburgh Journal of Medical
Science ' for July, 1850.
   After graduating, Dr. George Harley went to Paris, and there
began his scientific studies.  He entered the laboratory of Messrs.
Wurtz and Verdeil, Rue Garanciere, and for a winter worked there,
together with the author of the present notice.   This laboratory had
been opened by Professor Ad. Wurtz, the distinguished chemist. He
had rented a spacious apartment on the ground floor of a house, Rue
Garanciere, and at great expense and no little trouble, had turned it
into a chemical laboratory, most complete in its fittings, where he
was then joined by two other chemists, Dr. Verdeil, a Swiss gentle
man, and Monsieur Charles Dollfus Galline, who was part owner of
large dyeing works in Alsace, and had made a special study of the
chemistry of colouring matters.      Wurtz taught chemistry proper,
Verdeil chemistry applied to physiology and pathology, and Dollfus
chemistry in its application to technology.
   The building enclosed a spacious courtyard, and on the r.ide
opposite to the laboratory,      Charles Robin, who, with Claude
Bernard and Majendie, was at the head of physiological science
in France, opened a laboratory of experimental physiology, where
a few Englishmen      obtained instruction which in some instances
matured into high distinction.
   George Harley worked under Verdeil, and they soon became friends.
Here he prepared all the constituents of the human body which can
be obtained in the crystalline form, such as creatine, creatinine,
sarco-lactates, urea, uric acid, hippuric acid, sodium taurocholate
and glycocholate, fatty acids, &c. ; he analysed biliary and vesical
calculi, and indeed went through a complete course of physiological
chemistry, but at that time he was mostly interested with the com
position of urine.
   That there was great activity in the Laboratory Rue Garanciere
may be gathered from the circumstance that one of the students
wishing to prepare creatine on a large scale, purchased an old horse,
and walked the poor dilapidated beast into the laboratory, and it was
shot then and there. What little flesh there was on it was cut off as
quickly as possible, and submitted to the various operations required
for the preparation of creatine ; but little of the substance, how
ever, was obtained.
   Shortly after the author of this notice had left Paris he received
from Harley a letter, which contained the following passage (the
letter is dated 46, Rue Vaugirard, Paris, 26th Juno, 1852) : —

                                         vm
        " I am still working away at Verdeil's ; he is at present making
     observations on the fats of the blood and fffices while I am working
     at urine.   I have made a most important discovery, namely : that
     the colouring matter of the urine is hrematin, which appears to
     have all the properties of that in the blood, and I have clearly shown
    the presence of iron combined with the colouring matter, and
     seemingly in the same manner as it is combined in the blood.              I
    have found this substance in the urine of many pigs, horses, cows,
    &c., and can get it by three or four different processes."
        Harley was in Paris at the time of the Coup d'Etat provoked by
    Louis Napoleon.         The writer of this notice sallied forth on the
    morning of that memorable day with George Harley and E. Risler, a
    gentleman also at work in the Rue Garanciere, and who subsequently
                                                      " Directeur
    rose to a high position in France ; he is now                  de l'lnstitut
                    " in Paris. Paris was in a state of
    Agronomique                                            feverish excitement,
    the   Place  du  Carrousel   was  so crowded   that  it was impossible to
    walk across it, when suddenly a lane opened in the crowd, and
    Louis Napoleon appeared on horseback, walking leisurely at the
    head of his staff.     Thus it was that he rode round Paris, and the
    courage he exhibited won the day for him. Along the boulevards the
   cavalry was drawn up apparently from the Madeleine to the Bastille,
    and there was firing on the people.       After the firing had ceased the
    party, which    had    been joined by  Verdeil,  thought of visiting the
    Boulevards.     At the corner of the Rue Vivienne they came across
   a dead body on the pavement ; a little further on there were two
   more ; then a poor man who had been killed still grasping with his
   contracted fingers a coloured handkerchief, containing apparently
   clothes for the wash.        The cavalry looked ominously threatening,
   drawn up on the opposite side of the street ; one of them riding up
   enquired the object of the party on the boulevard, and then enjoined
   it to leave as soon as possible, as orders had been given to fire on
   anybody walking about the street.          Of course his injunction was
   strictly complied    with.
       Harley 's next paper after the publication of that on the presence
                                         " Recherches sur la
  of iron in the blood, was entitled                             physiologie du
  Diabete — nouvelle methode pour produire artificiellement le diabete
                            Compt. Rend. Soc. Biol.,' 1853. In this year he
                         '
  sur les animaux,"
  was elected President of the Parisian Medical Society.
       While in Paris Harley worked also under Majendie and Claude
  Bernard.       Majendie was then giving up work, after having earned a
  deservedly great reputation, and was succeeded at the College de
  France by Claude Bernard, who delivered an admirable course of
  lectures on physiology which was attended by many English visitors
  and by     Harley amongst others.
       After two years' residence in Paris, Harley went to Germany, and
\

 studied   at the universities   of Wurzburg,    Berlin,  Vienna,    and
  Heidelberg.   A paper  he published in German obtained    for him the
 corresponding   membership of the Physico-medical       Society of the
 Wurzburg University.
    He returned to London at the end of 1855, and through the
 influence of Professor Sharpey, obtained the post of Curator to the
 Anatomical    Museum of University College.         In 1859 he was
 appointed to the Professorship of Medical Jurisprudence, and not
 long afterwards joined the Medical Staff of University College
 Hospital.
     George Harley married, in 1861, Emma Jessie, the youngest
 daughtei' of James Muspratt, of Seaforth Hall, Liverpool.        Among
 his children are Ethel, now Mrs. A. Tweedie, the known writer, and
 Dr. Vaughan Harley who, following in his father's footsteps, is now
 Professor of Pathological Chemistry at University College.
    In 1861 Harley received the triennial prize of the Royal College
 of Surgeons for an Essay on the Anatomy and Physiology of the
 Supra-Renal Bodies, and the College also granted him the John
 Hunter Gold Medal, of which there has only been one awarded
 since 1858. In 1864 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College
of Physicians of London, and in the year following, a Fellow of the
 Royal Society, having previously been made a Corresponding Member
of the Academy of Science of Bavaria, and of the Academy of Medicine
of Madrid.
    Harley's career was nearly cut short in 1864, while working with
a powerfully illuminated small-lens microscope, when a blood-vessel
burst in his left eye, ending in retinitis, which was so severe that
he was confined to complete darkness for a period of nine months,
ending, however, in a perfect cure.       He had to wear dark-tinted
glasses for a considerable time before he could use his sight freely,
and remarked to the writer of this notice, that while wearing
" goggl68/' as ne could not see well, he became accustomed to look
at things more carefully than he had done before, and that when
subsequently he dropped his glasses, could actually see better than
before, as from training he had improved his powers of observation.
Other men under similar circumstances would probably have
retired into a quiet private life, but the fact that Harley had suffi
cient self-possession to accept a complete privation of light for nine
months shows the clogged resolution and perseverance which was,
perhaps, the main trait of his character, and carried him through
so much good and useful work.
    Harley loved to roam over a variety of subjects ; he would ponder
over any matter of interest to him and then record his ideas in
print.
    Claude   Bernard's lectures,  which  dealt with the    physiological
   vol. lxi.                                                    d

action of poisons, and the functions of the liver, were apparently the
origin of Harley's scientific bent of mind, and we find him early in
bis career investigating the action of " atropine " in dilating the
pupil, of strychnine on the spinal cord, and of the " Calabar bean."
Then he took to the special study of the liver, and in 1883 wrote
his elaborate treatise on diseases of the liver, a book which was very
favourably received and had a great circulation, being translated
into several languages. He communicated many papers to the Royal
Society — one of them even as early as 1856-7, and in 1865 was the
author of a paper in the ' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
         ' "
Society      On the Influence of Physical agents on the Blood, with
Special Reference to the Mutual Action of the Blood on the Respira
tory Gases."     He also wrote in the ' Transactions ' of the Micro
                                                              '
scopical, Zoological, and Anthropological Societies, in the Comptes
Rendus de l'Academie,' and was the author of a number of contribu
tions to the medical papers.       It would be too long to give an
enumeration of all George Harley's writings scientific and medical ;
he was never at rest ; and when he died he must have felt conscious
that he had done his duty and completed his work.

                            Coutagium of Rinderpest.         Preliminary
       Communication."        By ALEXANDER Edington,                M.B.,
       F.R.S.E., Director Colonial Bacteriological Institute, Cape
       Colony. Communicated by Sir James Crichton Browne,
       M.D., LL.D., F.R.S. Received xWarch 22,— Read June 3,
       1897.
    In the following pages it is proposed to communicate to the Royal
 Society the results of experiments made in South Africa on the
 infectivity of the blood of animals affected with Rinderpest.        The
 experiments    were all made on  cattle kept  under conditions  in which
 accidental spontaneous infection could with certainty be excluded.
 These experiments had been concluded in 1896, before the arrival of
 Dr. R. Koch in South Africa, and their results had been communi
cated to him on his arrival.
    1. The blood of an animal ill with rinderpest, when taken during
the febrile stage or previous to death, and injected subcutaneously or
intravenously into healthy cattle, produces the typical disease —
rinderpest, provided the blood is prevented from coagulating.
    2. The onset of coagulation and actual coagulation of the blood
exert a marked destructive influence on the virulence of such blood.
    3. The best method of obtaining virulent blood is to draw it asep-
tically from the jugular vein of an animal ill with rinderpest, and
to mix it immediately with a 1 per cent, solution of citrate of potash,
the latter previously well sterilised, in the proportion of 2 — 3 parts
of blood to 1 part of citrate of potash solution. Such blood, as has
been shown, remains fluid.
   4. This citrate of potash mixture of blood proves virulent in the
first few days, generally not exceeding six days ; after six days'
keeping the virulence becomes rapidly weakened, so that after nine
days the blood mixture is altogether inert.
   5. Admixture of glycerine to citrate blood does not cceteris paribus
interfere with the virulence of such blood. Glycerine added to fresh
blood does interfere with the virulence of the latter on account of
the coagulation of the blood.
   6. The nasal mucus of an infected animal when used fresh and
rubbed into the nostrils of normal cattle, produced in all instances typi
cal rinderpest.     We have never had a single failure in attempting to
produce the disease by this means.        By keeping the nasal mucus,
even for a few hours, its virulence becomes markedly less.

    7.  The condition of marked swelling of the lymphatic glands is
 one of, if not indeed the most evident pathognomic feature of the
disease.       The contagium exists as a primary infection in the lym
phatic glands.
    8. A very mild attack of rinderpest, such as is produced by injection
of blood of greatly decreased virulence, does not convey absolute
immunity, this latter being produced in proportion to the severity of
the attack through which the animal had passed primarily. An animal
seemingly affected may have a relapse of the disease, which may go on
to fatal issue or be mild in type, leading to recovery.                     Animals in
 the latter case always acquire immunity of a high degree.
" On the Dielectric Constants of certain Organic Bodies at and
        below the Temperature of Liquid Air." By James Dewar,
        M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., Fullerian Professor of Chemistry in
        the Royal Institution, and J. A. Fleming, M.A., D.Sc.,
        F.R.S., Professor of Electrical Engineering in University
         College, London.              Received June 29, 1897.
     Continuing the researches on which we are engaged on the Dielec
 tric quality of matter at very low temperatures, we have examined a
 number of organic bodies and measured their dielectric constants at
 and above the temperature of liquid air.
     The apparatus and arrangements for effecting this measurement
 are described in a former communication by us on the same subject.*
     The frequency of the reversals of the electromotive force used in
 charging the condenser in the experiments here described was, as
 before, 120.           The condenser used was the gilt cone condenser
 described in the communication mentioned.
     In another paperf we have given the results obtained by us on the
 measurement of the dielectric constants of glycerine, ethylene di-
 bromide, and nitrobenzol at very low temperatures, and shown that
 in the case of glycerine the very high value of the dielectric constant
  possessed by this body, above — 100° C., is reduced, on cooling to
  — 185° C., to a value not far from 30.                We have also shown that a
 similar great reduction in the value of the dielectric constant takes
 place in the case of ethyl alcohol when frozen at —185° C.+

    Constants   of certain Organic Bodies   at Low Temperatures.         35!)
   We have now examined, in addition, the following organic bodies,
viz., formic acid, methyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, acetone, chinoline, tetra-
ethylammonium      hydrate, and carbolic acid, and we find that these
bodies have, in the liquid or solid condition and at temperatures
above — 100° C., high, or very high, dielectric values, but all have
their dielectric constants reduced to a value not far from 2-5 when
they are cooled to the temperature of liquid air.
   In addition, we have measured the dielectric constants of castor oil
and olive oil, and find that they are reduced in value when these oils
are cooled to — 165° C. We have also measured the dielectric
constants of bisulphide of carbon, ether, ethyl nitrate, solution nf sulphur
in bisulphide of carbon, and absolute alcohol with 10 per cent, of
metallic sodium in it. We find in all these cases that there is a reduc-
tion in the value of the dielectric power, large or small, these bodies
possess at normal temperatures.       These experiments further confirm
the view that the presence of the radicles hydroxyl (HO), carbonyl
(CO), and the organic acid radicle (COOH) always produce relatively
high dielectric values in the bodies containing them when these
bodies are in the liquid condition or at temperatures not very far
below their freezing points. When these bodies are, however, frozen
and cooled to the temperature of liquid air, all of them suffer a
reduction in dielectric power, and their dielectric constants are
reduced to values not far from 2i>, or between 2-5 and 2-6, at the
temperature of — 185° C. or a little below. The action of the low
temperature is thus to annul the effect of the radicle.
   We have not found, so far, any exception to the role that pure
organic bodies have a dielectric constant of from two to three times
that of vacuous space when they are cooled to the temperature of
boiling liquid air, no' matter what value their constant may have
 when in the liquid condition.
   The following tables give the numerical results, and the observa
tions are delineated graphically in the chart in fig. 1.
   All the tables are headed by a statement giving the galvanometer
scale deflection in centimetres when the condenser has air as dielec
tric.    This is to be understood as the constant, for the time being,
representing the capacity of the condenser when its dielectric is
iraseous air at normal pressure and temperature.           The numbers in
the columns headed
                        " Dielectric constant," under each
                                                               substance are
obtained by dividing the number in the second column of the tables,
headed "Mean galvanometer deflection," by the above air capacity
constant, after having applied a correction to the galvanometer
reading for the charging voltage and for the capacity of the leads.
The numbers headed " Mean galvanometer deflection," when corrected
 for voltage and the capacity of the leads and vibrator, represent, to
 the same scale as the corrected air capacity constant, the capacity
                                                                2 c 2

 of the condenser when the particular substance mentioned was being
 used as dielectric.    The temperatures are given in platinum degrees,
 as explained in our other papers to which reference is made.               The
 last column    in  the  tables   gives   the  electromotive   force, in  volts,
 used to charge the condenser         The frequency of reversals was in all
 cases 120 per second.
    The observations were stopped        in each case at that temperature at
 which any sensible true conductivity made its appearance in the
 dielectric, and this, as we have already shown, takes place in the
 case of many bodies quite suddenly, and at temperatures far below
 their melting point. Thus it is impossible to carry up the dielectric
 constant measurement, by the method we employed, of formic acid or
 methyl alcohol much above about — 120°, because at that point

At the liquid air temperature all the organic bodies in the following
tables are, however, practically perfect insulators.

   The observations on castor oil, olive oil, and bisulphide of carbon
are of considerable interest.
   In the first place they show that the method we are using gives
results at normal temperatures which are in agreement with those of
other observers.           Thus Dr. J. Hopkinson* found the dielectric
constant K of carbon bisulphide at 20° C. to be 2'67 : we find it to be
2'64. The square of the refractive index of carbon bisulphide for the
D ray at 10° C. is 2-673, and accordingly this body is generally
said to be one of those which obey Maxwell's law, in that its
refractive index is nearly equal to the square root of the dielectric con
stant. If, however, we calculate the square of the refractive index of
bisulphide of carbon for waves of infinite wave-length using at least
                    *  See   'Koy.  Soc. Proc.,' vol. 43, p. 161, 1887.

366     Profs.      J.    Dewar aud              J.   A. Fleming.   On the Dielectric
two terms of the Cauchy's formula,* we find that for carbon bi
sulphide the value of (/t»)2 is 2-01, and this is somewhat less than the
value (267) of K at ordinary temperatures.          It is, however, much
nearer to the value (2'24) which we find for K at the liquid air
temperature.       Again, Dr. J. Hopkinson's value for the dielectric
constant of castor oil at normal temperature is 4- 78, and the square
of the refractive index of this body for infinite waves is 2'153.      Our
value for the dielectric constant of castor oil is 4-23 at 20° C. and 219
at -185° C.
    Hence, in the case of castor oil at the temperature of liquid air
there is practically a very fair agreement between the values of K
an(i (/'» )2 for a low frequency of electromotive force reversals, whereas
at normal temperatures K has nearly twice the value of (/i„                       )*.
    The same fact holds good for olive oil. At normal temperatures
its dielectric constant K is 3'16, and the square of its infinite refrac
tive index (p^)2       2131. At the temperature of liquid air we find
                          is
the dielectric constant of olive oil to be 2T8 for low frequency.
Hence, in these cases a large part of the difference between K and
(f-a.>¥ which      exists at normal temperature disappears at very
low temperatures, and castor oil and olive oil then make in this
respect even a better agreement than carbon bisulphide.                One

a maximum value for their dielectric constant.

   The determination of the actual values of the refractive indices of
these bodies at the liquid air temperature is a work of great diffi
culty, and one which we have not yet attempted. There is no question
that it is important also to determine whether these very low
temperatures have any effect in altering the absorptive power of these
organic bodies for ultra- red rays, and removing that anomalous dis
persion which appears to exist in some of them beyond the limits of
the visible spectrum.

    By the aid of the cone condenser and the method described by                    us
in another communication,* we have studied the changes produced
in the dielectric constants cf ice at and above the temperature of
liquid air when the ice has suspended in it insoluble metallic oxides
or else has dissolved in      it soluble metallic oxides or hydrates.             We
have also examined the dielectric properties of some of these oxides
and hydrates when dissolved in other menstrua frozen and reduced
to very low temperatures.
    The experiments were conducted exactly as described in the com
munication above mentioned, and the frequency of the electromotive
force reversals was, as before, 120.
    In the following tables the four columns of figures give respec
tively the platinum temperature of the dielectric, the scale deflection
of the galvanometer, representing the capacity of the condenser with
the selected dielectric, when corrected for voltage and capacity of
the leads and vibrator ; the deduced dielectric constant, and the
electromotive force at which the charging of the condenser was con
ducted.
    The figure given at the head of each table as the corrected galva
nometer deflection with air as dielectric, represents the capacity of the
condenser with gaseous air at normal pressure and temperature as its
dielectric.
    The hydrates dissolved in water or other media, or the oxides in a
very fine state of division, suspended in water, were introduced by
means of a pipette, as the dielectric into the cavity of the cone con
denser.       This liquid dielectric was then frozen and reduced to the
temperature of liquid air by lowering the whole condenser into a
large vacuum vessel holding several litres of liquid air. As soon as
the dielectric was reduced to the temperature of —188° C. the
 observations for capacity and temperature began.
     In all cases an observation was taken for electric conductivity and
the dielectric measurements were stopped the moment any sensible
conductivity made its appearance.

     It will     be noticed that the dielectric       constant of the ice having in
suspension particles            of oxide  of copper  has an exceedingly high value,
even at the temperature of liquid air, and, moreover, shows no signs
of becoming reduced.                We suspected that this might be due to the
conductivity of the oxide of copper particles, which, though separated
and insulated by ice at a low temperature in such fashion that the
whole mass is a good insulator, may yet raise the value of the average
dielectric constant.
     We tried suspending sulphide of copper in ice, but in this case
found the material, as a whole, had such conductivity that we could
not make any dielectric measurement by the method used.                         With
this exception, all the other frozen oxides and hydrates suspended or
dissolved in ice had a very high resistance.
     We then tried dissolving the oxide of copper in ammonia.

    Before drawing conclusions as to the dielectric power of these
oxides and hydrates, it seemed important to try the effect of sus
pending in ice small quantities of inert particles, and we therefore-
selected finely divided gold and precipitated sulphur as instances of a
good conductor and a good non-conductor in very fine states of divi
sion.      These finely divided materials were suspended in water and

     The results show that practically no influence is produced upon the
-dielectric quality of the ice at very low temperatures when it is
impregnated either with conducting particles of gold or non-conduct
 ing particles of sulphur. The amount of gold in the ice as used by
 us is no doubt small.            In each case the dielectric constant of the
material is very close to that of the ice obtained from pure distilled
water.
     The electrical resistance of the ice slightly impregnated with finely
divided gold did not appear to be less than that of ordinary ice.
To the tests we applied the one appeared to be as good an insulator
as the other.
     The foregoing observations are graphically delineated in the
diagrams in figs. 1, 2, and 3, according to the magnitude of the
dielectric constants found. The following facts may then be noted : —
     (i) The presence          of coesium hydrate, lithium hydrate, bismuth
            oxide, aluminic oxide, finely divided sulphur or finely divided
            gold, in the percentages used by us, in ice makes little or no
            difference in its dielectric power when cooled to the tempera
            ture of liquid air.
    (ii) The presence to about the same extent of the hydrates of
            potassium, sodium, rubidium, or the oxides of copper, iron,
            or lead, causes a very great increase in the dielectric power
            of the ice at that low temperature.
    (iii) The dielectric curves are, however, all seen to be tending
            downwards in such a way as to show that at still lower tem
            peratures it is probable the effect of the oxides or hydrates
            would be annulled and the dielectric constants of all be
            reduced to a value not far from that of pure ice.
     (iv)  The    exception to this tendency, so far as yet observed, appears
            to be in the case of the oxide of copper, which, when sus
             pended in ice, causes it to possess the remarkably high
              dielectric value of 150 even at the temperature of liquid air.

Fig.  1. — Curves showing the variation in Dielectric Constant with Temperaturo of
                           various Oxides and Hydrates.
           It  is possible, however, that in this case the conductivity of
           the yet insulated particles of oxide may account for the
           result.
   (v)   The    effect of the solvent or menstruum upon the dielectric
           constant is also exceedingly marked.             Thus the oxide of
          copper suspended in ice has a dielectric constant of about
           150 at —185°, the oxide of lead suspended in ice has a value

           of copper is dissolved in ammonia and frozen, the dielectric
          constant of this at —185° falls to 2'2, whereas if the oxide of
          lead is dissolved in 5 per cent, solution of caustic potash and
           frozen, the dielectric constant rises to 1 70 at the temperature
           of liquid air.

   The only general conclusion that can as yet be drawn from the
experiments described is that the presence of certain oxides or
hydrates of metals in ice, even to the extent of not many per cent.,
has an immense influence in raising the dielectric power of the ice
when taken at the temperature of liquid air, whereas the presence
of other oxides or hydrates chemically analogous has hardly any
influence at all.
   In the above described experiments, Mr. J. E. Petavel has given us
considerable assistance.

  Further Observations on the Dielectric Constants of Frozen
       Electrolytes at and above the Temperature of Liquid Air."
       By J. A. Fleming, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S., Professor of Elec
       trical Engineering in University College, London, and

       Chemistry in the Royal Institution. Received June 29, 1897.
   In continuation of our examination of the dielectric constants of
frozen electrolytes at very low temperatures, we have subjected to

                of Frozen Electrolytes         at very Low Temperatures.       381
  test (in the manner described in a former abstract)* another large
 series of electrolytes.
     Referring to the above-mentioned abstract for an account of the
 details of the method, we merely give in the following Tables the
 results of our observations on the dielectric constants of many
 -aqueous solutions of metallic salts, which have been taken with the
 .object of determining if possible the causes which create high or low
 dielectric values at low temperatures.
      The dielectric observations were all taken at a frequency of electro
 motive force reversal of 120.
     We have taken, in the first place, a large series of observations on
 .electrolytes with the same base (sodium), but different acid radicles,
-and then a number with the same acid radicle but different bases.
 Also, we have examined normal and corresponding acid salts, double
 salts, and many salts taken in such proportion with water as to yield
  the so-called cryohydrates.
     The following tables give the details of the dielectric measure
 ments.

   In the case of each dielectric measurement a preliminary resist
ance measurement was generally made to determine the electrical
resistance of the frozen electrolyte. It was invariably found that in
the case of all the true electrolytic solutions, the electrical resistance
of the dielectric at the temperature of liquid air was exceedingly
large, generally exceeding many thousands of megohms.
   As the temperature of the dielectric rose the electrical resistance
fell down, often very quickly, to a fraction of a megohm, and, long
before the melting point of the electrolyte was reached, quite con
siderable conductive power always made its appearance in the frozen
electrolytic solution.

   The observations in the last table show the rapid rate at which a
frozen alcoholic solution of potash increases in conductivity between
very narrow limits of temperature, whilst the experiments with the
frozen solutions of sodic chloride and potassic iodide show the same
kind of change, but less rapid, in the case of aqueous electrolytes.
   In each case we have very considerable conductivity in a solid con
dition far below the melting point of the electrolyte, but, at the
same time, exceedingly high resistance at the temperature of liquid
air.
   On looking at the chart of curves it will be seen that the general

             of Frozen    Electrolytes at very Low Temperatures.             395
form of the dielectric temperature curve is not unlike the magnetisa
tion curve of a ferro-magnetic body or a vapour tension curve.
    In most of the curves there is within a certain range of tempera
ture a fall more or less sudden from a high value of the dielectric
constant to a low value.
    As regards the value of the dielectric constants of frozen electro
lytes at the temperature of liquid air, the salts employed by us may
be divided into three broad classes : —
    I. Those which, when         added to water    in percentages from 5 to 50,
            do not much affect the     dielectric constant of the water when it
            is frozen ; and which, at the temperature of liquid air, have
            dielectric constants not far from 2'5, or lying between 2 and 3.
            Such salts are sodic bicarbonate, sodic bisulphate, potassic bi
            chromate, potassic bicarbonate, sodic chloride, baric chloride,
            potassic iodide, sodic nitrite, hydropotassic sulphide, cupric
            carbonate.    These include the acid salts and halogen salts.
     II.  Those salts    which,   when added to water in percentages from
            5 to 50, raise the dielectric constant of the water somewhat and
            which yield frozen electrolytes, having, at the temperature of
            liquid air, dielectric constants lying between 3 and 10, that
            of pure ice at the same temperature being 2-5. Such salts
            are potassic chromate, sodic sulphate, sodic chlorate, cadmic boro-
            tungstate, sodic. acetate,   potassium   aluminic sulphate, plumbic
            nitrate. These are all      highly oxygenated salts.
     III.  Salts which, when added to water in percentages from 5 to 50,
            yield electrolytes which, if frozen, have immensely greater
             dielectric constants, than pure ice at the temperature of liquid
            air, viz., values from 30 to 70.
                Such salts are sodic carbonate, sodic biborate, sodic hypo
            sulphite, sodic silicate, hydrodisodic   phosphate, potassium  ferro-
            cyanide.
     It will  be  noticed that whenever we have tested a normal salt and
 >vn acid salt of the same base, such as a carbonate         and a bicarbonate,
 a chromate      and   a bichromate,    a  sulphate  and  a bisulphate,  the acid
 salt always has the lower dielectric constant of the two at the tem
 perature of liquid air.
     With the exception of sodium carbonate, potassium ferrocyanide,
and hydrodisodic phosphate, the whole of the dielectric curves seem
 to be tending downwards in such a way as to show that at somewhat
 lower temperatures than we have at command, the whole of these
 frozen electrolytes would have dielectric constants not far from that
 of puro ice. In other words, would be reduced to values probably
 near 2 or 3.
     There seems now a fair amount of evidence to show that with a

39(3              Proceedings and  List of Papers read.
few exceptions all frozen electrolytes would, in all probability, if
reduced to temperatures not far above the absolute zero, have their
dielectric constants approximately equal, and reduce to a value not
far from 2 or 3. At the same time the electric resistivity of such
frozen electrolytes would tend to become infinite as the temperature
is continuously reduced.
   In the very great labour of taking and reducing the above
numerous observations, Mr. J. E. Petavel has rendered us much
valuable service.

                                   (Abstract.)
    Charles Darwin was the first to point out the great importance of
the study of the nature and causes of variation.        Since his time, two
 methods of investigation have been adopted ; in the one the obvious
and strongly pronounced variations are selected and the probability
 of species having been derived from such " sports " is analysed and
discussed.        According to the second method a population of a
 species is taken, and the condition of the organs in each individual is
 determined. It is believed that this latter statistical method will
 lead to more accurate ideas as to the causes of variation and as to
 the part which variation has played in the origin of species.
    As in all other scientific investigations, the course pursued by
 statistical inquiry is, firstly, to record facts, and, secondly, to
 generalise from the facts.        The facts consist of the nature of the

         Skeleton,  with especial Reference to the Naqada Race.            399
 variation and the relationships which obtain between one variation
and another ; these may be expressed by diagrams or by means of a
few numerical constants.       After the data have thus been expressed
 in a convenient form, they are examined to see if any legitimate
theory or generalisation can be drawn from them. If not, the facts
nevertheless possess a value, for light is sure to be shed on them by
future investigations, since the subject of variation is still in its
 infancy.
    To obtain an accurate knowledge of the variability displayed by
 man and the mutual relationships of the different organs is surely a
subject of great interest and of both practical and theoretical import
ance.     An exceptionally favourable opportunity for studying the
variation exhibited by the human skeleton in a fairly homogeneous
race was presented by the kindness of Professor Petrie in placing at
                                                    "
my disposal the skeletons of the " New Race which he has recently
brought over from Egypt.           There were remains of about 400
skeletons.
    Although numerous bone-measurements             have been made, yet
generally the number in each race has been too small to be of any
statistical use, and even when fairly numerous measurements have
been made on a single race, the results have been dealt with in a
very inadequate manner. So far as I am aware, the present investi
gation is the first where the limb-bones have been measured for
statistical purposes, and it is also,    I believe, the largest series of
measurements that have been made on the human skeleton.
    The paper deals primarily with the nature of the variation in the
length of the limb-bones and of the correlation between the bones.
The sacrum and pectoral girdle have also been studied as far as the
material would allow.      Besides this  I have made some observations
on the more important ethnological characters which the material
exhibited.
    The measurements of each bone are recorded in the tables, and
these constitute the foundation for all theory, and in the future will
be of use for discovering fresh relationships and for correcting any
erroneous ideas.
    In the following paragraphs some of the more important conclu
sions are briefly recapitulated : —
    (1) The variability of the limb-bones is roughly proportional to
their absolute length, and hence expressing the variability in terms
of the mean we tend to get a constant ratio.

    (2) The mode of dispersion of the variations about the mean
,would      appear to be distinctly skew, and the range given by the
theoretical curves would seem to be generally limited.                    The fre
quency curves are steeper on the negative side than on the positive
side of the origin, hence there is greater variability towards long
bones than towards short bones, that is, abnormality in the direction
of giants is greater than in the direction of dwarfs.
     (3) The femora of the New Race were strongly pilastric, occasion
ally they were platymerie, but then the pilastric index* was generally
low. This observation is in accordance with Professor Manouvrier's
statement that platymerism is more frequently exhibited in femora
with low than with high pilastric indices.
      (4) The length of the head + neck of the femur in proportion to
 the total length of ths bone is greater in man than in woman. I
 find that in the New Race the angle of the neck with the shaft is
larger in woman than in man, though on somewhat scant data the
reverse is stated to be the case in Europeans.
     (5) In the New Race the angle of torsion of the femur is much
greater than in Europeans ; it is suggested that this angle «nay be
found to be a race character.
      (6) The angle which the condyles of the femur make with the
 horizontal plane, when the bone is held upright in the maximum
 position, is greater in woman than in man.                   This would appear to
 be due to the greater width of the pelvis.               It is suggested that this
 angle might yield valuable information as to the width of the pelvis
 in prehistoric peoples.
      (7) The tibiae exhibited platycuemia to a marked degree.               A cor
 relation is believed to exist between the flattening of the tibia and
 the condition of the pilastre of the femur; hence as the pilastric
 condition would seem to be produced by a vigorous musculature
 platycuemia may prol:ui>ly be referred to a similar cause, and so it is
  not an atavistic character.
       (8) Perforation of the septum botween the olecranon and coronoid
 fossa) of the humerus was very frequent.                   Also it occurred more
 often in the female than in the male, and on the left side than on the
 right. It is suggested that in man this perforation is frequently
 incidental, and is due to the impact of the beak of the olecranon
 against the septum in extension of the arm.
       (9) Many of the ulnae were conspicuously incurved. The olecranon               .
  was remarkable for its variation in size.
       (10) The femur + tibia is longer on the left side than on the
 light, while the right humerus + radius is very considerably greater

than the left. The difference between the means of the two sides
would appear to vary in different races ; also it is distinctly greater in
woman than in man.
    (11) The absolute correlation between the lengths of the long
bones is high, while, on the other hand, the correlation between
length and breadth would appear to be weak.
    (12) On comparing with the Aino it would seem that serially
homologous bones are more strongly correlated with one another than
are non-homologous bones.            Also the femur and tibia are more
closely correlated    than  the humerus     and radius. Distal bones would
appear to be somewhat less correlated with one another than are
proximal bones, e.g., there is slightly less correlation between the
tibia and radius than between the femur and humerus.
    In the New Race woman was distinctly less correlated than man.
     (13) Sometimes it is desirable to refer the variations to some
standard, such as stature. The index-correlations tend to be lower
 than the absolnte correlations.          From the results wo have obtained
 it appears doubtful as to what meaning we can attach to the dif
 ference between the observed correlation of ratios and Professor
 Pearson's
              " spurious correlation."

 indices were nearly identical with those of Europeans.
  u The average Contribution            of each several Ancestor to the
         total Heritage of the Offspring."            By FRANCIS Galton,
         D.C.L., Sc.D., F.R.S. Received and Read June 3, 1897.
      In the following memoir    the  truth will be verified in a particular
  instance, of a statistical law of heredity that appears to be universally
 Applicable to bisexual descent.       1 stated it briefly and with hesitation
  in my book 'Natural Inheritance' (Macmillan, 1889; page 134),
  because it was then unsupported by sufficient evidence.             Its exist
  ence was originally suggested by general considerations, and it might,
 as will be shown, have been inferred from them with considerable
 .assurance.      Consequently, as it is now found to hold good in a
  special case, there are strong grounds for believing it to be a general
  ]aw of heredity.
      I  have had great difficulty in obtaining a sufficient amount of
  suitable evidence for the purpose of verification. A somewhat exten
  sive series of experiments with moths were carried on, in order
  to supply it, but they unfortunately failed, partly owing to the
   diminishing fertility of successive broods and partly to the large
   disturbing effects of differencas in food and enviroument on different
                                                                                '

 4G2.      Dr. F. Galton.      The average Contribution   of each
 broods and in different places and years.      No statistical results of
 any consistence or value could be obtained from them. Latterly,
 while engaged in planning another extensive experiment with small,
 fast-breeding mammals,      I became acquainted with the existence of a
 long series  of records, preserved by Sir Everett Millais, of the colours
 during many successive generations of a large pedigree stock of
 Basset hounds, that he originated some twenty years ago, having
 purchased ninety-three of them on the Continent, for the purpose.
 These records afford the foundation upon which this memoir rests.
    The law to be verified may seem at first sight too artificial to be
 true, but a closer examination shows that prejudice arising from the
 cursory impression is nnfounded.        This subject will be alluded to
 again, in the meantime the law shall be stated.           It is that the
 two parents contribute between them on the average one-half, or
 (0'5) of the total heritage of the offspring ; the four grand
 parents, one-quarter, or (0'5)2; the eight great-grandparents, one-
 eighth, or (0'5)3, and so on. Thus the sum of the ancestral contribu
tions is expressed by the series {(0\5) + (0-o)2-|-(0-5)*, &c.}, which,
 being equal to 1, accounts for the whole heritage.
    The same statement may be put into a different form, in which a
 parent, grandparent, &c., is spoken of without reference to sex, by
 saying that each parent contributes on an average one-quarter, cr
 (O'5y, each grandparent one-sixteenth, or (0-o)*, and so on, and that
generally the occupier of each ancestral place in the nth degree,
 whatever be the value of n, contributes (0'5)2* of the heritage.
    In interbred stock there are always fewer, and usually far fewer,
 different individuals among the ancestry than ancestral places for
them to fill. A pedigree stock descended from a single couple, m
 generations back, will have 2™ ancestral places of the mth order, but
only two individuals to fill them ; therefore if m = 10 there are 1024
such places ; if to = 20 there are more than a million.         Whenever
the   same   individual occupies many places he will be separately
rated for each of them.
    The neglect of individual prepotencies is justified in a law that
avowedly relates to average results ; they must of course be taken
into acconnt when applying the general law to individual cases. No
difficulty arises in dealing with characters that are limited by sex,
when their equivalents in the opposite sex are known, for instance in
the statures of men and women.
    The law may be applied either to total values or to deviations, as
will be gathered from the following equation. Let M be the mean
value from which all deviations are reckoned, and let Di, D2, &c., be
the means of all the deviations, including their signs, of the ancestors
in the 1st, 2nd, &c., degrees respectively; then
           i(M + D,)+i(M     + D0 + &c. =  M+.(iD,  + iDt+Ac.)

         several Ancestor    to the total Heritage   of  the Offspring.   403
    It should noted that nothing in this statistical law contradicts the
generally accepted view that the chief, if not the sole, line of descent
runs from germ to germ and not from person to person.               The person
may be accepted on the whole as a fair representative of the germ,
and, being so, the statistical laws which apply to the persons would
apply to the germs also, though with less precision in individual cases.
Xow this law is strictly consonant with the observed binary sub
divisions of the germ cells, and the concomitant extrusion and loss of
 one-half of the several contributions from each of the two parents to
 the germ-cell of the offspring.       The apparent artificiality of the law
 ceases on these grounds to afford cause for doubt ; its close agree
 ment with physiological phenomena ought to give a prejudice in
favour of its truth rather than the contrary.
     Again, a wide though limited range of observation assures us that
 the occupier of each ancestral place may contribute something of his
 own personal peculiarity, apart from all others, to the heritage of
 the offspring.     Therefore there is such a thing as an average contri
 bution appropriate to each ancestral place, which admits of statist
 ical valuation, however minute it may be.            It is also well known
 that the more remote stages of ancestry contribute considerably less
 than the nearer ones.        Further, it is reasonable to believe that the
 contributions of parepts to children are in the same proportion
 as those of the grandparents to the parents, of the great-grand
 parents to the grandparents, and so on ; in short, that their total
  amount is to be expressed by the sum of the terms in an infinite geo
  metric series diminishing to zero.      Lastly, it is an essential condition
  that their total amount should be equal to 1, in order to account for
  the whole of the heritage.       All these conditions are fulfilled by the
  series of £ + 12 + £s + Ac., and by no other.      These and the foregoing
  considerations were referred to when saying that the law might
 be inferred with considerable assurance a priori ; consequently,
 being found true in the particular case about to be stated, there is
  good reason to accept the law in a general sense.
     The Bassets are dwarf blood-honnds, of two, and only two, recog
  nised varieties of colour.       Excluding, as I have done, a solitary
  exception   of black  and tan,  they are either white, with large blotches
  ranging between red and yellow, or they may iu addition be marked
  with more or less black.        In the former case they are technically
  known and registered as " lemon and white," in the latter case as
  " tricolour." Tricolour is, in fact, the introduction of melanism, so I
  shall treat the colours simply as being " tricolour " or " non-tri
           "                                 I
  colour ; more briefly, as T. or N.            am assured that transitional
   cases between T.      and  N-. are very rare, and that experts would
   hardly ever disagree about the class to which any particular hound
   should be assigned.      A stud-book is published from time to time

 404        Dr. F. Galton.         The average Contribution      of each
 containing the pedigrees, dates of birth, and the names of the
 breeders of these valuable animals.             The one I have nsed bears the
 title ' The Basset Hound Club Rules and Stud-Book,' compiled by
 Everett Millais, 1874-1896.           It contains the names of nearly 1000
 hounds, to which Sir Everett Millais has very obligingly, at my
 request, appended their colours so far as they have been registered,
 which during later years has almost invariably been done.                    The
 upshot   is  that I have   had   the   good  fortune  to  discuss a total of 817
 hounds of known colour, all descended from parents of known colour.
 In 567 out of these 817, the colours of all four grandparents were
«lso known. These two sets are summarised in Table I and discussed
 in Table V, and they afford the data for Tables II, III, and IV. In
 188 of the above cases the colours of all the eight great-grandparents
-were known as well ; this third set is discussed in Table VI.
    Partly owing to inequality in the numbers of the tricolours and
 non-tricolours, and partly owing to a selective mating in favour of
the former, the different possible combinations of T. and N. ancestry
are by no means equally common.               The effect of this is conspicuous
 in Table I, where the entries are huddled together in some parts and
absent in others.       Still, though the data are not distributed as evenly
 as could be wished, they will serve our purpose if we are justified in
 grouping them without regard to sex ; or, more generally, if we
 treat the 2" components of each several A„, whatever be the value of
 n, as equally efficient contributors.
    Our first inquiry then must be, " Is or is not one sex so markedly
 prepotent over the other, in transmitting colour, that a disregard of
-sex would introduce statistical error ?"          In answering this, we should
 bear in mind a common experience, that statistical questions relating
to sex are very difficult to deal with. Large and unknown disturbing
.causes appear commonly to exist, that make data which are seemingly
 homogeneous, very heterogeneous in reality.              Some of these are un
 doubtedly     present  here,   especially  such   as may   be due to individual
 prepotencies combined with close interbreeding.               For although this
 pedigree    stock  originated   in as  many  as  ninety-three  different hounds,
 presumably more or less distant relations to one another, some of
•them proved of so much greater value than the rest that very close
 interbreeding has subsequently been resorted to in numerous in
 stances.     In order to show the danger of trusting blindly to averages
of sex, even when the numbers are large, I have compared the
 results derived from different sets of data, namely from those con
 tained in the last two columns of Table I, where they are distin
guished by the letters A and B, and have treated them both sepa
 rately and together in Table II.              They will be seen to disagree
 widely, concurring only in showing that the dam is prepotent over
 the sire in transmitting colour.            According to the A data, their

          several A ncestor to the total Heritage of the Offspring.    405
relative efficacy in this respect is as 58 to 51, say 114 to 100 ; accord
ing to the B data, it is as 47 to 32, say 147 to 100.       Taking all the
data together, it is ns 54 to 45, say 120 to 100, or as 6 to 5.
   It does not seem to me that this ratio of efficacy of 6 to 5 is suffi
cient to overbear the statistical advantages of grouping the sexes as
if they were equally efficient, the error in one case being more or less
balanced by an opposite error in the other.           It is true that the
reciprocal forms of mating are by no means equally numerous, the
prevailing (endency to use tricolours as sires being conspicuous.
Still, as will be found later, on the application of a general test, the
error feared is too insignificant to be observed.      Should, however, a
much larger collection of these data be obtained hereafter, minutiae
ought to be taken into account which may now be disregarded, and
the neglect of female prepotency would cease to be justified.
   The law to be verified supposes all the ancestors to be known, or to
be known for so many generations back that the effects of the
unknown residue are too small for consideration.           The amount of
the residual effect, beyond any given generation, is easily determined
by the fact that in the series \ + \ -\-^, &c., each term is equal to the
sum of all its successors.     Now in the two sets of cases to be dealt
with the larger refers to only two generations, therefore as the effect
of the second generation is \, that of the unknown residue is also.  \
The smaller set refers to three generations, leaving an unknown
residual effect of £. These large residues cannot be ignored, amount
ing, as they do, to 25 and 12'5 per cent, respective!y. We have,
therefore, to determine fixed and reasonable rules by which they
should be apportioned.
   The requisite data for doing this are given in Table III, which
shows that 79 per cent, of the parents of tricolour hounds are tri
colour also, and that 56 per cent. of the parents of non-tricolour
hounds are tricolour.       It is not to be supposed that the trust
worthiness of these results reaches to 1 per cent., but they are the
best available data, so I adopt them.
   It will be convenient to use the following nomenclature in calcula
tion: —
   fl0 stands  for a single member of the offspring.
   d| for a single parent ; a% for a single grandparent, and so on, the
suffix denoting the number of the generation.          A parallel nomen
clature, using capital letters, is : —
   A0 stands for all the offspring of the same ancestry.
   A, for the two parents ; A2 for all the four grandparents, and so on.
Consequently A„ contains 2" individuals, each of the form a„, and A„
contributes (0'5)" to the heritage of each a„ ; while each a„ contributes
(0-5)s" to it.
   In the upper part of Table IV the ratios are entered of the average
   VOL.   lxi.                                                   2 V

 40(3      Dr. F. Galton.      The average  Contribution   of each
 contributions of T. supplied by known ancestors.        Nothing further
 need be said about these, except that they are styled coefficients
 because they must be multiplied into the total number of offspring,
 in order to calculate the number of them that will, on their separate
 and independent accounts, be probably tricolours.
    We have next to explain how the coefficients for the unknown
 ancestry have been calculated, namely, those which are entered in the
 lower part of Table IV. Suppose all the four grandparents, A3, to
 be tricolour, then only 0'79 of A3 will be tricolour also, (0-79)s of A,,
and so on.     These several orders of ancestry will respectively con
tribute an average of tricolour to each Oo of the amounts of
 (0-5)3 x (079), (05)' x (0-79)*, &c.    Consequently the sum of their
tricolour contributions is
        (0-5)3x (079) {l + (0-5) x (079) + (0-5)sx (0-79)' + &c.},
which equals 0'1632.      The average tricolour contribution from the
ancestry of each of the four tricolour grandparents must be reckoned
as the quarter of this, namely, O0403.
   By a similar process, the average tricolour contribution from the
ancestry of each non-tricolour grandparent is found to be 0'0243.
   When the furthest known generation is that of the great-grand
parents, the formula differs from the foregoing only by substituting
(0-5)* x (0-79) for (0'5)3X (079). This makes the average tricolour
contribution from the ancestry of the whole eight tricolour great-
grandparents equal to 008160, and that from the ancestry of each of
them to be one-eighth of this, or 0-0102.
   In a similar way the tricolour contribution from the ancestry of
each non- tricolour great-grandparent is found to be 0'0061 .
   The following example shows how the coefficients in Table IV were
utilised in calculating the general coefficients entered in Table V.
             2  Parents, T, (personal)                 05000
             3 Grandparents, Ts (personal)             01875

                     Total tricolour contribution . .  0'8342
    The coefficient 0-83 will consequently be found under the appro
priate head in Table V, where the total number of offspring (" all
cases") is recorded as 119. By multiplying these together, viz.,
083x119, the "calculated" number of 99 is obtained. It will be
seen that the observed number was 101, a difference of only 2 per
cent.
   The extraordinarily   close coincidence throughout     the two tables,

 V  and  VI,  between calculation and observation, proves that the law
 is correct  in the present instance,      and that the principle             by which
the unknown ancestry was apportioned, is practically exact also.                        It
is not so strictly exact as it might have been, because the whole of
the available knowledge has not been utilised.                 The 0'79 applied to
 A^, &c., requires some small correction              according to the known
colours of the offspring of A3. If they had been all tricolour the 0'79
 would have to be increased; if all non-tricolour, it would have to be
diminished.      Having insufficient data to check a theoretical emenda
       I
 tion, note its omission, but shall not discuss the matter further.
    It will be easily understood from these remarks how collateral data
:ire to bo brought into calculation, for if the collaterals were more
 tricolour than the average of hounds, the 0-79 would have to be
somewhat increased (but not beyond the limiting value of l-00); if
less tricolour than the average, the 0'79 would have to be diminished.
The knowledge of collaterals would be superfluous, if that of the
direct ancestry were complete, but this important prolongation of the
 present subject must not be considered further on this occasion.
    There are three stages in Tables V and VI at which comparisons
 may be made between calculated results and observed facts.
                            — In Table V the sum of all the calculated
    (1) The Grand Totals.
values amounts to 391 ; that of all the observed ones to 387, which
are closely alike.     In Table VI they amount to 180 and 181 re
spectively, which is a still closer resemblance.                 Consequently the
calculations are practically   exact  on  the whole,   and   the   error occasioned
 by neglect of sex, &c., is insignificant.

are striking, in comparison with such results as statisticians have
usually to be contented with; the second pair, 149, 139, is the least
good, and will be considered in the next paragraph.

408        Dr. F. Galton.        The average Contribution     of each
tives of the normal condition.           I have not uuravelled the causes
of this  error,  and  it  is not   urgent  to  do so, since its ill effects are
swamped by the large number of successes elsewhere.
   In order to satisfy myself that the correspondence between calcu
lated and observed values was a sharp test of the correctuess of the
coefficients,  I  made many experiments by altering them slightly,
and recalculating.       In every case there was a notable diminution in
the accuracy of the results. The test that the theory has success
fully undergone appeared on that account, to be even more searching:
and severe than I had anticipated.
   It is hardly necessary to insist on the importance of possessing a
correct law of heredity.        Vast sums of money are spent in rearing
pedigree   stock  of the   most   varied kinds, as horses, cattle, sheep, pigs,
 dogs, and other animals, besides flowers and fruits.             The current
 views  of breeders  and    horticulturists  on heredity  are contradictory in
 important respects, and therefore must be more or less erroneous.
 Certainly no popular view at all resembles that which is justified
 by the present memoir. A correct law of heredity would also bo of
 service in discussing actuarial problems relating to hereditary long
 evity and disease, and it might throw light on many questions con
 nected with the theorv of evolution.

                    for February 11 this jear, vol. 60, No. 367, wish
to add an observation to those previously recorded, as I have recently
acquired a concave Rowland grating (3£ X H-inch ruled surface,
14,438 lines to inch, 10 feet radius of curvature, being the one used
 by Mr. George Higgs), of which the spectra of the first and third
orders on one side are very satisfactory.
    It is said on page 513, " If the focussing is sharp enough to show
a narrow, dark reversal line down the middle of each sodium line,
that dark line completely disappears when the magnet is excited."
With the greater optical power now available tho dark reversal line
is often by no means narrow, and though in some positions of the
flame it does still tend to disappear or become less manifest when
the flame is subjected to a concentrnted magnetic field, the reason of
its partial disappearance is that it is partially reversed again — i.e.,
that a third bright line, as it were, makes its appearance in the
midst of the dark line, giving a triple appearance to each sodium
line.
    More completely stated the phenomena are as follows : — After
obtaining each sodium line with a prominently double aspect by
 manipulating the flame, the magnet is excited, and the dark band in
the midst of each sodium line is then seen to widen out considerably
 in the region of most intense magnetisation, while a bright intrusion
 line makes its appearance.      On closer examination this new line is
seen to bo double, by reason of a dark division down its middle ; and
 I  apprehend that with still more magnetic power this dark band
might itself open out into two ; but this last phenomenon I have not
yet observed.
    The whole sodium group is thus seen as if it were octuple. The
effect is not due to a mere mechanical disturbance or rearrangement
of the     gases of the flame by the agency of magnetism     ; because a

nicol, placed in the rays emanating transversely to the magnetic
lines of force, cuts off nearly all the visible magnetic effect when
oriented so as to get rid of light whose plane of polarisation contains
the lines of force — that is, of oscillations or revolutions        'whose
electrical components are across or around the magnetic lines. That
it does not cut off every trace of the effect appears to be due to the
fact that the field of force is not strictly uniform, and so its lines are
not strictly parallel.
   The following is a summary of the different appearances that may
be seen according to the state of the flame and the strength of the
field:—
  At low temperature, and with     the flame forward in the field, when
each sodium   line is sharp and single, magnetism widens it, and with
a little more power doubles      it,
                                 causing a distinct dark line down its
middle.    The same effect occurs with lithium and thallium lines.
   At higher temperature, and with the flame partially behind the
field, when each sodium line appears as a broad hazy-edged double,
magnetisation greatly widens the doubling, pushing asunder the
bright components very markedly        stronger magnetisation reverses
                                       ;
the middle of the widened dark band, giving a triple appearance            ;
stronger magnetisation still reverses the middle once more, giving        a
quadruple appearance to the line. In every case a nicol, suitably
placed, cuts off all the magnetic effect and restores the original
appearance of the line.
   A curious circumstance        that although both lines, D> and D2,
                                is
show the effect, D2, i.e., the less refrangible     line, shows     best
                                                                   it
and most sharply.     I   should describe the effect on D2 as a coarse
widening of considerable amount, but without very clear definition;
whereas the widening of D,, though perhaps no greater in amount,          is
decidedly better defined.      There   is no doubt but that, with my
grating, D2 is the line at which one finds oneself usually looking in
order to see the details of the change best and   ;    I can hardly sup
pose this to be subjective to the grating.      hope to show the effects
                                                 I
at the soiree next Wednesday.
  [The same thing    is   seen when salts of lithium or of thallium are
introduced  into  the  flame;    and the components of the doubled red
lines are more widely separated than the components of the doubled
green lines, the effect being proportional to wave-length.          The most
interesting line to  try  was   the  red  cadmium line, since  this  has been
proved to be of specially simple constitution by Michelson.               We
have recently   been  able   to  get  the cadmium spectrum    well  developed
by means of a sort of spark arc between the magnet poles, main
tained by an induction coil excited by an alternating machine; and
we find that the magnetic doubling of the chief lines occurs in

 precisely the same way with the spark spectrum as with the flame
  spectrum, and that the red cadmium Hue behaves in the same way
 as the others.     The magnetic effect is better seen, from a direction
 perpendicular to the line of force, when a nicol is interposed in the
 path of the light, but rotation of the nicol through 90° cuts it
 entirely off, accurately so when a small spnrk is the source of
 light.— May 31.]
       Fifth Report      to the   Royal Society Water Research
                                   Committee.
 By H. Marshall, Ward, Sc.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., Professor of Botany
       in the University of Cambridge. Presented to the President and
        Council, December     10, 1896.
                                   (Abstract.)
     The following    is a short resume of the     principal points resulting
 from three years' study of the Bacterial Flora of the Thames.
    All  the forms have been grown on gelatine, agar, and potato, as well
 as in broth, milk, and sugar-solutions, and some of them in special
 media in addition.      Moreover, most of them have been cultivated in
 hanging drops     under   the microscope, sometimes isolated and under
 high powers, for long periods, and the course of development of the
 colonies traced in detail in several cases, and even when this could
 not be successfully carried to a conclusion, information as to the
 changes and growth of the organisms has been obtained, which helps
 to throw light on their behaviour and relationships.
     This work has occupied a long time, and these water bacteria do
 little beyond growing and dividing, so that in many respects this
 part of the work only starts problems for the future. In some cases,
 however, the morphological changes observed are helpful in explain
 ing the macroscopic appearances of the colonies, and in any case it is
 clear that no examination of a bacterium can be considered complete
 until its life-history has been traced under the microscope.
    The number of forms isolated and cultivated amount to eighty, not
 counting the large number which were either rejected at an early
 stage as certainly duplicates, or lost during cultivation.
    Of these eighty forms some have been distinctly recognised as well
 known types, e.g., Bacillus membranaceus amethystinus (Eis.), B.
fluorescent liquefaciens     (Fl.), B. fluorescein  non-liquefaciens  (FI.), B.
 coli commune, Proteus        vulgaris (Haus.), Bacillus     arborescens (Fr.),
 B. prodiyiosus (Ehr), B. termo (Cohn), B. subtilis, and Sarcina lutea.

410                    Prof.  II. Marshall Ward.
    Others have been referred with less certainty to less well known
forms, such as Bacterium urece (Jaksch), B. fulcus (Zimm.), B.
aureus (Adam.), Ascococcus (Cohn), Micrococcus carueus (Zimm.), and
 M. candicans (Fl.).
    The remainder are either new, or only doubtfully identified as
-already described forms, or evidently varieties of some of the fore
going.
    During the progress of the cultures, large numbers of coloured
drawings were made, with the intention of affording means of identi
fication, but it was found that variations are so numerous and so
large, that some study of these variations had to be undertaken.
    This led to an investigation of the growth of the colonies in
gelatine and other media, and an attempt to explain why, and how
far, the colonies vary in culture.     This necessitated a careful exami
nation of the factoro concerned in the development of the shapes,
markings, movements, and so forth of the colonies themselves, and
to a classiScation of the characters furnished by these colonies.
   One outcome of the above studies was the conviction that two sets
of factors are at work in causing the variations found in the colonies.
First, the slight variations in the food- materials, temperature,
moisture, &c., which cannot bo avoided, however carefully the work
is done; and, second, variations in the bacterium cell itself as it
comes from the river, owing to the exigencies it has been subjected
to during its sojourn there. The water of the river is, in fact, a very
dilute and indefinite food solution, and just as changes occur wheu
we remove a bacterium from broth to milk or to gelatine, so do such
result when we transfer from the river to these media, and the
changes induced in all cases depeud on how long the bacterium has
been in the one medium or the other, as well as upon other factors.
   The river water is a very poor food medium, and so we cannot be
surprised that in many cases the recently isolated bacteria behave as
weakened forms ; the recognition of these enfeebled varieties suggests
explanations of many of the bad "species" in the literature of water
bacteria. My work goes to show, not that species cannot be made
out, but that the limits of the species are, in most cases, far wider than
is assumed in descriptions — in other words, that many so-called species
in the books are merely varietal forms, whose characters, as given,
are not constant, but depend on treatment. How fnr this is true for
any given case will have to be tested on the particular form in
question.
   Very slight variations in rapidity of growth of the individual
bacterium, its power of liquefaction, pigment production, capacity of
fermenting, and so on, lead to comparatively very great differences in
the appearance of the colonies formed in a given time on, or in, a
medium like gelatine, the composition, aeration, hygroscopicity,

                 Report  to the Wale?-   Research Committee.           417
density, &c., of which is changing all the time, and since every
variation in temperature, light, air-supply, &c., affects the matter
also,  I  find ahnndant causes for the variations which otherwise
appear so astouishing.        It results, therefore, that the attempt to
determine species     of bacteria  by ordinary macroscopic methods leads
to difficulties of the same kind as would be met if we tried to
differentiate species from the marks presented by masses of trees in
forests from a distance— say in a balloon. A forest of a given
species of tree would appear very different at different seasons, and
according to its age, the kind of soil, climate, and so on, and the
treatment it had received previous to planting.
    In order to emphasise my own impressions of the specific value of
the forms isolated, and at the same time leave it clear what are the
differences between the various forms or varieties themselves, I have
grouped them into types.          Each group contains a type which I
regard as probably a species, of which the other forms included are
varieties. These varieties are fully described and figured, and would
certainly be regarded as species in most books consulted. The
reasons for grouping them as I have done are fully discussed with
the literature under each. Here, of course, 1 can only give a very
brief summary of the groups as follows : —
    Group I is made to contain a form which nppears to be identical
with the Bacterium iirece of Jaksch, and forming curiously character
istic dull stearine-like plate colonies.      It was not uncommon in the
river, but the want of salient features rendered it comparatively
uninteresting, and no prolonged study of other varieties of it was
undertaken.
    Group   II  was constituted for a type which in certain cultures
developes    an  intense violet colour exactly like that of a strong
solution of gentian violet.      It was not common — at any rate in the
typical form — but it was easily cultivated, and two varieties were
isolated and kept under observation for many month? .
    The type accords best with Jolles and Eisenberg's B. membrana-
ceus amethystinus, and forms the deep blue violet zooglcea-raembrane
described for that species, but three years' study of the variations in
culture convinces me that several violet bacilli described in the
literature are identical with this, or at least cannot be separated by
the characters given.
    A marked tendency to lose its power of forming pigment, and to>
grow as a pure white form, characterises this bacillus.          It is the
species  with   which  I obtained  the  bacterial photographs exhibited in.
 1894, and is very sensitive to light.     The spectroscopic characters of
the pigment were determined, atid the bacillus itself cultivated
under high powers.
    Group   III comprises the common B. fluorescein liauej aciens, very

     418                       Prof. H. Marshall Ward.
     nbundant in the river. Four varieties were isolated and cultivated. It
     is the same as that previously described by P. Frankland as B. viscotut,
    and by Schraolck as B. fluorescein nivalis.            Some of the varieties
     liquefied very feebly or not at all, suggesting that B. fluorescent non-
    liquefaciens may be only a form of the present species, a conclusion
     borne out by comparing the two side by side, on, and in, various
    media.
         Group     IV    comprises    the   non-liquefying   forms of the type
    Z>-.
         fluoresceins non-liquefaciens,   extremely  common    in the river, and of
    which eight were isolated and kept in culture.
         These eight varieties differ in details, but the differences are not
    constant, and their behaviour suggests the identity of several so-
    called species of green fluorescing bacteria, hitherto regarded as
    distinct, e >/., the Bacillus of Lesage, that of Adametz, Lustig's
    B. aquatilisfluorescens, Flugge's B.fluorescensputidus, aud certain forms
    described by Frick and Zimmermann.
        The fact that some of these varieties were pathogenic and some
    not, points to the possibility of there being two species, but as
   experience shows that pathogenicity                varies as well as other
   characters, this could not be relied on, any more than the differences
   in size, colour,. &c.
        Group V embraces a large series of forms comprising the typical
    B. coli communis find a number of varietal and allied forms. Inallsix-
   teen varieties were studied in detail, some of them very closely and for
    long periods. They are common in the river, especially in summer,
   though some of the forms show variations so marked that few
   observers would be likely to suspect their close relationships.             For
   instance, varieties occurred incapable of coagulating milk ; others
   which formed no gas-bubbles in gelatine; others not pathogenic for
   guinea-pigs.        Some other forms, suspiciously like B. coU in other
   respects,     but  forming   capsules, or liquefying gelatine to a greater or
   less extent, are placed in different groups in deference to usually
   received opinion, though I am convinced of their closo relationship.
        High-power cultures show considerable differences in size of
   rodlets, and facts were obtained of value in understanding the very
   great differences observed in the macroscopic characters.
        Group VI comprises a series of forms centering around the type of
   Hauser's Proteus vulgaris, and of which eleven forms were isolated
   and cultivated.
        One of the most striking features of this typo is its variability as
   to liquefying power; another is the concurrent variations in motile
   power of the platc-colunies.             I recognised the types named P.
   mirabilis and P. proteu.i by Hauscr, and during cultures extending
   over three years have convinced myself thiit not only are these and
   his P. Zenkeri merely varieties of the same form differing in liqucfviu"

power, but that they vary in several directions towards powerfully
liquefying forms of the B. termo type, on the one hand, and yellow
chromogenic forms, like Zimmermanu's B. ochraceus and P. Frank-
land's B. arborescens, on the other.
   A careful and prolonged study of the plate-colonies and " wander
           "
ing islets was made under high powers, throwing light not only on
the movements of these colonies over the surface of the gelatine, but
also on the structure of all such colonies as are composed of tresses,
zooglcea-clumps, and contoured groups of filaments, motile or not.
   Drawings were made illustrating the movements and changes in
form of the
              " wandering islets " at intervals, and showing the indi
vidual movements of the bacilli on which these depend.              Evidence is
also given showing     that  the differences  in  size, vigour  of   movement,
and liquefaction, and chromogenic power, depend on the vigour of
the organism as it comes from the river, as well as on variations in
conditions of culture.
   Group   VII  includes seven forms evidently closely allied to the last
group, if really distinct.     They are remarkable for their more or less
pronounced yellow pigment formation, and are termed the yellow
Proteus type.
   I  have identified some of the varieties here collected together as
Zimmermann's B. radiatus and B. ochraceus and P. Frankland's B.
arborescens, and there can be little doubt that other yellow chromo
genic forms described will have to be included.              Among these, a
 number of "non-liquefying" yellow forms may also have to be
counted when they have been sufficiently studied in detail.
   Group   VIII   includes a form which varied so much that I had to
 make   numerous     separation cultures at various periods during the
two years it was kept in culture, to satisfy myself there was no
admixture.      Its most characteristic features were the star-like
character of the plate-colonies and the presence of a bluish irides
cence when held up, but a yellow pigment was also formed in varying
degrees of intensity.      In other characters it comes near Group IX,
on the one hand, and the yellow Proteus type of Group                VII  on the
.other, but its peculiarities   were  so puzzling   that 1 kept  it  apart.
    Group IX comprises a series of golden-yellow liquefying forms, of
which five varieties were studied. The type is that of Zimmermann's
B.fulvus and B. subflavus, and, while they differ in liquefying power,
all form deep chrome-yellow pigment, like yolk of egg. The group
is clearly allied to the yellow Proteus group, and seems to connect
P. Frankland's B. aquatilis and the true Proteus type with B.
arborescens and B. ochraceus, the differences depending largely on the
formation of zoogloea or not.
    Group X consists of a series of very common non-liquefying forms,
of which three varieties were studied in detail. The type appears

 420                    Prof. H. Marshall Ward.
nearest to Adametz's B. aureus and P. Frankland's B. auranliacus.
 They grow very slowly, and seem to be feeble forms. From their
behaviour during culture and comparison with the last group, I am
compelled to regard these non-liquefying yellow forms as merely
weakened varieties of the last group ; this is borne out by the
 tendency to liquefaction shown by some of them after being culti
vated for some time, as well as by the enfeeblement of liquefying
power shown by pome of the older cultures of the yellow Proteus
group. It is probable that they are simply species of the Protens
 group, so weakened by their prolonged sojourn in the river that they
can only be cultivated with difficulty in the new enviroument of the
 gelatine media, &c. This being so, the whole of the series included
iu Groups VI to X inclusive may be varieties of one or two species,
since I find that, great as the differences seem between the extreme
forms, the varieties studied present character passing imperceptibly
into one another. This result is also in accordance with the fact
that fo many yellow varieties, impossible to separate satisfactorily,
 have been isolated from water and described by other observers.
    Group XI is made to include a colourless capsuled form, not very
common in the river, and reminding one of Cohn's Ascococcus. Two
sets of cultures of it were carried out in detail, and a very character
istic feature was discovered in the plate-colonies, viz., the presence
of curious vermiform zooglcea masses imbedded in the colonies;
these arc not intruded forms, but merely growth-phases of tho same
           So far as can be judged, the

species.                                    species
   Group XII comprises a series of yellow capsuled bacilli, not
uncommon in the river, and morphologically conforming to the type
of Friedlander's bacillus.    I cultivated five varieties of it. The most
characteristic feature is tho formation of extremely tough zoogloea-
colonies, often looking like the roe of a fish. There is some variation
in the degree of liquefying power, and much difference in consistency
and other characters, but the sum of all the diagnoses leaves no
doubt that all the forms belong to one species.
   Group   XIII  comprises a series of forms which produce a crimson
pigment. Tho type is that of B. prodigiosus, and five varieties were-
isolated and very closely investigated.        Colourless varieties were
developed in cultivation, and the pigment again restored by suitable
treatment.    Weakened forms, and considerable differences in liquefy
ing power were also found. Koch's B. indicus, Breuuig's Kieler
lacillut, Frank's B. ruber, Dowdeswcll's B. rosaceum metalloides, and
Zimmermann's B. miniaceus are all identical with this form, or, at
least, can be matched by the varieties arising in culture.
   Group XIV comprises a series of rapidly liquefying, colourless
foiins, very common in the river at all times, and conforming to the
 type of B. termo as amended by Mace. I made a prolonged study of

                Report   to the  Water Research Committee.                421
five varieties, and found considerable differences as regards rapidity
of liquefaction, anaSrobism, and other characters. The series includes
Eisenberg's B. liquefaciens, Frankland's B. liquidus, and Zimmer-
mann's B. punctatus and B. devorans, and brings together a large
series of incompletely described forms with more or less probability.
The type is one of the commonest in the Thames, and a pronounced
putrefactive bacterium.
   Group XV includes three varieties not uncommon in the river in
the summer, and conforming to the type of B. subtilis in general
behaviour and in the characters of their highly resistant spores, the
germination of which was carefully traced. The total behaviour of
these varieties points to confusion between the hay bacillus (B. subtilis)
and the potato bacillus (B. mesentericus), and I am driven to the con
                           "        " are either identical or
clusion that these two species                                  more similar
than is usually assumed.       In any case both these forms are matched
by the varieties in this group, which my examination suggests are
varieties of one species.     The wrinkled growth on potato cannot be
relied upon to separate them.
   Group XVI comprises a series of varieties of a yellow Surcina of
the type S. lutea. 1 obtained five varieties, showing considerable
differences in liquefying power, and it was interesting to fird that
                                          "
the Sarcina form — " packet form — is not always maintained.
My cultures unite Frankland's S. liquefaciens, Lindner's 8. flava,
and Schroeter's S. lutea as mere varieties of one and the same
species.
    Group XVII was made for a rose-pink or cerise-coloured micro
coccus of the type of Zimmermann's M. carneus, not common, but
isolated several times in the winter of 1894 — 1895.               The most
interesting point was the discovery that in early stages of division,
followed uuder high powers, it develops as a Sarcina, and several
facta point to the conclusion that the Sarcina form is a mere result
of slow development — e.g., in acid media — of Staphylococcus forms of
Micrococcus.    My cultures unite M. carneus with Maschek's Coccus
ruber, Fliigge's Micrococcus cinnabareus,        Zimmermann's M. cinna-
barinus,  and  certain forms  often termed  M. roseus, as well as Schroter's
Sarcina rosea, as mere varieties of one form.
    Group   XVIII    is made for a curious form which serial cultures
under the high power shows to be no schizomycete at all, but a truly
branching micro-organism with acre-petal growth and other charac
ters which place it in the category of true fungi. Nevertheless it
breaks up into minute coccus-like oidial joints, so similar to a short
bacterium or oval coccus that it would inevitably be taken for such
 if examined by ordinary methods only.         I  referred to it in 1895 as a
 " false bacterium," and its history affords au excellent proof of the
 necessity of microscopic cultures in these investigations.        It presents

undoubted resemblances     to Loffler's  B. diphtheria.    It was not found
to be pathogenic to guinea-pigs by Dr. Kanthack.
   Group  XIX   was made to contain a white micrococcus of tbe type
M. candieans of Fliigge.     It is very common in the river, and was
kept under observation a long time, with interesting results ; for
although typically a non-liquefying form, it becomes capable of lique
fying gelatine in time, and the plate-colonies and other cultures show
variations which lead me to connect M . candieans with Zimmermann's
M. concentricus, Tataroff's " schminkeweisser Streptococcus," and some
other forms, as mere varieties of one and the same species.
   Group XX contains a form only isolated once from the Thames,
but studied very thoroughly in 1894.           It develops lemon-yellow
liquefying colonies on gelatine, and presents close resemblances to
Sarcina lutea, but it is a fairly large bacillus, and no attempt to
convert is into a Sarcina form succeeded.         All efforts to match this
form among those described have failed, though incompletely
examined forms by Maschek, Unna and Tommasoli, and Adametz
present resemblances,    so  far as their imperfect       diagnoses   go.  It
may be necessary to name     it  as a new species.
   Group  XXI   contains two varieties of a short oval form,       or coccus,
principally characterised by the development of a red pigment, vary
ing from pale salmon-pink to deep rosy-scarlet, but also differing in
details of shape and adaptation to temperature, and a few other
points. Nevertheless it was difficult to give the varieties specific
rank on the evidence.           I  have been unable to identify this
form.
    Group XXII comprises two forms, not completely investigated,
 and nearer the type of Group XIV than any others of my groups.
 Both seem common in the river.
    The question of the pathogenicity or otherwise of these forms
 was naturally raised, and was kindly tested for me in several cases
 by Dr. Lazarus Barlow, and at much greater length by Dr. Kanthack,
 through whose hands nearly all the forms have passed.                In the
 following summary pathogenic means           pathogenic to guinea-pigs.
 Pathogenic varieties occurred in Groups IV, V, VI, VIII, XI,           XIII,
XIV, and XVII, with considerable variation in detail, while the other
groups seem to be harmless. The most markedly pathogenic forms
were in Group V (type of B. coli commune).             Those in Group     IV
aroused the suspicion that B. pyocyaneus comes here ; and it is inter
esting to note that B. prodigiosus (Group XIII) was pathogenic in
 some cases.
    Of course no full test of pathogenicity        is afforded by the few
trials made in this way, but the positive results obtained at least
show that a not inconsiderable number of the river bacteria are
pathogenic, or can become so in culture.        Not less important is the

                 Report   to the Water Research Committee.           423
fact that pathogenicity, like the other characters, is variable, as is
abundantly shown by Dr. Kanthack's experiments.
   In conclusion, the results show that —
   1. Very many forms occur in the Thames, some of which are
pathogenic under certain conditions.
   2. The
              " species " of the descriptive hand-books — principally
 medical — arc frequently not species at all, in the botanical sense, but
varieties, or growth-forms, the distinctive characters of which are
not constant. These so-called species need revision and grouping
around types, which may turn out to be the true species.
   3. The characters derived from the behaviour of colonies are not
 sufficient for the determination of species, and how far they may be
employed in conjunction with other characters will only be eluci
dated by advances in our knowledge of the way the colonies are built
up by the growing bacteria on the given media.
    ,4. The effects of definite changes in the environment on the media
are of great importance, but have hardly been noticed as yet. Plate-
colonies on gelatine, for instance, develop quite differently, according
 to the condition of the gelatine ; so that a feeble and slow-growing
bacterium produces colonies quite unlike those developed by the same
species when vigorous and quickly growing, not only owing to its
peculiarities of growth as a feeble form, but also because the gelatine
has altered during the intervening period.
    5. The effect of changes       of the environment on the growing
organism     itself is recognised as important.
    6. With especial reference to the Thames bacteria, the past history
of the organism isolated from the river implies causes of variation.
 The river water is a poor nutritivo medium, and the organism is
exposed to great changes of temperature, light, movement, &c., during
its sojourn therein. Consequently the time it has been iu the river
affects the behaviour of the organism when isolated, just as we know
that a bacterium is affected by the previoiis conditions of its culture
in other media. Hence two colonies on a plate may look very differ
ent, and yet belong to the same species, one being developed from a
cell that had been many days or weeks in the water, the other from
one that had only been there a few hours. It may need weeks or
months of cultivation under constant conditions to establish the
identity of the two.

                 Report   to the Water Research Committee.           423
fact that pathogenicity, like the other characters, is variable, as is
abundantly shown by Dr. Kanthack's experiments.
   In  conclusion, the results show that —
   1. Very many forms occur in the Thames, some of which are
pathogenic under certain conditions.
   2. The " species                 descriptive hand-books — principally
                        " of the
medical — are frequently not species at all, in the botanical sense, but
varieties, or growth-forms, the distinctive characters of which are
not constant. These so-called species need revision and grouping
around types, which may turn out to be the true species.
   3. The characters derived from the behaviour of colonies are not
sufficient for the determination of species, and how far they may be
employed in conjunction with other characters will only be eluci
dated by advances in our knowledge of the way the colonies are built
up by the growing bacteria on the given media.
    4. The effects of definite changes in the enviroument on the media
are of great importance, but have hardly been noticed as yet. Plate-
colonies on gelatine, for instance, develop quite differently, according
to the condition of the gelatine ; so that a feeble and slow-growing
bacterium produces colonies quite unlike those developed by the same
species when vigorous and quickly growing, not only owing to its
peculiarities of growth as a feeble form, but also because the gelatine
has altered during the intervening period.
    5. The effect of changes of the enviroument on the growing
 organism itself is recognised as important.
    6. With especial reference to the Thames bacteria, the past history
of the organism isolated from the river implies causes of variation.
 The river water is a poor nutritive medium, and the organism is
exposed to great changes of temperature, light, movement, &c., during
its sojourn therein. Consequently the time it has been iu the river
affects the behaviour of the organism when isolated, just as we know
that a bacterium is affected by the previous conditions of its culture
in other media. Hence two colonies on a plate may look very differ,
 ent, and yet belong to the same species, one being developed from a
 cell that had been many days or weeks in the water, the other from
 one that had only been there a few hours.        It may need weeks or
 months     of cultivation    under constant conditions to establish the
 identity   of the two.

        Hospital.    Received May 13,— Read June 17, 1897.
     Having some years ago prepared for the purpose of spectroscopic
,examination several uranium compounds, it was of interest to make
 further use of them by repeating some of the very important experi
 ments which Becquerel has made with these compounds.                 He has
shown that if the metal or some of its salts be placed on a photo
 graphic plate in perfect darkness, and allowed to remain there for
some days, the plate becomes acted on, the action being rendered
evident by the ordinary photographic process of development. Tbis
action is readily produced, and belongs apparently to all the salts of
 this metal, and, as Becquerel has shown, to m-anous as well as uranic
 salts. It is very remarkable that this power belongs also to the
 salts when in solution, and, as the action passes through glass, solu
 tions of the double chloride or of the nitrate contained in a thin
 glass bottle, when placed on a photographic plate, act readily upon it.
  While speaking of these compounds it may be well to record some
 experiments which have been made to determine whether they lost
 their peculiar activity on being kept in the dark.
     On the 10th August last, specimens of yellow oxide, recr}-stallised
 nitrate, and chloride, the latter in solution, were each divided into
 two equal portions, and all placed in similar clean thin glass bottles.
 One sample of each was then placed in total darkness, and the other
 kept in the light. These samples have from time to time been tested
  by placing them on a photographic plate for a week and then
 -developing the plate in the usual manner. Seven such examinations
  have been made at about one month's interval.              No very marked
  difference between the samples in the light and the dark has occurred :
 on the whole the samples preserved in the dark have proved slightlv
  the most active, and tlm was decidedly the case with all three
  specimens at the last examination on March 26.              Another experi
  ment was begun     a  little  later with the  black oxide of uranium, which
 appears    to be   one   of   the  most  active  of the uranium compounds;
  -equal weights of a sample of this body were placed in two similar
  >pill-boxes with a glass bottom ; one has been kept in the dark, and
   the other in the light; after five months there was no difference in
  the effect which they produced on the photographic plate (Plate 2).
  The experiments are being continued. When repeating these different
   uranium experiments and using a card painted with the yellow oxide,
  perforated zinc was made use of simply as a screen to show the

         Metals and other Substances on a Photographic Plate.           425

negative of the perforated zinc, i.e., the action occurring where the
plate was exposed, and none where covered by the zinc, tho reverse
took place, and the greatest amount of action occurred underneath
the zinc. This happened over and over again, and even when the
experiment was varied in different ways, so that the only explanation
of the action was that the zinc itself must be able to effect a change
of the same kind as the uranium, at all events, to act on a photo
graphic plate, and further experiment with zinc alone proved this to
be the case; later on it became known to mo that R. Colson had
                                                                  '
already described this action of zinc iti a paper in the            Comptcs
         '
Rendus     in January last, and had also found that similar results
could be obtained with cadmium and with magnesium.                       He
explains this remarkable action as due to vapour given off by these
metals.
    Both before and after seeing the account of Colson's work a large
number of experiments have been made with zinc under different
conditions, and there is no doubt of the ease and certainty with
which the results can be obtained. The zinc, as C0I3011 states, must
bo bright ; if well rubbed with coarse sand-paper it is most active :
probably this may, to some extent, arise from increase of surface ; if
cleaned with acid or with caustic alkali it is not so active, and zinc in
its ordinary condition after exposure to the air ceases to be active.
The salts alsp have no power of acting in this way.             A polished
piece of zinc laid on a highly sensitive photographic plate will, under
certain conditions even in four or five hours, so act on it that on
development a complete picture of the zinc is produced, showing
the scratches or any ruled lines or faint pattern drawn on it,
or if flaws in the metal exist they are clearly seen. A slight
pattern produced on zinc by pressing on it a piece of white net and
then rubbing it down with fine emery or sand-paper will give a
picture in which the pattern is very evident. In fact, such a pattern
 forms a satisfactory tost of this action of the zinc. Very slight altera
tions of the surface are shown in the picture.         Absolute contact of
metal   and  plate-is not necessary.   If screens  of different thicknesses
of any inactive substance be interposed between plate and metal,
thus preventing contact, the action still occurs ; if the screen be
very thin, a picture of the zinc surface is still obtained, but if
thicker, only a dark cloudy patch is formed.           Still further, if a
thick piece   of glass tubing an  inch long   be placed on a photographic
plate, and the upper end covered with a piece of polished zinc, in a
 week to a fortuight distinct action will be found to have taken place
 below the zinc. Since the action thon is not one of mere contact,
 the next point was to ascertain whether it would be transmitted
                                                               2 h 2

426      Dr. W.   J. Russell.    On the Action exerted by certain
through different solid or liquid media.      Glass, even of the thinnest
kind, was found to stop the action, but many other substances allow
of its transmission.      For instance, the action takes place readily
through celluloid, sheet gelatine gutta-percha tissue, collodion, vege
table parchment, real parchment, gold-beater's skin, tracing paper,
and no doubt many other bodies.           With all these bodies experi
ments   have   been  made  by placing the  medium first in contact with
the zinc and the photographic plate, then by introducing a screeu so
as to prevent the medium from touching the zinc, and then placing a
second screen so that neither zinc nor plate were in contact with
the medium.       The screens were made of different materials, most
commonly      of either  white cardboard or sheet indiarubber, and of
different thicknesses.     The details of each experiment need not be
here described,    but  the general results obtained are that with thin
sheet gelatine, either red, green, or blue when laid on the zinc, the
action readily passes through, and a good clear picture of the surface
of the zinc is obtained, and even with two sheets of gelatine a
similar effect is produced. With thick sheet gelatine interposed
the action on the plate still takes place, but of course the ex
posure must be longer.        Warm solutions of gelatine were painted
on polished zinc and allowed to harden ; the action took place
through such layers as readily as through the films. With screens
used as before described to prevent contnet the gelatine still allowed
the action to take place through it.      Thin sheets of celluloid about
0'28 mm. in thickness allowed the action to take place through them,
and sheets 0'8l mm. in thickness also allowed the action to be trans
mitted. Again, gutta-percha tissue was found to act in the same
kind of way as the gelatine and celluloid.      The other media experi
mented with, although possibly not so uniform and continuous in
structure as the foregoing, also allow this action to be transmitted to-
them.
   Gold-beater's skin and tracing paper both allow the action readily
to pass through, and pictures of the zinc are readily obtained.         If
either of these bodies be placed between a piece of perforated zinc
and the plate, the perforations are very distinctly shown, or if they
be placed between a double screen with corresponding holes cut, a
picture of the holes is readily obtained.
    Both vegetable and real parchment are also transparent to this
 action, but not so much so as the previously-mentioned substances -r
 the vegetable parchment is more transparent than real parchment.
 When in contact with the zinc a picture of the zinc surface is
 obtained, but this is somewhat modified by the substance of the
parchmen t.
    If different kinds of ordinary papers, such as writing and drawing
 papers, be interposed between polished zinc and a photographic

         Metals and other Salislances on a Photographic Plate.         427
plate, interesting results are obtained, for the pictures formed
show clearly the structure of the papers, and also show that papers
have very different powers of transmitting this action.            Certain
writing papers     are  quite opaque  to the action ; with others pictures
of the structure and the watermark are easily obtained.
   The painting a paper with India ink does not destroy its trans
parency.     Obviously pictures of bodies, such as skeleton leaves or
dried flowers, &c., are easily obtained in this way.
   A mere difference of colour does not appear to alter the absorptive
power of a medium ; at least, this is the case with gelatine. The thin
sheets of gelatine, whether red, green, or blue, have no difference in
their absorptive power, and when gelatine, coloured with aniline dyes,
is painted on polished zinc, the colour docs not affect the amount of
action which takes place.       The same thing happens if demy paper
be painted with different coloured solutions of gelatine.       With ordi
nary pigments     different  results are  obtained, but these results need
not be discussed on the present occasion.
    In addition to the metals cadmium and magnesium, mentioned by
M. Colson, there are certainly many others which are able to produce
effects similar to that produced by zinc.         There are also certain
alloys   which  can  act in the same  way.   The  following is a rough list
of active metallic bodies approximately in the order of their activity :
 mercury, magnesium, cadmium, zinc, nickel, aluminium, pewter,
 fusible metal, lead, bismuth, tin, cobalt, antimony.
    The above order, even if not absolutely correct, is sufficiently so
 to indicate that, although mercury is the most active, the other
 metals do not follow in the order of their fusibility or exactly accord
 ing to any obvious physical property, but most nearly according to
 their position in the electrical series     Mercury is, then, at ordinary
 temperatures the most active metal, and its action is exercised not
only when the photographic plate is placed half an inch or so above
 the metal, but when gelatine, gutta-percha, tracing paper, vegetable
 parchment, are interposed. It appears, however, that the action of
 the mercury does not take place as readily through gelatine, but more
 readily through gutta-percha than is the case with zinc.
    Magnesium is also a very active metal, and very good pictures,
 showing every scratch on its surface, are easily obtained ; also very
 marked effects are produced when both single and double screens are
 used.    Cadmium also produces very good pictures, and is rather
more    active than zinc ; nickel and aluminium are not quite so active,
 but give good pictures ; then follow lead, bismuth, and tin. The
 last metal is by far the least active. Only a few alloys have at
 present been experimented with ; brass gives no action, but ordinary
 pewter, and fusible metal, consisting of lead, bismuth, and tin,
 were found to have considerable activity, and are placed in the
                                                                            W

 428      Dr. W. J.  Russell.     On the Action exerted by certain
 list between aluminium and lead.        That certain alloys should act in
 the same way as the metals is certainly of interest, and probably of
 considerable importance.      The oxide and sulphate, both of zinc and
 cadmium, were found to be devoid of any power of acting on the
 photographic plate. Iron, gold, and platinum, are not active, and
 copper only very slightly. All the above results are founded on
 experiments in which the exposure lasted for one week ; with longer
 exposure other metals will probably produce some action.
    In order to determine whether moisture was an active agent either
 directly by affecting the medium or indirectly by affecting the photo
 graphic plate, experiments were made by exposing the plates under
 bell-jars, in which in one case there was water, and in the other
 sulphuric acid or calcium chloride, and even in these extreme cases
 no appreciable difference was found to occur, and even if the
 membrane was purposely damped it did not appear to aid the action
 except by bringing it closer to the metal, so that aqueous vapour is
 not apparently an active agent in produciug these reactions.        In an
atmosphere of hydrogen        the  action  takes  place  as it does in air.
 Carbon dioxide, under ordinary conditions, does produce an effect,
 but this probably arises from its action on the zinc plate. Altera
tion of temperature produces very marked effects ; increase the
 temperature, and the action of the zinc is greatly increased ; for
 instance, two similar plates, both wrapped in tinfoil and the
plates separated from the zinc by means of a cardboard frame.
 One was placed on a water bath and exposed to a temperature of
about 70° C., and the other placed in a vessel of ice at 0° C. After
five hours the one which had been exposed to the high temperature
had given a black picture, while the one at the low temperature gave
a picture barely visible.    A similar experiment was also made with
nickel, and this gave, after heating to about 70°, a good dark picture,
but the corresponding experiment, when the metal was kept at 0°
for five hours, gave no picture at all. Aluminium, when treated iu
the same way, gave at the higher temperature only a faint picture,
but at the lower temperature, even after two days, no picture at all.
It has already been mentioned that this action of the metals cannot
pass through even thin glass, nor can it pass through selenite, nor a
layer of gum arabic, nor one of paraffin. Glass being impervious to
the action, renders it somewhat difficult to try satisfactorily the
action exerted by liquids, but celluloid may be used for this purpose ;
also mercury may be covered with a thin layer of water, and then its
action entirely ceases. The action of certain salts in the dry state
has, however, been tried by soaking non-glazed paper in different
solutions, drying it, and then placing it, either with or without a
screen, between the zinc and the photographic plate. These experi
ments have given some interesting results ; for instance, paper

        Metals and other Substances on a Photographic Plate.               42if
soaked in the following solutions, alum, potassium chromate, zinc
sulphate, and quinine sulphate, renders the paper quite opaque to the
action of the zinc.
   No doubt this action of alum accounts for certain papers not
allowing the action to pass through them. Some singular develop
ments of this subject have arisen from experiments made while
examining the metals.        A piece of polished zinc was coated with
copal varnish with the object of ascertaining whether the action
would take place through such a medium, and in case it did, as it
was thought at the time, of demonstrating that the action could nor,
arise from metal vapour. The experiment was quite successful ; the
photographic plate, notwithstanding the varnish, was strongly acted
on.    The experiment was repeated several times, and always with the
same result ; but the pictures seemed rather too good, darker than
those given by the zinc alone, and on trying the copal on plain glass
instead of on zinc it proved that effects apparently similar to those
obtained with zinc were produced. What is known as picture copal
answers very well for these experiments. That prepared by Winsor
&> Newton     has been used.       This is painted or poured on a clean,,
warm glass plate, and allowed to harden completely. The plate can
then be used in the same way as tho zinc plates.            If a photographic
plate  be laid  on  the hardened   varnish   for two  to seven  days, a picture
of the varnish, showing the streaks it happens to have dried
in, is produced. If screens be interposed so as to prevent con
 tact between the copal and the plate, the action still occurs, and, in
fact, readily passes down a tube 1 inch long. Therefore, as with the
 zinc, any figure cut out in an inactive screen is readily produced on the
 photographic plate.      Substances which are transparent or opaque to
 the action  of  the  metal3 seem to act in the same way towards copal.
It is rather more active than zinc. Glass is perfectly impervious to
its action, but celluloid, gutta-percha tissue, and gelatine it per
 meates more readily than zinc does.         The activity of the copal varies
considerably under different conditions.           If the powdered gum be
 sprinkled on   a  glass plate  and then   fused, it is not so active as when
 picture varnish is used.     If the solid gum be dissolved in pure alcohol
 and ether, and applied to a glass plate as before described, it is far
 more active than after fusion.      Heating it in a water bath for a con
 siderable length of time certainly deprives it of a considerable
 amount of its activity ; but this can be revived by wetting it with
 ether and allowing it again to dry at ordinary temperatures. As -
 with zinc, increase of temperature increases its activity to a great
 extent. Experiments similar to those with zinc were made with
 copal. A coated glass was exposed to a heat of about 70°, and &
 similar one was kept at 0°. This one after five hours gave only a
 faint picture, whereas the heated one gave a dark picture, and a con

430      Dr. W.   J. Russell.  On the Action exerted by certain
 siderable amount of action took place even throngh the cardboard
 screen.    Many other bodies of the same nature as copal act in the
 same way.     This has been proved to be the case with Damar and
 with Canada balsam, but copal seems to be the best representative of
 the class.   Certain gums, such as gum arabic, gum Senegal, have not
 the property of acting in this way. There are, however, a large
number of bodies which have the power of acting in a manner
 similar to the copal ; one of these is wood, and it possesses a very
considerable amount of activity.     Any ordinary smooth piece of wood
 laid on a photographic plate will act like zinc in impressing its
picture on the plate.
    A section of a young larch tree gave a good picture showing
clearly the different rings and the layer of bark, which was the
darkest part of the picture.        The same section, when a film of
gelatine was interposed between it and the plate, still gave a good
picture.    Wood which is thoroughly dried and hardened is also able
to act in the same way.
    A piece of mahogany 3'5 mm. thick, which had been in this
form for at least thirty-five years and been carefully preserved in
a dark cupboard, gave after a week's exposure a good picture,
and the bottom of an old cigar-box acted equally well.            Bodies
such as straw, hay, bamboo, oiled silk, and, no doubt, many others,
act in the same way. If wood, however, be painted with melted
paraffin, it is no longer active. Ordinary charcoal also depicts
itself on a photographic plate, but if it be heated for some hours
in a covered crucible it loses this property. An ordinary piece of
wood, if it be charred on one side by heating it with a Bunsen
lamp, becomes remarkably active, as shown by placing it behind
a screen with a pattern cut out.     The action passes readily through
different media, such as gelatine, tracing paper, &c., vegetable
parchment, &c., and the structure of the charcoal is shown, when
the action has taken place, even through a sheet of vegetable
parchment.      Coal and coke, sulphur, sugar, on the other hand,
exert no action of this kind.      When trying whether a copy of a
lithographic picture could be obtained by placiug behind it a plate
of zinc, some curious results occurred.     It would seem that printer's
ink in most cases is not capable of acting, like copal, on a photo
graphic plate, but that there are many cases in which it is a remark
ably active substance.    Specially so is the ink used in printing many
of the newspapers.       The ' Westminster Gazette,' for instance, is
printed with an ink which very readily acts on a photographic plate.
A portion of this paper with printing on only one side, laid with
the blauk side on the photographic plate, in a few days gives a
remarkably black and distinct picture.         If there be printing on
both sides, then two pictures are obtained, the darker printing

          Metals and other Substances on a Photographic Plate.       431
 becoming most evident on whichever side it may be. Interpose a
 sheet, for instance, of gold-beater's skin, and still the picture is
              The ' Standard     and ' Daily Graphic
                               '                       '

 active, and the ' Times only a little less so. The Evening News
 is only slightly active, and the ' Morning Post,' ' Pall Mall,' ' Echo,'
                    '
 and ' Daily News have not the property of acting in this way ; at
 least, those copiea experimented with had not.    An admission ticket
 to the Society of Arts laid on a photographic plate, the ink away
from the plate, also gave a very distinct picture.
    Another singular case of an action of this kind was met with
 when experimenting with the uranium salts. Not having a sufficient
number of small, clear glass bottles for a certain set of experiments,
one of the compounds, the black oxide, was placed in a pill-box,
 believing that the action of the uranium would take place through
the bottom of the box, and on developing the plate a dark circular
space where it had stood was visible.     The experiment was, there
fore, considered very satisfactory, and, with different salts and for
different objects, it was several times repeated.         Ultimately it
seemed evident that the uranium salts acted more strongly when in
pill-boxes than in any other way, and on placing a pill-box without
any uranium salt in it on a photographic plate it was found that
action had occurred, as shown by the dark circular space produced.
    The experiment was repeated over and over again, with the result
that most pill-boxes have the power of acting on a photographic
plate.     Both new and old pill-boxes from different sources were
experimented with, and almost all of them found to be active.
There are, however, exceptions, and these, it was noticed, were
always the more expensive and elaborate boxes.            On examining
the structure of a pill-box it was found that it is usually made of
what is known as strawboard, covered with a thin white paper ;
on separately testing these two materials it was apparent that
the white paper was without action on the plate, and that the
strawboard was very active and produced exactly similar effects to
those produced by the active pill-boxes.     The inactive ones proved
to be made of white cardboard, which is not an active substance.
Samples of strawboard from several different sources have been
tried, and all found to be active, and when separated from the
photographic plate by means of screens, like the copal and the zinc,
it gives a clear action. Different substances of a like nature have
been tried, such as brown papers, &c. Some of them are more or
less active, but none more so than common strawboard.         Mr. Bevan
was good enough to examine a piece of this active strawboard, but
was unable to find any material other than straw present.       Writing
paper and, as mentioned before, white cardboard have not this power
of acting on a photographic plate, but many kinds of brown paper
                                                                            s~

432'    Action of certain Metals,   §c, on a Photographic   Plate.
and no doubt many other bodies have the property.           Many of the
boxes in which photographic plates are packed are made of straw-
board, but as the action does not pass through glass, the plates are
but little or not at all acted on ; but if a plate be laid face upwards
in one of these boxes and left thero for a week it will be very appre
ciably affected.    If a small piece of glass be laid on the plate, it
protects  the  film   beneath, and shows clearly the amount of action
which has occurred.         If a box of this kind be painted inside
with melted paraffin, this action does not take place. It happened
that a few months before making the above experiments others
were in progress in which black net was placed on a photographic
plate simply to show clearly whether the plate had been acted on,
and continually a reversed picture was obtained ; this at the time
could not be accounted for, but now the experiment was made of
simply placing the black net on the photographic plate and leaving
it there for some days ; then on development a clear picture of the
net was produced. The action is due to some material in the black
dye, for white net does not act in the same way.
   The action of the vapour from a few liquids on a sensitive plate has
been tried. The plate was placed about half an inch above the liquid,
and a screen, with holes cut in it, was fastened against the plate.
Methylated spirit acted slightly on the plate ; pure alcohol and ether
had no action ; benzene, coal-tar, crude wood spirit, linseed oil also,
had no action, but turpentine and oil of cloves produced a slight
amount of action.
   Such, in outline, is an account of the experiments which have
already been made on this subject.           One point has led on to
another, and some of the results were so unexpected that the experi
ments had to be repeated many times before full credence could be
given to them.      On the present occasion it is desired to do little
more than record facts ; further experiments, it is hoped, may lead to
explanations not now evident. The supposition that all these active
substances, the metals as well as organic bodies, give off a vapcnr
capable of acting on a photographic plate, naturally suggests itself,
and that copal does give off a vapour which directly or indirectly is
active there can be no doubt.        At the same time, it is at least
difficult to suppose that the activity of such a body as strawboard
should, after the treatment it has undergone, give off at ordinary
temperatures sufficient vapour to produce the effects described, and
the same applies to old dry wood, &c. Still more interest attaches
to the action of the metals; do they emit a vapour so delicate in con
stitution and in such a quantity that it can readily permeate celluloid
gelatine, &c., and produce a picture of the surface from whence it
came, or is it a form of energy (possibly what has been called dark
light) that these bodies emit ? Zinc kept and polished in the dark

         Behaviour    of H and   K Lines    of Spectrum of Calcium.     433
 loses  none   of its activity.   An experiment has been made with the
 object  of reflecting  the zinc action  from glass.  This did not succeed ;
 whether this arose from the glass not being capable of effecting such
 a reflection, or whether a fortuight was not sufficient time to produce
 in this way a visible effect, is not known, but the experiment is being
 repeated.    A photographio plate, suspended film upwards over a
 copal plate, was acted on round the edges in the way one would
 imagine a vapour to act. A similar experiment is being made over a
 zinc plate. The action of glass proves that there is at least a marked
 difference between the action exerted by metallic uranium and that
 by zinc and other metals.
    It should be stated that it is only the most sensitive photographic
plates which, without extremely long exposures, give the results
 described. The Mawson plate has generally been used in the fore
going experiments, but the Ilford special rapid plate acts equally
well, and Edwards' isochromatic suap-shot plates are particularly
sensitive to the action of the uranium salts.         Lumiere's extra rapid
are not so sensitive as the Mawson and Ilford plates, and still less
sensitive are the same firm's plates for yellow and green, and for red
 and yellow.      Other sensitive plates have not been experimented
with.
   On the Relative Behaviour of the H and K lines of the

       Spectrum of Calcium."            By William Huggins, D.C.L.,

    The remarkable relative behaviour of the lines in the spectra of
certain substances as they appear at and near the sun's limb, and in
the atmospheres of stars of different classes, has long been before
our minds as a problem of great interest, which there is reason to
believe is capable of solution by the methods of the laboratory, and
on which we have worked from time to time for many years.
Without waiting for the results of other researches which are in
progress, we think that it is desirable to put on record some definite
results on the behaviour of the lines of calcium, which appear to us
to be conclusive, and of great importance in forming a correct inter
pretation of many solar and stellar phenomena.
   As early as 1872, Professor Young from a few weeks' work at
Sherman on the spectra of the chromosphere and of the prominences,
was able to point out that " the selection of lines seems most capri
cious; one is taken and another is left, though belonging to the same
element, of equal intensity, and close beside the, first." Especially
he noticed that while the H and K Hnes of calcium are almost always

434    Dr. W. Huggins and Mrs. Huggins.                   Relative Behaviour
observable, the strong blae line as well as the other lines of this
metal are very seldom seen. In his table of the chromospheric lines
 Professor Young gives for the frequency of this strong blue line the
 small number 3 ; while for the frequency of H and K, he gives

   From 1863, when mapped the spectrum of calcium with a strong
spark from metallic calcium*         I  have constantly used the lines of
calcium as a comparison spectrum in stellar work. The experience
was familiar to me that as the quantity of calcium salt on the elec
trodes became very small, H and K continued strong even when the
other calcium lines had almost disappeared. The suggestion then
occurred to roe, that this behaviour of the lines might furnish a clue
to the phenomena which take place near the sun's limb.
   We were encouraged to use this experience as a guiding thought
in the experiments about to be described, by the consideration that
in the higher solar regions, where H and K appeared alone of the
calcium lines, the density must be much less than at the lower level of
the reversing layer. It seemed very probable that in the simple fact
of difference of density, lay the true explanation of the modifications
of the calcium spectrum as they are presented to ns in solar and
stellar phenomena.
   The problem before us was, therefore, to find out by experiments
in the laboratory, under what conditions the lines of calcium other
than the lines H and K, and in particular the strong blue line at
4226-9, were so greatly enfeebled relatively to H and K, that they
became quite insignificant, or even disappeared altogether from the
spectrum, leaving the very simple spectrum of the two lines H and
K, or nearly so.
   Professor Lockyer states that : — " Some of the substances which
have been investigated, including iron, calcium, and magnesium,
have probably a definite spectrum, consisting of a few lines, which
can only be completely produced at a temperature higher than any
which is at present available in laboratory experiments."                ('Boy.
Soc. Proc.,' vol. 61, p. 205.)
   In the case of calcium : —
   "(4) A spectrum consisting of the two lines at 370S-18 and
3737'08 and the H and K lines, corresponding to a temperature
higher than the average temperature of the spark, as before ex
plained."    (Ibid., p. 161.)
   Such a spectrum was not actually obtained, but experiments with
a large intensity coil suggested that by a still greater increase of
intensity of the spark such a simple spectrum might appear. The
intensity of the strong blue line was reduced to one half of H and K.

          of the  H and K Lines   of the Spectrum of Calcium.       435
   Kayser and Runge found 106 lines of the calcium spectrum to
belong to the series of triplets ; among the remaining lines they
pointed out pairs with constant differences of wave-frequencies.
Notably H and K, with a difference of wave-frequency of 222-9,
and the more refrangible pair at 3737-08 and 370618, with a differ
 ence 2231.
   Messrs. Humphreys and Mohler in their experiments on the effect
of pressure on the wave-lengths of metallic lines, found that in tho
case of calcium, the H and K lines were shifted only one-half as
much as the blue line at 4226'9.    We know far too little to justify
us in forming any theoretical conclusions from this peculiarity of
behaviour.     Indeed there are no certain reasons why the lines of any
substance should be equally shifted.
   It is well known that calcium, in common with nearly all sub
stances, gives a more complex spectrum under the conditions of the
arc and spark than under those of a flame.      Now in the Fraunhofer
lines we have, as first shown by Kirchhoff and Bunsen, absorption
spectra of the elements which correspond, speaking broadly, with those
of the bright-lined spectra of the same substances as they are pro
duced by the spark. In order, therefore, to study the modifications
which the calcium undergoes in the higher regions of the chromo
sphere, in the prominences, and possibly in lower parts of the corona,
as well as in tho atmospheres of stars of different orders, it was
clearly desirable that we should start with an ordinary spark spec-
trum.    It was suggested to us strongly by the known rarer state of
the gases in the regions above the photosphere, as well as by my
long experience with the behaviour of calcium in comparison spectra
that the modifications of the calcium spectrum which we were seeking,
would be likely to show themselves under conditions of greatly
reduced density of the calcium vapour.
                              Experiments.
   For reasons which will be obvious later on, we elected to use
throughout the experiments a spark of very small intensity.
   1. The break of a 6-inch Apps coil was fixed at the position of
smallest acting force of the spring.      So much battery power only
was employed as would be just sufficient to move the break. Under
these conditions, when a jar was not in connection, the feeble spark
would not pass when the distance between the points exceeded
1^ inches.
   2. In all the experiments a jar was intercalated.
   3. The same length of exposure, a very s\\ort one oi a sccoui awl
a half, sufficient to bring out only tho strongest lines oi t\vo spec-
trum, was used in each experiment.

   4.  Two sets of similar experiments were made; in one case with
electrodes of platinum, and in the other with electrodes of iron.       In
the latter case the chief lines of iron were present with those of
calcium.
     Method adopted  for reducing the Density of  the  Calcium Vapour.
   (a) The spark was taken between electrodes of metallic calcium.
It was assumed, as was confirmed by the appearance of the spark,
that with metallic calcium for electrodes, the largest amount of
calcium vapour would be present.
   (h) The tips of the electrodes, iron or platinum, were slightly
moistened with a strong solution of calcic chloride.
   (c) The tips were slightly washed with pure water.
   (d) The tips were again washed with pure water.
   (e) The tips were then slightly moistened with a very weak solution,
made by adding a drop of the strong solution to 2 ounces of water.
   Our expectations were completely confirmed. Under the condi
tions (a) of greatest density of the calcium vapour, when metallic
calcium was employed, the blue line was as strong and possessed the
same diffusa character as H and K.
   As the density of calcium was reduced, the lines were not found to
bo equally enfeebled, but, on the contrary, the blue line and the greater
number of the lines were increasingly reduced in intensity relatively
to H and K, until at last with the twice washed electrodes (d) the
spectrum was simplified to the condition usually existing in the pro
minences, in which H and K only are present.
   We now proceed to a more precise statement of the changes of
relative intensity as they are presented in the photographs which
accompany this paper.
         Description of the Photographs  on the Plate.   (Plate 4.)
   A. Photograph     of the spark when both electrodes consist of
metallic calcium.     Here we have present doubtless the largest
amount and greatest density of calcium vapour.                The winged
character of H and K, of the blue line, and of the pair more refran
gible than H and K, is well seen, showing that this appearance
comes out when the gas is dense.        If the greater extension of the
wings of H is allowed for, and the line H carefully distinguished
from the fine lines close to it, it will be seeu to possess very nearly
the same strength, both as regards width and length, as the blue line
at 422G'9. The strength of this blue line under this condition of
density is about the same as that of the line at 3737, and rather
greater than the line beyond at 3706.

           of the  H and K Lines  of the Spectrum  of  Calcium.    437
    B. . Spark taken with one electrode only of metallic calcium, the
other electrode being of platinum.        In this case the effect of a
smaller density of the calcium vapour is clearly shown in the greatly
reduced wingedness of the lines. It wilh be remarked that the
diminished density has had the greatest influence on the pair at 3737
and 3706; these Hues are now much less strong than the blue line,
which still holds its own, and remains about as strong ns H and K.
The lines of the more refrangible pair are no longer diffuse at the
edges.
    C. Spark taken between platinum electrodes moistened with a
strong solution of calcium chloride.      Here the effect of a smaller
quantity of vapour begins to tell strongly upon the intensity of the
blue line relatively to H and K. It may now be estimated at less
than one-fourth of the intensity of H. At the same time, H and K
 have almost completely lost their diffuse character, and have become
 thinner and more defined.
     D. The electrodes as left in the former experiment were slightly
 washed with pure water, leaving a trace only of calcium chloride.
 There is, as might be expected, an advance in ttie enfeeblement of
 the blue lino and of the more refrangible pair, relatively to H and K.
     E. The electrodes were again slightly washed with pure water, so
 that a still smaller trace of calcium chloride must have remained
 upon them.       The enfeeblement of the blue line and of the pair has
  now become very great, while 11 and K, though thinner, remain
  strong.
     F. The electrodes were once more washed with pure water,
  reducing still further the trace of calcium chloride which remained
  upon the platinum wires. The blue line has now practically dis
  appeared, and the refrangible pair become very thin. The H and
  K lines have become thin and defined, as they usually present them
  selves in the prominences.
     G. The electrodes remaining as they were left after the last experi
  ment (F), the spark was taken upon a background consisting of a
  faint solar spectrum. The blue line has now completely disappeared,
  leaving H and K strong.
     H. Once more the electrodes were washed, with the expectation of
  having removed completely the last remaining trace of calcium. To
  our surprise, when the photograph was developed, the lines H and
  K came out alone. The more refrangible pair had now faded out as
  well as the blue line. H and K were now thin, and extended but
  a short distauce in the spectrum.
     It must be remembered that the only condition which was varied
  during this set of experiments was the amount or density of the
  calcium vapour.      The changes of relative intensity, and the modifi
  cations of the calcium spectrum produced thereby as shown in the

438        Dr. W. Huggins and Mrs. Huggins.       Relative Beliaviour
succession     of photographs on the plate, correspond closely to the
  behaviour of calcium at different levels near the sun's limb, and in
  the atmospheres of stars of different orders. There can remain little
  doubt that the true interpretation of the changes in appearance of
 the calcium lines in the celestial bodies is to be found in the different
 states of density of the celestial gases from which the lines are
  emitted or by which they are absorbed.
     A similar set of experiments was made with iron electrodes.
 Precisely similar results as to the relative enfeeblement of the lines,
 as with calcium chloride on platinum electrodes, were obtained.        Of
 course the iron lines were also present.      As might be anticipated, in
 consequence of the simultaneous presence of the iron vapour, the
 lines of calcium were thinner than when platinum was used.
     Outside the range of wave-lengths which could be conveniently
 given on the plate, far on in the ultra-violet, there is a pair of strong
 lines which behave very much as H and K. It remains visible in
 photograph H, when the pair at 3737 and 3706 have disappeared.
 This pair is situated at 3158-98 and 3179'45.
    It is desirable to point out again that all the photographs on the
 plate and the far ultra-violet lines, were obtained with a spark of
 quite unusually small intensity, which was purposely made as little
 hot as possible, in order to emphasize the important fact that the deter
 mining condition of the spectral changes under discussion is not one
 of increase of temperature.
    In the modifications of the calcium spectrum arising from varia
 tions in the relative intensities of the lines which have been discussed
in this paper, and which correspond to those observed in the celestial
 bodies, there does not appear to us any reason for assuming, much
less any direct evidence in favour of, a true dissociation of calcium,
that is, of its resolution into chemically different kinds of matter.
    It would be remarkable   if,  by decomposition through increase of
temperature,     a large  number  of lines of a spectrum should become
relatively enfeebled, and that as the result of decomposition a
spectrum should become simpler, and not as analogy would suggest,
more complex.
    It of importance to keep in mind that the recent chemical use
      is
of the word dissociation is not equivalent to true decomposition, i.e.,
to a resolution of the original substance into two or more chemically
different kinds of matter. It may, and does often mean not more
than a different arrangement of the parts of the molecule, while
those parts are all chemically matter of the same kind as the
original molecule. As in the case of the resolution of a com
pound molecule of peroxide of nitrogen into two identical half
molecules or, in the separation of a molecule of elementary
            ;
iodine into two half molecules or atoms of identical chemical

           of the H and K Lines     of the Spectrum   of Cahnum.       439
 characters.    Such dissociations are well known, and are not of
 infrequent occurrence, and may, indeed, take place in connection
 with some of the spectral changes of a substance observed under
 different conditions.  On the other hand, a true decomposition of a
 chemical element, that is, a breaking up of the molecule into simpler
 and quite other kinds of matter, though a notion familiar to chemists
 since Prout's time, and regarded as theoretically possible, is, as yet,
 unknown as a matter of fact.
                                Conclusions.
    These experiments seem to us to furnish an adequate and consistent
explanation of the behaviour of the calcium lines at and near the
 sun's limb.     Near the photosphere where the absorption mainly
takes place, by which the dark lines of the solar spectrum are
formed, there would be, we should expect, a much greater density of
calcium vapour than at a higher level, and we find the Fraunhofer
line at 4226'9 strong but much less broad than H and K. The
recent photograph of the reversing layer shows that the broad
shading of H and K is not produced there, but probably, as Prof.
Jewell concludes from his measures, lower down where the gas is
still denser, which is in agreement with photograph A on the plate.
    Higher up in the chromosphere, in the prominences, and possibly
in the lower coronal regions, the decrease of the density of the gases
composing them must be rapid, and the temperature gradient as
determined by expansion must be also rapid. We have clearly to do,
in these regions, with calcium vapour in a rarer state, and except so
far as the molecules may have carried up within themselves to some
extent the higher heat of a lower level, or through imperfect trans
parency, the gases may have received heat from the sun's radiation,
it must be at a much lower temperature than near the photosphere.
Now, the changes of the calcium spectrum which take place in these
regions, are those which correspond in our experiments to a very
small amount of calcium vapour, and a spark of small intensity.
    On acconnt of the violent commotion which must exist through
the strong convection currents at the sun's limb, we should not be
surprised to find some calcium vapour, notwithstanding its greater
density, carried high up together with the lighter substances such as
hydrogen and helium.      Our experiments show how strongly the H
and K lines may come out when a trace only of calcium vapour is
present, and so, it seems to us, offer a possible explanation of the great
height at which these lines may be sometimes recognised. At no
very great distance from the surface of the sun the gases must
become too tenuous to give a visible spectrum; but it may well be that
the brilliant radiations of even very rare calcium gas at H and K

                                                 have become too subtle
to furnish spectrum that we can detect.
          a
   The relative behaviour of the lines of the calcium spectrum as they
present themselves in the different orders of stellar spectra when
interpreted by the terrestrial experiments described in this paper,
will throw much light on many of the important questions which
are still pending in celestial physics.    In forming conclusions as to
the state of the stellar atmospheres from the different densities which
may be indicated by the modifications of the calcium spectrum,                            it-
must be borne in mind that, as have said elsewhere —
                                      I                                     :
   " The conditions of the radiating photosphere and those of the
gases above it, on which the character of the spectrum of the star
 depends, will be determined not alone by temperature, but also                           by
the force of gravity in these regions    this force will be fixed by the
                                              ;
star's mass  and its stage of condensation,  and will become greater as
the star continues to condense."*
   It may be, though on this point we have as yet no sufficient data,
 that though the stars are built up of matter essentially similar to that
of the sun, the proportion of the different elements      not the same in
                                                                       is
stars which have condensed in parts of the heavens widely distant
from each other, or at epochs greatly separated in time.
   It does not seem desirable to discuss any of these questions at the
present time, as we hope before long to offer some explanation of
the, to some extent analogous, relative behaviour of the lines of
some other substances as observed in the sun and stars.
    [The following letter from our friend Professor Liveing, which he
has given us permission to publish, contains an account of early
experiments on the spectrum of calcium which not only support, by
a different method of working, the conclusions of our paper, but also
seem to suggest the possible occurrence of the line H withont the line
K. In our experiments both lines were always present, the line K
being longer and stronger than H conditions of the calcium lines
                                             ;
which are in agreement with the photographs of the prominences
taken by Hale and by Deslandres.
  I " have been looking up some observations of Dewar's and mine
en the H and K lines of calcium made in 1879. We found that
when we used, for the arc, carbon poles which had been heated for
two davs in chlorine to remove metals, the calcium lines were not at
first visible in the arc, but after    time H was seen alone and not
                                            a
strong;   after a further  time, K  was  seen, and then other calcium
lines came out. No doubt the calcium had been pretty well removed
from the carbon rods to some depth, but not entirely from the

a stream of hydrogen into the arc through it, H and K could be
both entirely obliterated ; but by then reducing the current of gas
they gradually reappeared, and H always came out first and after
wards K ; and H remained stronger than K, until they had both
resumed their ordinary appearance.      This observation was repeated
several times.
   " Both sets of observations, those with the purified carbon poles
and those with the perforated pole, seem to me to confirm your con
clusions.
   " In the case of those with the perforated pole, the stream of
hydrogen diluted the calcium vapour, and the degree of dilution was
controlled by the rate at which the gas was introduced.       The mass
of gas passing was too small to reduce the temperature by any
considerable amount, or even, I should think, to any sensible
amount.
   " We found also that metallic lithium, introduced into the arc,
produced effects similar to those produced by hydrogen, that is, that
it reduced very much the strength of the H and K lines. If more
than a very minute piece of lithium were introduced, the arc was
invariably broken, so that we did not notice the complete oblitera
tion of H and K with the lithium.
   " The reduction of the strength of H and K, in this case, I
attribute to the dilution of the calcium vapour by that of lithium."

having for their object the determination of the lines which were
enhanced in the spectra of iron, magnesium, and calcium, on passing
from the arc to a high temperature spark, and      I  pointed out the
presence of these lines in the spectra of the hotter stars and in the

   The list of lines is not given here for the reason that so far the

complete.        Nevertheless     the approximate      wave-lengths already
determined are of the same order of accuracy as those of the chromo-
spheric and stellar lines, and the supposed coincidences depend upon
the occurrence of several lines of a given substance rather than
upon an absolute agreement in the deduced positions of any single
line.
   In the former paper        I  drew attention to the fact that while the
enhanced      lines  of  magnesium (4481'3) and calcium (H and K)
remained feebly visible in the hottest stars included in the discus
sion, the enhanced lines of iron vanished entirely in such stars, and
were thinner than those of magnesium and calcium in stars which
are approaching the highest temperature as determined by the length
of the spectrum in the ultra-violet.         Similar differences of behaviour
have also been noted among the substances which have since been
investigated.
    These differences in the case of metals of the iron and calcium
 groups are shown in the following table, in which the stars are
 arranged in the order of temperature previously deduced from the
 discussion of the lines of iron, magnesium, and calcium, and the
 name of each substance considered is placed opposite that of the
 hottest star in which its enhanced Hues remain visible.
    It thus appears that while calcium remains visible up to the highest

iron and manganese show their enhanced lines at temperatures as high
 as f Tauri, while cobalt and nickel do not extend higher than Rigel.
 Among the substances recently examined, the case of silicium is of
 special interest. The enhanced lines of this substance, two of which
have wave-lengths about 4128'6 and 4131 '4, are amongst the most
conspicuous lines in a. Cygni and remain distinctly visible even in
Bellatrix, after the lines of iron, manganese, nickel, and cobalt have
vanished. In its stellar behaviour then, this substance resembles Ca
and Mg.
   So far as the work has gone, the comparison of the enhanced lines
with the spectrum of the chromosphere reveals several facts of im
portance. In the case of iron, I have already pointed out* that the
enhanced lines were all present in the chromosphere during the
eclipse of 1896, and most of them in that of 1893, their intensities
being greater than those of the corresponding Fraunhofer lines.
Many of the characteristic arc lines of iron also appear in the
chromosphere, but the presence of the enhanced lines with such
great intensities indicates that at least in some parts of the chromo
sphere the temperature of the iron vapour is considerably higher
than that of the iron vapour which is most effective in producing the
Fraunhofer lines. A similar result is obtained when other sub
stances are considered. The special importance of the enhanced lines
in the chromosphere is shown by the following figures relating to
substances which have been most completely studied : —

  444           The Total Solar Eclipse       of August 9, 18%.
     These numbers show that the chromospheric spectrum is largely
  composed of enhanced         metallic lines in addition to the lines of
  hydrogen   and  the  cleveite gases.
     In the Fraunhofer spectrum enhanced lines may be regarded as
  wanting, for in the case of iron and magnesium, at least, they only
  appear with the feeble intensities which they have in the arc
  spectrum, while the characteristic arc lines are strong. Here then we
  find the cause of the dissimilarity of the chromospheric and Fraun
  hofer spectrum which is indicated by the following figures : —

     The observing party consisted of Mr. Fowler, Dr. W. J. Lockyer,
  and myself, and the selection of Kio Island as an observing station
  was rendered possible by the grant of the services of H. M.S. " Volage."
  Although the expedition failed in its main objects, because of
  unfavourable weather, it is considered desirable to put on record an
  account of the arrangements which had been made to secure observa
  tions, more especially as a new feature was introduced in the train
  ing of a large number of officers and men to take part in the
  observations.
     Profiting by the experience gained in previous eclipses, prismatic
  cameras of the highest available powers were taken out, as well as a
  powerful integrating spectroscope.        To supplement the work of these
  photographic     instruments,   a   number     of prisms and small slit
  spectroscopes were provided for use by such assistants as were
  available. The voluntary services of 74 officers and men of H.M.S.

and the sun was quite invisible during totality.
   No photographs were obtained, but some observations of tempera
ture, colours of the landscape, and the general phenomena of totality
were secured.     As shown by two thermometers screened from the
direct rays of the sun, the temperature fell 0'9° P. from first contact
to totality, and rose the same amount between totality and last
contact. A fully exposed thermometer at another place indicated a
fall of 6'5° F., and a subsequent rise of 1'5° F. during the same
intervals.

                                   Introduction.
   The spectrum of c Cephei is one of a group with special character
istics. While containing a great number of fine metallic lines, giving
it more or less the same general appearance as the solar spectrum, it
shows many lines which are either faint in the solar spectrum or are
altogether absent.     In a former paper* I showed that the spectrum
is practically identical with that of 7 Cygm, which my previous
work had indicated to be a star of increasing temperature.f
   The chief argument which I had employed in favour of placing
7 Cygni on the ascend ing'side of the temperature curve was based on
the presence of certain special lines, which occur with increased im
portance, in the spectrum of a Cygni, which differs very widely from
the solar spectrum, and has a close relationship to the Orion stars.
   Further, the association of a special kind of variability with some
of the stars having a spectrum of this type seemed to strengthen the
view that the constitution of such stars must be vastly different from
that of the sun.         Dr. Vogel, however, has classified two stars of
the same group as S Cephei, namely, 7 Aquiloe and 10 Sagittae,

  with the sun in his Class IIo, and more recently Dr. Scheiner has
  placed another star of the group, a Persei, between a. Cygni and the
  sun.   It is right to add that Drs. Vogel and Scheiner differ very
  considerably as to the classification of a. Cygni, and this still further
  complicates matters.
     It will be seen that the question between the two classifications is
 a very sharp one. Is the difference between stars like S Cephei
 and stars resembling the sun solely due to a temperature differ
 ence, as it is on Vogel's view, or does it in part represent, as I
 contend, a physical difference between the two classes, since on my
 view stars like S Cephei consist of uncondensed swarms of meteorites
 of increasing temperature, while those like the sun are masses of
 vapour in which there are photospheres and relatively quiet atmo
 spheres ?
    Since    the  work recently commnnicafced to the Royal Society
enables me to go still further forward, I propose to discuss in the
 present paper the points relating to the classification of stars of the
 S Cephei class.
    In Vogel's classification all stars are regarded as cooling bodies,
 while one of the chief points of mine is the distinction between stars
 which are getting hotter and those which are becoming cooler.
 Thus, while stars like S Cephei and those like the sun are grouped
 together by Vogel in his Class Ila, they are in mine divided into two
 groups, Group     III   including S Cephei and Group V the sun.
    When I first suggested the new classification I fully recognised
 the difficulty of separating Groups              III   and V. Thus  I wrote in
 1888   :—
    " With our present knowledge, it is very difficult to separate those
 stars the grouping of which is determined by line absorption into
 Groups    III   and V, for the reason that so far, seeing that only
one line of temperature, and that a descending one, has been con
sidered, no efforts have been made to establish the necessary
criteria."*
    In the following year         I   gave the results of some visual observa
tions of stellar spectra which seemed to justify the separation of the
stars with line spectra into two groups, and to suggest the necessary
criteria for distinguishing them.f
    Soon after this a photographic investigation of stellar spectra was
commenced at Kensington, and as a result of that work the conclu
sions at which     I had arrived from a discussion of the eye observations
were confirmed.        The additional details shown by the photographs
enabled me to extend the classification given in 1888.J

            On the Classification       of Stars of   the  8  Cepliei Class. 447
     Stars resembling 7 Cygni formed the sub-group IIIjS.
    In November, 1895, I gave an account* of the spectra of five short
 period variable stars, & Cephei, 7 Aquilee,                f  Geminorum, T Vul-
 peculae, and S Sagittae, and pointed out that these belonged to the
 same sub-group as 7 Cygni, which, however, is not a variable star ;
 a Ursae Minoris has also a spectrum which has since been recognised
 to be identical with that of 7 Cygni and S Cephei, while a. Persei
 differs so slightly from them that it may also be classified with
 them.
    These I now group together, and for convenience of reference I
designate them the S Cephei class.
                            Dr. Vogel's Classification.
    Only two of the stars which have been mentioned as belonging to
the c Cephei class, namely, 7 Aquilee and S(10) Sagittae, were
included in Vogel's spectroscopic Durchmusterung, published in 1883,
and both are classed without further comment as stars of Class Ila.f
This type of spectrum was thus defined : " Spectra with very numer
ous metallic lines, which are easily known by their intensity, espe
cially in the yellow and green. The hydrogen lines are for the most
part strong, but are never so broad as in the case of Class la. In
some stars the lines of hydrogen are faint, and in these faint bands
can be generally recognised in the less refrangible portion of the
spectrum."
    So far as Vogel's classification serves as a guide, then, all the stars
of the S Cephei class wonld be classed with the sun.
   Dr. Scheiner has discussed one of the stars of the £ Cephei class,
a Persei, in some detail.       J   Attention is specially drawn by him to
the differences between the spectrum of a Persei and that of the
sun.
                               I
   In the following table have brought together the lines of a. Persei
which Dr. Scheiner states to be more intense than in the sun, and
have compared them with c Cephei and a Cygni as photographed at
Kensington.       The remarks in the last column are those made by
Dr. Scheiner with regard to the spectrum of a. Persei.

   Dr. Scheiner also remarks on a few of the special lines of a Ursse
Minoris, another member of the S Cephei class.                           My own photo
graphs    show almost    absolute     identity   with    >3 Cephei,       so that a special
discussion of this star would be superfluous.
   It will be seen that the special lines of a Persei are nearly all
present in S Cephei and a Cygni, and that they are all either faint in,
or absent from, the solar spectrum.
   The spectrum of S Cephei has been investigated by Belopolsky,*
and he gives a table showing that it differs in many respects from
that of the sun. Attention is specially drawn by him to some of the
                           * '

 lines which are strongly marked in the spectrum of >5Cephei as com
 pared with corresponding lines in the solar spectrum photographed
 with the same instrument.            A discussion of these differences shows
 that the more special lines of >5 Cephei, like those of z Persei, are
 very prominent in * Cygni.
     In spite of these differences, Dr. Scheiner classes a. Persei with
 stars like the sun, but regards it as a transition stage between a; Cygni
 and the sun.       He says : " From the general conclusions, the above
 list gives us quite a curious and important result. If one compares
 these lines with those in the spectrum of a. Cygni, which is of special
 interest as an advanced spectrum of Class 16, one finds that, out of
 sixty lines in a Cygni, twenty-one occur in the list, and all of these in
 a. Persei.    The fact, therefore, remains that nearly half the lines which
 in the spectrum of a. Persei show divergences when compared with
 the solar spectrum appear certainly in any case in the spectrum of
 a. Cygni and determine its peculiarity.
    " Now a. Cygni belongs to Class 16, a. Persei to Class Ila, and the
plausible conclusion appears to me, therefore, that a, Persei had pre-
 viously a spectrum similar to that of a Cygni, and that in this case
 we have the missing connexion between 16 to Ila." *
    The spectrum of a. Tauri, which, as I shall show, must he regarded
as a condensing swarm, closely resembles that of the sun ; so that
Dr. Scheiner's evidence would equally place a. Persei intermediate
between a. Tauri and a. Cygni.
                Difficulties connected    with Vogel's Classification.
    The close association of stars like B Cephei with those like a Cygni
makes it here important to discuss the place of a Cygni in Vogel's
classification. With regard to this star Dr. Scheiner writes : " The
spectrum of a Cygni, in spite of the large number of its lines, has no
resemblance with that of the sun.               While it is possible to identify
most of the lines with solar lines in respect of their position, yet the
total lack of agreement ns to intensity of the lines makes many of
these identifications worthless."         f
    Dr. Scheiner has classified a Cygni in Vogel's Class 16, which was
thus defined in Vogel's original classification : " Spectra in which
the metallic lines are few in number, and very faint or entirely
imperceptible, and in which the hydrogen lines are lacking."
    In view of the photographic results obtained at Potsdam, the
last clause in this definition was corrected in 1888, so that it reads :
" and the strong hydrogen lines of
                                              Type la are lacking."J           This has
again     been   modified     by    Dr.   Scheiner,    and the characteristics of

Type 16 are stated as "spectra in which the hydrogen lines and
the few metallic lines all appear to be of equal breadth and of
sharp definition."*           It is on the ground of this greatly modified
definition that a Cygni is included with stars like Rigel in Class 16.
   Dr. Vogel, however, is not prepared to accept Dr. Scheiner's
amended definition of Class 16.               He writes : " However justifiable
it may be to regard the peculiarly sharp spectral lines of the stars
above mentioned and a few others of the same kind as worthy of
special consideration, the adoption of this proposal would make it
necessary to separate a number of stars (including those of Orion)
whose relationship is placed beyond all question by the investigations
I  have referred to, and to place them with a. Cygni, which has a
materially different spectrum."           \
   In the same paper Dr. Vogel brings forward a new definition of
his Class 16 in the following terms : " Spectra in which, besides the
still dominant hydrogen lines, the lines of cleveite gas appear, and
above all the lines X 4026, X 4472, X 5016, and X 5876(D,).                     The lines
of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and iron are also more or less
numerous in spectra of this subdivision."
   This new definition excludes a Cygni from Class 16 in Dr. Vogel's
opinion, and he places this star in Class la 3 of his extended classifica
tion of spectra of the first class.              This sub-class is thus defined :
"Spectra in which the calcium line X3934 has nearly the same
intensity as the hydrogen lines. In occasional instances it is still
sharply defined at the edges, or it may be broader and more intense
than the hydrogen lines, and very diffuse, forming with the hydrogen
line H6(X3970), which is greatly intensified and broadened by the
calcium line X3969, a conspicuous pair.
   " In the spectra of this division the lines of the cleveite
                                                                              gas cannot
be recognised ; on the other hand, numerous strong lines of different
metals, particularly lines of iron, are always present.                    The lines of
hydrogen      are still always     dominant.       Hj   is   plainly apparent among
the other lines, and the group G is less conspicuous than Hy.                        This
subdivision forms the direct connecting link with the spectral
class II, in which the hydrogen lines no longer play a prominent part
in comparison with the lines of other metals. "J
   According to this definition, a Cygni is classed with Procyon, a
star which in the main resembles the sun, and this notwithstanding
 Scheiner's remark that the spectrum of a. Cygni bears no resemblance
to that of the sun.
   It is clear, then, that a, Cygni cannot be classified satisfactorily on
the supposition that all stars are cooling.

           On the Classification        of Stars of the   8  Cephei   Class.    451
                Reference to the Old Evidence of Two Series.
    In previous communications           to the Royal Society I have stated the
evidence which shows that            in   stars of Group II, such as a Ononis,
the occurrence of radiating carbon vapour is an indication that these
stars, like comets, consist of uncondensed swarms of meteorites.
Since the temperature of a condensing swarm of meteorites must be
increasing, in accordance with thermodynamical principles, stars like
a.. Orionis must be placed        on the ascending arm of the temperature
curve.     The photographs show that the spectrum of stars like
a. Tauri is almost identical with that of a. Orionis so far as the lines are
concerned, and since one of the flutings in the red in the spectrum of
>z Orionis also appears in a Tauri, this star must also be regarded as
one of increasing temperature.
    The discussion of the Kensington photographs led me to place
7 Cygni next to a. Tauri in the series of stars with increasing tem
perature,* and we now know that S Cephei must be classed with this
star.    I pointed out that the spectrum of 7 Cygni
                                                                     " has much in
common with that of a Tauri, but there is less continuous absorption,
and many of the lines of a. Tauri thin out.              The next step to a. Cygni
is  rather  a long  one,   but   it seems    very probable that if more photo
graphs were available intermediate spectra would be found. It will
be seen, however, that in a. Cygni the hydrogen lines are intensified
as compared with 7 Cygni, and that all the important lines of a Cygni
agree in position with prominent lines in 7 Cygni                         In passing
to Rigel the more important lines of a. Cygni are retained, and a few
new lines make their appearance."
    My argument was, then, that with an increase of temperature a
star like a. Tauri would develop into one like S Cephei, which, with
further increase, would pass through successive stages represented by
a. Cygni,   Rigel, and Bellatrix.             To justify this it is accordingly
necessary to show greater reason for associating S Cephei with
a. Tauri than with        a star like the sun, which we know on other
grounds to be cooling.
    From the great similarity of the line spectra of a. Tauri and the
sun, it is clear that the argument will not entirely depend upon the
identity of lines in the spectra of a Tauri and c Cephei, but upon
general and specific differences between 0 Cephei and the sun.
                         Evidence from Enhanced Lines.
    In a recent communication to the Royal Society,t I have shown
that the investigation of the lines enhanced in the spark spectra of

  metals has enabled       me to apply new     criteria in the classification     of
  stellar spectra.
     A study of these lines shows at once that 6 Cephei is hotter than
  either a. Tauri or the sun, and that the difference between its spectrum
  and that of a. Tauri or the sun is certainly in part due to this differ
  ence of temperature of the absorbing vapours.                  The lines which
  are stronger in S Cephei than in the sun include many of those which
  have been found to be enhanced in the spark spectra of metals, so
  that they are no longer to be regarded as unknown lines. Similarly,
 many of the lines of a. Cygni for which no origins could previously
 be assigned have been shown to be lines of common metals under con
 ditions of high temperature.        Still, the mere presence of the enhanced
 lines in a star spectrum affords us no criterion as to whether the
 temperature of a star is increasing or decreasing. Bat I have also
 shown that if we take the relative intensities of the enhanced lines
 and the arc Hues as an indication of stellar temperatures, and in this
 way bring together a sufficient number of stars of about the same
 temperature as 7 Cygni or >5 Cephei, such spectra may be divided
 into two well-marked groups, of which 7 Cygni and Castor may be
 taken as types.          The chief generic differences between the two
 groups of stars at the temperature of c Cephei were thus summarised
 in the paper to which reference has been made : —
                  I Cephei.                                 Castor.
 (1) Considerable        absorption   in     (1) Very little continuous ab
         ultra-violet.                              sorption in ultra-violet.
 (2) Hydrogen lines relatively               (2) Hydrogen        lines relatively
         thin.                                      very  thick.
(3) Metallic lines of moderate              (3)   Metallic     lines    relatively
         intensity.                                 feeble.
    I  further showed that these differences are simply and sufficiently
explained on the supposition that stars like 7 Cygni and £ Cephei
are uncondensed        swarms of meteorites, while those like Castor, which
have about the same mean temperature, are stars approaching the
condition of the sun in which photospheres and relatively quiescent
atmospheres have formed.            The foregoing considerations indicate
that there are three chief periods in the history of a star during its
stages of luminosity : —
    (1) A period during which it exists as an uncondensed swarm, when
the "atmosphere" is disturbed by meteoritic bombardment from
without.
    At this stage the atmosphere is a mass of heterogeneous vapour
at various temperatures and moving with different velocities in
different regions.

           On the Classification  of Stars of  the I  Cephei Class.    453
   (2) A period of complete vaporisation         during which the atmo
sphere is quiescent, bombardment having ceased, and the radiation
being too great to permit condensation in the atmosphere.
   (3) A period of cooling during which the atmosphere is disturbed
by the fall of condensation products from the outer parts of the atmo
sphere on to the photosphere.
         Evidence  that we are not dealing with Composite Spectra.
   Many of the lines in the spectra of stars of the S Cephri class
coincide with prominent lines in the spectrum of a. Cygni, but it is
true that many also coincide with lines in the spectra of stars like
a Orionis and Arcturus, which closely resemble the solar spectrum.
It seemed possible, therefore, that we might be dealing with the
integrated spectra of two stars in close proximity, one having lines
resembling those of a. Orionis or Arcturus, and the other those of
a. Cygni.     The spectra of all the stars of this sub-group have accord
ingly been very carefully investigated from this point of view.
Enlarged glass positives of a. Cygni and Arcturus on exactly the
same scale have been superposed, and the integrated spectra photo
graphed. When this integrated spectrum is compared with 7 Cygni or
 6 Cephei, there is a considerable   similarity, but the relative intensi
ties of the various lines and the general appearance of certain parts
of the spectrum, especially about G, are quite different.         Agnin, if
there were two bright bodies physically connected in such a star as
7 Cygni there must be a revolution and a consequent doubling of the
common lines, unless the plane of movement were perpendicular to
the line of sight. No signs of such doubling, however, have been
detected in any of the eight stars of the sub-group which have so far
been recognised, and it is quite improbable that the plane of revolu
tion would be at right angles to the line of sight in every case, and
still more so that the two components would have identical spectra
in each of the eight systems.
   Spectra of the S Cephei type must, therefore, be taken to repre
sent a particular stage in the orderly development of cosmical
bodies.
                         Evidence from   Variability.
   Further evidence in favour of placing stars like S Cephei and
7 Cygni on the ascending arm of the temperature curve is afforded
by the fact that stars of this class present a special form of vari
ability.     This variability is similar in kind, but different in degree,
to that associated with stars of Group II, such as Mira. The follow
ing table shows that the amount of variation is very much less than
that in variables of the Mira type : —

     It will   be seen that the luminosity at maximum is from about two
 (08      magnitude) to three times (1-2 magnitudes) greater than at
 minimum, while the forms of most of the light curves resemble the
 majority of those of the Mira class in the relatively steep ascent to
 maximum.          A constitution more or less similar to that of the Mira
 class is therefore indicated.
     I   have already shown that in such variables as Mira the presence
 of bright carbon flutings indicates a meteoritic structure.*                    Here the
variation has a much longer period than in S Cephei, but it is only
necessary to suppose that & Cephei is more condensed, so that revolv
ing swarms of short period will be alone effective in producing
collisions at periastron, as I pointed out in 1889. t
    A recent discussion of all the available observations of y Aquihe
by Dr. William J. S. LockyerJ has shown that the light curve of
this variable can be best explained on the supposition of three
meteor swarms moving around their centre of gravity.                              In this
way not only is the general form                   of the   light curve satisfied, but
the smaller irregularities discovered by the author are also easily
accounted for.
    Hence, by placing stars of the c Cephei class on the ascending
arm of the temperature curve, the variability of certain members
of the group finds a ready explanation.                I  am not aware of any satis
factory explanation of the S Cephei type of variability in which a
constitution resembling that of the sun is assumed, and to my mind
such a variation in a star constituted like the sun is impossible.

                                    General Conclusions.
   The final result of the discussion of the spectra of stars of the
«5Cephei class is to show that they must be placed on the ascending
arm of the temperature curve, at a stage higher than stars like
a Tauri, in which the mean temperature is not very different from
that of the sun.      Stars of equal temperature on the descending side
of the curve, of which Castor may be taken as a type, show pre
cisely the same lines, the enhanced and cool lines having the same
relative intensities, but with inverted intensities of the hydrogen and
metallic lines, and with somewhat less continuous absorption in the
ultra-violet.    The difference between stars like S Cephei and those of
the sun is therefore partly due to a difference of temperature and
partly due to a difference of physical condition such as is demanded
by the meteoritic hypothesis.      This result enables us to understand
why some members of the c Cephei class should show such a very
special kind of variability.
   a. Cygni   also finds a natural place on the ascending arm of the
temperature curve, at a stage higher than S Cephei, and all the ditti-
culties met with in attempting to classify it on Vogel's view of
decreasing temperature alone are removed.

quakes are grouped together and expressed by means of a Fourier
series, and conclusions are based on the greater or smaller values of
the coefficients of this series.   In order to decide what value is to bo
attached to such investigations, it seems necessary in the first instance
to discuss what would be the order of magnitude of the coefficients,
on the supposition that the events have happened perfectly at random
without any connecting law. It is the object of this paper to solve
this question, and to apply the solution to the periodicities which are
supposed to exist in the frequency of earthquakes.

 discussed in the first part of Mr. Knott's paper the                           intervals      are
 hours, and p is taken to ho 25, i.e., approximately equal to the
 interval between two successive meridian passages of the moon.
 Tx would therefore represent the number of earthquakes which have
 happened within an hour after the meridian passage of the moon.
      The numbers T may be expressed by a periodic series of the form

  We may take the quantity            p  = rx\aa as a measure of the periodicity
 corresponding to p intervals. Our problem now is this :

  problem may        be  put  into  a more    general      form.        The  events,    like the
 earthquakes in Mr. Knott's paper, have all been put into the same
 compartment if they happened within certain interval of time (an
 hour in this case), no matter whether they happened at the beginning
 or at the end of that interval.            This simplification is introduced only
 for purposes of more easy arithmetical calculation.                           Theoretically,

lines OP], OP2 and a fixed direction are ktu M2, &c. If OP>, OP..
represent forces of equal intensity but different directions, the right-

according to hypothesis, the events may happen with equal prob
ability at any time, every position on the circle equally probable for            is

and the expectancy   for p is

    In proving this proposition it was assumed that the number of
intervals into which the period T is subdivided is very large, but this
condition is not essential.      To suit accurately the process employed
by   Mr.  Knott,  we should    have  to consider the vectors OP1, OPs, &c.,
to be confined to fixed directions forming augles 2v\p with each
other. But it follows directly from the method employed by Lord
Rayleigh that his results must apply to this case also, if p is a
multiple of four. It is further not necessary to enquire whether
 (7) holds in the most general case, when p, for instance, is an odd
number, because the process employed by Mr. Knott and others is
justified only on the assumption that the number of intervals into
 which the period is subdivided is so large that a further increase of
 it would not alter the relative ralue of the coefficients of the Fourier
series.
    3. Unfortunately    Mr. Knott has adopted a common but in my
opinion    mischievous  practice, which renders some further reductions
necessary before we can apply expressions              (7) and (8). Instead
of basing his calculations on the number of earthquakes which
took place in any particular lunar hour, he first takes over
 lapping means of the numbers put down for five consecutive hours.
This practice has its legitimate use, when it is desired to make
periodicities apparent to the eye by plotting down a series of
numbers which by themselves may be too irregular to bring out the
peculiarities which it is intended to show.              The averaging of a

             On    Lunar and Solar Periodicities of Earthquakes.                           459
certain number of successive figures eliminates to some extent the
shorter periods, and therefore emphasises the longer ones. But this
elimination is done in a much better and more complete manner by
Fourier's analysis, and when it is therefore intended to submit the
figures to that process of calculation, the smoothing down of the
original numbers, represents a waste of arithmetical work, uncom
pensated,     as   far as I can see, by any advantage.
   To judge of Mr. Knott's results it is necessary therefore to trace
the effect of the process of calculation employed by him.                                  The
problem      to   be solved   for   that    purpose     may    be   stated  thns    : —
   A number, p, of figures, yu yt. . . . yp, is expressed in terms of the
periodic series (1).            A second series is then formed by taking the
sum of m successive numbers, the first two members of the series
being y, + i/2+.. ..y„, and y2 + yi + . . . . y«.+ 1. The original series is
supposed to repeat itself, so that the last member of the derived
series becomes yp + iji + yi+. . . . +ym-\-                  It is required to find the
relation    between     the  coefficients      of  the   Fourier     expansion for the two
series.
   It will be sufficient to find the solution of this problem for the case
that the original series y„ y3 represent equidistant ordinates of the
curve y = cos kx, so that
        j/i = cos    Kx>t   y3   = cos (kxi + S),         y3 = cos (kXi+2F)           ....
                               ym  = cos (kXi + (m—1) o).
The solution of this case really includes the general one, for the
original series y is supposed to be represented by a number of terms,
each of which is simply periodic, and to each of which the result of
the special case may be separately applied.
   The first term of the derived series may be obtained by a well
known process, for
                                                 sin  \mi         I        m—   1 . A

   The number of earthquakes taken into account was 7427, so that

paper, we obtain the numbers placed in the first row of Table I ;
the second row gives by comparison the coefficients actually found by
Mr. Knott.

   The numbers in this table do not support Mr. Knott's contention,
but seem to me rather to be a striking confirmation of the theory of
^probability.      It must be remembered that the " expectancy " only
gives the average value of a great many cases, the individuals of
which may differ considerably from that average.                          Thus it may be
calculated with the help of expression (9) that in about one case out
of every four the coefficient C, would come out still smaller than the
number found by Mr. Knott, while the coefficient C2 would be larger

           On   Lunar and Solar Periodicities of Earthquakes.              46l
than Mr. Knott's number in two out of every five cases.              It will, I
think, be admitted that, until further evidence is brought forward,
the lunar day cannot be considered to affect earthquakes.
   4. In the second part of his paper, Mr. Knott treats of the
monthly and fortuightly periodicities.            He expresses himself very
guardedly    as  to the results of this part of the investigation, chiefly
on the ground that the amplitudes found for the period of the
" nodical " month are quite as great as those found for the " tropi
cal" or "synodic" months. As there is no conceivable reason why
the nodical month should affect earthquakes, the conclusion will
reasonably be drawn from this, that any period chosen at random
would give similar results.         I think we must take it, in default of
further evidence, that this argument is valid and outweighs the not
very conclusive considerations which seem to Mr. Knott to favour
the reality of these lunar periods, in spite of the weakness of the
evidence to which he himself draws attention.                 The number of
earthquakes taken into consideration are about 4730, and this would
give an expectancy for each of the coefficients equal to 0-0258.              A
reducing factor has to be applied which differs for the different
coefficients as has been explained in the case of the periods depend
ing on lunar day.            I obtain in this way the numbers shown in
Table II. For the sake of completeness,           I give the amplitudes found
by   Mr.  Knott    for the   various  months,  and   also the mean amplitudes
of the different monthly periods.

    The striking feature of this table consists in the first place in the
 roughly equal amplitudes for the different kinds of months, and
secondly in the fact that the expectancy is in all cases smaller than
the mean of the coefficients found, and in nearly equal proportions
 at any rate for the monthly, third-monthly, and quarter-monthly
 periods.
    5. This points not so much to the reality of the period found, but
 to some common cause which has led to too low an evaluation of the
 expectancy.        The latter quantity has been calculated under the

462                           Prof. Schuster.
assumption that the     earthquakes are altogether independent of each
other and take place     at random.        Any regularity wonld be contrary
 to this assumption      and might affect the expectancy.           Thus, for
instance, it is known     that earthquakes take place in groups, a large
earthquake being generally followed by some minor shocks.
                                    ;i          "
   Mr. Knott states that the           obvious     aftershocks were left out of
account   in his calculation ; but there may be aftershocks which are
not obvious, and it seems quite likely that every earthquake is
followed by a period during which another is more likely to happen
than at other times.        If there is such a tendency it is easy to see
that our calculated numbers for the expectancy will be too low.
Take the case, for instance, that all earthquakes happen in groups of
two, or, what comes to the same thing, let each earthquake in the
investigation of § 2 count as two.            The quantities I have called p
will not bo affected by this change, but the total number of earth
quakes being doubled, the expectancy calculated according to our
formula is now reduced in the proportion of v2 to 1, and would
therefore be too small in that ratio.         It seems to me to be probable
that the discrepancy between Mr. Knott's coefficients and the calcu
lated expectancy is explained in this way.             Apart from this possible
explanation it would not be safe to draw any certain conclusions
from any instance in which the calculated amplitude has double the
value of the expectancy, for expression (9) shows that the ampli
tudes will turn out to be even greater than that on the average in
one case out of every twenty-three.             The matter to be explained is
not that any one of Mr. Knott's coefficients is, roughly speaking,
twice as great as the expectancy, but that all coefficients show this
tendency towards higher values in not very different proportions.
   6. It is interesting to discuss, from the point of view of this paper,
the periodicities of earthquakes which apparently depend, directly or
indirectly, on the position of the sun.            We owe to Mr. Davison a
very complete      discussion    of    the  annual     period.*  The method
employed by him (in determining the amplitudes of the periodic
terms), though neither direct nor very accurate, is sufficient for our
purpose. Taking as an example the record of 5879 earthquakes in
the northern hemisphere, given by Mr. R. Mallet, the results of this
paper show that if they were distributed indiscriminately over the
whole year tho expectancy for the amplitude would be \/Trj&87i), or
0'023, while Mr. Davison, in § 18 of tho paper quoted, gives O'll for
the amplitude.      Similarly, the discussion of 8133 earthquakes, for
which   the  expectancy is 0'020, yields the number 0'29 for the ampli
tude.    Here, then, we have the amplitude in one case equal to five
times, and in the other equal to fourteen times, the expectancy.

             On Lunar and Solar Periodicities of Earthquakes.                463
  is in the first case only 1 in 300,000, and in the second almost
  infinitesimally small. The reality of the period would be thereby
  established beyond reasonable doubt, unless the peculiarity of earth
  quakes occurring in groups, as discussed in the previous section, can
  be shown to raise the expectancy sufficiently.            The fact, however,
  that in each hemisphere the phase of the periodicity found is nearly
  identical in a great number of cases disposes of all doubt which
 might remain on that point.
     In some of the details Mr. Davison's results would seem to require-
 further confirmation. The evidence, for instance, that the strong
 and weak shocks follow different laws is not very strong when
 examined by means of the theory of probability.                  Mr. Davison
 classifies the Japanese earthquakes into three groups, according to
 their intensity, and finds that the maxima of the annual period
 agree in the two stronger groups and take place in winter, while the
 maxima for the weakest group occur in summer. The magnitude of
 the amplitude for the former is 0-17, while the expectancy is 0-074
 and 0'133 respectively.          Here the excess of amplitude over the
 expectancy is not sufficiently marked to allow of any certain con
 clusions being drawn. A similar remark applies to the record of
 Zante (see § 45 of Mr. Davison's paper) .
     7. The daily periods of earthquakes have been fully discussed by
the same author in a paper published in the ' Philosophical Magazine."
 The following table summarises some of the more important results, the-
 twenty-four hours period only being taken into account.             The epoch
given is that of the maximum, and            I  have added the expectancy of
amplitude calculated on the principles of this paper.

    The amplitudes are seen to exceed the expectancy considerably in
all cases but one. The reality of the daily period must be considered
established, unless the evaluation of the expectancy is faulty, owing

464        On   Lunar and Solar Periodicities of Earthquakes.
to the fact that tremors occur in groups (§ 5). The good agreement
between the phases of the periodicity disposes of that doubt.
   8.  The expression for the expectancy deduced in § 2 may with
advantage be employed in similar investigations to decide the number
of events which it is necessary to take into account in order to
establish a periodicity of given amplitude. It follows from the laws
of probability that, to be reasonably certain, the amplitudes found
should be at least equal to three times the expectancy.                Hence, if c
bo the amplitude looked for,
                    c — 3 v/>r/n,     or   n = 9tt/c3
                                                      =   28'3/c*.
   Thus, for instance, Mr. Knott deduces for his supposed lunar
period a range of 6 per cent., or an amplitude of O03. In order to
establish with certainty such an amplitude, it would be necessary
that the number of earthquakes taken into account should at least be
equal to 30,000, or over four times the number actually used in the
calculations.
   9. The difficulty discussed          in § 5 would seem to limit in many
cases the applicability of the results found.               There are, indeed, in
nearly every case actually occurring in nature, certain regularities in
the manner in which events happen, and this regularity always favours
the higher values of the Fourier coefficients.                  As it will not be
possible   to  estimate   in  many cases the effect    of   the  expectancy, some
other form of treatment will often be called for.                   The following
theorem will, I think, prove useful in these investigations : —
    Let y be a function of t, such that its values are regulated by some
law of probability, not necessarily the exponential one, but acting in
such a manner that if a large number of values of t be chosen at
random there will always be a definite fraction of that number
depending on ti only, which lie between ti and ti + T, where T is any
given time interval.
                        f'>+T                         f'i+T.
   Writing         A=   |
                            y cos ictdt   and  B=     I y sin ntdt,
and forming
                                   R = v'A'+B*,
 the  quantity     R will, with increasing values of T, fluctuate             about
some mean value,          which   increases pz-oportionally to ,/T, provided
T is taken sufficiently large.
    If this theorem is taken in conjunction with the two following
well-known propositions,
    (1) If   y  = cos Kt,   R will, apart from periodical terms,           increase
            proportionally to T ;
    (2) If   y = cos Kt,     \ being different from      k,   the quantity   R  will
            fluctuate about a constant value ;

     The Vector Properties of Alternating Currents and other
        Periodic Quantities." By W. E. SoMPNER, D.Sc. Commu
        nicated by 0. Henrici, F.R.S. Received May 28,— Read

     It has been well known      for many }'ears that the variations of a
 simple harmonic function, such as A cospt, can be represented by
 the projection, on a fixed line, of a vector of constant length A sup
 posed to revolve uniformly so as to complete one revolution in a
time T given by the relation yT = 2ir.                 The angle between the
 revolving    vector and the  fixed  line   is pt at any instant t. In the first
                                                                 '
edition of Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy (vol. 1, p. 38,
                                       '
 § 58), it is shown that any two simple harmonic functions of one
 period can be compounded to a single simple harmonic function of
 the same period, and that the vector, representing the compounded
 function, is obtained from those representing the component func
tions by the ordinary process of vector addition.
     This device has proved useful for many purposes, but it has
proved especially valuable in connexion with alternate current
problems.       Its application to such cases was first clearly pointed
out by Mr. T. H. Blakesley more than twelve years since.               The use
of it in alternate current work has gradually developed into what
may be described as a vector, or network, method of representing
alternate current quantities.       In this method the length of the vector
denotes the magnitude of the current or voltage, while the angle
between any two vectors represents the time which elapses between
the instants at which the maximum values of the corresponding
quantities occur. In particular, if one line represents the voltage on
a conductor,       and a second line denotes the strength of current
produced in it by this voltage, the power absorbed in the conductor
is measured by the product of the length of the two lines into the
cosine of the angle between them.                 It is to this possibility of

466         Dr. W. E. Sumpner.         The Vector Properties  of
deducing from the network figure the electrical power absorbed by
the conductors, as well as the magnitude of each current, and
voltage, that is chiefly due the usefulness and importance of this
mode of representation.
   It  will be convenient here to describe briefly the mathematical
basis   on which the method rests. It will be evident that we may
represent the value of a simple harmonic function A cos pt either by
the projection of a revolving vector on a fixed line, or by the projec
tion of a stationary vector on a revolving line. It will be more con
venient for our purpose to adopt the latter plan. If, therefore, we
have a vector a, of length A, the projection of this on a line supposed
to revolve uniformly will always be equal to A.cospt, provided the
period of revolution T is such that pT = 2 it, and provided also that
the line coincides with the vector at the instant from which t is
measured.      We can, moreover, represent the value of Bsinp< by the
projection at the same instant on the same revolving line of a vector
/3 of length B, provided only that the vectors a and /3 are perpen
dicular.     It will also be evident that any other simple harmonic
function of the same period
                            mA cos pt + «B sin pt
will  be  similarly represented by the projection of the vector
                                   ma. + np,
and the length of this vector will be equal to the maximum value of
the function it represents.
   Now, in any system of conductors traversed by alternate currents,
if every electromotive force E* is a simple harmonic function of one
period, Ex = V* sin (pt + <pi), and if the coefficients of induction and
 the capacities are all constant quantities, it follows mathematically
that each current, and each voltage, can be expressed in the general
form
                                 \
                           F = cob pt + p sin pt,
which can thus be represented by the vector
                                 v = X>z-r7«/3,
where a and /3 are the perpendicular vectors representing cos pt and
empt.
   If a. and /2 are unit vectors, the length of v is i/(\? + p.-), which is
 the maximum value of the function F. The magnitude of an alter
 nate current quantity is however estimated by the square root of its
 mean square, and not by its maximum value, and since

          Alternating Currents and other Periodic Quantities.        467
if we choose   for a and /3 two perpendicular vectors of lengths numeri
cally equal to l/v/2, the length of v = \-z + ft/3 will be equal to
 v^fO^ +/*')i or *o ^ne magnitude of F.
   If now we consider the value of the mean product of two functions
F,xF,=
                 {Xicos^t+piivcipt)    (X>cos^+/t> sinpf),
we see that this mean product is
                               £ (XiX2 + ^'i^2),
or the same as the scalar product of the corresponding vectors,
    Every alternating current problem is reducible to the considera
tion of the current, voltage, and electrical power spent in the
different conductors.     Since all these quantities are varying periodi
cally some average value has to be taken. For cuiTent and voltage
the mode of averaging selected is always that obtained by taking the
square root of the mean value of the square of the quantity during
the period.      The electrical power is, however, the mean value
through the period of the product of the instantaneous values of
voltage and current.       Hence, if the current and voltage are repre
sented by vectors in the manner described, the scalar product of the
two vectors will represent the power.            This vector method is
particularly   suited to alternate  current problems, and has been very
 much used for such purposes by electricians, siuce it is simple to
understand and to apply, and it can be used for the simple solution
 of many problems which would otherwise need the use of the
 calculus.
    The method, however, assumes that all the voltages and currents
 considered vary according to a simple sine law. In ordinary com
 mercial practice this is unfortunately not the case, owing chiefly to
 saturation and hysteresis phenomena in the magnetic circuits, and
 also to the fact that ordinary dynamos do not develop an electromotive
 force varying according to a simple harmonic law. The object of
 the present investigation is to show how far this method can be
 modified, and used correctly, in cases whero the currents, although
 periodic, do not vary according to any simplo law.
    Since we shall have frequently to refer to the value of the square
 root of the mean square of a periodic function, we shall call such a
                                                                         /,"

     The mode of measuring electrical power known as the Three
Voltmeter Method,* is really dependent upon a curious property of
periodic functions which may be stated as follows :—
    If any two arbitrary periodic junctions, i\ and vz, be represented in
magnitude by the lengths of two sides of a triangle, and if the third
side represents the magnitude of v (another periodic function equal
to the sum, or difference,     of the former two), then the mean value of
the product of any two of these functions will be represented by the
product of the lengths of the two corresponding sides and the cosine
of the angle between them.
    Thus, in the figure, if CA represents v2, and BC (or CD) represents
f2, then BA will represent i-i + r2, and DA will represent t\ — 1'3; also
the mean product of («i + «2)«2 will be BAxBCcosABC, the mean
product (v> — O>)«i will be DA x CA cos CAD, and so on. Thus we may
regard ti> and v% as vectors, the length of the vector representing the
magnitude of the periodic function, and the scalar product of two
vectors the mean product of the two corresponding functions.                 Any
periodic function derivable from vx and v2, by a linear relation, can be
similarly represented in accordance with the ordinary properties of
vectors, and the scalar product of any two such vectors will be equal
to the mean product of the corresponding periodic functions.
    In order to establish this we may proceed as follows : —

   Whatever be the law of variation of    v, c,, and v2, if
                              v = vi±vi                              (1),
then                         c2 = v*+2v1vt+vii
and,  taking means, we have
which equation is the same as
                         (vj = (»J±2^+ GO'                           (2).
But if the lengths of the three sides of a triangle respectively repre
sent v, vi, and v,, we have from geometry
                   («)2 = (vl)1+ (v,y±2(v,) (v2) cos 0               (3).
whero 0 is the angle between i\ and «2.
   Comparing equations (2) and (3) with the figure, it will be seen
that for the case represented by the line AB the positive sign must
be taken in each equation, while for the other case, AD, the negative
signs must be chosen.     In either case we have v&2 =-- {vi) \vt) cos 0.
Moreover, if in equation (1) we transpose either vi or vt, and square
and proceed as before, we find that whichever two sides of the tri
angle ABC be chosen, the products of these sides into the cosine of
the anglo between them is equal to the mean product of the corre
sponding periodic functions.
   The foregoing argument shows that assuming it possible to form a
triangle with sides equal to the magnitudes of v, v\, and v2, such
triangle has the properties stated.     But we have yet to show that it
is always possible to construct such a triangle, or, in other words, to
show that any two of these quantities are together necessarily greater
than the third.
   Now if                        v = vi+v,,
we find by squaring and taking the mean that
                        (u) =    («,) +{v2)  +2vtv2;
we shall therefore prove that
provided we can establish the inequality
                            (»,) (vt) > Wt                            (4) ;

  so that   if we can show       for any two periodic functions that the pro
  duct of their magnitudes is necessarily greater than the mean value
  of their product, we shall have shown that it is always possible to
 construct a triangle the sides of which represent the magnitudes of
 any three periodic functions related as in equation (1).
     The meaning of (4) can be illustrated by supposing that t'i repre
 sents an alternating voltage applied to a conductor, and producing a
 current, r2, through it.         The right-hand element of (4) then repre
 sents the power absorbed, while the left-hand element is the product
 of volts and amperes.             The fact that the power absorbed in an
 inductive circuit is always found to be less than the product of volts
 and amperes, is usually stated by asserting that the " power factor"
 is less than unity for such circuits.           Experience has not shown any
 case  in  which   the   power   factor   of a circuit  is greater than unity, but
 this of course is no evidence of the truth of (4), which must be
 proved for the general case in which the two periodic functions are
 perfectly arbitrary Fourier series.*
    Let us therefore put
                       vt   = 2 ( Am sin mpt + Bim cos mpt)                         (5).

                        t>2 = 2  (A2m sin mpt + Blm cos mpt)                        (6).
                               m
    By taking the mean value of twice the square of each of                       these
equations, we get
                                        m
                             2®' = 2(A„,I+B*,»).
                                        m
and by taking four times the value of the mean product we get
                           4tv'2 = 22 (AwA,« + BmBim),
   * In the proof given, the two functions vt and p2 are assumed to have funda
mental periods that are commensurable with each other.        This will always be so in
practical cases, and what happens with functions of incommensurable periods is of
but theoretical interest. It is, however, worth notice that no limitation is thereby
imposed on the application of the theorems given in this paper. These theorems
deal with mean products, and the truth of them is directly deducible from the
fundamental inequality given in (4).       Now when the periods are incommensurable
the product iv'2 consists of terms such as sin mpt sin upt, where m and « are incom
mensurable, and as each of those can be expressed as the sum of (wo sinuous func
tions of angles denoted by (m ± n) pt, the mean value is zero, the vectors representic g
»i and  r3 are perpendicular, and the truth of (4) is at once evident.   But inasmuch
as the value of (m — n) may be infinitesimally small, it may be necessary to taie an
infinite time to determine the mean values.

                                      4(«V      W     > (zuiU>)        ,

     This will be proved if we can establish the algebraic inequality —
  (A,3 +   A32 +    ....   +A„!)(B1S + B3!+            ....     +B„2)

 Now it will be found quite easy to establish this inequality by an
 inductive method, but there is no need to do so here, since                           it is proved
 in the theory of determinants that
            A,2 + A2* +             + A„2              A,B, + A2B3 +        .... +A„B„

and is necessarily positive.
    It follows that the inequality (7) is true. In order that the
inequality may become an equality the necessary and sufficient condi
tions are
                             A,/B, = A./B, =            . . . .  = A„/B„.
    In other words, the two Fourier series must bear a constant ratio
to each other at every instant of time, and must be multiples of the
same Fourier function.                  This is a limiting case which is not con
templated        in    (4),  and    with      this exception only, we have shown*
that :—

   The product of the magnitudes of two periodic functions is always
greater than the mean value of their product.
  From this and from the foregoing reasoning, it follows that : —
  Any two periodic functions can be represented by vectors in such a way
that the length of each vector represents the magnitude of the function,
and the scalar product of the vectors, the mean product of the functions.
Any other function derived from, the first two by means of a linear rela
tion can     be   represented        in magnitude by a vector derived by means of the
same  linear relation from the two original vectors. The scalar product
of any two such vectors will he equal to the mean product of the corre
sponding functions.
   Now suppose       and /3 are two vectors representing two arbitrary
                         a.
Fourier series, Fa and Fa. It follows from the law of vectors that
any vector in the plane a/3 will be a linear function of a. and      and                             /?,
must therefore represent      Fourier series derivable from Fa and Fj
                                        a
in a linear manner. If, therefore, we have a third arbitrary Fourier
series, Fy, which cannot be expressed as a linear function of F« and
Fe, it follows that this cannot be represented by vector in the same           a
plane as a and         It remains to show that a vector, 7, out of this
                            /J.
plane can still be found to represent Fy.
   Let us first of all assume that three vectors a.,       (not in one                /3,   7
plane) have been found to represent three Fourier series F0, Fb, and
Fy.   We can then show that any linear function of a,       7, similarly                     #,
represents the Fourier series, which    the same linear function of F„

  If,  now, we compare the value of the sqnare of any vector
\a+p.8 + v*l with the value of the mean square of the corresponding
Fourier series XF„ + pFp + vFy, we find, by expanding and using the

We have now, however, to show that whatever Fa, Fp, Fy may                                                    be,   it
is always possible to find three vectors, «, 8, 7, to represent them.
   For this purpose let ub consider two other Fourier functions, F„
and F„ derived in a linear manner from the given functions, F«, Fp,

where       a, 6,   and   c   are scalars determined from the mean products,
                                                    a        =      FoFa,

It will     then be seen that
                                  F«F„ =       0              and          F«F, =     0,
and whatever F„ and                     F, may          be there is a real angle, 0,              for which

since the product F«FP must be less than F„ x F,.
   If, therefore, we take two planes inclined to each other at an angle,
0, and take two vectors, u, v, in these planes, drawn perpendicular to-
the line of intersection, and of such length that

  Any three periodic functions can   be represented   vectors in such a way
                                                                       by
that the length      the vector represents the magnitude
                      of                                       the function,     of
while the scalar product      any two vectors represents the mean value
                                of                                                              of
the product     the corresponding functions.
                 of                             Any other periodic function
derivable from the original three, in a linear manner, can be similarly
represented    a vector, derivable from the original three vectors
                 by                                                meant              by
of the same linear relation.
     It   will, however, be seen that           it   is   impossible, in three-dimensioned
space, to find vectors to represent four arbitrary periodic functions,
unless a linear relation connects them. For instance, the functions
sin pt, cob pt, sin 2pt, cos 2pt cannot he so represented.    The                          mean
product of any two of these         zero, and  is  impossible init    is                   three-
dimensioned space to find four lines each of which       at right           is         angles
to the other three.
   In discussing problems the solutions of which are expressible                               in
terms of the mean square of a Fourier function, or the mean product
of two such functions,    may sometimes prove advantageous to make
                            it
use of the foregoing theorem. As a rule the complicated Fourier
series occurring in actual problems are obtained in an indirect and
somewhat artificial manner by expressing in precise mathematical
language the value of some periodic quantity which can be repre
sented graphically in    very simple way. In some cases the curve,
                           a
though perfectly determinate, follows no recognised mathematical
law   ;in other cases    consists of
                           it         series of discontinuous curves,
                                                     a
each of simple mathematical character.      In all such instances the
mean square of the ordinate of such     curve, and the mean prodnct
                                                          a
of the corresponding ordinates of two such curves, can more easily
and qnickly be obtained than the Fourier expansions themselves. If
the problem only demands a knowledge of these mean squares and
mean products, the vector method will probably be the simplest one

          Alternating Currents and other Periodic Quantities.        475
to apply, and possibly many problems exist wbich may be solved in
this manner.      This seems the more likely when it is remembered
that, in problems involving periodic forces and fluxes, the energy
depends upon the mean product of the force and its corresponding flux,
or, if the forces and fluxes are proportional, upon the mean square of
the value of either.   The theorem, however, seems most immediately
applicable to the case of alternate current problems.
    To apply the theorem to alternating currents, let us first of all
consider the case of a network of conductors in which there are
only three arbitrary periodic electromotive forces, Bi, E2, and Es,
acting in the branches. If the resistances are all non-inductive, it
will always then be possible to express the current in each branch,
and the potential between any two points, as a linear function of Ei,
Es, and E3, the coefficients only involving the resistances of the net
work branches. If au st>, and a.3 are vectors representing the periodic
functions Ei, E2, E3, it will be possible to represent all the potentials
 and all the currents involved by means of a network of vectors.
    A case in which the resistance of one of the branches is inductive,
 owing to its possession of a constant coefficient of self-induction, can
best be treated by assuming that such a branch possesses an arbitrary
electromotive force E, related to the current C, passing through the
 branch in a manner given by the equation
    We know nothing of the relation between the vectors representing
 E and C, except that their scalar product is zero, and they are in
 consequence perpendicular to each other.      No energy is wasted, due
to self-induction, since
    This relation gives a certain connexion between the coefficients
 which express C as a linear function of the vectors denoting the
 electromotive forces, but does not make it possible to express E as a
 linear function of the other electromotive forces E, and E2. For
 although we may put E = \1Ei + \>E2, the coefficients A,! and \*
 will not  be  scalar quantities, since they will involve not only the
 resistances  of  the branches of the network, but also the operator
 djdt. It will always be possible to find a vector to represent E, but
 only in special cases will this vector be in the same plane as the
 vectors denoting E! and E2.
    Similarly a case in which two points of the network are connected
 with the terminals of a condenser of capacity K can best be treated

476          Dr. W. E. Sumpner.           The Vector Propertiet  of
by assuming that the condenser is replaced by a conductor possessing
an arbitrary electromotive force E, related to the current passing
through the branch in a manner given by the equation
                                 E = -r^        Cdt.
                                              0
   The vectors representing E and C are such that their scalar
product is zero, and the same remarks apply as in the preceding case.
   The case of a transformer can be similarly treated.           The reaction
due to the varying induction of the core produced by a current C
through the primary, must be treated as an arbitrary electromotive
force E. The case will differ from that of constant self-induction, in
that the vectors representing E and C are at right angles in the latter
case, but not in the former, since, owing to hysteresis and eddy
currents, the core absorbs energy, and the scalar product of the
vectors   E and C cannot      be zero.
   It  will thus be seen that     the effect of inductance in a branch of the
network, is the same as that of an arbitrary electromotive force placed
there, whether the inductance be due to constant self-induction, U>
condenser action, or to transformer action.          With this understanding
it follows that a vector figure can be drawn in space, completely repre
senting the alternating currents and potentials in a network of conductors,
provided    the number   of independent alternating electromotive forces does
not exceed three.     This figure can be drawn in a plane if the number
of  such   electromotive  forces is not more than two. Of course, where
a linear relation, with scalar coefficients, connects three electromotive
forces, only two of these are to be regarded as independent.
   Now the vector method which has hitherto been so largely used in
explaining alternating current phenomena, will not be really service
able in the new and extended application here suggested, except in
cases in which the vector figure is either confined to one plane, or
can, with all essential accuracy, be treated as if that were the case.
   Fortunately, several circumstances conspire to simplify the appli
cation of the theorem to alternate current problems. In the first
place the vectors which are needed are divisible naturally into two
sets : one representing the currents, and the other the voltages.           It
is never necessary to find the product of two of these vectors unless
they belong to different sets. Although in some cases it may not be
 possible to construct the complete vector figure in one plane, it may
still be possible to construct two figures — one for each set. In prac
tical cases one of these figures (say the current vectors) will almost
certainly be confined to one plane, and if the vectors of the other (or
voltage) network be projected perpendicularly on to this plane, the
product of any projected voltage vector and the appropriate current

           Alternating    Currents and other Periodic Quantities.      477
vector will accurately represent the corresponding quantity of power,
since it is a well-known property of vectors that the scalar product
of any two vectors is the same as the scalar product of one of them
and the perpendicular projection of the other on any plane containing
the first.
    It will only rarely happen that a plane figure will fail to give a
sufficiently accurate representation of the relations between the volts
and amperes in alternate current circuits.        These circuits are gener
ally simple    in  character.   Complication  is not caused by a multitude
 of conductors unless some of these are inductive.          A network of
non-inductive resistances may involve a large number of currents
and potentials, but they are all connected by linear relations, and
 the construction of the vector network presents no difficulty.      Wher
 ever a transformer is used, the primary and secondary circuits can
 be treated as quite distinct.       The vector figures representing them
 can indeed be drawn to different scales, the only necessary connexion
 between them being the relation which connects the power put into
 the primary core of the transformer with that taken from the secon
 dary. As a type of the most complicated circuit likely to occur, we
 may take the case of an alternator feeding the primary coil of a
 transformer, the primary terminals of which are also connected
 through a condenser.          Here we have three inductive circuits in
 parallel.    There   are  only three currents to consider. One of these
 can be expressed as the sum of the other two, and hence the current
 vectors lie in a plane.      There is only one voltago. This may not lie
 in the plane of the currents, but its projection on this plane will
 give all that is needed.        Let E be the electromotive force of the
 dynamo,      R  the  resistance   of the armature and leads up to the
 terminals of the transformer, kept at voltage V, and let C be the
 armature current, we then have
                                  E = RC + V.
  The vectors representing E and V may not be in the plane of the
  currents, but their projections on this plane are vectors which are
  connected with each other by the same linear relation as in the above
  equation, and in nearly all practical cases the projections may be
  taken to represent the voltages.
     The chief purpose for which this vector method has hitherto been
  used is to explain or to predict the nature of the changes caused in
  alternate current circuits by variations in resistance, self-induction,
  or capacity, and to deduce the relations which must be fulfilled in
  order that certain results may be obtained. It has been possible to
  do this because from the network representing one particular case it
  has been easy to draw the figures representing other cases by merely
  increasing the length of certain of the lines in the proper proportion.
                                                                           .,

 It will    be   evident that the same process is equally applicable when
 the currents are no longer of a simple sinuous character, provided
 only that the network representing one particular case can be pro
 perly drown ; for, however complicated the network may become-
 when it represents several such cases, it is obtained from the original
 network by increasing some of the vectors to correspond with the
 changes in the conductors.         If we have a current, C, passing through
 (1) a wire of resistance R, (2) a coil of self-induction L, or (3) a
condenser of capacity K, the voltages at the ends of these conductors
are given respectively by the expressions
                           EC,  L^,       a„d
                                                   -j^fedf,
                                                        o
and hence the vectors representing them are proportional                  respec
tively    to
                                  R, L, and 1/K,
and     the   effect of an alteration   in R, L, or   K  can generally be easily
indicated on the network figure.
    It   may, therefore, be     taken as established that the vector method
of representing alternate current quantities is as applicable when
the currents and potentials vary in a manner widely different from
the sine law as when they are simply sinuous. But it is desirable in
this connexion to repeat and emphasise an old warning about the
continued use of coefficients of self and mutual induction in the
theoretical investigations of alternate current problems. These co
efficients may be of service in connexion with coils not possessing
iron cores, but they are very misleading in commercial cases in which
iron is present.         By no choice of the value of these coefficients is it
possible to represent the phenomena of hysteresis. The presence of
the latter implies that the current has a different law of variation
from that of the voltage, while the assumption of constant induction
coefficients necessitates that if either the current or potential follows
a sine law the other must also.             Again, constant self-induction in
volves the assumption that there is no loss of energy in the magnetic
changes going on in the iron, an assumption which is not only known
to be wrong, but one which involves an error of serious practical
importance.         It has already* been pointed out that the difficulty of
reconciling theoretical formulae with experimental results does not
arise so much from assuming that the currents vary according to a
simple sine law, as from the quite unjustifiable assumption and use
of constant coefficients of induction.

   Recent Investigations on tlie Mechanical      Equivalent of Heat.         479
 " Note on recent Investigations on the Mechanical Equivalent
         of Heat." By E. H. Griffiths, F.R.S. Received and Read
         June 17, 1897.
    Yesterday (June 16) I received, from Professor Ames, of Johns
 Hopkins University, the results of an important investigation which
 has been carried out under the direction of Professor Rowland and
 himself.     An elaborate comparison of the thermometers used by
 Rowland, with certain standards supplied by the International
 Bureau, has been performed by Mr. W. S. Day. This comparison
 has been made under conditions as similar as possible to those
 prevalent when the thermometers were used by Rowland during his
 original experiments. A further most elaborate comparison has also
 been conducted by Messrs. C. W. Waidner and F. Mallory between
 a platinum thermometer, previously standardised at Cambridge
 (England), and Rowland's thermometers.                 The results of these
 separate investigations may be regarded as         in  practical agreement.
    The conclusions to which this prolonged investigation has led the
 authors are so important that I take this opportunity of bringing
 them before the notice of the Royal Society. Full details will be
given when the respective papers are published in America, but in
 the meantime the authors have given me permission to communicate
their results to this Society .
    The following chart is a reduced copy of the one forwarded by
Professor Ames.
    It will be seen that the alteration in Rowland's values is consider
able at certain temperatures.        This is rendered more evident in the
following table.

   These numbers are in the C.G.S. system and hydrogen scale. The
point to which      I  now chiefly wish to direct attention is this — the
slant of Rowland's corrected curve is almost exactly similar to that
resulting from my own experiments. Hence the uncertainties pre
viously existing as to the changes in the capacity for heat of water
over the range 10° to 25° C. are greatly diminished.

the difference between the value of the mechanical equivalent found
by Rowland, and that found by Griffiths and by Schuster and Gannon,

   A happy result of this agreement (arrived at by such devious
paths) concerning the changes in the capacity for heat of water, is
that we can now utilise the results recently published by Professor
Reynolds regarding the capacity for heat of water over the range 0°
to 100° C. A hurried calculation indicates that if we accept Row
land's corrected values, the mean thermal unit over the range 0° to
100° is in close equality with the " thermal unit at 19°."

   1.  The size of the cathodic shadow of an object depends upon its
own electric state, as already found by Crookes.*              If it is negatively
electrified the shadow expands.            If it is positively electrified the
shadow contracts.       The position, as well as the size of a cathodic
shadow, may be affected electrostatically ; the rays which cast the
shadow being repelled from a neighbouring body if the latter is
negatively electrified.      In some cases the contraction of the shadow
of a narrow object that is made positively electrical (anodic) may go
so far that the luminous margins approach and even overlap, giving
the appearance of a bright or negative shadow in place of a dark
one.    The enlargement of a shadow when the object is made cathodic,
and the diminution of the shadow when the object is made anodic,
both depend upon the degree of exhaustion of the tube ; and both
are augmented up to a certain point by raising the degree of
exhaustion.     They are also unequal, the enlargement when the
object is made cathodic vastly surpassing the diminution when the
object is made anodic, other things remaining equal.               The conclusion
is reached that cathode rays are capable of being deflected electro
statically, being apparently strongly repelled from a neighbouring
cathodic surface ; and less strongly attracted towards a neighbour
ing anode. Incidentally it was observed that two cathode beams
from two small disk cathodes can cross through or penetrate one
another without interfering with one another.
   2. The electrostatic deflection of cathode rays by an electrified
object is found to be dependent upon the surface of that object as
                     * '
                         Phil. Trans.,' 1879, Part II, p. 648.

      to whether it is a conductor or not.       Objects protected by a non
      conducting layer of glass do not at moderately low exhaustions,
      when made cathodic, repel or deflect cathode rays, and their shadow
      does not enlarge.     But at a certain minimum exhaustion they sud
      denly exert an electrostatic deflection. Naked objects made cathodic
      deflect the cathode rays at all exhaustions.
          3. The
                  " splash " phenomenon often observed on the tube-wall of a
      Orookes' tube, where it is struck by the cathode beam, at the stage
      of exhaustion a little below that which suffices to evoke Roentgen's
      rays is due to electrostatic deflections of the cathode rays b}' the
      charges on the glass.
          4. A hot wire used as an object casts a cathodic shadow precisely
      like that of the same wire cold.      Under some circumstances, if the
      wire is heated by an electric current, the difference between the
      electrostatic state of its different parts may slightly affect the size of
      the shadow it casts.
          5. Cathode rays cannot be concentrated by reflection either from a
      non-conducting or a conducting surface, nor by passage through a
      metal tube which is itself negatively electrified.
          6. When cathode rays strike upon an internal metal target or anti-
       cathode there are emitted from the latter (both at exhaustions lower
       than suffice to produce Rontgen rays, and at exhaustions at which
       those rays are also produced) some internal rays resembling ordi
       nary cathode rays in the following respects : — They produce a
       similar luminescence of the glass ; they cast shadows of objects ; they
       are susceptible of deflection both magnetically and electrostatically.
       But they produce no Rontgen rays where they fall upon the glass
       surf-.ice. They do not follow either the law of specular reflection,
       nor that of diffuse reflection, but are emitted from the anti-cathode
       surface apparently according to a similarly anomalous distribution
       to Rontgen 's rays, i.e., with nearly equal intensity, at all angles up
       to 90° with the normal. It is proposed to call these rays para-cathodic
       rays in contradistinction to the ordinary or ortho-cathodic rays.
       From the similarity of their distribution with that of the Rontgen
       rays it is inferred that the physical processes concerned in their
       production are identical.      These para-cathodic rays are emitted
       from the anti-cathode both when the latter is made an anode, and
       when it is neutral or even made cathodic.        From an anti-cathode
       there may proceed at one and the same time, and in one and the
        same direction, para-cathodic rays and Rontgen rays, which, meeting
       an interposed object, may cast simultaneously two shadows — a para-
        cathodic shadow on the glass, and a Rontgen shadow on an external
        screen of barium platinocyanide.     The former shadow can be deflected
        by a magnet, the latter cannot. The former shadow expands if the
        object is made cathodic ; the latter does not.

    7.  If thin metal screens       are used to    sift the cathode      rays the
luminescent phenomena change.                The rays of least penetrating
power appear       to  be  most   susceptible to magnetic and electrostatic
forces.     The various constituents of a heterogeneous cathode beam
are emitted in various proportions at different degrees of exhaustion.
In the cathode rays emitted at higher degrees of exhaustion there is
a greater proportion of the less-deflectable rays.             The least-deflect
able rays are those which most readily penetrate through a per
forated screen when that screen is itself made cathodic.
    When ordinary cathode rays fall upon a perforated screen which
is itself made cathodic, or are attempted to be passed through a
tubular cathode, there emerge beyond the screen or tube some
 rays, here termed dia-cathodic rays, which differ from the ortho-
cathodic, and also from the para-cathodic rays.              These dia-cathodic
 rays are not themselves directly deflected by a magnet.               They show
 themselves as a pale blue cone or streak.              Where they fall on the
 glass they do not excite the ordinary flnorescence of the glass.                The
 dia-cathodic rays excite, however, a different or second kind of fluor
 escence ; the tint in the case of soda-glass being a dark orange.
 Intervening objects in the beam or cone of dia-cathodic rays cast
 shadows.       The orange fluorescence         evoked on soda-glass by the
 dia-cathodic rays shows in the spectroscope the D lines of sodium
 only.     The shadows cast by dia-cathodic rays are not deflected by
 the magnet, nor do they change their size when the object is elec
 trified.

     § 1. In this paper the authors describe a long series of experi
 ments on the electrification of air and other gases with which they
 have been occupied from May, 1894, up to the present time (June,
 1897).      Some results of earlier experiments, and of preliminary
 efforts to find convenient methods of investigation, have from time
 to time been communicated to the Royal Society, the British Asso
 ciation, and the Glasgow Philosophical Society.*

     § 2. The method for testing the electrification of                  air which was
nsed in their earliest experiments was an application                     of the water-
 dropper,* long1 well known in the ordinary observation of atmo
spheric electricity.           Its nse by Maclean and Gotof in 1890 led to
an interesting discovery, that air in an enclosed vessel, previously
non-electrified, becomes electrified by a jet of water falling through
 it. An investigation of properties of matter concerned in this effect,
related as it is to the " development of electricity in the breaking
                                     "
 up of a liquid into drops             which had been discovered by Holmgren J
as early as 1873, and              to  the later investigations and discoveries
 described by Lenard,§ in his paper on the " Electricity of Water
falls," forms the subject of §§ 25 — 37 of the present communication.
     § 3. The electrification of air by drops of water, breaking from a
jet in it, or falling through it, or striking on the ground, or on
 water, or on metal below it, produces absolutely no practical disturb
 ance of the electric potential measured by the water-dropper in its
 use for the observation of open air atmospheric electricity : but con
 stitutes a serious objection to its application for investigating
 atmospheric electricity within doors, unless in a very large room
 or hall, and renders it altogether unsuitable for experimental investi
 gations, such as those described in the present paper.
     § 4. The authors were, therefore, early led to abandon it : and,
 for testing the electrification of air, they nsed three different
 methods, one or other of which they found convenient in different
 cases.
     Method      1.    Observation of electrification of the substance receiving
           the electricity equal and opposite to that taken by air in any
           case of electrification of air.
     Method 2. Observation of the electricity of an insulated metal vessel
           into which electrified air is introduced, or from which electrified
           air is removed.

   § 5. Method       1, was  used  in the experiments described in their
comnranication to the Royal Society of February, 1895, from which
it was concluded that air and several other gases tried became
electrified by blowing them in bubbles through water, and through
solutions of various salts, acids, and alkalis, in water. This conclu
sion was verified for the case of common air and pure water by
collecting, into a large reservoir over water, air which had been
bubbled through pure water in a U-tube.           The electrification of the
air thus collected was tested by a water-dropper, taking the same
potential as the air at the centre of the reservoir.            It was thus
proved that the electrification of the air was negative, as was to be
expected from the positive electrification which the authors had
found on insulated vessels containing water through which air had
been bubbled.
    § 6. Method 2, was used in the first experiments described in the
present paper (§§ 16 — 24) which were undertaken for the purpose
of determining approximately in absolute measure the total quantity
of electricity in a given mass of electrified air ; and particularly for
finding the greatest electrification which could be communicated to a
large quantity of air by needle points supplied with electricity from
an electric machine. The result thus found in § 23, 3'7 x 10-~* C.G.S.
 electrostatic, is the greatest electric density (quantity of electricity
 per cubic centimetre) which the authors have hitherto been able to
measure in air electrified by electrified needle points. But by an
 electrified hydrogen flame a density of 22 x 10-4 C.G.S. electrostatic
 unit was obtained in air (§ 65).
    § 7. In all the other experiments described in the present paper,
 Method 3 was used ; but probably the authors must return to Method
 2 if, in future, they undertake further experiments to find the greatest
 electric density which they can measure in air or other gases.
 " On the Change of Absorption produced by Fluorescence."
        By John Burke, B.A. (Dub.), Berkeley Fellow of the
        Owens College, Manchester. Communicated by Professor
        Arthur Schuster, F.R.S. Received June 10, — Read June

     If  a body, A, of some fluorescent substance,         such as uranium
 glass,   be transmitting light    from  a similar  body, B, which is fluo
 rescing, the amount of light transmitted by A from B seems quite
 different, according as A is fluorescing or not. There appears to

 exist in a dilute solution of flnorescine or eosine a small difference,
 but a strong solution of either does not permit its fluorescent light
 to penetrate, except a very small thickness of the liquid, whether
 fluorescing or not.
     Sulphate of quinine is too transparent to the luminous rays, so
 that even if a change did exist it could hardly be detected.           The case
 is otherwise with uranium glass, in which the effect is well marked.
    The compounds of uranium are remarkable for many characteristic
 properties connected with fluorescence, which they seem to exhibit
 more readily than most other bodies.               The spectrum of the fluor
escent light emitted by uranium glass shows certain maxima and
 minima, as was noticed by Stokes in 1852.
    The experiments which have been carried out with a view to
 testing whether a change in the absorption is produced by fluores
cence, have been almost exclusively upon uranium glass. Regarding
it as the most suitable substance to experiment upon, a careful
series of experiments have been made to determine whether the
phenomenon really existed or not.
    If we call a. and ft the fractions of the light from B transmitted by
A, according as the latter is fluorescing or not, for uranium glass
1 cm. thick, the values of a. in a particular set of experiments, in
which eye determinations were taken, were as follows.                      Each
experiment consisted of twenty observations.

meter is adjusted for this value the difference is most marked.
    The effect has also been shown by obtaining two photographs on
the one plate ; one photograph being the result of an exposure to
the light from two fluorescing cubes one behind the other, and
the second photograph the result of superposing the effect of the
 light from A alone, when fluorescing, upon that from B after having
passed through A, when the latter was not fluorescing. The exposure
in each of the three cases being the same, a very distinct difference
is shown in the result ; the superposed photographs being always the
darker in the negative, notwithstanding the fact that the resultant
effect of superposing two photographs due to light of the same
intensity, or nearly so, has been found not to be equal to but less
than that due to light of double the intensity acting for half the
time. If the resultant effect were equal to the sum of the separate
 ones, the effect caused by the change of absorption would have been
 still more marked.
    In the determinations of a and ft a null method has been em
ployed by which any appreciable want of uniformity in the illumi
nation can be detected.
    The source of illumination has been almost invariably the spark
discharge of a Leyden jar between cadmium electrodes, being one of
the richest sources of the fluorescence-exciting rays, and the photo

    In Mr. Larmor's Brit. Assoc. Report (1893) on the Action of
 Magnetism on Light, it is pointed out (§ 20) that there are two
 ways in which the magnetic field may affect the phenomena of light
propagation, and two corresponding types of magneto-optic theory.
It is the object of the present paper to take the fundamental
equations of the second type of theory in a general form on the lines
 of Mr. Larmor's recent papers on Electrodynamics, and to develop
 them so as to obtain the solutions of the problems of magnetic reflec
 tion and of transmission through magnetised films ; the formulae so
  obtained are compared with the available experimental results, and
  the agreement of the theory with experiment thus put to the test.

theory are those of Drs. Sissingh and Zeeman on magnetic reflec

amplitude       of the " magneto-optic component " of the reflected

   If  we suppose      that the value of x is about 62°, the agreement
shewn is remarkably good.            Experiments on polar reflection from
iron point to almost exactly the same value for x.
    If we suppose the value of C0 to be given by
                             -Co =7-288       x 10-",
the ratios of the calculated to the observed values of p          for the above
angles of incidence are found to be respectively 1-13, 0-96, f>99, 0'97,
rOl, l-03, and 0'97 ; so that in the case of the amplitudes also there
is good agreement.
   6. For nickel the agreement of theory with experiment, thongh
not so exact as in the case of iron, is still very good.             The values
indicated for the constants are
                  x = 76° to 80°,         -C„  = 9-225 x  10~w.
   The agreement is better for cobalt, being specially good in the
amplitude experiments. For polar reflection at incidences of 45°,
(10°, and 73°, the ratios of the calculated to the observed values of /t
are found to be 098, 097, and 107 respectively.                The values indi
cated for the constants are
                       x =64°,        -C„   = 1-227 xlCT10.
   7.  The theory gives a satisfactory account of a phenomenon which
has only recently been discovered, namely an effect of the com
ponent of magnetisation perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
The change of phase which measures this effect has been observed by
Zeeman, who, in a particular case, found it to be 0'003 X 90°, with a
mean error of O'OOl x 90°.           The value indicated by the theory is
0-00243 x 90°.
   8.  Two of the many available experiments on transmission through
magnetised metallic films are used to test the theory. In one of
these the rotation observed by Lobach is l-62°, while the value indi
cated by the theory is 0'961o. In the other the rotation observed by

490        Magnetic Properties     of Iron  at High Temperatures.
 Drnde is 4'25°, the theoretical value being 2972°.       When   it is borne
 in mind that the value of the magneto-optic constant derived from
 reflection experiments has here been applied to test experiments ou
 transmission through films, with results not only of the same order
 of magnitude, but identical within the limits of uncertainty of the
 intensity of magnetisation, the agreement must be considered as a
very satisfactory vindication          both oE the theory and of the
 experiments.
    9. It is to be noticed that, as 6i, bit b, are necessarily real, the
 imaginary part of Cue" must be entirely accounted for by the Hall
effect.    Hence the present theory involves the supposition that the
 Hall effect is very much greater for exceedingly rapidly alternating
currents than for steady ones. There is nothing unnatural in this
supposition, which may be compared with the fact discovered by
Maxwell, that the ordinary coefficients of conductivity are very much
smaller in the optical circumstances.

this opinion. I would therefore wish to delete the following sentences

with approximately pure iron as is shown in Curve XXXIX, and can
only conclude that I must have been in error as to the composition of
the sample examined.         I therefore wish in the last paragraph of the
paper to speak of the sample as of unknown composition ; to strike
out the words " This shows why soft iron apparently does not
recalesce "; to substitute "this" for "the" and strike out " of the
soft iron " in the last line.

    1. Although this paper contains the results of a very large amount
of arithmetical work, which has been in progress during the last
two or three years, it is not intended in the first place as a contri
bution to the meteorology of the British Isles.          It is especially
intended as an illustration of      method.    The  authors believe that
hitherto no exact theory of variation or of correlation has been applied
to meteorological observations, and they have endeavoured to indi
cate that fruitful results may be obtained from such a theory when
applied to one branch at least of meteorology, namely, barometric
frequency.     They wished to deal with a fairly extended area with
an easily accessible material, and this was found in the Meteorological
Observations at Stations of the Second Order for the British Isles. The
"            "
   telegraph stations would have provided better material, but it was
far less accessible.    The authors have accordingly only dealt with
three telegraph stations. The main body of their data was drawn
from twenty stations of the second order, four of which are in
Ireland, and the remainder distributed round the coast of England,
Wales, and Scotland, as indicated on a chart accompanying the
memoir.
    2. Their first object was to determine the nature of the barometric
frequency distribution.     By means of tables and plates it is shown
that it can be described with a very high degree of accuracy by
the use of a generalised frequency curve of the type —
                                   /    x\r
                                  -V
a type which has been fully discussed in a previous memoir on skew
variation.
    A standard frequency curve for the British Isles having been
selected, it is shown that the frequency distribution varies con

   492            Prof. Karl Pearson and Miss Alice Lee.
   timionsly from this type as we pass from station to station, and
   appears to be fairly uniform along lines which are termed gener
   alised isobars. If this result should be confirmed, then the positions
   of these generalised isobars would require a larger series of stations
   with observations for a longer period of years to determine them
   accurately.
       3. The authors' next object was to discover what constants of the
   barometric frequency suffice to describe it with the least probable
   error. A somewhat elaborate investigation was accordingly made
   into the probable errors of the constants, and four physical quantities,
   the mean, the variation (or standard deviation), the skewness, and
   the modal frequency were found to be the constants, which described
    a local barometric frequency with the smallest probable errors.
       4. They have next discussed the chief physical features of a
    barometric frequency distribution.
       (a) The modal height and the modal frequency are found to
    possess certain advantages over the mean height and the mean fre
    quency. Various methods are considered for approximately deter
    mining the position of the mode.         The mean modal height for
    Great Britain is shown to be very nearly the standard atmosphere
   of 30".
       (6) The variability of the barometric height and the skewness of
    the distribution are discussed at some length.      A formula is given
   in terms of the skewness for calculating the probability that the
   barometer at any station will be in excess or defect of the mode or
   of the mean.
       (c) A test of the accuracy of the observations for the twenty coast
    stations is made by attempting to interpolate the frequency constants
    of London and Cambridge from those of Southampton, Hillington,
    and St. Leonards.     The results are fairly close when tested with the
   results for London and Cambridge calculated directly from the
    telegraph station returns.
       5. In the second part of the memoir the subject of correlation is
   dealt with. It is shown that within the limits of the British Isles
   there is a very high degree of correlation (as high as 0-9824 between
   Babbacombe and Churchstoke), only sinking to 0'7572 if we take
   practically the utmost reach of the British Isles.       The correlation
   differs with directions more or less along and more or less perpen
   dicular to the generalised isobars, and it is pointed out that this
   gradual change with direction and distance, combined with change
   owing to the interval of time between observations, enables the
   meteorologist to find systems of stations with almost every variety
   of correlation coefficient.
       The probable height and probable deviation from that height at
   any given station, based on a knowledge of the heights, contempora-
-V

            Distribution of Frequency of the Barometric Height.        493
neous or not, at one, two, three, or more other stations, are considered.
It    is indicated that with a proper arrangement of times and dis
tribution of stations it must be possible to make the probable devia
tion zero or nearly zero, and hence to predict with very great
accuracy the height at one station from a knowledge of heights
at other selected stations. The suggestion is made that this prin
 ciple might very possibly be applied to closely predict fnture baro
 metric heights at a given station from antedated observations at
 other selected stations.
     Various theorems are deduced from the general principles of
 correlation : thus, it is shown that —
     (a) There is a balance height for every pair of stations, such that
 when the barometer stands above this height at one station it will
 usually stand below it at the other, and vice versa.
      (h) That for a very considerable number of triplets of stations
  which are positively correlated together, so that a high barometer
 at one means usually a high barometer at a second, it can still be
  predicted that if the barometer be steady at one, a rise or fall at
 the second denotes a fall or rise respectively at the third member of
  the triplet.
      These principles are illustrated from actual observations at stations
  in the British Isles. The memoir concludes with an appendix, giving
  an account of a frequency -recording barometer devised by Mr. G. U.
  Yule.
      The writers hope that their paper may draw attention           to the
   importance of rendering the large amount of barometric observa-
   tions now made, available for the easy calculation of the variation
   and correlation coefficients.   They consider that if a chain of stations
   round a large continental area could have their correlation for a
   series of intervals of time worked out, much might be done in the
   way of very close prediction of barometric changes.

    assistance in a variety of ways.

    He returned to London       at the end of 1855, and through the
influence of Professor Sharpey, obtained the post of Curator to the
 Anatomical Museum of University College.            In 1859 he was
 appointed to the Professorship of Medical Jurisprudence, and not
 long afterwards joined the Medical Staff of University College
 Hospital.
    George Harley married, in 1861, Emma Jessie, the youngest
 daughter of James Muspratt, of Seaforth Hall, Liverpool.        Among
 his children are Ethel, now Mrs. A. Tweedie, the known writer, and
 Dr. Vaughan Harley who, following in his father's footsteps, is now
 Professor of Pathological Chemistry at University College.
    In 1861 Harley received the triennial prize of the Royal College
 of Surgeons for an Essay on the Anatomy and Physiology of the
 Supra-Renal Bodies, and the College also granted him the John
 Hunter Gold Medal, of which there has only been one awarded
 since 1858. In 1864 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College
of Physicians of London, and in the year following, a Fellow of the
 Royal Society, having previously been made a Corresponding Member
of the Academy of Science of Bavaria, and of the Academy of Medicine
 of Madrid.
    Harley's career was nearly cut short in 1864, while working with
 a powerfully illuminated small-lens microscope, when a blood-vessel
burst in his left eye, ending in retinitis, which was so severe that
 he was confined to complete darkness for a period of nine months,
ending, however, in a perfect cure.       He had to wear dark-tinted
glasses for a considerable time before he could use his sight freely,
and remarked to the writer of this notice, that while wearing
"goggles," as he could not see well, he became accustomed to look
at things more carefully than he had done before, and that when
subsequently he dropped his glasses, could actually see better than
before, as from training he had improved his powers of observation.
Other men under similar circumstances would             probably have
retired into a quiet private life, but tho fact that Harley had suffi.
cient self-possession to accept a complete privation of light for nine
months shows the dogged resolution and perseverance which was,
perhaps, the main trait of his character, and carried him through
so much good and useful work.
   Harley loved to roam over a variety of subjects ; he would ponder
over any matter of interest to him and then record his ideas in
print.

action of poisons and the functions of the liver, were apparently the
origin of Harley's scientific bent of mind, and we find him early in
his career investigating the action of " atropine " in dilating the
pupil, of strychnine on the spinal cord, and of the " Calabar bean."
Then he took to the special study of the liver, and in 1883 wrote
his elaborate treatise on diseases of the liver, a book which was very
favourably received and had a great circulation, being translated
into several languages. He communicated many papers to the Royal
Society — one of them even as early as 1856-7, and in 1865 was the
author of a paper in the ' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
         ' "
Society      On the Influence of Physical agents on the Blood, with
Special  Reference   to the Mutual Action of the Blood on the Respira
tory Gases."     He also wrote in the ' Transactions ' of the Micro
                                                               '
scopical, Zoological, and Anthropological Societies, in the Comptes
Rendus de l'Acadernie,' and was the author of a number of contribu
tions to the medical papers.        It would be too long to give an
enumeration of all George Harley's writings scientific and medical ;
he was never at rest ; and when he died he must have felt conscious
that he had done his duty and completed his work.
                                                                 W. M.
   Augustus   Wollaston Franks was the elder son of Captain Frede
rick Franks, R.N., and Frederica, daughter of Sir John Sebright
Bart., of Beechwood, Herts.       He was born on March 20, 1826, at
Geneva, and his second name records the fact that the celebrated Dr.
 Wollaston, F.R.S., was one of his godfathers. At Geneva and at
Rome his parents resided during his boyhood, when he became wel
 versed in French and Italian.    His school education was, however, at
 Eton, whence in due course he proceeded to Trinity College, Cam
 bridge, where he took his B.A. degree in 1849, and his M.A. in 1852.
 While still at college he exhibited a strong attachment to mediaeval
antiquities, and in 1849 published a volume on Ornamental Glazing
                                                   '
 Quarries,' many of the illustrations in which were drawn by himself.
He subsequently published a treatise on ' Vitreous Art in the Art
 Treasures of the Manchester Exhibition.'       It was, however, as one
 of the editors of Kemble's
                              '
                                Horas Ferales,' which was published in
 1863, that he established his position as a scientific archaeologist,
for it was in that work that he first brought before the world his
views on a phase of civilization corresponding in the main with what
on the Continent is known as " the Early Iron Age," the remains of
which are perhaps more characteristically present in the British
Isles than in any other part of Europe.        For the term " late-Celtic
 Period," by which this stage in human progress is now generally
 known, we are indebted to Sir Wollaston Franks.
    He also took a warm interest in prehistoric archaeology, and at

                                     XI
the time when Lartet and Christy were carrying on their investiga
tions in the early caverns of the Dordogne he materially aided them
in their researches, and also afforded valuable assistance in the publi
cation of the ' Reliquicae Aquitanicae.'     It was mainly through his
friendship with Mr. Henry Christy that the latter resolved to
bequeath his fine ethnological collections, together with an endow
 ment fund, to truntees, of whom Mr. Franks was one. Through his
 exertions, and aided by his own liberality, the Christy collection
 has attained its present extreme importance, and has been incorpo
 rated with the- national collections at the British Museum, where the
 whole have been arranged under the immediate superintendence of
 Sir Wollaston Franks.
    His connexion with that Museum extended over a period of more
than forty-six years.     In 1850 an Exhibition of Mediaeval Art was
held at the rooms of the Society of Arts, for which he acted as
 honorary secretary, and it would seem that the acquaintance that he
 then showed with all that related to mediaeval antiquity induced Mr.
 Hawkins, the keeper of the Department of Antiquities at the British
 Museum, to offer to him the post of an assistant in that Department.
 On the 1st of March, 1851, he received the appointment, and during
 his long connexion with the Museum wituessed an immense develop
 ment in its archaeological collections, towards which he in no small
 degree contributed, and also a subdivision of the old Department of
 Antiquities into four departments, each charged with some special
 branch of archaeology, of one of which, that of British and Mediaeval
 Antiquities and Ethnography, he became keeper in 1866. To any one
 looking back to what the collections were at that date, and comparing
 them with what they are at the present time, the advance in extent,
 value, interest, and importance seems almost incredible. Much of
 this has been due to Mr. Franks' great personal influence with col
 lectors, several of whom, actuated in no small degree by the confi
 dence they reposed in him, have bequeathed their whole collections
 to the nation, while others have presented choice and valuable speci
 mens.    Of such liberality, he was himself the most conspicuous
 example. During the whole time that he was connected with the
 Museum it may be said that not a year passed without his presenting
 to the collections some objects for which the trustees had to return
 their special thanks, and when from want of funds some desirable
 purchase could not bo made by the Museum, his private liberality
 was sure to come to the rescue.     Nor was this liberality checked by
 the grave, for he has bequeathed to the Museum collections of rings,
 jewellery, drinking cups, and other objects, valued at a sum of
 £50,000.
    In connexion with his work at the Museum may be mentioned
  the ' Medallic Illustrations of the History of Great Britain and

                                    Xll
 Ireland,' which was published in two volumes by the trustees in
  1885.    This book, which was based on a catalogue compiled by the
 late Mr. Edward Hawkins, was completed and in a great measure
  re-written by Mr. Franks, though the work was in reality outside
 his own department. In carrying out his object he was much aided
 by Mr. H. A. Grueber, and the Illustrations will long remain the
                                  '            '
 standard authority on the subject of British medals struck before the
 death of George II.
    His connexion with the Society of Antiquaries was almost as long
 as that with the British Museum, he having been elected a Fellow in
 1853.    He did much to improve its library and its publications, and
 for upwards of twenty years he was Director of the Society.       His
 communications, both to its Proceedings and to the Archteologia,
 were numerous and important.       In 1892 he was elected President,
 thus becoming an ex officio trustee of the British Museum, and on
 his retirement from the post of Keeper of British and Mediaeval
 Antiquities and Ethnography in 1896 he was elected a member of the
 Standing Committee of Trustees.
    He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1874, and was an
Honorary Member of the Royal Irish Academy and of numerous
Foreign Societies. He also for some years before his death held the
post of Antiquary to the Royal Academy. The University of Oxford
conferred upon him the honorary degree of D.C.L., and that of Cam
bridge of Litt. D., and in 1894 he was promoted by Her Majesty to
the rank of K.C.B.                               .
    Among British archaeologists there was no one who had a wider or
more accurate knowledge in nearly every department than Sir Wol-
laston Franks, and he was ever ready to communicate all that he
knew with characteristic liberality. Tt is, however, sad to think
what an amount of incommunicable knowledge has perished with
him. His kindly nature led to the formation of numerous and endur
ing friendships, and his death leaves in the hearts of many a void
that can never be refilled.
