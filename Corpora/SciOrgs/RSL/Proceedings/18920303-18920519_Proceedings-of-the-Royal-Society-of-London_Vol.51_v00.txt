 1.  “Certain Correlated Variations in Crangon vulgaris.”          By W.
      F. R. WELDON, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow of St. John’s College.
      Cambridge, Professor of Zoology in University College
      London.     Received February 11, 1892.
    The <U+FB01>rst successful attempt to <U+FB01>nd a constant relation between th<
 variations in size exhibited by one organ of an animal body and 1111081
 occurring in other organs was made some three years ago by Mr
 Galton; and in a paper read before the Royal Society (‘ Roy. Soc
 Proc.,’ vol. 45, p. 135) he determined this relation between sever-a.
 organs of the human body. In what follows an attempt is made t<
 apply Mr. Galton’s method to the measurement of the correlatim
 between four organs of the common shrimp. Before the details 0
 the measurement are discussed, a short summary of the method wil
 be given.                                                              ,
    Galton’s starting point was the fact that each organ of a given rac.
 of men varies about its mean size to an extent and with a frequenc;
 indicated    by the probability   equation
                                              (y

    mimected    that when the deviation of one variable from its average is
    known    the mean deviation of the second is known, then, evidently, a
     surface can, from these data, be constructed,      showing the relative fre
     quency of occurrence       of all possible combinations between the two
                    The changes produced in such-a surface by changes in
’
      variables.
      the degree of interdependence         of the two variables have been in
      vestigated,   at Mr.  Galton’s  request,  by Mr. J. D. H. Dickson (‘ Roy.
       Soc. Proc.,'  vol. 440, 1886, p. 63). 'The results of this investigation,
       which are of importance for the present purpose, are two :-—
          (1   In the population examined, let all those individuals be chosen
       in which a certain organ, A, differs from its average size by a <U+FB01>xed
        mount, Y ; then, in these individuals, let the deviations of a second
        organ, B, from its average be measured.         The various individuals
        will exhibit deviations of B equal to an, mg, :03, . . . . , whose mean may
        be called mm.   The ratio wm/Y will be constant for all values of Y.
           In the same way, suppose those individuals are chosen in which
        the organ B has a constant deviation, X ; then, in these individuals,
       3],, the mean deviation of the organ A, will have the same ratio to X,
       whatever may be the value of X.
           (2.) The ratios mm/Y and ym/X are connected by an interesting
       relation.     Let Q“ represent the probable error of distribution of the
      organ A about its average, and Q5 that of the organ B ; then——

             So that by taking   <U+FB01>xed deviation of either organ, expressed in
                                       a
      terms of its probable     error,  and by expressing the mean associated
      deviation of the second organ    in terms of its probable error, a ratio may
      be determined,    whose value becomes                  i1
                                                         when a change in either
      organ  involves   an  equal  change    in  the  other,   and   when the two   0
      organs  are quite  independent.     This  constant,   therefore, measures the
                               ”            the   two
        degree of correlation     between              organs.
      “
          Adetermination of this constant will now be made in the case of
      <U+FB01>ve pairs of organs of the shrimp.         In accordance with Mr. Galton’s
      notation, the- constant will be denoted by             the mean size of each

are expressed in terms of the body length, taken as 1,000. As the
average length of the shrimps used was rather over 50 mm., the
measurements, in the form in which they are recorded, are accurate
only to the nearest unit. The roughness of the edges of the parts
measured, and the fact that the animals were preserved            in spirit,
made any attempt to attain greater accuracy exceedingly dif<U+FB01>cult.
   The variations in the length of the four organs here discussed have
already been shown to occur with a frequency which agrees very
                                                               ‘
closely with that indicated by the law of probability (cf. Roy. Soc.
Proc.,’ vol. 47, p. 4415). The closeness with which the distribution of
deviations in the samples used agreed with that indicated by a proba
bility curve may be gathered from the diagrams, <U+FB01>gs. 2 and 3, which‘
are fairly typical of the whole series.
    l.——T0tal Length of Carapace and Length of Post-spinous      Portion.
   The relation between these two parts has been determined          in <U+FB01>ve
races of shrimps; of these the sample containing the greatest num
ber of individuals was obtained        at the laboratory of the Marine
Biological Association at Plymouth.
   The mean length of the carapace, in 1000 adult female shrimps
from Plymouth, was 249'63 thousandths of the body length; the
probable error of distribution about this average was 4'55.           These
numbers will be denoted in what follows by M, and QC respectively.
The mean length of the post-spinous portion (Mm) was 177.53, its
probable error (QB) being 3‘50.
    These numbers having been determined, the individuals were
 sorted into groups, such that the recorded length of the carapace, c
 was the same in each group.       The mean length of the post-spinoua
 portion, 10s, was  then  determined in each group. The results are
 entered in the <U+FB01>rst two columns of Table I.       Each pair of entries ii
 the table gives a datum for determining the mean deviation of 1).
 which is associated with a given value of c. If each value obtained it
 this way be divided by the probable error of the organ to which i1
 belongs, a series of pairs of values will be obtained, from each of which

         FIGS. 2 and 3.—Curves            of frequency of all observed magnitudes of post-spinons
      lengths   (<U+FB01>g, 2) and total          carapace lengths (<U+FB01>g. 3) in 1000 adult female shrimps
      from Plymouth.             The dotted curve is a probability curve of the calculated probable
      error: the continuous curve shows the results of observation.            The horizontal scale
      represents tbousandths            of the body length: the vertical scale represents tens of
  -
      individuals.
      the  value    of   r    can be separately determined. This process has been
      performed for each of the values entered in the <U+FB01>rst two columns of
      Table I, and the results are recorded in the third and fourth columns.
        In Table II, the results of a similar process are shown, but the
     individuals have been sorted into groups in each of which the length
     of the post-spinous              portion 0f the carapace is constant, and the mean
     value 0f the total carapace length has been determined                       in each group.
    As before, the immediate                   results of these determinations are entered
    in [he <U+FB01>rst two
                                  columns, and the deviation of each entry in these
    Columns from            its corresponding average, divided by its “probable
    mom”     is given         in the third and fourth columns.

    The mean value of r, as determined from these two tables, is 081 ;
 that is to say, if all those individuals be chosen in which the deviation
 of one of the two organs from its average length is m times the prob
 able error of that organ, the mean deviation from the average size of
 the other organ in the individuals chosen will be 081712 times its
 probable error.
    If the variations in size occurred in each of these two organs with
  a frequency equal to that indicated by a probability curve, then every
 pair of entries in each table should give the same value of 1'. As the
  conformity between the observed frequency and that indicated by
 probability is only approximate, the individual determinations give
  values which di<U+FB02>er slightly from one another; but these variation:
  are on the whole small, as may be shown in three ways.
     In <U+FB01>g. 4, all the determinations of r are indicated: the deviation 01

 \       So  that   the assigned value of r ful<U+FB01>ls all the required conditions
     very fairly well.
          Having found a relation between the deviation of carapace lengths
      and that of post-spinous lengths, which is constant for all magnitudes
      of   either  organ in one local race, the question at once arises whether
      this   relation is not a. speci<U+FB01>c character of the shrimp, which is con
       stant in all local races.        At the beginning of the inquiry Mr. Galtou
       suggested      to me   that  the   relation between the two organs indicated
       by the value of 'r was of such a kind that r might be expected to have
        the same value in all races of the same species, and in some cases in
       groups of species.         A determination of the relation between carapace
        length and post-spinous length, and of other relations which are to be
       discussed below, has abundantly con<U+FB01>rmed Mr. Galton’s prediction.
           In order to test the constancy of the relation between them, the
       variations in total length of carapace, and in length of the post-spinous
       portion, were measured in samples of adult female shrimps from
      Helder (North Holland), from Southport, from Sheerness, and from
      RoscoE (Finistére)——that is, from four ~places fairly distant from
      Plymouth, and differing from Plymouth and from each other in
      climatic conditions, in salinity and other characters of the sea water,
      and in nature of the sea bottom<U+FB01>“                Each of these races was found to
      differ from the others in the average length of the organs measured,
      and in the probable error of distribution of each organ about its
      average ; but the relation between the two organs, as measured by the
      value of r, was very fairly constant throughout.
           The details of each determination of 'r are given in Tables III—X,
       at the end of the paper; they are constructed on precisely the same
       plan as that used for Tables I and II, and need not therefore be.
       furthcr‘explained.          The values of 'r deduced from all the tables are—
              In Plymouth       .....     'r =   0'81 (1000 individuals examined).

          The    approach to identity between these values is very striking.

and Southport, is too small to allow of a satisfactory determination of
the second decimal place. The reader, who cares to do so, may satisfy
himself of this by taking 0'80 or 0'82 as values of 'r in the Plymouth
tables, when he will <U+FB01>nd the agreement                between calculated and
observed values of the associated organ to be only slightly less close
than in the existing table.
    It may, therefore, be fairly said that the values of 1' obtained by
examining <U+FB01>ve races of shrimps are not inconsistent with the exist
ence of a constant value in all the races examined—a value lying
somewhere      between 0'80 and 0'85.
    So that   if the deviation of total carapace length from its average be
expressed    in  terms of its probable error, and if the deviation of the
post-spinous portion be in the same way expressed in terms of its prob
able error, then, when either organ differs from its average by any
constant amount, the mean deviation of the other will be a constant
 fraction of that amount, the fraction being between 0'80 and 0‘85.
    A similar approximation to constancy has been found to exist in
the relation between three other pairs of organs, determined in the
samples from Plymouth and from Southport.                  These organs are so
largely independent that the probable error of the determination is
 much greater than before ; and accordingly the irregularities in the
 results are much greater than in the previous case. The mean values
 of 'r are as follows :—
                        Carapace length    Carapace length       Telson and
                         and tergum vi.      and telson.         tergum vi.

     Southport . . . .        0 ‘06              0' 141             —9 '09
     These values are found from the tables at the end of the paper,
 from which it will be evident that the determination is much less
 reliable than that <U+FB01>rst discussed.
     So far, we have only investigated the mean deviation of each organ
  which is associated with a known constant deviation of another organ.
  But since a <U+FB01>xed deviation of one organ does not as a rule involve a,
  <U+FB01>xed deviation of the second, it becomes necessary to inquire how the
  values of this second organ are distributed about their mean.              Mr.
  Galton points out that the deviations of each dependent              Organ are
  distributed about their mean with a probable error of Q ~/1—'rz.            So
  that in Plymouth, for example, those post-spinous carapace lengths
  which are associated with any <U+FB01>xed total carapace length should be dis
  tributed about their mean, with a probable error of Q," ~/l —- (0'81)2
 or 3'5 (7-34, or 2‘03 nearly. In the same way, the values of total

1892.]           Correlated Variations in Crangon vulgaris.                11
carapace     length which are associated with a <U+FB01>xed length of the post
spinous     portion should be distributed about their mean with a
probable     error of 4‘55 Mm, or nearly 2'64. Therefore, when the
Plymouth       shrimps were sorted into groups, such as those used in
Table    I, such that the carapace length was constant in each, then the
pcst-spinous lengths in each group should have been distributed about
 the mean given in the table with a probable error of 2'03.       The largest
 of these groups contained only about eighty individuals, so that any
 accurate determination of this point was out of the question; but a
 rough estimate of the probable error was made in each group which
 contained more than forty individuals, and the mean value obtained
  in this way was 1'96, which is perhaps suf<U+FB01>ciently near to 2'03.         A
  similar treatment of the groups in Table     II gave 2'59  as the probable
  error of distribution;   and this, again, is not very different from 2'64.
     The other samples show a similar rough agreement between the
  probable error of the dependent organ in each gr0up and that indi
  cated by the value Q ~/1———r2; but the numbers employed are too
   small to make a determination of this point worth serious discussion.
      It cannot be pretended that the results .here given are either
   suf<U+FB01>ciently numerous or su<U+FB01>iciently accurate to serve as a basis for
   generalisation; but at the same time they seem certainly to suggest
   a very important conclusion.     For if the values of r have really the
   degree   of  constancy which  has  been attributed to them, then by ex
   pressing the deviation of every organ examined from its average in
   terms of the probable error of that organ, the deviation of any one of
   these organs from its average can be shown to have a de<U+FB01>nite ratio
   to the associated deviation of each of the others, which is constant
   for all the races examined. And since both the organs measured and
   the samples of shrimps examined were chosen, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, by
   chance, any result which holds for all these organs through all these
   races may be reasonably expected to prove generally true of all organs
   through the whole species.
      That is, the results recorded lead to the hope that, by expressing
   the deviation of every organ from its average in Mr. Galton’s system
   of units, a series of constants may be determined for any species of
   animal which will give a numerical measure of the average condition
   of any number of organs which is associated with a known condition
   of any one of them.    A large series of such speci<U+FB01>c constants would
   give an altogether new kind of knowledge of the physiological con
   nexion between the various organs of animals; while a study of those
   relations which remain constant through large groups of species
   would give an idea, attainable at present in no other way, of the
   functional correlations between various organs which have led to the
   establishment of the great sub-divisions of the animal kingdom.

                            University College, London).
                                     (Abstract)
    The subject is introduced by an allusion to the attempts that have
been made       by anatomists to determine the functional relationships
between the nerve roots and groups of muscles they supply, in which
connexion the work of Krause, Schwalbe, Herringham, and Paterson
are cited.      A brief reference is made to the observations of Erb,
 Dnchenne, Knie, and Thorburn, after which the author refers to
the experimental work that has been done in this <U+FB01>eld by Miiller and
Van Deen, Kronenberg, Panizza, Peyer, Krause, Ferrier and Yec,
Bert, Marcacci, and Forgue.               The anatomical accounts of the
brachial plexus of the dog as given by Ellenberger and Baum,
Chanveau and Arloing, and Forgue are quoted, the discrepancies which
exist between these different accounts pointed out, and the author’s
own experiences in this connexion, differing in some points, while
agreeing in others, with the descriptions given by these observers,
 are detailed.
    He then proceeds to explain his methods of experimentation, which
consisted    in :—
    1.   Observation of the compound movements in the fore limb of the
 dog by electrical excitation of the peripheral end of the whole of a
cervico-brachial nerve root which had been previously exposed and
divided.
    2. Minute di<U+FB01>‘erentiation obtained by electrical excitation of the
individual bundles composing such a nerve root.
    3. Direct observation (after dissection) of the muscles thrown into
action by electrical excitation of the separate nerve roots.                 As a
corollary to this, the question as to whether or no a single bundle of
<U+FB01>bres representing a single simple movement in :a nerve root ever
remains distinct in its course to the muscles it supplies, without
inosculating with other nerve <U+FB01>bres, is dealt with. A further point
determined is whether, when a muscle receives nerve <U+FB01>bres from more
than one cervico-brachial nerve root, both nerve roots supply <U+FB01>bres to
one and the same muscle <U+FB01>bre or not.
    4. Alteration in the action of the fore limb in progression or in
standing, evoked by section of a nerve root or roots.
    5. In<U+FB02>uence of section of a root
                                             _or roots in excluding part of a

generalised    epileptic    spasm induced in the limb by cortical excita
tion.
    6.  Differentiation of parts of the nerve roots by the degeneration
 method,    in which connexion an allusion is made to certain results
 obtained by the author, which do not accord with the Wallerian law
 oi degeneration,     and which       are in accord   with  the experiments   of
  Joseph.
     From the results of these various methods of experimentation, the
   author draws the following conclusions :—
                            I.  Stimulation Experiments.
      1. The compound movement obtained by stimulation of awhole
   nerve root is a well-coordinated one, depending on the action of a
   group of muscles in synergic combination, as Ferrier and Yeo showed
  to be the case in the monkey.
      2. This compound effect may be resolved into its component factors
  when it is found that movements diametrically opposed to each other
  may be represented in the same nerve root, e.g., <U+FB02>exion and extension.
      3. Such single simple movements bear a constant relation to the
  nerve roots, the same movements being always found in any given
  root, and thus such movements always bear the same relation to the
  spinal level; e.g., <U+FB02>exion of the elbow is always represented one root
  higher than extension of the same joint.
      4. Fibres representing a certain movement always preserve lhe
  same position in a given nerve root; e.g., extension of the wrist is
  represented by a bundle of <U+FB01>bres in the upper part of the circum
  ference, while <U+FB02>exion is represented by a bundle of <U+FB01>bres in the lower
 part of the same root.
      5. Each bundle of nerve <U+FB01>bres representing a single simple move
 ment in a nerve root remains distinct in its course to the muscle or
  muscles producing such a movement, without inoscnlating with other
 motor nerve <U+FB01>bres.
     6. The group of muscles supplied by any given nerve root occupy
 both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the limb.          In other words,
 muscles whose unimpeded action would produce one movement are
 represented in the same root as others whose action would produce a
  movement diametrically opposite.
     7. In such combinations         certain muscles are always more exten
 sively   represented    than    others,  so that, with a current su<U+FB01>iciently
 “mug to      stimulate     all  the  <U+FB01>bres   of a nerve root equally, certain
 muscles predorninate
                            in  their action  over others.
    8. The muscles
                        whose    action  predominates in one root always pre
 dominate in that
                       room
                                                               .

in their action in    one root, those producing    extension predominate    in
another.
   10.   It is possible, by stimulation of a single bundle of <U+FB01>bres in a
nerve root, to produce contraction of a single muscle, and it alone.
    11. The same muscle is always represented in more than one nerve
root, usually two, and to an unequal extent in these.
    12. When the same muscle is represented in two nerve roots, the
muscle <U+FB01>bres innervated by one root are not innervated by the other.
                           11.

   1. Division of any given nerve root produces paresis of the        group
of muscles supplied by it.
   2. This paresis is only temporary, and soon passes o<U+FB01> almost        com
pletely.
   3. Such division of a nerve root does not result in incoordination
of the remaining muscular combinations represented in other nerve
roots.
III.   Exclusion of a certain Root 0r Roots during an Epileptic Spasm in.
   the  Limb (the root being divided at the time, and not some time
  previously) .
   1. Division of one or more nerve roots produces alteration of the
position of a limb during an epileptic spasm, which altered position
depends on the particular muscular combinations that have been thus
thrown out of action.
   2. No incoordination is produced in the action of the remaining
muscular combinations.
   3. There is no evidence of over<U+FB02>ow of the impulses which ought to
travel down the divided root into other channels through the spinal
centres, so as to reach the muscles by new paths.
                           IV.    Degeneration Method.
   1.  These    experiments con<U+FB01>rm the anatomical facts that had been
previously     ascertained   by dissection, as to which nerve roots supply
any given nerve with <U+FB01>bres.
   2. The degeneration       which results in the nerves is not a scattered
one, but is localised to distinct bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres occupying a
certain position in the transverse section of the nerve.
   3. The Wallerian law of degeneration is found to be en'oneous with
regard to the degenerations which result on division of a nerve root
on the distal side of the intervertebral ganglion; for not only is de
generation found in the peripheral end of such a root, but also in that
portion of the sensory root between the ganglion and the spinal cord;

pointingto the probability that there are certain nerve <U+FB01>bres which do
not depend on the ganglion for their trophic supply, but derive the
same from elsewhere, either the spinal cord at another level, or the
periphery.
  In conclusion, the author call special attention to the value of the
method of excluding one or more nerve roots during an epileptic
spasm, as affording   a means of con<U+FB01>rming the facts that have been
previously observed from stimulation of the nerve roots, and also of
ascertaining new facts with regard to them and the plexuses which
 they form.  He further goes on to point out that it supplies a valuable
 means of studying the manner in which conduction of impulses from
 the cortex through the nerve roots and plexuses to the muscles takes
 place; and that it is capable of still wider extension, as   instead of       if,
 producing general epilepsy, less powerful stimuli be applied to the
 centres for di<U+FB01>erent movements, as represented in the motor cortex,
it will afford a means of connecting such centres, or parts of these,
with the nerve roots to which <U+FB01>bres proceed from these cortical motor
 centres.

       results described in this preliminary communication were ob
        The
tained in a series of experiments commenced in June, 1889, and at
present still in progress, with the object of elucidating the functions
       kidneys, and to gain an insight into the disturbance produced
        the
in of
   the economy by disease of these organs.
  Method.——All the experiments were made on dogs, and a complete
experiment involves the following stages :—
  Firstly.-—-The animal, after being weighed,       placed in a suitable
                                                                is
Chamber, and   fed on a weighed  diet containing  a  known quantity of
nitrogen; the water
                      drunk    also    is
                                     measured.   The   amount of urine
passed
          measured, and
              is         the quantity of  urea and  total nitrogen in                    it
determined,           Finally,    the weight of the         fzeces   and the amount of
          in them are also determined.    All the nitrogen determina
nitrogen
tions were made
                 by means   of Kjeldahl’s method; the urea was esti
                                       A  daily                of the

                            method.
                                                 determination
<U+FB02>bow      factors    was made for        a   period of   a   week, and    a   daily aVerage

   thus obtained.     In the earlier experiments only the quantities of
   urine and urea passed were determined.          On removal from the
   chamber, the animal is again weighed.
      Secondly.--The operation described below is performed on one
   kidney. After recovery from this, the dog is again placed in the col
   lecting chamber, and the above data again obtained for a week or more.
      Thirdly.—-—The second kidney is removed, and the animal again
‘
   placed in the collecting chamber, the food and excreta being again
   determined for a period of a week or more.
      Fourthly.—At a variable time after the second operation the animal
   is killed by bleeding, and the amount of nitrogenous extractives
   present in the tissues determined.
      As regards the operative procedures, there is nothing to remark
   about the second operation—the kidney is removed in the usual
   manner by lumbar incision; a few words are necessary in order to
   describe the <U+FB01>rst operation.    After anwsthetising the animal with
   chloroform and morphia, the kidney is exposed by a lumbar incision
   and freed from its connexions. The vessels in the hilus are then com
   pressed with the <U+FB01>ngers, the kidney trans<U+FB01>xed from before back, and
   a large wedge of kidney substance, with the apex of the wedge at
   the pelvis of the kidney, removed from the middle of the organ.       The
   piece  removed   weighed  from  5 to 15 grams  in  different  cases.  The
   very free haemorrhage is arrested by ligature of the large vessels
   divided, and by pressure on the cut surface.     “Then all bleeding had
   been arrested (the vessels in the hilus being of course no longer com
   pressed) the cut surfaces of the kidney were brought together by two
   or three silk sutures passed in deeply, and by numerous super<U+FB01>cial
   <U+FB01>ne horsehair sutures involving only the cortex and capsule of the
   organ. The abdominal wound was closed and dressed in the usual
   manner.
      Full antiseptic precautions were always used, and morphia was
   given hypodermically to prolong the narcosis.
      Summary of Experiments.—-Twenty-three animals survived the <U+FB01>rst
   operation : <U+FB01>fteen animals survived both operations.
      Thus, eight animals died after the <U+FB01>rst operation and before the
   second.    The causes of death in these eight were as follows :—
      In four cases the animals were accidentally killed with chloroform
   administered to perform the second operation.          In two cases the
   wound became septic and the animals were killed.        In one case death
   resulted from haemorrhage on the seventh day, and one dog, to which
   further reference will be made below, died of asthenia thirty-six days
   after the <U+FB01>rst operation.
      This communication deals with the results obtained in the <U+FB01>fteen
   complete experiments.     In one, the <U+FB01>rst, no observations were made
   on the urine, and in three dogs the observations were incomplete, so

  the  urine before and after the operations.
    Effects of the First Operation (i.e., the removal of a wedge of
 the kidney
                substance).—-~The shock of the operation passes ed in
 about twenty-four hours, but for two or three days there is some
 heematuria, and the appetite is poor.       The temperature of the.body
 remains at its normal height, or there may be slight pyrexia.         The
 dog,  however,   soon regains its former health, and no permanent ill
 e<U+FB01>ects result from the operation in the great majority of cases.        In
one case
            (one of the eight incomplete experiments) the animal died
thirty-six days after the operation, with considerable wasting and loss
of appetite,     and nothing was found post mortem except extreme
atrophy     of  the kidney operated on. The opposite kidney was
healthy and of        normal size. The atrophy was very marked, as
the following      numbers show :——7'6 grams of the left kidney were
removed, post 'nzo'rtem the remaining fragment of the left kidney
Weighed only 3'5 grams, and the opposite kidney 18 grams.           In this
case, the only one where      death resulted from the e<U+FB01>ects of the <U+FB01>rst
operation, although the atrophy was very marked, there was micro
scopically no evidence of cirrhosis, and no lesions of the renal vessels
were discovered.       The cause of death is obscure, as the second kidney
 was not removed.
    With this one exception, the <U+FB01>rst operation failed to produce any
 serious   or permanent ill effects, and the only result noticed was
 Slight emaciation, but this was generally recovered from in a. week
 or  two.
    A period of from one to six weeks was allowed to elapse between
 the <U+FB01>rst and second operations, and during this time the animal was
 placed in the chamber, and the ingesta and excreta determined.        The
  following table gives the results observed in <U+FB01>ve cases :—

139‘2.]         The In<U+FB02>uence of      the  Ifidney   on Mtabolism.              29
    From this tabular statement of the results in <U+FB01>ve cases it will be
seen    that, as stated above, the results of the operation are tri<U+FB02>ing
when we consider its severity.            In one case, No. 16, the output of
area was increased from 7 to 10 grams per diem.                 In this case the
 ingesta    were  not  determined, and the apparent increase may have
 been due to an increased          diet. In No. 22 the diet was the same
 l-efore and after the operation, but there is an increase in the urine
 and urea after the operation.      This case is quoted because it illustrates
  the maximum effect produced;         in no other case was so great an eifect
  observed.     In the other cases the effects on the urine, &c., are so
  slight as to be well within the limits of experimental errors.             The
  loss in body weight is tri<U+FB02>ing when compared             with that described
  below as resulting from the second operation.            The greatest loss ob
  served was in Dog 22, where the body weight fell from 14 lbs. to
  12 lbs.    The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the urine is not permanently a<U+FB01>ected
  by  the  operation. In the <U+FB01>rst few days after the operation, whilst
  there is haematuria, the urine is frequently more abundant in quantity
 and the speci<U+FB01>c gravity then is temporarily lowered, but this soon
 passes off, and the urine returns to its normal quantity and density.
                   The Results following    the Second Operation.
     The results following the removal of the second kidney differ
 widely from those described above as following the <U+FB01>rst operation, in
 that there are frequently no immediate ill effects, the animal running
 about, 830., within a few hours of the nephrectomy, and there is but
 little shock, haimorrhage, &c., when compared with the <U+FB01>rst operation.
 The remote effects, however, are very marked: a widespread disturb
 ance   of  nutrition  ensues, accompanied by extreme wasting, hydruria,
 and   polynria, and with     these a fall in the body temperature and a
great    increase in the nitrogenous extractions of the tissues, provided
a   sufficiently large amount of kidney has been removed at the <U+FB01>rst
operation.
    In all cases   the wound has healed up rapidly and soundly, and in
 110case    has death resulted directly from the operation. Out of the
<U+FB01>fteen     experiments, the <U+FB01>rst was killed <U+FB01>ve days after the second
operation, and at that time the animal was in sound health.              In four  _
cases, N0, 2, No.
                        11, N0. 19, and No. 21, the animals were killed
47 days, 60 days, 14 days, and 30 days respectively after the second
operation, and the results
                                observed in them will be described below

   From this table     it will be seen that the second operation is followed
by a  great  increase in the amount of urine excreted, and also by a
laige increase in the output of urea.            The increase in the urinary
water, however, is greater than the increase in the urea, although
the  latter, as seen above, is greatly augmented.
    This condition of polyuria is accompanied by great wasting.
 Thus  the weight of Dog No.         6 fell from 11 lbs. to    8 lbs.  in 50 days.

    This wasting is rapid in its course, and is not materially checked
 by a liberal diet, when the animal’s appetite will admit of it.                The
 appetite frequently fails somewhat, but the animals will eat meat
 in large quantities to within a short time of their death, although
 they refuse dog biscuit.         There is also great thirst, and this, no
 doubt, is in close relation with the hydruria.          When the polyuria is
 fully  established,   the rectal  temperature    falls,  so that ultimately it
 may be as low as 97° F., or even 95°            F.,  the normal temperature
 varying between 101° F. and 102° F. This condition of polyuria
 leads to a more or less rapid death; all the animals in Table            II  either
 died, or were killed because moribund, in from two to six weeks after
 the second operation.

                                                         only tested when
  putrefaction had taken place; hence the real amount was
                                                                  probably
 far greater than 8 grams. In the other three
                                                     cases, the output of
 urea was either slightly diminished or
                                          slightly increased; this result
 is of considerable  interest from the fact that these dogs ate little or
 nothing after the operation.     Thus, No. 22 passed 5 grams of urea
 daily with a diet of 230 grams of dog biscuit; after the operation
 5‘5 grams of urea were excreted, but no food
                                                   was taken, the animal
 refusing to eat the biscuit.
    In N o. 28, 9 grams of urea were excreted per diem with 100 grams
 of meat and 100 grams of biscuit daily; after the
                                                       operation 8 grams
 of   urea, with the ingesta diminished to 40 grams of meat and 20 grams
 of  biscuit daily. Similarly, in No. 14, a liberal allowance of meat
t and biscuit were given and eaten before the
                                                 operation, but after only
  small quantities of meat were eaten, and often none at all.
                                                                The com.
  paratively small quantity of urea excreted in these cases, when com

  inability on the part of the fragment of kidney left to excrete urea.
 This     is   well shOWn by         the following observation on No. 22.
                                                                             This
 dog,     as   just mentioned,        excreted only 5'5 grams of urea
                                                                       per diem
with no ingesta, ;            but, on a diet of 200 grams of meat, the
                                                                       daily out
put of urea, rose             immediately to an average of 15 grams, and on
some days   as much               as 19 grams          were   excreted   by   a fragment;   of
‘n'dney found on post-mortem examination to weigh only 10 grams.
Hence, even in the cases where the urea is not absolutely largely in
Cteased, it is really increased when we remember that the ingesta are
greatly        diminished, and           that the dog may pass as much, or
                                                                                even

          remaining four dogs described in Table IV the amount of
     In the
kidney  removed was slightly less, and, as the table shows, the results
are di<U+FB01>erent to those described in the ten rapidly fatal cases.
   In none of these cases was the operation fatal, and, as previously
mentioned, the animals were killed 47 days, 60 days, 14 days, and
30 days respectively after the second
                                       operation.  In no case was there
any great emaciation. the greatest loss of weight being in No. 11,
 Where the body weight fell from 14 lbs. to 12 lbs.   In all cases there
 was marked hydruria, but the polyuria was slight or absent, not
 withstanding the fact that there was no failure of appetite.      Thus
 these four experiments are in great contrast to the other ten, where
 a larger amount of kidney was removed with a uniformly fatal result.
 It is clear from these results that the increased <U+FB02>ow of urine is not
 dependent simply upon any increased excretion of urea, since the
 former may exist without the latter.    In no case, however, has an
  increased    excretion of urea been obtained without an increase in the
   quantity of urine.
      In no case amongst the ten fatal ones (where three-fourths of the
   total kidney weight was removed) has the operation been followed
   by a diminution in the output of urea, provided the ingesta were not
   diminished.
      We may then form the following conclusion, that when a dog is
   left with only one-fourth of its total kidney weight, a condition of
   extreme hydruria invariably results. This hydruria is accompanied,
   provided the appetite does not fail, by a large increase in the output
   of urea.    Further, that if the ingesta are diminished even to Zero,
   the output of urea remains at the height it reached with a diet
   su<U+FB01>icient to maintain the weight of the animal when in a normal
   condition.
      That the hydruria, although associated with an increased excretion
  of urea, is not dependent upon it, is shown not only by the fact men
  tioned above, that by removal of a smaller amount of kidney hydruria
  pure and simple is produced, but also by the fact that when both
   hydruria and polyuria are produced they do not begin simultaneously.
   In other words, when hydruria and polyuria are both ultimately pro
   duced by removal of three-fourths of the total kidney weight, the
   hydruria precedes the polyuria.          To illustrate this, it will be suf<U+FB01>cient
   to quote one experiment,      i.e.,  No.   23. After the <U+FB01>rst operation, when
      grams of the left kidney
   6'5                                 were   removed, the dog passed 14-0 0.0. of
  mnecontal-ning      15 grams of urea per diem, with a diet of 150 grams

the appetite was regained, the ingesta returned to 200 grams, the
urea rose to 16 grams, and the urine to 480 c.c.         1n the third week
the ingesta were 140 grams, the urea rose to 21 grams per diem, and
the urine to 550 0.0.; the animal was then killed, being weak, the
body weight having fallen from 11 lbs. to 7 lbs. This experiment
illustrates the two stages the animals pass through, the <U+FB01>rst one
where the normal output of urea is maintained, but the method of its
excretion is altered, so that the quantity of urinary water is greatly
increased.      The second stage is one where the quantity of urine is
still further increased, with a more or less sudden increase in the
urea, accompanied by emaciation, &c.           By the removal of very large
quantities    of   kidney    substance    these  two results are obtained
almost together,     but  even  then,   for a  day or two after the second
operation, hydruria only is present.        When, however, a smaller quan
tity of kidney is removed the condition called here the <U+FB01>rst stage is
the only one produced, and this condition of simple hydruria is very
permanent, as the experiments quoted in Table IV demonstrate.           My
observations do not show whether this stage of hydruria can be pro
longed inde<U+FB01>nitely, but they show that the second stage, polyuria, ema
ciation, is comparatively sudden in its onset, and rapid in its course.
    Character of the Urine—The urine passed after the second operation
contrasts greatly with the normal urine of the dog, inasmuch as it is
very pale, abundant, and of low speci<U+FB01>c gravity, is, from 1007 to
1020-,   whereas the normal urine is dark in colour, and its speci<U+FB01>c
gravity is often as high as 1050 or even 1060, and it is scanty in
amount.       The urine after the second operation contains neither
albumen nor sugar.        The percentage of solid matter is of course less
than normal, but the total solids are not diminished in amount.        The
ash   also is not  diminished;    but more detailed observations on these
points are at present in progress.
    With regard to other symptoms of the disorder produced by the
operation, it is to be noted that convulsions are absent.      Vomiting is
rare ; it has only been observed once or twice. Diarrhoea is frequently
present towards the end, and small ulcers and sores occur about the
lips and feet, possibly of traumatic origin.       During the last twenty_
four or forty-eight hours of life the <U+FB02>ow of urine diminishes greatly,
so that usually the animals have been killed whilst the polyuria, &c.,
was at its height, so as not to vitiate the analysis of the tissues.
Thus the <U+FB01>nal symptoms are great prostration of strength and some
drowsiness,     together with the great fall in the temperature; the
last, however, begins as soon as the polyuria is marked, and hence is
present for many days before death.
    The aortic blood pressure, measured by connecting the carotid
artery to a mercurial manometer, is very high when the marasmic
condition of the animal is
                                   considered:

 1892.]          The In<U+FB02>uence of the Kidney           on Metabolism.                 37
 has   varied between     95 and    100 mm. Hg, the animal being under the
in<U+FB02>uence     of chloroform, that is to say, the blood pressure was as high
asit frequently is in normal and healthy chloroformed dogs. This
height of the blood pressure is in great contrast to the blood pressure
in dogs after double nephrectomy, where even on the third day the
blood pressure has sunk to a few millimetres of mercury.
    Hence the arterial tension is raised when the animal has but 4rd
to {th of its total kidney weight.
    Post-mrtem Examination—The animals are greatly emaciated, but
usually some fat remains, especially the omental fat.                     No marked
naked-eye      changes have        been detected, except a marked excess of
cerebro-spinal       <U+FB02>uid in     the cranial cavity. No obvious change was
found     in the heart       or vessels. The abdominal viscera have been
found     rather soft       and sticky, but no other evidence of septic
poisoning or of auto-infection has been found.
    The kidney fragment has never been found hypertrophied; more
 frequently distinctly atrophied, the weight of the fragment found
 postmortem plus the weight of the piece removed being generally
 less than the weight of the opposite kidney.              This is in opposition to
 the results of a French observer! He, however, removed at the <U+FB01>rst
  operation the entire kidney, and then subsequently removed pieces of
  the second kidney, which had, as is well known, undergone a so-called
  compensatory hypertrophy. Under these circumstances Tu<U+FB02>ier states
  that the fragment hypertrophies considerably.
      Whether the atrophy observed by me is dependent upon the
  part of the kidney removed, I trust to elucidate by further observa
  tions now in progress.
      Nitrogenous Ewtractives of the Blood and Tissues. —The animals,
  after being anaesthetised with chloroform, were bled to death.                50 0.0.
  of blood were placed in an excess of recti<U+FB01>ed alcohol and 50 grams of
   muscle, liver, brain were similarly treated after being <U+FB01>nely divided.
   After prolonged extraction, the <U+FB01>ltrate is then evaporated to dryness
   over a water-bath, and the dry residue repeatedly extracted with cold
   absolute alcohol, usually for some hours.              The absolute extract is
   evaporated to dryness on the water-bath and the residue dissolved in
   water.    The material insoluble in absolute is also dissolved in water,
   and thus two watery extracts are obtained which may, for simplicity,
   be called the absolute and recti<U+FB01>ed extract;              these are treated as
   follows :—half of each is introduced separately into a Dupré urea
  apparatus, and the amount of nitrogen evolved by decomposition
  with sodium hypobromite determined.               In the remaining half of each
  extract the total      nitrogen    present    was    determined by Kjeldahl’s
  method     In this      manner     a   control   is  kept on the hypobromite
 method, since,       if such a body as urea is present, the anré and

Kjeldahl determinations should nearly               coincide,      whereas,   if such a
body as creatin, &c., is present, the one method would yield twice as
much nitrogen as the other.                In the present communication only
the extractives present in what has been called above the “ absolute
          ”
extract will be considered, and the results obtained in four experi
ments are given below. In two cases, N0. 19 and No. 21, the removal
of two-thirds of the kidney weight had produced simple hydruria,
and in the other two cases, N0. 23 and No. 28, a more extensive
operation had produced polyuria as well. In 23, the polyuria was
absolute, in 28 relative, the ingesta being diminished in the latter but
not in the former.
   It is to be distinctly understood that in the following results the
extractive is reckoned on urea, because of its solubility in cold alsolute
alcohol, and because the amount of nitrogen obtained by the Dupré
and Kjeldahl methods respectively practically coincided.

   N o. 23 was passing an average of 21 grams of urea per diem at the
time of death, and No. 28 an average of 8 grams, although in the
latter case 106 grams of urea were excreted in the last twenty-four
hours of life. From these results we see that in the case of dogs
                                                                          ”
suffering from the simple hydruria, the amount of " urea in the blood
and tissues is only slightly above the normal.               In the case of the dogs
in the second stage, suffering from polyuria, &c., the amount of “ urea. ”
in the blood and tissues is enormously increased.                    Thus, in N o. 23 at
                                                      “          ”
least twenty         times  the normal quantity of urea             was present in the
blood, at a time when the animal was still excreting an amount;
greatly exceeding the normal (tide Table II). Hence the excess 0f
extractive matter present in the tissues is not dependent on simple
retention, but on increased production.
   I trust to consider the extractives soluble in recti<U+FB01>ed alcohol in a,
future communication, but they also are largely increased in the
tissues, but not in the blood.
   The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the blood serum is lower than normal,
sinking frequently to 1025. The total solids, the proteids, and the
ash of the serum are all diminished in amount, the last falling to
0'5 per cent. in many cases.                                                            _
   The disturbance of nutrition with increased production of. urea.

1892.]             The In<U+FB02>uence of the Kidney                on Metabolism.             39
described       above does not follow destruction of the renal plexus, nor
does    it follow free incision of the kidney with subsequent suturing of
the damaged organ.               It is a phenomenon closely connected with the
removal of large quantities of kidney, 6.6., half of one kidney and
the whole of the second.                Inasmuch as the phenomena do not ensue
after the <U+FB01>rst and more severe operation, but only after the second
and comparatively trivial operation,                  it must be concluded that they
are more related to the quantity of kidney removed than to the shock
 of the operation,             or to any re<U+FB02>ex disturbance produced by the
 operation.
     The excess of urea in the muscle over that in the liver and brain
 might be considered as evidence of its production in the muscles.
 That this is not necessarily the case is shown by the results of the
 injection of large quantities of urea into the circulation of normal
  dogs.       The dogs were anaesthetised with chloroform, the ureters
  ligatnred, and the urea then injected into the external jugular. After
  from one to three hours the animals were killed by bleeding, and the
   tissues examined,‘ as described above.

      From these and other observations, we see that the percentage of
  urea    in the muscles is greater than in the case of the liver and brain
  after intravenous injection, and that it may exceed that of the blood.
  The smaller percentage in the liver is not dependent upon the excre
  tion of urea through the bile duct, because after ligature of the bile
  duct the percentage              in the liver is still lower than that of the
   muscles after the intravenous injection of urea. After ligature of both
  ureters, and after double nephrectomy,                  the same distribution of urea
                                                    '
  is found in the tissues.

   Finally, in   the tissues of patients dying from urwmia consequent

      Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics in the Uni
      versity of Glasgow. Received March 10, 1892.

   In this paper a historical sketch is given of the progress of observa
tional and theoretical researches into the nature and causes of the
Trade Winds and other great and persistent currents of atmospheric
circulation.   Mention is made of the fanciful attempts at explanation
by Dr. Martin Lister and by Dr. Garden in papers submitted to the
Royal Society a little more than 200 years ago, and which are to be
found recorded in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions.’           These papers
give evidence of the scanty and crude condition of knowledge and
speculation on the subject in the early years of the Royal Society; but
yet they may probably have had a bene<U+FB01>cial e<U+FB01>ect in instigating
Edmund Halley, the astronomer, to communicate to the Royal
Society, in 1686, a paper on the “Trade Winds and Monsoons,”*
bringing together a systematized collection of observational results.
accompanied     by theoretical considerations.        That paper constituted
an important step in the development of the science of the subject,
even though his theory, in one of its most important parts, that which
relates to the east to west motion of the trade winds, which he
attributed to the diurnal revolution round the equatorial zone of the
maximum of accumulation of heating eiiect, turns out to be funda_
mentally untenable.
    Halley’s paper was followed, forty-nine years later, by one more

1735?      This George Hadley was a brother of the John Hadley who
invented the instrument known as Hadley’s quadrant.                         Hadley’s
         is entitled,     “                  the  Cause    of the    General Trade
paper                        Concerning
Winds,”     and it is right here to notice that he applied the name
                            ”
"general trade wind            not merely to those winds of equatorial regions
towhich the name trade wind is commonly restricted, but used it as
including also the westerly winds known to be prevalent in higher
latitudes, and which were taken advantage of in trade by mariners on
 ocean passages      from west to east.           Thus, his theory has a much
 wider scope than the title of his paper would now, according to
 ordinary nomenclature, appear to indicate. Hadley brought into con
 sideration, for the <U+FB01>rst time, as an essential element towards the                   _
 formation of a. true theory, the inertial and frictional e<U+FB01>ects resulting
 in the atmosphere       from the rotation of the earth; and we may with
 con<U+FB01>dence judge that, in that paper, he o<U+FB01>ered to the world a sub
 stantially true theory of a large part of the system of atmospheric
 circulation in its grandest and most dominant conditions.
     The paper gives a full account of Hadley’s theory, accompanied by
 explanatory remarks, bringing into special notice its most important
 features; and the author quotes the concluding passage of Hadley’s
 paper,    which he considers, though somewhat vague, and not entirely
 correct in expression, is to be regarded as suggesting a very notable
 and important principle, videlicet :—~That, in respect to the earth‘s rota
 tion round its axis, the sum of the forward turning-force-in<U+FB02>uences
 applied by the winds to the surface of the earth, land and sea in
 cluded, must be equal to the sum of all the backward turning-force
 in<U+FB02>uences likewise applied to the earth’s surface; so that these
  force-in<U+FB02>uences may be such as conjointly to produce no acceleration
  0r retardation    in the revolution of the earth round its axis.
      During a period of more than a century from the promulgation of
  Hadley’s theory there was little, if any, remarkable progress in the
  development of new speculation regarding the grand or perennial
  currents of atmospheric circulation.             Hadley’s theory seems to have
  lain dormant for a long time in the pages of the ‘Philosophical
  Transactions,’ and to have become but little kndwn, even among men
  of science.     Sketches of the theory, more or less complete, were from
   time to time   put forward in encyclopzedias and in works on meteorology
  and navigation,     but   usually without due appreciation of its meaning
   and importance,     and often without any reference to his name.                On
   the other hand, progress         was gradually being' made in        the  bringing
            of  information       cOncerning    the   winds, so far as regards the
  together
  temporary and local
                             disturbances of the atmosphere; and speculations
 0,. theories   were    advanced       as to hurricanes, tornadoes, or cyclones.

  A     short sketch of     such  progressive   researches  is given  in the
  paper.
       Also through information derived from observational sources, i1
  came gradually to be accepted, as an established fact, that in the
  latitudes outside the limits of the trade winds—latitudes extending
  from about 28° or 30° up to far towards the poles—the wind, while
  prevailing from the west, as had been previously known, prevails alsc
  more from the equator towards the pole than from the pole towards
  the equator, so that to take the case of the northern hemisphere, for
  simplicity, the winds of our middle latitudes were found prevalent] y
  to blow from south of west.
       To account for this component from the south in these westerly
_  winds, it came to be very generally supposed among the best writers
   on the subject‘ that the air departing for the northern hemisphere
   from the top of the equatorial belt of buoyant air, while <U+FB02>owing
   northward still in the lofty regions of the atmosphere and over the
   trade-wind zone; soon becomes a current from the south-west, or from
   south of west, and continues, after descending to the earth’s surface
   at the northern border of the trade-wind region, still to move forward
   in continuation of its old course as a current from south of west.
   But why in the lower regions a poleward motion should he maintained
   rather than a return <U+FB02>ow towards the equator, and how the return
   from higher to lower latitudes, to compensate for this supposed
   poleward surface current, should be accomplished, are questions
   which appear to have been scarcely mooted or to have been left en
   shrouded in vagueness.
        The paper goes on to give an account of the theory which Maury
   offered in 1855 as an attempt to clear up what he considered “para
             " in
    doxical       the theories of others on this subject.
        The author of the paper presently reported in abstract (Professor
    James Thomson), <U+FB01>nding Maury’s theory untenable, devised a new
    theory in 1857, and brought it forward at the Dublin meeting of the
    British Association in that year. In endeavouring to penetrate the
    mystery as to what the courses of the circulation might be in the
    middle and higher latitudes, he was, in preliminary ways, fully
    satis<U+FB01>ed that Hadley’s theory, in its main features, must he substan
    tially true, and must form the basis of any tenable theory that could
    be devised.     He adopted that theory in all its important features, and.
    superadded    further  new features, which are told of at length in the
    paper.    His   theory, so composed, may be brie<U+FB02>y sketched Out as
                             '
    follows:—
        That at the equator, or near to it, there is a belt of air ascending
    because of its    high temperature and consequent rarefaction :—that
     its supply of air is maintained by in<U+FB02>ux from both sides towards the
      zonal region at its base, which is a. region of diminished pressure :—

    that   from its upper part currents <U+FB02>oat away to both sides, northward
    and  southward z—and that these currents continue in the upper regions
    of the atmosphere each of- them advancing towards, and in part to, the
    high latitudes of its own hemisphere, until, by cooling, its substance
‘   becomes     less buoyant, and sinks down gradually in various latitudes
    of that hemisphere, and forms itself into a
                                                     return current towards
    the equator, in the lower part of the atmosphere.
       That the air of this great cap of atmosphere, covering the middle
    and higher latitudes,       and including portions of the currents just
    described, having come from the equatorial regions, which were moving
     absolutely from west to east in the earth’s diurnal rotation with a
     velocity of about 1000 miles per hour, must, on coming into those new
     regions much nearer to the earth’s axis, have greater velocity from
     west to east than the earth below it in those new regions has.     That
     in the central     or polar part of this great revolving cap of air the
     barometric pressure must be abated in consequence of the centrifugal
     tendency due to the extra speed of this great whirling cap of atmo
      sphere.     That the bottom layers of this great cap of atmosphere,
      being by friction on the earth’s surface retarded as to this extra
      velocity of rotation eastward, must have a diminished centrifugal
      tendency as compared with the quicker revolving air above them,
      and,    consequently,  tend to <U+FB02>ow, and actually do <U+FB02>ow, inwards,
      towards the region of abated barometric pressure at the centre of the
      revolving cap of air.
        That thus, over the middle, or middle and higher latitudes, there
                                               '
     are three currents :—
        (1.) A top main current towards the pole.
        (2.) A bottom subordinate current towards the pole.
        (3.) A middle main current in direction from the pole, and con
     stituting the joint return current for both the preceding currents.
        And that all these three have a prevailing motion from west to
     east, in advance of the earth.
        That the great return current, <U+FB02>owing in direction from the pole
     towards the equator, arrives at a certain part of its course at which
     it ceases to revolve eastward in advance of the earth; and, for the
     rest, of its course to the foot of the equatorial rising belt, it blows
     along the surface of the earth as the trade wind of the hemisphere in
     Which  it is situated.

by experiment theoretical results concerning the effect of the currents
in the armature of dynamo machines on the amount and distribution
of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld which were given in that paper, but which were
left without veri<U+FB01>cation.      For the sake of completeness, part of the
work is given over again.
    The two dynamos experimented upon were constructed by Messrs.
Siemens Brothers and Co., and are identical, as far as it is possible to
make them.       They are mounted upon a common base plate, their
axles being coupled together, and are referred to in this paper
respectively as No. 1 and No. 2.
    Each dynamo has a single magnetic circuit consisting of two
vertical limbs extended at their lower extremities to form the pole
pieces, and having their upper extremities connected by a yoke of
rectangular section.       Each limb, together with its pole-piece, is
 formed of a single forging of wrought iron.           These forgings, as
 also that of the yoke, are   built up of hammered scrap iron, and after
 Wiuds carefully annealed.       Gun-metal castings bolted to the base
 plate of the machine support the magnets.
    The magnetising     coils on each limb consist of sixteen layers of
 copper wire 2  mm.   diameter,   making a total of 3968 convolutions for
 each machine.    The pole-pieces are bored out to receive the armature,
 leaving a, gap above
                         and below subtending an angle of 68° at the

    The armature core is built up of soft-iron discs, No. 24 B.W.G.,
 which are held between two end plates screwed on the shaft.
    The following table gives the leading dimensions of the armature :—
                                                                   cm.

    The core is wound longitudinally according to the Hefner von
 Alteneck principle with 208 bars made of copper strip, each 9 mm.
'deep by 1'8 mm. thick.       The commutator is formed of <U+FB01>fty-two hard
 drawn copper segments insulated with mica, and the connexions to
 the armature so made, that the plane of commutation in the commu
 tator is vertical when no current is passing through the armature.
     Each dynamo is intended for a normal output of 80 ampéres
 140 volts, at 880 revolutions per minute.               The resistance of the
 armature measured between opposite bars of the commutator is
 0042 ohm, and of each magnet coil 133 ohms.
     In the machine, the armature core has a greater cross-section than
  the magnet cores, and consequently the magnetising force used
  therein may be neglected.         The yoke has the same section as the
  magnet cores, and is therefore included therein, as is also the pole
  piece.    The formula connecting the line integral of the magnetising
  force and the induction takes the short form

                      E feats  of the errent in   the Armature.
    Quoting     from the Royal Society paper, p.          342,  “The currents
in the    <U+FB01>xed coils around the magnets are not          the only magnetising
forces     applied in a dynamo machine; the currents in the moving
coils    of the   armature have also their e<U+FB01>ect on the resultant <U+FB01>eld.
There are in      general two independent variables in a dynamo machine,
the   current around the magnets and the current in the armature, and
the   relation of               to currents is fully represented by a surface.
In   well-constructed machines the effect of the latter is reduced to a
minimum, but it can be by no means neglected. When a section of
[he armature coils is commutated it must inevitably be momentarily
short-circuited, and, if at the time of commutation the <U+FB01>eld in which
the section is moving is other than feeble, a considerable current
will arise in that section, accompanied by waste of power and destruc
tive sparking.
    “
      Suppose the commutation occurs at an angle X in advance of the
symmetrical        position between the <U+FB01>elds, and that the total current
through the armature be C, reckoned positive in the direction of the
resultant EMF of the machine, i.e., positive when the machine is used
as    a generator of electricity.            Taking any closed line through
magnets and         amature,     symmetrically drawn as ABCDEFA, it is
 obvious     that    the line integral   of magnetic force is diminished by
  the   current in     the armature    included between angle X in front and

 on the magnets.           Thus, if we know the lead of the brushes and the
current in the armature, we are at once in a position to calculate the
 e<U+FB01>ect on the electromotive force of the machine. A further e<U+FB01>ect of
 the current in the armature is a material disturbance of the distribu
tion of the induction over the bored face of the pole-piece; the
force along BC is by no means equal to that along DE. Draw
the closed curve BCGHB, the line integral along CG, and HB is
 negligible.       Hence the difference between force HG and BC is
 equal to                 =  2 me, where      :c is the angle COG.”

    To verify     this formula         is one of the principal        objects of this
paper.
   A   pair of brushes having relatively <U+FB01>xed positions near together,
and insulated from the frame and from one another, are carried upon
a divided circle, and bear upon the commutator.                     The di<U+FB01>erence of
potential between these brushes was measured in various positions
round the commutator, the current in the armature, the potential
diiference of the main brushes, and the speed of the machine being
also noted.
    The results    are given       in Diagrams Nos.      2, 3, 4, and 5, in which the
ordinates are       measured        potential diiierences, and the abscissee are
angles turned.       through by the exploring brushes.                 The potential
di<U+FB01>erences in       Diagram N0. 2 were measured by a Siemens’ volt
meter, and each ordinate is therefore somewhat smaller than the
true value, owing to the time during which the exploring brushes
were not actually in contact with the commutator segments.                          But
this does not affect the results, because the area is reduced in the same
proportion as the potential differences.                In Diagrams Nos. 3, 4, and
5, the potential            differences     were taken on one of Sir William
Thomson’s quadrant electrometers, and are correct.
   Take Diagram N o. 2 in which machine No. 1 is a generator.                         A

represent di<U+FB01>erences of potential between the brushes.                     The area of

      College, and S. SKINNER, M.A., Christ’s College, Demon
      strator in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge. Received
      February 17, 1892.
                                          (Abstract)
   The paper consists of two parts :—
     In Part    I
                an account is given of experiments on the absolute
electromotive force of 9. Clark cell.
   This was determined in the manner described by Lord Rayleigh
(‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1884) in terms of a known resistance and the electro_
chemical equivalent of silver.
   The resistance used was a strip of platinoid about 1 cm. wide and
0‘05 cm. thick wound on an open frame.       It was immersed in a bath
of paraf<U+FB01>n oil, and the currents used, varying from about 0'75 to
rather over 1‘4 amperes, did not raise its temperature suf<U+FB01>ciently to
a<U+FB01>ect the result. It had a resistance of nearly 1 BA. unit.        This
was determined in terms of the original BA. units. As part of the
object of the experiments was to test the memorandum on the use of
the silver voltameter recently issued by the Electrical Standards
Committee of the Board of Trade, the large currents mentioned
above were purposely employed.      The silver voltameters were treated
in accordance with the instructions in the memorandum.
   The standard cell to which the results are referred is one con
structed by Lord Rayleigh in 1883, probably N0. 4 of the cells
described in his paper already quoted.                               ‘
   The results have been reduced on the supposition that 1 BA.
unit is equal to 09866 ohm; if we take the number O'9535“ as
representing the value in BA. units of the resistance of a column
of mercury at 0°, 1 metre long, 1 sq. mm. in section, the above is
equivalent to saying that the length of the mercury column having
a resistance of 1 ohm is 1063 cm.       It has also been assumed that
the mass of silver deposited in one second by a current of 1 ampere
is 0001118 gramme, and that the coe<U+FB02>icient of change of E.M.F. with
temperature of a Clark’s cell is 000076.      This last result has been
veri<U+FB01>ed by us in Part II.

14-342.
   In Experiment 2 the current in the voltameter was rather un
 steady, which may account for the low value; while in Experiment 9
 the temperature    of the cell was changing somewhat, and our later
 experience has shown us that the E.M.F. in our standard cell lags
 very considerably   behind the temperature.     Still even taking these
 experiments into account, the results are very close.
   If we suppose, as seems most probable, for reasons given in the
 paper, that our cell is No. 4 of Lord Rayleigh’s paper, and that it has
retained relative to No. 1 (Lord Rayleigh’s standard) the value it had
in 1883, the E.LI.F. of his cell N o. 1 would be in the units he used
                                         1'41346    volts at 15°.
  The value found by Lord Rayleigh was 14348 volts; thus the two
are very close.
  In the units we have . given above, those speci<U+FB01>ed by the Board of
Trade, we have <U+FB01>nally the result that the E.M.F. of our cell is
                                      14342 volts at 15° C.
                                 or   1'4324 volts at 62° F.

 about 00005 volt.
     The <U+FB01>rst set of cells, eighteen in number, constructed for the pur
 poses of this enquiry were made according to Lord Rayleigh’
 instructions, using, however, various specimens of the chemicals
 These showed some differences at <U+FB01>rst, but in the course of about tw
 months they had all, with one exception, settled down to close agree
 ment with the standard.              The exceptional cell has since becom
 normal. In two of these cells mercury was used which had been take:
 direct from the stock in every-day use in the laboratory.                          T11
            of these cells was much too low at <U+FB01>rst, but it graduall;
 increased, and they are now normal. The mercurous sulphate appear
 to free the mercury from certain harmful impurities.
     Another set of cells were put up, in accordance with the provisiona
 memorandum of the Electrical Standards Committee of the Board 0
 Trade, issued in June last and quoted below.
      MEMORANDUM      on THE PREPARATION       or   THE Cmnx’s     Snnnmn      CELL.
                                  De<U+FB01>nition of   the Cell.
    The cell consists of mercury and zinc in a saturated solution of zinc sulphate an
 mercurous    sulphate in water, prepared with mercurous sulphate in excess, and 1'
 conveniently contained in a cylindrical glass vessel.
                              Preparation of the Materials.
    1. The Mercury.—To      secure purity it should be <U+FB01>rst treated with acid in th
 usual manner, and subsequently distilled in vacuo.
    2. The Zinc.—Take a portion of a rod of pure zinc, solder to one end a piece r
 copper wire, clean the whole with glass paper, carefully removing any loose piece
 of the zinc. Just before making up the cell, dip the zinc into dilute sulphuric acic
 wash with distilled water, and dry with a clean cloth or <U+FB01>lter paper.
    3. The Zinc Sulphate      Solution—Prepare a saturated solution of pure (“pin
 recrystallised”) zinc sulphate by mixing in a <U+FB02>ask distilled water with nearl
 twice its weight of crystals of pure zinc sulphate, and adding a little zinc carbonat
 to neutralise any free acid.   The whole of the crystals should be dissolved with th
 aid of gentle heat, i.e., not exceeding a temperature of 30° 0., and the solutio
 <U+FB01>ltered, while still warm, into a stock bottle.    Crystals should form as it cools.
    4. The Mercumms Suhrhate.—Take        mercurous sulphate, purchased as pure, an
 wash it thoroughly with cold distilled water by agitation in a bottle; drain oif th
 water, and repeat the process at least twice.      After the last washing, drain 05‘ z
 much of the water as possible.
    Mix the washed mercurous sulphate with the zinc sulphate solution, addin
 su<U+FB02>icient crystals of zinc sulphate from the stock bottle to ensure saturation, and
 small quantity of pure mercury.      Shake these up well together to form a paste (
 the consistency of cream.     Heat the paste suf<U+FB01>ciently to dissolve the crystals, br
 not above a temperature of 30°.     Keep the paste for an hour at this temperatur'
 agitating it from time to time, then allow it to cool. Crystals of zinc sulphat

should then be distinctly visible throughout the mass; if this is not the case, add
more crystals from the stock bottle, and repeat the process.
   This method ensures the formation of a saturated solution of zinc and mercurous
sulphates in water.
   The presence of the free mercury throughout the paste preserves the basicity of
the salt, and is of the utmost importance.
   Contact is made with the mercury by means of a platinum wire about No. 22
 gauge—This is protected from contact with the other materials of the cell by being
 sealed into a glass tube. The ends of the wire project from the ends of the tube;
 one end forms the terminal, the other end and a portion of the glass tube dip into
 the mercury.
                                       To    set up the Cell.
   The cell may conveniently be set up in a small test-tube of about 2 cm. diameter,
and 6  or 7 cm. deep. Place the mercury in the bottom of this tube, <U+FB01>lling it to a
depth of, say, 1'5 cm. Cut a cork about 0'5 cm. thick to <U+FB01>t the tube ; at one side
of the cork bore a hole, through which the zinc rod can pass tightly; at the other
side bore another hole for the glass tube which covers the platinum wire ; at the
edge of the cork cut a nick through which the air can pass when the cork is pushed
into the tube.    Pass the zinc rod about 1 cm. through the cork.
   Clean the glass tube and platinum wire carefully, then heat the exposed end of
the platinum red hot, and insert it in the mercury in the test-tube, taking care
that the whole of the exposed platinum is covered.
  Shake up the paste and introduce it without contact with the upper part of the
walls of the test-tube, <U+FB01>lling the tube above the mercury to a depth of rather more
than 2 cm.
   Then insert the cork and zinc rod, passing the glass tube through the        hole pre
pared for it.   Push the cork gently down until its lower surface is nearly    in contact
with the liquid.    The air will thus be nearly all expelled, and the cell      should be
left in this condition for at least twenty-four hours before sealing, which    should    be
done as follows :—
   Melt some marine glue until it is <U+FB02>uid enough to pour by its own weight, and
pour it into the test-tube above the cork, using su<U+FB02>icient to cover completely the
zinc and soldering.    The glass tube should project above the top of the marine
clue.

  The cell thus set  up may be mounted in any desirable manner. It is convenient
to arrange the mounting so that the cell may be immersed in a water-bath up to
the level of, say, the upper
                               surface of the cork.     Its temperature can then be
determined more   accurately than  is pessible when the  cell is in air.
  These      cells, as the tests given show, have been good from the <U+FB01>rst,
and,    indeed, we have not had any dif<U+FB01>culty with any of the cells in

    It may be      well to explain the purpose of some of the precautions
advised      in the circular. The mercurous sulphate, as ordinarily pur
chased,     contains some mercuric         sulphate.    When this is moistened
 with    water     it is   resolved into a yellow basic mercuric sulphate
 (tnrpeth mineral)         and a soluble acid mercuric sulphate.         The <U+FB01>rst,
 atany     rate   in  moderate    quantities, does not affect the              the
 latter greatly hinders it from attaining the proper value.              Repeated
 washing, however, removes most of this soluble salt.                   The paste,
 when made, is shaken with mercury to remove                   any traces of the
 acid sulphate         which may be left, for the acid mercuric sulphate
 attacks the mercury and forms mercurous sulphate.
     Careful precautions are necessary to ensure that the solutions should
 be saturated with both zinc and mercurous sulphates, but the solu
 IiODS should        not be raised in temperature above 30°C., for the zinc
 sulphate may then crystallise out in the wrong form.                  The proper
 crystals have the composition ZnSO,.7HZO, and are rhombic.
     But while we have had no serious dif<U+FB01>culty with any of the cells
 prepared in accordance           with the last form of the memorandum,
 some of the other cells we have set up have led to some interesting
  results.                               _
     Two sets of cells were put up with great care by Mr. Wilberforce
  in March and April.           One of us (S. S.) set up some cells in the same
  way    about     the  same  time.   The solutions were prepared from very
  pure    materials,     following  Lord   Rayleigh’s instructions.      The zinc
  sulphate was remarkably free from acid, and it appeared as if the
  results ought to be good.
      In the <U+FB01>rst set, Nos. 36—41, the E.M.F. was too low. At the end
  of a month         it was much too low, about 0005 volt, and Mr. Wilber
  force noticed that a dull-grey deposit covered the zines; he therefore
  removed them and scraped o<U+FB02>f this deposit, when, on replacing the
  zines, the cells were found to have approximately the normal E.M.F.;
  they have continued nearly normal since.            The next set, Nos. 42—47,
  were very good when <U+FB01>rst set up, but the E.M.F. soon fell rapidly,
   until at the end of a month they were nearly 0'01 volt too low.
      The grey deposit again was formed over the zinc.              Some of these
   cells were left untouched till August, by         which  time   the        had
   recovered somewhat, being then about 0005 too low.                  Others had
   been treated       by removing the zines and replacing them by amalga
   mated   zines,     In August some experiments were made on the unal
  tered cells, which       showed conclusively that it is necessary that the
  surface of the zinc should remain'bright
                                                      if consistent results are to

amalgamation of the zinc must go on in the cell to enable it to reach
the steady state, and that  it may not be suf<U+FB01>cient to introduce amalga
mated zincs. On this and some kindred points, however, we are still
experimenting. The grey deposit can be shown to be mainly mercury
in a state of very <U+FB01>ne division.     There are some indications that a
slight acidity in the solutions is of use in promoting amalgama
tion.
   We have veri<U+FB01>ed repeatedly an observation of Dr. Hopkinson’s that
the E.M.F. of a bad cell changes considerably if the cell be slightly
shaken, while that of a good cell is not a<U+FB01>ected.
   The paper also contains an account of some experiments on the
coef<U+FB01>cient of change of E.M.F. with temperature.        The value found
is 0000755 per 1° 0., practically the same as that given by Lord
Rayleigh.    In this connexion we may mention the important obser
vation that when the temperature is rising, even although the rise be
only a few degrees, the           of the cell may—especially if the cell
be large—lag very considerably behind the temperature. On one
occasion in which the temperature rose by some 5° C. in about a
week, the E.M.F. of our large cell at the end of the week corresponded
to a temperature nearly 3° lower than that given by a thermometer
in the bath with the cell, being about 00027 volt too high. In this
case a thick cake of crystals had formed on the top of the more solid
portion of the paste, and the zinc sulphate solution only attained the
state of saturation corresponding to the temperature by very slow
degrees.   Mr. Carhart and Mr. Swinburne have called, attention to
the dif<U+FB01>culties which thus attend the practical use of the cells.   They
are to some extent met by using small cells.
   The paper also describes a new form of portable cell which may
be turned into any position without harm. Experiments have also
been made on the mercury chloride standards described by Von
Helmholtz.     A set of these has been constructed which has an E.M.F.
of very nearly 1 volt. A form of standard due to Gouy, in which
oxide of mercury is used, has also been examined.          The E.M.F. of
these cells prepared with yellow oxide is, we <U+FB01>nd, 1'381 volts, and
when prepared with red oxide 1388 volts.
   By the kindness of Major Cardew several of our cells have been
compared with the standards of the Board of Trade.        The di<U+FB01>erences
are very small, being about 00003 volt.       The average of the Board
of Trade cells is less than our standard by about this amount.
   The Board of Trade possess seventy-two cells, and Mr. Rennie,
Major Cardew’s Assistant, inforrhs us that the greatest difference
between any two of them is under 0'0007 volt. It will be seen from the
table given that, while the cells there considered are on the average
about one of our units above our standard, they are rather over two
of such units above the Board of Trade cells.

  If   we   take the          of our standard as 14342 volts at 15°, the
cells of    the Board of Trade average in E.M.F. about 1'4339 volts at

                                                      on the re<U+FB02>ex mechan

what particular examination        of the distribution of the efferent and

The present communication          has reference to the distribution of the
efferent <U+FB01>bres of the roots.
   Reil,* Scarpa<U+FB02>" A. Monro,1' and Soemmering§ all paid considerable
attention to the arrangement of the root-bundles in the limb plexuses,
but physiological work upon the subject commenced with Van Deen,[|
J. Miiller<U+FB02>l and Panizza.**          The former two gave an anatomical
=igni<U+FB01>cance    to the plexus, the last a physiological.          At Miiller’s
Suggestion, renewed research was undertaken by H. Kronenberg<U+FB02>"
in1835.      Kronenberg con<U+FB01>rmed Muller’s observations as to the in
dividual inconstancy of the contribution made by any spinal root to
the nerve cords of the plexus; he also concluded          that the excitation
6f a single nerve-root before its entrance        into the plexus produces
Contraction    of almost all the muscles of the limb; and that the
arrangement      is intended to protect against fatigue.              Later,
 Eckhardt,II    working   in   Ludwig’s   laboratory,  arrived  at somewhat
 iimilar conclusions.     He stated that a great number of muscles

supplied by the roots ; that the distribution of the <U+FB01>bres of a root is
not to one group of muscles, but is to several groups, which are often
not related to each other in function; that antagonistic groups are
often supplied by one and the same root.
    Three years after the experiments by Eckhardt, and also under
Ludwig, Peyer’s* experiments on the brachial plexus of the rabbit
were made. As Krause, in 1861,“? repeated Peyer’s work on the same
limb and the same species, the results of both may be here referred to
together. The muscles of the limb each receive nerve-<U+FB01>bres from two,
in some cases three, spinal roots; usually the contraction of a muscle
on excitation of the spinal roots innervating it is obviously different in
degree for each root: the same spinal root does not always supply in
di<U+FB01>i'erent individuals the same muscles; the further the position of
a spinal root from the head, the nearer the muscles it supplies to the
distal end of the limb; the peripheral trunks of the limb plexus are
themselves plexuses of root-bundles.         In 1881 Ferrier and Yeoj';
con<U+FB01>rmed the above results in experiments on the spinal roots of the
monkey.       In addition to their experiments on the brachial plexus,
they performed four complete experiments on the lumbo-sacral roots.
Unlike Kronenberg, Eckhardt, and others, they do not seem to have
met with any variation in the results obtained.     They revived the view
that the efferent distribution of each spinal nerve is based on its phy
 siological function, and that the movement resulting from the excita
tion of a root is that of a highly coordinated functional synergism.
 Some months later Paul Bert and Marcacci§ published experiments
 on the lumbar roots of the cat and dog.     They concluded that (i) each
 root produces a coordinate movement, and consists of <U+FB01>bres function
 ally associated; (ii) when a muscle is functionally divisible its root-
 supply is multiple.
     In 1883 Fergus and Lannegracell published a research on the limb
  plexuses of the cat, dog, and monkey.       The ‘ Comptes Rendus       of        ’11"
 the following year contain their reports. As to the lower limb, their
 account is    prefaced by a remark that the highest lumbar root of man
     tripled in the dog and monkey. What species of monkey was used
is is not mentioned in the      Comptes Rendus.’

tothe 6th of the dog.           The chief of their conclusions, drawn from
examination of both limbs, are :—The majority of muscles are innerv
ated by several roots. Excitation of a root determines in the muscles
which it supplies a total, not a partial, contraction.               The tributary
<U+FB01>bres of the root are disseminated through the muscle supplied by it,
and not
           “ cantonnées ” in a special zone of it. Each root has a mus
cular distribution almost absolutely constant in the animals of its own
species.     The functions of analogous roots di<U+FB01>er very little in
different mammalian species.             Each root supplies muscles of very
various, often of antagonistic,          action.    Excitation of a root gives a
combined movement, but an arti<U+FB01>cial, not a functional.                    The roots
that pass furthest into the member occupy the lowest position in the
cord.     The innervation of the two planes of <U+FB02>exors and extensors is
not always symmetrical.            The super<U+FB01>cial layers are supplied before
the deep.
     Herringham,* by minute dissection of the human brachial plexus,
 and, therefore,      under disadvantage from inability to distinguish
 clearly between a<U+FB02>'erent and eiferent <U+FB01>bres, arrived nevertheless
 at facts and conclusions of great importance.               He found much 'indi
  vidual variation, but evidence of certain “laws.” Thus: any given
  root-<U+FB01>bre may alter its position relative to the vertebral column,
  but will maintain its position relative to other <U+FB01>bres; of two
  muscles, or two parts of a muscle, that which is nearer the head end
  of the body tends to be supplied by the higher, that nearer the tail end
  by the lower, root; of two muscles, that nearer the long axis of the
  body tends to be supplied by the higher, that nearer the periphery by
   the lower, root; of two muscles, that nearer the surface tends to be
   supplied by the higher, that further from it by the lower, root.
      Recently Langley<U+FB01> in the course of a paper on the sweat nerves
   to the foot of the cat, refers to the movements of the limb produced
   by excitatiOn of roots of sciatic plexus in that animal. He desired
   to ascertain whether the variation, which he <U+FB01>nds considerable in the
   distribution of the sweat nerves (sympathetic system), has a correla
   tive in the distribution of the nerves to the limb muscles.                 Like
   Kronenberg,     Eckhardt,    and    Peyer,   he  <U+FB01>nds   that  the movements   re
   sulting from stimulation      of  the  same   nerve-roots  are  not uniform, and
   that the want of uniformity goes hand in hand with want of uniformity
   in the root composition of the plexus, just such as displayed in Her
                                                                        >

made in the spinal canal;          the single root, or a component <U+FB01>lament
from     it,   has been isolated in the case of the lower roots of the cat and
monkey,        to a length   5,   6,   or   7   cm., and lifted up by a silk ligature on
 to small platinum electrodes                   sheathed almost to the points.     Series
 of weak induced currents have been used for excitation, one pint
 Daniell being in the primary of the ordinary physiological induc
 torium (R. Ewald’s pattern).        The secondary coil has usually been
 at  a distance from the primary somewhat more than twice that at
 which a current was detectable by the tongue.           Use has also been
 made of absolutely minimal stimuli, and largely of mechanical
 stimuli.   For certain purposes, stimulation by quite strong electrical
 excitation has been used.
    In these experiments       became clear that the frequency of indi
                                  it
 vidual variation, as regards the anatomical and physiological consti
 tution of the efferent roots of the lumbo-sacral region, was great
 enough to demand the recognition of a “pre-axial” and a “post
 axial ” class of innervation for each muscle and movement.               By
 pre-axial class of innervation      meant that the‘roots connected with
                                            is
 the muscles and the movements are more pre-axial than the roots
 connected with the same muscles and the same movements in the
 post-axial class of innervation.
    Thus, in the frog there      a pre-axial class of innervation for the
                                       is
 hind limb, in which, for instance, the viith spinal root, as well as sup
 plying the antero-internal thigh muscles, supplies the muscles on the
 front of the leg (tibialis anticus). There      a post-axial class in which
                                                                is
the pretibial muscles are supplied by the viiith and ixth roots only.
 The post-axial class as measured in this way        the more usual. Thisis
 may be merely because the above criterion, found convenient for dis
tinguishing in any individual case the direction which the variation
has taken in it, does not coincide with the mid point about which
 individual variation in the species     really oscillating.

    The results of the experiments are in harmony with those of
Eckhardt.       Many of the muscles of the limb are supplied by three
spinal roots, some by two; one alone, as far as        I have yet observed,
by a single root only. Individual variation is frequent. Excitation
of the same spinal root not always throws into action the same
muscles, even in individuals of the same species, sex, and approximate
.age; nor does it always produce the same movement, e.g., <U+FB02>ewion at
 knee followed excitation of 5th root in two individual instances.
Analysis of the distribution of the component <U+FB01>laments of a root
 shows that in different individuals <U+FB01>laments which correspond in
absolute position in the nerve-root do not correspond in function.
Nevertheless, Herringham’s “ Law         I ”
                                             (quoted above) holds good for
the out<U+FB02>ow of <U+FB01>bres throughout considerable regions of the cord,
although a sciatic plexus of the post~axial class may occur in the
same individual as a brachial plexus of the pre-axial class, so that in
its narrowest sense the “law” is not always applicable to great
 lengths of the cord.      No exception has been found to it in the sense
                                                                            '
 that an e<U+FB01>'erent <U+FB01>bre pre-axial in one individual to some particular
other efferent <U+FB01>bre is ever in any individual of the same species post
axial   to it.
    The distribution of the peripheral nerve-trunks is not obviously
di<U+FB01>erent, whether by its root-formation the plexus belong to the pre
axial or to the post-axial class.      The peripheral nerve-trunks are, as
 regards their muscles, relatively stable in comparison with the spinal
 roots.    When the innervation of the limb-muscles is of the pre-axial
class, so also is that of the anus, vagina, and bladder; and conversely.
    The region of out<U+FB02>ow from the spinal cord of the <U+FB01>bres destined for
.a natural group of the limb-muscles, or the representation of a par
 ticular movement at a limb joint, is often not conterminous with the
origin of the <U+FB01>laments of a spinal root, but has its limits at points
 within spinal segments, either overstepping or falling short of their
 boundaries.       Thus the out<U+FB02>ow to the intrinsic muscles of the sole
 sometimes has its upper limit placed nearly midway up the region of
origin of the <U+FB01>laments of the 6th root. The lower limit of the out
 <U+FB02>ow to the calf muscles sometimes lies about two-thirds down the
 region of origin of the 8th root.         Other examples could be cited.
 The ankle, knee, &c., which seem to be divisions between funda

1892.]       On the Nerve-roots           of the Lumbo-sacrai Plexus.         77
mentally    distinct portions of the limb, are not regarded as such in
the   segments of the spinal cord.
    If the simple movements (<U+FB02>exion, &c.) of the limb-joints be con
 sidered individually, the region of representation in the spinal roots of
 Macacus extends for each into at least three segments of the cord.
 The region of representation for each simple movement is about as
 extended for the small joints (digits) as for the large (hip-knee).
 The whole region of representation for the movements of the knee is,
 however, longer (includes more cord segments) than that for the
 ankle; and that for the hip is longer than that for the knee.              This
 is because the more distal the joint the greater the overlap of the
 regions of representation in the roots of each of the two opposed
 movements at the joint. Of the opposed movements, the one which
 is in a. direction toward the anterior aspect of the limb is always
 represented the more pre-axially in the spinal roots.
     In the thigh, the nerve-roots supplying the musculature are none
 of them common at once to the muscle groups of the anterior and
 posterior aspects of the thigh.            In the foot and leg the nerve-roots
  supplying the muscles each supply muscles situated both on the ante
  rior and posterior aspects; this is more marked in the case of the
  foot than of the leg; yet in the former even the musculature of the
  sole is distinctly post-axial to that of the dorsum.
      Although there is clear evidence that the nerve supply of the
  skin of the hallux is pre-axial to that of the 5th digit, my experi
  ments have given only equivocal evidence that the musculature of
   the hallux is pre-axial to that of the minimus; nor is in the thigh
   the gracilis     (lower part) pre-axial to the vastus externus. The
   mutual relationship of gracilis and vastus externus is as that of

   the same is probably true of hallux and 5th digit (as regards their
   musculature).       This is in accord with Paterson’s* views of the
   mutual    relationship      of the obturator and anterior crural nerves,
   although not with      his   extension of a similar view to the relationship
   of the internal and external popliteal nerves.

   regards the fore-limb, by Herringham, viz., that, of the super<U+FB01>cial
   and deep muscular layers of a region of the limb, the super<U+FB01>cial layer
  is innervated      by more pre-axial roots than the deep layer. The
   reverse holds good for the calf muscles and the hamstrings.
     The significance of the distribution of the efferent <U+FB01>bres of a spinal
  root is, as   J.  LIiiller suggested, anatomical (based on metamen'sm,
  Mi.) rather
                than functional (based on co-ordinate action, &c.). Ex

 due to the action of many muscles, but there is no safe ground for
 believing that the combination is of a functional character; the
 weight of evidence is against this.
    As to the question whether a muscle, when supplied by several
 nerve-roots, is supplied by them in such a way that one piece of the
 muscle is supplied by one root, another by another, although there is
 certainly great interlapping of regions belonging to the individual
 roots,  I cannot agree with Forgue and Lanuegraoe when they say,
 “ Excitation of a spinal root determines in the muscles which it
                                                                         sup
 plies a total, not a partial, contraction.” Simple inspection is enough
 to convince one, that in the case of some of the larger muscles, e.g.,
 in the thigh and spinal regions, the nerve supply from the individual
 roots is distinctly partial, that a district of' the muscle belongs to this
 root, another district to that, although always with a large mutual
 overlap; striking examples are given by the sartorius, 3rd and 4th
 (Macaaus) sacrococcygeus superior, 7th, 8th, 9th (cat), &c.          On the
 other hand, as the distal end of the limb is approached, the inter
 mingling of the root-districts iu the several muscles becomes more
intimate, and in the muscles of the sole the intermingling of the
 muscle-<U+FB01>bres belonging to individual nerve-roots is so complete
 as to ba<U+FB02>ie analysis, except by the degeneration           method.   In the
sphincter muscle of the anus there is an overlap of the motor dis
 tributions of the right and left halves of the body.          The sphincter
ani is supplied by four nerve-roots, two right-hand, two left-hand.
Any three of these may usually be cut through without the anus
becoming patulous, or exhibiting asymmetry.            Conversely, excitation
of any one     of  the  eHerent   roots  supplying  it causes contraction of
both right and left halves of it. The innervation of the bladder from
its right- and left-hand roots, is, on the other hand, neither in the
case of its sympathetic nor its direct spinal supply of a bilateral
character.
IV. “On      the Causation of Diphtheritic Paralysis.”            By SIDNEY
      MARTIN, M.D., F.R.C.P., Assistant Physician to University
      College Hospital. Communicated by GEORGE BUCHANAN,
      M.D., F.R.S. Received. March 2, 1892.
    The paralysis following     diphtheria in man is so closely associated
with the     acute   disease  that it is more correctly considered as a.
symptom and not a sequela.          Its mode of production in man has not
been demonstrated.
    A chemical examination of       the blood and spleen of eight patients
who had     died  of diphtheria    revealed  the presence of two classes of
substances not normally present in the tissues of the body, viz. (l) of

 1892.         On the Causation     0  DiP htheritic Paral1/ sis.               79
 two albumoses     or digested proteids, proto- and deutero-alburnosc,
         the same chemical reactions as the albumoses of peptic diges
tion, and (2) of an organic acid, which is soluble in absolute alcohol
and in water, to a less extent soluble in amyl alcohol, and insoluble
in ether, chloroform, or benzene. There is no base or alkaloid present.
Owing to the small quantities in which this acid was obtained, a
more detailed chemical examination was not possible.
    Physiological Action of the Albumoses.—When injected into the
 circulation of a healthy rabbit these albumoses produce fever.               If a
 single dose only be given, the fever subsides, and the animal remains
apparently well for months. A single dose, however, may kill in a
few hours.
    Repeated doses of the albumoses, besides producing fever, cause a
paralysis which may come on in two days, but more often is evident
in six or seven days, and may be delayed for twenty days if the dose
is small.
    The total doses given were between 0083 gram and 015? gram
 per kilo. of body weight in rabbits weighing between 1000 and 2000
 grams.
    The paralysis is not complete, but is a paresis, and is not accom
 panied by any special wasting of the paralysed parts.             The paralysis
 is progressive, and, if the dose be large enough (over 0'1 gram per
 kilo. of body weight), the animal dies in syncope with either slow or
 quickened respiration.
     The animals that do not die, but show paralysis, may have
 syncopal attacks, with an affection of the respiration ; but they
  recover from these.
     Five animals were used for experiment, and they all showed the
  same symptoms, including a loss of body weight, which is proportional
                                            -
  to the dose of the albumoses.
     A post-mortem examination of these animals showed that the blood
  was slow in coagulating with the largest doses.        Bacteria were absent
  from the blood and tissues, and in only one case was any oedema (of
  the abdominal wall) found.
     After staining with osmic acid and counterstaining with borax
  carmine, the nerves were found extensively degenerated, while the
  spinal cord, spinal ganglia, and brain were normal.
     The degeneration of the nerves is what has been described by
  Gombémlt’lf  in his experiments on lead poisoning as “un névrite
 segmentaire périaxile,” or a segmental degeneration.
    This degeneration affects a segment of the nerve; the <U+FB01>bres at that
part 1059 their
                  white substance of Schwann, and the                   cylinders

 becomes     ruptured, the nerve <U+FB01>bre below the point undergoes the
 Wallerian      degeneration.       The early stage of the segmental degenera
 tion is the breaking up of the white substance of Schwann.
     There may be more than one degenerated segment in the nerve
 which may then undergo completely the Wallerian degeneration.
 Above the degenerated segment the nerve is normal, the change
 being simply peripheral and not central in origin.
     All nerves in the body may be affected by this degeneration: the
 motor nerves, the sensory, and the visceral (sympathetic).
     An example may be quoted to show the extent of the nerve change
 A rabbit, which received two doses, equal to 0'1 gram per kilo. of
 body weight, showed de<U+FB01>nite palsy on the twentieth day, and was
 killed on the twenty-fourth.
     Segmental degeneration was found in the following nerves :—

    The nerve change is, therefore, widely spread over the body.
    Physiological Action of Organic Acid—This is much less toxic than
                            I
the albumoses, and have not succeeded in producing paralysis with
it. It, however, produces a moderate degree of nerve degeneration
when injected into the circulation.

 1892                                                                              81
    The nerve    degeneration is       associated   with a fatty degeneration       of
 the   muscles,   which is proportional to the degree of degeneration.
The heart, in     all cases, shows advanced fatty degeneration.
   Diphtherit'ic    Membrane—The            membrane in diphtheria consists
chemically     of <U+FB01>brin,    hetero-albumose,      proto-, and deutero-albumose,
i.e., it is in a state of digestion.         From it was obtained an extract
which was 3—5 times as toxic as the albumoses removed from the
body, producing the same symptoms (fever, paralysis) and the same
nerve    degeneration.
   This poison is probably the same as that isolated by Roux and
Yersin, and is presumably of a ferment nature, the albumoses and
organic acid found in the bodies of the patients being the result of
the action of the ferment on the proteids of the tissues.
   Diphtheria. would, therefore, be, from this point of view, a disease
in which the Bacillus diphtherine growing in the membrane excretes
aferment which, being absorbed, digests the proteids of the body,
with the formation of albumoses and an organic acid, the action of the
former of which is to produce fever and paralysis dependent on nerve
 degeneration.

             Professor of Physiology in the University of Turin.                Re

                                          (Abstract)
        In his investigations on the temperature of the brain the author has
     employed, in preference to the thermo-electric pile, exceedingly sen
     sitive mercurial thermometers, constructed specially for the purpose.
     Since each thermometer contains only 4! grams of mercury, the
     instruments       respond very rapidly to changes of temperature, and a
     change of not more than 0002" C. can easily be measured by means
     of them.       The author has studied the temperature of the brain, com
          '
             g it with that of arterial blood, of the muscles, of the rectum,
     and of the uterus;         his observations were made on animals under
     the in<U+FB02>uence      of morphia or various anaesthetics, and also on man.
        The curves of the observations made show that in profound sleep a
     noise, or other senSOry stimulus, is suf<U+FB01>cient to produce             a slight
     development of heat in the brain, without the animal necessarily
     awakening.
        ln profound     sleep the temperature of the brain may fall below that
     Of the   blood in the arteries. This is due to the very great radiation
l
     of heat   which takes place from the surface of the head.
)
       The   brain  when subjected       to the action of the ordinary interrupted
   current    rises   in   temperature.       The rise is observed earlier in the
   hm“    than   in the blood,      and the increase is greater in the brain than
  in the ge   neral    blood-current or in the rectum. During an epileptic
  seizure    brought on by         electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex,
                                                                         0 2

84           Temperature    of Bram and Psyehieal Activity.       [Man   24,
the author observed within twelve minutes a rise of 1° C. in the
temperature of the brain.
    As a rule the temperature of the brain is lower than that of the
rectum; but intense psychical processes, or the action of exciting
chemical substances, may cause so much heat to be set free in the
brain that its temperature may remain for some time O'2° or 03" C.
above that of the rectum.
    When a dog is placed under the in<U+FB02>uence of curare, the tem
perature of the brain remains fairly high, while that of the muscles
and that of the blood falls.        The di<U+FB01>erence of temperature thus
brought about is great and constant.       In one instance, the temperature
of the brain was 1'6“ 0. above that of the arterial blood in the aorta.
 Such observations warn us not to regard the muscles as forming, par
 excellence, the thermogenic tissue of the body.
    In order to show how active are the chemical processes in the brain,
it is su<U+FB01>icient to keep the animal in a medium whose temperature is
the same as that of the blood. When the effects of radiation through
the skull are thus obviated, the temperature of the brain is always
higher than that of the rectum, the difference amounting to 05° or
 0'6° C.
     Observations made while an animal is awake tend to show that the
 development      of heat due to cerebral metabolism may be very con
 siderable, even in the absence of all intense psychical activity.      The
 mere maintenance of consciousness belonging to the wakeful state
 involves very considerable chemical action.
     The variations of temperature, however, observed in the brain, as
 the result of attention, or of pain or other sensations, are exceedingly
 small. The greatest rise of temperature observed to follow, in the
 dog, upon great psychical activity was not more than O'Ol° C. When
  an animal is conscious, no change of consciousness,          no psychical
  activity, however    brought  about experimentally,   produces  more than
  a slight effect  on the temperature  of the  brain.
     The author shows an experiment by which it is seen that, as part
  of the e<U+FB01>ect of opium, the brain is the <U+FB01>rst organ to fall in temperature,
 and that it may continue to fall for the space of eighteen minutes,
 while the blood and the vagina are still rising in temperature.
     The author discusses the elective action of narcotics and anaes
  thetics. He shows that these drugs suspend the chemical functions
  of the nerve-cells. In a dog rendered completely insensible by an
  anaesthetic, one no longer obtains a rise of temperature upon stimu
  lating the cerebral cortex with an electric current.         These results
  cannot be explained as merely due to the changes in the circulation of
  the blood. The physical basis of psychical processes is probably of
  the nature of chemical action.
     In another experiment, in an animal rendered insensible with

 chloral, the  curves of temperature show that when the muscles of a
 limb are made to contract, the temperature of the muscles rises, but
 falls rapidly as soon as the stimulation ceases, soon returning to the
 normal. This is not the case, however, with the brain excited by an
 electric current.     Here the stimulus gives rise to a. more lasting pro
 duction of heat ; the temperature may continue to increase for
 several minutes after the cessation of the stimulation, indeed often
 for half an hour.      This may possibly explain why, upon an electric
 stimulation of the cerebral cortex, the epileptiform convulsions are
 not immediately developed, but only appear after the lapse of a latent
 period of several minutes.
    This experiment may be made to show the elective action exercised
 upon the brain by stimulant remedies. The injection of 10 centigrams
 of cocaine hydrochlorate produces a rise of temperature in the brain
 of 036° (3., without any change in the temperature of the muscles or
 of the rectum being observed.        In a curarised dog, the intervention
of the muscles being thereby excluded, the action of the cocaine may
produce a rise of as much as 4° C. in the temperature of the brain,
the author having observed a rise from 37° to 41° C.              This shows
that in arranging the calori<U+FB01>c topography of the organism a high
place must be assigned to the brain.
    The author concludes by expressing the hope that the comparative
study, by the direct thermometric method, of the temperature of the
various organs of the body will enable us to push forward our
knowledge of the phenomena of life.

   The only inconvenience and delay experienced in making a series
of tests in this chamber, with varying mixtures of gas and air, arose
from the dif<U+FB01>culty in rapidly, and with certainty, replacing the
mixture in the chamber by fresh air. This was attempted at <U+FB01>rst by
blowing air from bellows through the opening in the <U+FB02>oor of the
chamber. But the process was tedious and uncertain, because the

   gases   heated by  the burning of the lamps tended by their lightness
   to  remain near    the roof of the chamber, and were, therefore, only
   gradually removed by a process of dilution with fresh air.
      The renewal of the atmosphere in the interior of the apparatus is
   now   effected by a much more certain and simple means.
      An opening is made in the root of the chamber, immediately over
  the large aperture in the <U+FB02>oor, and corresponding to it in size.   This
  upper opening is closed with a water-seal, as in the case of the lower
  one. To effect this a square trough of sheet zinc, about 2 inches in
 depth, is <U+FB01>tted closely against the edge of the aperture, and a weighted
 deep-edged lid dips into water, which nearly <U+FB01>lls this trough.        By
 bedding a broad <U+FB02>ange of this trough with red lead upon the top of
 the chamber, screwing down broad wooden strips upon the <U+FB02>ange,
and brushing the surface over with melted paraf<U+FB01>n-wax, an air-tight
joint was at once obtained (see <U+FB01>g. 2).
    The replacement of the atmosphere in this modi<U+FB01>ed chamber is
e<U+FB01>ected by removing the water-seals from both the upper and the
lower openings.        The chamber, after having been used in an experi
ment, is then found to be <U+FB01>lled with fresh air after simply being
allowed to stand for a. few minutes.         The replacement of the atmo
sphere within       the chamber may be secured in the course of a few
seconds by swinging the <U+FB02>ap up and down several times.             By this
means not only is the introduction of the fresh air much more rapidly
effected than by the use of bellows, but the complete removal of the
gaseous mixture <U+FB01>lling the chamber is secured with certainty.

      [Increased accuracy has been obtained in the recent experiments
  made with the hydrogen lamp, hereafter described, in the test chamber
  by the removal of a small part of the mixing <U+FB02>ap (see <U+FB01>g. 3). This renders
  it possible   to place the lighted safety-lamp in the chamber before the
  gas is introduced and mixed with the air; since it enables the <U+FB02>ap to
  be swung within the chamber without touching the lamp. Accord
  ingly the test is commenced by placing the lamp in position close to
  the glass front; the chamber is then closed, the measured volume of
  gas is introduced and mixed with the air by moving the <U+FB02>ap, and the
  “cap” is observed, and its appearance noted as soon as it undergoes
  no further change.        The chamber is only opened <U+FB01>nally when the
  lamp is to be removed. Any slight alteration in the gaseous mixture,
  which was formerly caused by the subsequent introduction            of the
  lamp, is thus avoided—March 26, 1892.]
   II. “On     the Application of a Hydrogen Flame in an ordinary
         Safety-lamp to the Detection and Measurement of Fire
         damp.”       By FRANK CLOWES, D.Sc. (Loud), Professor of
         Chemistry, University College, Nottingham.              Communi
         cated by Professor ARMSTRONG, F.R.S. Received March 24,
         1892.
      In  a former paper (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 50, p. 122) an apparatus
   was    described in which the appearance of the “ cap” over the <U+FB02>ame
   of a safety-lamp could be observed and measured when the lamp was
   exposed to de<U+FB01>nite mixtures of air with methane or <U+FB01>rodamp.           The
   relative sensitiveness of dilferent forms of lamp, and of different
   <U+FB02>ames, when they are applied to the detection and measurement of
   “
     gas,” was thus readily ascertained.      It was stated that the <U+FB02>ames
   of colza oil, rape oil, mixed oils, benzoline, methylated spirit, and
   hydrogen had been experimented upon : and that the non-luminous
   <U+FB02>ames producible by benzoline, alcohol, and hydrogen far excelled
   the more or less luminous oil <U+FB02>ames in their power of indicating low
   percentages of in<U+FB02>ammable gas or vapour in the air.        It was further
   found that the delicacy of the test was much increased by grinding
   the inner surface of the back of the glass cylinder of the lamp so as
   to destroy its re<U+FB02>ecting power.
      Ashworth’s modi<U+FB01>ed benzoline safety-lamp was especially referred
   to as an ef<U+FB01>cient lamp both for lighting and for gas-testing.        The
   brilliant illuminating <U+FB02>ame gave a forward light equal to one miner’s
   candle.    When it was reduced in size by drawing down the wick it
   became blue and non-luminous: and when it was viewed in this con
   dition against the ground glass surface, or, better still, against the
,  dead-black background produced by smoking the interior of the

1892.]       Flame to Detection and Measurement of Fire-damp.                     91
lamp     glass  at the back, a distinct <U+FB02>ame cap, 7 mm. in height, was
seen    in air containing only 0'5 per cent. of methane or <U+FB01>re-damp. The
height, density, and de<U+FB01>nition of the cap over this <U+FB02>ame were found
 to increase pretty regularly as the percentage            of “gas ” in the air was
 augmented.       The ef<U+FB01>ciency of this lamp for lighting and testing is
 thus    placed beyond doubt.
     In continuing the experiments described in the former paper, how.
  ever, a comparison of the
                                   “        ”
                                     caps      produced by the <U+FB02>ame of this lamp
  with those produced by a small alcohol <U+FB02>ame and a small hydrogen
  <U+FB02>ame showed       that the latter <U+FB02>ames were more sensitive as gas indi
  cators than that of the benzoline lamp.             Thus, when an alcohol and
  hydrogen      <U+FB02>ame,   each  10  mm.    in   height, were introduced, together
  with the small blue benzoline <U+FB02>ame, into the testing chamber, which
  was <U+FB01>lled with air containing 1 per cent. of coal gas, <U+FB02>ame caps of the
  following dimensions were obtained :—
                      Hydrogen............            27    mm.
                      Alcohol..............           19
                      Benzolinc............             7'2   D
      It is true that the benzoline      <U+FB02>ame employed in this experiment was
  much smaller than the        two    other   competing <U+FB02>ames.        But it must be
  remembered. that the benzoline <U+FB02>ame is necessarily small when it is
  employed for gas-testing, since, if its dimensions are increased, it
                                                      “      ”
  becomes luminous, and renders the pale                cap     invisible.  And one
  of the principal advantages of the alcohol and hydrogen <U+FB02>ames con_
  sists in their remaining non~luminous, even when they are made of
   large dimensions; the greater surface and higher temperature of

   “caps              possible with a small benzoline <U+FB02>ame.
       It will be seen from the results of the experiment just described
   that the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame has the advantage over the alcohol <U+FB02>ame in
                             “       ”
                                        which it yields. But by prolonging the
    the dimensions of the      cap
   test, another advantage of the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame over its rival was
   ascertained.     The two <U+FB02>ames were allowed to burn side by side in the
   chamber, charged with air containing 1 per cent. of coal gas, for over
    thirty minutes.     Throughout this protracted test both the hydrogen
                      “ cap” above it remained unaltered in size and ap
    <U+FB02>ame and the
    pearance,     The alcohol <U+FB02>ame and its “ cap,” however, steadily
   diminished in size : after <U+FB01>ve minutes the height of the cap had fallen
   from 19 mm, to 125 mm., and after another interval of <U+FB01>ve minutes
   the height of the cap was reduced              to 6'5 mm.: and thirty minutes
  after the    beginning    of  the    experiment the <U+FB02>ame was spontaneously
  extinguished.      This result seems to indicate that the alcohol <U+FB02>ame
  is much more      sensitive    to the in<U+FB02>uence of the presence of products
 of combustion,      and   to  de<U+FB01>ciency      of oxygen, than the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame

oxygen required by the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame for its combustion.

                     in air was taken advantage of by G. Pieler in 1883 to
ages of       gas
produce      the   most   sensitive form of safety-lamp for gas-testing yet
invented. The Pieler lamp is a large Davy lamp, burning alcohol
from a circular wick, which yields a large <U+FB02>ame, 30 mm. in height.
When the lamp is used for testing, even the feeble light of this <U+FB02>ame
is shielded from the eye, so as not to interfere with the perception of
the “ cap.” Experiments with this lamp in known percentage pro
                        ”
portions of “ gas          and air have been described by several observers,
and their results were fully con<U+FB01>rmed by a series carried out in the
 test-chamber. The “ caps ” obtained were as follows :—
               0'25 per cent. of methane      gave a 30 mm. cap.
               0'5           ,,       ~    ,7               11

    Indeed the <U+FB02>ame of this lamp is so sensitive that when the propor
 tion of methane in the air reaches 1'75 per cent. the “ cap ” touches
 the top of the gauze of the lamp; and with a somewhat higher per
                “                       “      ”
 centage of        gas,” the enlarged     cap    completely <U+FB01>lls the interior of
 the gauze.
     Practical men, who have used this lamp, seem to feel some doubt
 as to its perfect safety in the mine.            But their main objection is
 that the alcohol <U+FB02>ame is non-luminous, and accordingly a second
 lamp must be carried for lighting purposes when the Pieler lamp
 is employed for gas-testing.
     Attempts have been made to obviate the inconvenience of carrying
 two lamps, by constructing a safety-lamp with two reservoirs.              One
 of these would contain oil, and the other alcohol. Each would be
 supplied with a wick in the ordinary way. By raising or lowering
 one wick or the other, a luminous oil~<U+FB02>ame for lighting purposes, or
 a non-luminous alcohol-<U+FB02>ame for gas-testing, should thus be obtained
 at will within one and the same lamp: the <U+FB02>ame being passed from one
 wick to the other, as may be required.           Practical dif<U+FB01>culties arose in
 the use of this composite lamp, which have prevented its adoption.
     Hydrogen Lamps.—Pieler was aware of the advantage secured by
 employing a hydrogen <U+FB02>ame for gas-testing.             Owing to the di<U+FB02>iculty,
 however, of adapting a hydrogen supply to a portable safety-lamp, he
 recommended that samples of air from the mine should be brought
 to the surface, and tested by a hydrogen <U+FB02>ame burning from a

    1892.]      Flavne  to Detection and Measurement of Fire-damp.             93
   chemical     generator, the apparatus being a <U+FB01>xture in a testing        room
   situated   near the pit’s mouth.
      Since, however, hydrogen gas is now obtainable at small cost,         com
  pressed     in light     steel cylinders, it has been found possible to
  flu'nish   a.  supply of    the gas to a jet inclosed in an ordinary safety
  lamp.
     The   lamp is so constructed that oil or benzoline may          be burnt  in
 the    ordinary way from a wick when the lamp is to                be used   for
 lighting purposes, the wick being drawn down so as to produce a
 non-luminous <U+FB02>ame, and this yielding caps in gas-testing when pro
portions     of gas    exceeding    3  per cent. have to be looked for.    When
proportions        of gas less than   3  per cent. are to be looked for and esti
mated,      the hydrogen        gas is introduced by a metal jet <U+FB01>xed close to
the    wick; the gas at         once kindles.     The wick is then drawn down
until the      oil <U+FB02>ame is extinguished, and the cap is looked for over the
hydrogen <U+FB02>ame.            A  cap is easily seen over this hydrogen <U+FB02>ame when
only 0‘25 per cent. of gas is present.            When the illuminating <U+FB02>ame is
required the wick is again pushed up, and kindled by the hydrogen
<U+FB02>ame.       The supply of hydrogen may then be withdrawn. The oil
<U+FB02>ame and the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame are thus made to supplement one
another in the same lamp in gas-testing.
    The hydrogen is at present supplied from a small steel cylinder,
3 inches      in   diameter by 8 inches in length, and weighing 4 pounds.
The cylinder when fully charged contains 4! cubic feet of hydrogen.
This supply lasts for many tests, since when the <U+FB02>ame is kept burn
ing continuously at the ordinary height of 10 mm. it consumes only
1 cubic foot of gas in about four hours.             A regulator may be adapted
to the neck of the cylinder, but it has been found that a very delicate
valve in the neck         of  the cylinder serves to adjust the stream of gas
with ease       without    the intervention of any regulator.
    The cylinder is slung in a leather case by a strap across the
 shoulder.       A  <U+FB02>exible tube from the nozzle of the bottle connects the
                                          FIG. 1.

94                    On   the  Detection of Fire- damp.             [Man 31,
bottle with a little <U+FB02>anged metal nozzle: and this can be attached to
an opening in the bottom or side of the oil reservoir of the lamp.
The hydrogen is thus supplied to a copper tube of <U+FB01>ne bore which
passes through the reservoir and terminates on a level with, and close
by, the top of the wick (<U+FB01>g. 1). Before the hydrogen is fed into the
lamp, it is gently turned on and allowed to sweep the air out of the
<U+FB02>exible tube; connexion is then made with the lamp, and by careful
adjustment of the valve of the bottle the <U+FB02>ame is made of' the required
size.   The aperture in the lamp for introducing the hydrogen is
closed by an automatic valve when the hydrogen is not in use.
   Several series of measurements         of “caps” were made over the
hydrogen <U+FB02>ame of this lamp in the testing chamber.              The <U+FB02>ame was
adjusted   to  a    height   of  10  mm.  by    viewing  it  through   a metal
diaphragm containing         a hole  10 mm.   in  diameter   and  held  outside
the lamp; or by making its tip level with the top of an upright wire
<U+FB01>xed inside the lamp and near the burner. A glass cylinder of
extra height (90 mm.) was <U+FB01>tted into the Ashworth lamp, and a
dead-black background was produced by smoking a broad strip of
the internal surface of the back of this glass with the <U+FB02>ame ofia wax
taper. The blackened glass not only gave a surface against which pale
caps were easily seen, but the dead surface prevented re<U+FB02>ections giving
perplexing ghosts of the true <U+FB02>ame.         The percentage of methane in
the air in these experiments varied from 0'25 to 3, and the following
heights of cap represent the average of a large number of fairly con~
cordant readings :—
              With    0'25 per cent. of methane,     17 mm. cap.

   In the 3 per cent. mixture the tip of the cap disappeared in the
Opaque metal cylinder of the lamp above the glass.               The hydrogen
<U+FB02>ame therefore became useless for measuring higher percentages,
unless it was much reduced in size : but at this point the oil <U+FB02>ame is
 competent to take up the indications with certainty.          When very low
 proportions of gas are to be tested for, the size of the hydrogen
 <U+FB02>ame may be increased with advantage, as is described below; but no
observer could fail to see the smallest cap mentioned above as being
produced by the 10 mm. <U+FB02>ame.
    The advantage which may, be obtained by increasing the size of the
hydrogen <U+FB02>ame, when small percentages of gas are being looked for, is
shown by the results of the following experiments, made by exposing
 the hydrogen safety- lamp in air containing 1 per cent. and 0'5 per

       Attention is directed in the above statement to the height of the
   cap   alone, but, as a matter of fact, its change in general appearance is
   also very noticeable as the proportion of gas is increased.              Very care
   ful observation of the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame in air free from gas serves to
   detect a slender and very pale cap.             When the gas in the air reaches
   0'25 per cent. the cap becomes broader and pale grey in‘colour, but
   is still inde<U+FB01>nite in outline, especially at its summit, and is seen only
   above the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame.              As the proportion of gas increases, the
   <U+FB02>ame becomes strikingly sharp and pointed in outline, distinctly
   bluish-grey in colour, and gradually broadens and extends down the
   sides of the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame, <U+FB01>nally enclosing it altogether and en
  circling the jet. At the same time, the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame itself is con
  stantly growing in every dimension, gaining in luminosity and ac
  quiring a rose-red tip. It is well to have watched the above changes
  in the test-chamber, and to have become familiar with the appearance
  of the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame in diiferent percentages of gas before the <U+FB02>ame
  is used for gas-testing.
      The use of the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame for gas-testing has the advantage of
  rendering       possible  the    employment of a non-luminous <U+FB02>ame which
  can be     immediately adjusted to any convenient size : not only may the
  size of the cap be thus increased at will by enlarging the <U+FB02>ame, but
  it is possible to avoid the risk of losing the <U+FB02>ame in the lamp. which
  is incurred by drawing down the wick very low when an oil <U+FB02>ame is
  made     use  of for gas-testing.
    III. “ On the Application of the Safety-lamp to the Detection
          of Benzoline Vapour and other In<U+FB02>ammable Vapours in
         the Air.”        By FRANK CLOWES, D.Sc. (Loud), Professor of
         Chemistry,      University      College, Nottingham. Communicated

     Since  the   vapour of     benzoline and of petroleum spirit, when mixed
 with air, may become            dangerously explosive and in<U+FB02>ammable, it is
 found necessary
                         to  employ     safety<U+FB02>lamps instead of naked lights to
                                           contain such a mixture. The safety
illuminate spaces which may
        should     accordingly        be used     in the neighbourhood of the oil

tanks in petroleum-carrying steamers, in petroleum stores, and in
chambers in which processes are carried on which involve the use of
light petroleum oil.
    The suggestion naturally occurs, that the safety-lamps used in these
places should be applied to ascertain whether the amount of in<U+FB02>am
mable vapour present in the air is suf<U+FB01>cient to 'give rise to danger if
it should come into contact with a naked <U+FB02>ame; in other words, to
ascertain if the space is ef<U+FB01>ciently ventilated.        Experiments were
accordingly undertaken to discover whether benzoline vapour would
                 “     ”                                              “    ”
give rise to a cap        over the <U+FB02>ame of the safety-lamp, and if a cap
appeared, to discover how small a proportion of the vapour could be
 detected   in air by this  <U+FB02>ame-cap  test.   Since the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame in
 the safety-lamp, and the benzoline <U+FB02>ame in Ashworth’s modi<U+FB01>ed
lamp, had been found to be most convenient for the formation of
visible “ caps,” these lamps were employed in the experiments; and
the test-chamber above described was employed for exposing the
lamps to mixtures in varying proportions of benzoline vapour with
air.
    Since benzoline is a mixture of liquids, and is therefore not of
invariable chemical composition, no attempt was made to ascertain
the actual percentage of the vapour present in the air. The per
centages of vapour, even if known and identical in amount, would
probably have di<U+FB02>erent e<U+FB01>ects when derived from di<U+FB01>erent samples
of benzoline, or even when derived from the same samples under
 different conditions. Accordingly an approximate determination only
was made of the amount of further dilution with air, which an ex
                                                                        ”
plosive or in<U+FB02>ammable mixture might undergo, before the “cap              it
 produced over the safety-lamp <U+FB02>ame ceased to be easily      visible.
    A large gas-holder was <U+FB01>lled with air which had bubbled through
 benzoline, and was thus charged with the vapour at the ordinary tem
perature, in the same way as air would be charged with the vapour from
the evaporation of stored benzoline.         This mixture was in<U+FB02>ammable
when kindled in the open air. Varying proportions of this mixture
with additional air were then prepared, and the e<U+FB01>ect was ascertained
 of introducing a <U+FB02>ame into them.        It was found that a mixture of 1
 volume of the benzolised air with 4 volumes of air was violently
 explosive.    When the proportion of air was increased from 4 t0 7
 volumes' the mixture was still in<U+FB02>ammable, and when the air was
 increased to 9 volumes the mixture ceased to be in<U+FB02>ammable.
Mixtures of the same benzolised air were then made in the test
chamber (pp. 87—90) with still larger proportions of air, and the
 appearance of the safety-lamp <U+FB02>ames was examined in these mix
 tures, with the following results :———

   The results of these experiments showed that the 10 mm. hydrogen
<U+FB02>ame in the Ashworth safety-lamp will detect a quantity of benzoline
vapour in air which is only 1/36th that of the explosive proportion,
and 1/20th of that which is in<U+FB02>ammable when mixed with air.                                The
benzoline <U+FB02>ame shows a very small but distinct “cap” when the
amount of benzoliue vapour is 1/9th that requisite for the production
of an explosive mixture, and 1/5th that which will yield an in<U+FB02>am

IV. “Aberration Problems:          a Discussion concerning the Con
       nexion between     Ether and Matter, and the Motion of the
       Ether near the Earth.” By OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S., Pro
       fessor of Physics, University College, Liverpool.         Received
       March 31, 1892.
                                 (Abstract)
    The paper begins by recognising the distinction between ether in
free space and ether as modi<U+FB01>ed by transparent matter, and points
 out that the modi<U+FB01>ed ether, or at least the modi<U+FB01>cation, necessarily
 travels with the matter.     The well-known hypothesis of Fresnel is
 discussed and re-stated in modern form.                          -
    Of its two parts, one has been veri<U+FB01>ed by the experiment of Fizeau,
 the other has not yet been veri<U+FB01>ed.     Its two parts are, (1) that inside
 transparent matter the velocity    of light is a<U+FB02>’ecled by the motion of
 that matter, and (2)“that immediately outside moving matter there
 is no such e<U+FB01>ect.    The author proceeds to examine into the truth of
 this second part, (1) by discussing what is already known,              by
                                         '
fresh experiment.
    The phenomena resulting from motion are four, viz. :—
    1. Changes in direction, observed by telescope and called aberration.
    2. Change in frequency, observed         by spectroscope    and called
                                                                           '
 Doppler e<U+FB01>ect.
    3. Change in time of journey, observed by lag of phase or shift of
 interference bands.
    4. Change in intensity, observed by energy received by thermopile.
    After a discussion of the elfects of motion in general, which differ
  according as projectiles or waves are contemplated, the case of a <U+FB01>xed
 Source in a moving medium is considered; then of a moving source
 in a <U+FB01>xed medium; then the case of medium alone moving past source
 and receiver; and, <U+FB01>nally, of the receiver only moving.
     It is found that the medium alone moving causes no change in
 .direction, no change in frequency, no detectable lag of phase, and
  probably no change _of intensity; and hence arises the dif<U+FB01>culty of
  ascertaining whether the general body of the ether is moving
  relatively to the earth or not.
     A clear distinction has to be drawn, however, between the effect of
  general motion of the medium as a whole and motion of parts of the
  medium, as when dense matter is arti<U+FB01>cially moved.        The latter kind
..of motion may produce many e<U+FB01>'ects which the former cannot.
      A summary of this part of the discussion is as follows :—
      Source alone moving produces a real and apparent change of
        colour; a real but not apparent error in direction; no lag of

        phase, except that appropriate to altered wave-length;             a change
        of intensity corresponding to different wave-lengths.
   Medium alone moving, or source and receiver moving together,
     gives no change of colour; no change of direction ; a real lag of
       phase, but undetectable without control over the medium; a
        change of intensity corresponding to di<U+FB01>erent distances, but
        compensated by change of radiating power.
     Receiver alone moving gives an apparent change of colour; 'an
        apparent change of direction; no change of phase, except that
         appropriate to extra virtual speed of light; change of intensity
         corresponding to di<U+FB01>erent virtual velocity of light.
      The probable absence of a <U+FB01>rst order e<U+FB01>ect of any kind, due to
  ethereal drift or relative motion between earth and ether, makes it
   necessary to attend to second order e<U+FB02>ects.
      The principle of least time is applied, after the manner of Lorentz,
   to de<U+FB01>ne a, ray rigorously and to display the effect of existence or
   non-existence of a velocity potential. Fresnel’s law is seen to be
  equivalent to extending the velocity potential throughout all trans
   parent matter.
      It is shown that a ray traversing space or transparent substances
   will retain its shape, whatever the motion of the medium, so long as
   that motion is irrotational, and that in that case the apparent direc
   tion of objects depends simply on motion of observer; but, on the
_ other
           hand, that if the earth drags with it some of the ether in its
   neighbourhood, stellar rays will be curved, and astronomical aberra
   tion will be a function of latitude and time of day.
      The experiment of Boscovich, Aim. and Hoek, as to the effect of
   <U+FB01>lling a telescope-tube with water, does not discriminate between
  .these theories.    For if the ether is entirely non-viscous and has a
   velocity potential, stellar rays continue straight, in spite of change of
   medium (or at oblique incidence are repeated in the simple manner),
  and there will be no fresh effect due to change of medium; while,            if,on
   the contrary, the ether    is all carried along near the earth, then it is
 stationary in a telescope tube, whether that be <U+FB01>lled with water or
 air, and likewise no e<U+FB01>ect         to be expected.
                                   is                     In the case of a viscous
  ether, all the dif<U+FB01>culty of aberration must be attacked in the upper
  layers above the earth; all the bending             is   over by the time the
 surface    is reached.    It isdif<U+FB01>cult    to see how   an  ethereal drift will not
  tend to cause    an aberration   in  the   wrong   direction.

            really discriminates between the rival hypotheses. All are
consistent either with absolute quiescence
                                                     of ether near moving bodies,

  Two others, however,   do appear to discriminate; viz., an old and
dif<U+FB01>cult polarisation experiment of Fizeau<U+FB02>“ which has not been
repeated since, and the recent famous experiment of Michelson      wi th
rays made to interfere after traversing and retraversing paths at right
angles.
    The conclusions deducible from these two experiments are antago
nistic.   Fizeau’s appears to uphold absolute rest of ether; Michelson’s
upholds relative rest, i.e., drag by the earth.
    The author now attempts a direct experiment as to the effect of‘
moving matter on the velocity of light in its neighbourhood; assum
ing that a positive or negative result with regard to the effect of
motion on the velocity of light will be accepted as equivalent to a
positive or negative result, with respect to the motion of the ether.
    He gives a detailed account of the experiment, the result of which
is to show that such a mass as a pair of circular saws clamped
together does not whirl the ether between the plates to any appreci
able amount, not so much, for instance, as a 1/500th part of their
speed.     He surmises, therefore, that the ether is not appreciably
viscous.    But, nevertheless, it may perhaps be argued that enormous
masses may act upon it gravitationally, straining it so as perhaps to
produce the same sort of effect as if they dragged it with them.          He
proposes   to try the effect of  a larger mass.   Also to see  when      if,
                                                                     subject
toa   strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld, ether can be dragged by matter.
    The aberrational e<U+FB01>ect of slabs of moving transparent matter                        is
considered, also the e<U+FB02>ect of a di<U+FB01>erent refractive medium.
    Motion of medium, though incompetent to produce any aberrational
or Doppler effect,      is shown to be able to slightly modify them if
otherwise produced.
    The Doppler eifect          then entered into. The question
                               is                                        dis       is
 cussed as to what the deviation produced by a prism or              grating   a
 really depends on: whether on frequency or wave-length. It                              is
 shown that whereas the e<U+FB01>’ect of a grating must be independent of
 its motion and depend on wave-length alone, yet that the effect
 observed with a    moving grating by a moving observer depends on
 frequency, because the motion of the observer superposes an aberra
 tional effect on the true effect of the grating.     This suggests a means
 of discriminating motion of source from motion of observer; in other
 words, of detecting absolute motion through ether; but the smallness
 of the di<U+FB01>erence  is not hopeful.
    Miohelson’s experiment          then discussed in detail, as a case of
                                      is
  normal re<U+FB02>exion from a moving mirror or from a mirror in a drifting
  medium. No error in its theory             is

 medium,     work done on     a moving mirror,      and the laws of re<U+FB02>exion
 and   refraction as modi<U+FB01>ed by motion, are considered.
    It is found that the law of re<U+FB01>exion is not really obeyed in a
 relatively moving medium, though to an observer stationary with
 respect to the mirror it appears to be obeyed, so far as the <U+FB01>rst order
 of aberration magnitude is concerned; but that there is a residual
 discrepancy involving even powers of aberration magnitude, of an
 amount possibly capable of being detected by very delicate observa
 tion.
     The following statements       are made and justi<U+FB01>ed :—
     (1.) The planes of incidence and re<U+FB02>exion are always the same.
     (2.) The angles of incidence and re<U+FB01>exion, measured between ray
              and normal to surface, usually di<U+FB01>er.
           If the mirror is stationary and medium moving, they differ by
              a quantity depending on the square of aberration magnitude,
              ale, by 1 part in 100,000,000; and a stationary telescope, if
              delicate enough, might show the effect.
    (4.)   If  the medium is moving and mirror stationary, the angles
              di<U+FB02>er by a quantity depending on the <U+FB01>rst power of aberra
              tion magnitude (1 part in 10,000), but a telescope moving
              with the mirror will not be able to observe it; for the
              commonplace aberration caused by motion of receiver will
              obliterate the odd powers and leave only the even ones ; the
              same as in case (3).
     (5.) As regards the     angles which the incident and re<U+FB02>ected waves
              make with the surface, they diifer in case             by a <U+FB01>rst
              order magnitude,    in  case (4) by a  second order  magnitude.
    (6,) At grazing incidence the ordinary laws are accurately obeyed.
             At normal incidence the error is a maximum.
           The ordinary laws are obeyed when the direction of drift is
             either tangential or normal to the mirror ; and are disobeyed
             most when the drift is at 45°.
   (8,)   In general,    the shape of the incident wave is not precisely pre
            served after re<U+FB02>exion in a moving medium. To a parallel
            beam the mirror acts as if slightly tilted; to a conical beam
            as if slightly curved. But either e<U+FB01>ect, as observable in the
            result, is almost hopelessly small.
  (9.)   Similar statements are true for refraction, assuming Fresnel’s
           law
  The   possibility of     obtaining <U+FB01>rst order e<U+FB01>ects from general ethereal
motion   by means of        electrical observations is considered.

     While engaged in certain experimental investigations in connexion
with the cervical nerve roots of the dog (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ 1892), the
ease with which I found one could separate, in a nerve root, the
 di<U+FB01>erent bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres which are concerned with one func
 tion from those concerned with another, or even a bundle of nerve
 <U+FB01>bres destined for the supply of one muscle from one destined
 for the supply of another, led me to suppose that by exercising
 suf<U+FB01>cient care, it might be possible to separate, in the same way, the
abductor from the adductor <U+FB01>bres in the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
It is a matter of clinical and pathological experience (Semon, R0sen~
bach) that in organic and progressive a<U+FB01>ections of this nerve the
abductor <U+FB01>bres are prone to succumb before the adductors; but why
this should be so is not at all clear.                In like manner, in the well
known experiments of Gad and B. Frankel‘l' on freezing the nerve, the
abductor <U+FB01>bres give way before the adductors do. Jeanselme and

1892.]              Adductor            F'z'bres   of the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve.                   103
subjects  who died of cholera, found that the crico-arytenoideus
posticus muscles were the <U+FB01>rst to lose their excitability after death.
This observation has been abundantly con<U+FB01>rmed by Horsley and
Semon" for all classes of animals. On the other hand, ether, reach
ing the laryngeal muscles through the circulation, puts the adductors
into abeyance before the abductors, so that, while excitation of the
recurrent nerve of an animal not very deeply under its in<U+FB02>uence
results in adduction of the corresponding vocal cord, similar excita
tion of the nerve when the animal is profoundly under the in<U+FB02>uence
 of the anaesthetic results in abduction of the cord.1'       It seemed,
 therefore, not unlikely that, if the <U+FB01>bres dominating over the one
 function could be successfully separated from those dominating over
 the other, some fresh light might be thrown on this subject.
    It is interesting to <U+FB01>nd. that Dr. Felix Semonj in a paper written
 so long ago as 1881, asked the following question with regard to the
 <U+FB01>bres of the recurrent laryngeal nerve: “Are we to suppose that,
 though the nerve is apparently homogeneous, it consists in reality of
 a bundle of strictly differentiated <U+FB01>bres, bound together simply by
 a common nerve sheath, and actually differentiated throughout their
                                                                       ”
 peripheral course; in fact, having ganglionic centres of their own ?
 Dr. Semon then goes on to show that the pathological facts strongly
 support the probability of the truth of this hypothesis.§
    Morell Mackenzie,“ in his text-book published the year before
 Semon raised this question, suggested that possibly the abductor
 <U+FB01>laments were more super<U+FB01>cially situated than the adductor <U+FB01>bres,
 and that this, if true, would account for the proneness of the abduc
 tors to succumb before the adductors in a<U+FB01>ections, especially com
 pression by tumours, of the nerve.     There is, however, no ground for
this    hypothesis.
      Since then, the general question of the proclivity of the abductor
<U+FB01>bres           the subject of great controversy, and has been
                  has       been
debated both from a clinical and pathological standpoint<U+FB02>l but, so
far as         I
        am aware, very few attempts have been made to determine

    Hooper<U+FB01>“ wishing to decide, by experimental investigation, whether
 it is  the abductor or the adductor <U+FB01>bres that are really the more
 prone to succumb in affection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve,
 passed a thread through the middle of one recurrent nerve, and left it
 in situ in the hope that it would act as a foreign body and excite
 in<U+FB02>ammation of the nerve.          At the end of a week, on inspecting the
 larynx, the vocal cord on the side corresponding to the injured nerve
 was observed not to come up to the middle line with the same “ snap
                                                                              ”
 on expiration as did the cord of the opposite side.
    The nerve was found imbedded in a mass of in<U+FB02>ammatory tissue,
 and electrical stimulation of its trunk below this point resulted in
 abduction of the corresponding vocal cord.             When a strong current
 was used, stimulation of the nerve resulted in abduction of the
 vocal cord of the same side, and adduction of that of the opposite
 side.   The opposite uninjured nerve was next divided, and adduction
 of the vocal cord on this side followed stimulation of its peripheral
 end.    Divisiouot the injured nerve below the point at which the
 thread had been inserted, and stimulation of its peripheral end,
 resulted in distinct outward rotation of the arytenoid cartilage of that
 side and an approximation of both arytenoid cartilages at the
 same time.      All attempts to verify these results have failed, so that
 the experiment stands alone.           Proneness of the adductors to suffer
 before the abductors is what this experiment seemed to point to, but
 the observer was unable to lay very great stress on this single experi
,meut, positive as it seemed.
    The possibility of direct injury to the adductor <U+FB01>bres during the
 process of inserting the thread into the nerve does not seem to have
 occurred to this observer, a possibility which is more than likely.
 Further, it is quite evident that the e<U+FB02>'ects he obtained on the opposite
 cord, by stimulating the injured nerve, were due to di<U+FB01>usion of the
 electrical current to the nerve of the other side by di<U+FB01>usion to the
 vagal trunk, and so re<U+FB02>exly to the opposite nerve.
    Onodif exposed the muscles of the larynx in dogs, and found that
 at the point where the recurrent laryngeal nerve crosses the crico
 arytenoideus lateralis muscle it splits into three bundles, the <U+FB01>rst of
 which supplies the crico-arytenoideus posticus, the second the aryte
 noideus transversus and crico-arytenoideus lateralis, and the third

the    thyro-arytenoideus externus. He passed a ligature round each
branch,    divided all three branches, and then stimulated each separately
by an electrical current, and noted the movements                of the vocal cords.
The communication is an exceedingly brief one; but the observer
promised to publish a full account of his experiments later.                      As far
as I am aware, no such publication has appeared up to the present.
    These observations can scarcely be said to have thrown much fresh
 light on the question at issue, as it is only natural to suppose that
 this nerve, in common with all other motor nerves, should so near its
peripheral termination divide into several branches, and that stimula-'
 lion of each branch of the nerve should evoke                   contraction of the
 muscle which it supplies, and thus bring about the particular move
 ment of the vocal cord over which the muscle presides.                         But this
 does not at all decide the all-important              question as to whether the
 nerve <U+FB01>bres presiding over the different functions have a separate
  course throughout the entire length of the nerve trunk or not.

  “dynamometer         between the cords.        This consisted of a small india
  rubber ball, which communicated by means of a tube with a mer
  curial    manometer.       The height of the mercurial column during
  inspiration    and   expiration was then noted during the natural move
  ments of the vocal cords, its positiOn during expiration being of'
 course     higher than during inspiration.              The recurrent laryngeal
  nerve was exposed and stimulated with an electrical current suf<U+FB01>
 ciently strong to produce moderate adduction of the corresponding
  vocal cord, during which the mercurial column rose. When excitation
 was discontinued it fell again, and oscillated between the two former
  points.     Circular pressure was then applied to the nerve, commencing
 with 5 grammes, and going up to 350 grammes, by gradual stages;
 pressure being kept up for 2% minutes at each stage.                    It was found
 that on stimulating the nerve after each stage there was a gradual
 diminution in its power of conduction, until stimulation on the
 proximal side of the point of pressure no longer gave any response,
  while stimulation on the distal side resulted in a. rise of the pressure,
 but not nearly so great as formerly.           There was a gradual fall of pres

the case of those instances in which it was necessary to allow the
animals to live for three weeks, for the study of the degenerations
which followed section of certain parts of the nerve. In the latter
case the operation, which was always of the most trivial character.
was performed under strict antiseptic precautions, and the small
 wound afterwards treated antiseptically.      In every case the small
 wound healed by immediate union. The animals were narcotised in
 these, as in the other, experiments, and at the end of three weeks
 death was produced by means of an overdose of chloroform.
    Tracheotomy was performed in every instance (exeept when the
 animal was to be allowed to live after the operation), a glass cannula
 being inserted into the trachea.    A short rubber tube connected the
 free end of the cannula with a glass funnel, through which the anaes
 thetic was administered during the remainder of the experiment.
 The trachea was then completely divided transversely above the
 point at which the tube had been inserted. A window was cut from
 the upper portion of the divided trachea and raised gently, so as to
 give a full view of the larynx, as seen from below, without producing
  the least traction on the parts, which might disturb their normal play
of movement<U+FB01>“
   One or other of the recurrent laryngeal nerves was next exposed,
separated from the loose connective tissue which surrounds it, and a
ligature passed round the trunk of the nerve at the lower part of the
neck.   The nerve was then divided on the proximal (i.e., bulbar) side
of the ligature, and its peripheral end was separated into its com
ponent bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres, round each of which a ligature was
passed and secured.
   In the operation for the production of control results by the de
generation method, the nerve, after being exposed and separated
from the surrounding connective tissue, was placed in situ upon a
piece of cork, in order to steady it, and one bundle of nerve <U+FB01>bres
being carefully separated from the others which compose the nerve,
a few millimetres of this bundle were excised.        These operations
were performed under strict antiseptic precautions, the wounds
closed by continuous aseptic silk sutures, and afterwards dressed anti
septically, healing by <U+FB01>rst intention, tracheotomy not having been
performed.
  *' In observations of this kind it is absolutely essential to view the larynx with
out traction on the attachments of the cords, since in the dog and the cat traction
on the larynx, whether by a ligature directly attached to   it,or indirectly by pulling
forward the tongue, may most easily produce the appearance of either paralysis or
spasm of one vocal cord where no such condition exists in reality.

             DIVISION or     SUBJECT   AND ANALYSIS    or REsUL'rs.
                              A. Division of  Subject.
    The  <U+FB01>rst part of the following research consists in the separation
and isolation     of the different bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres of which the
nerve trunk is composed, electrical excitation of each separate bundle,
and observation      of the effects produced on the vocal cords by such
excitation.
    Exposure    of the different bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres under exactly
similar   circumstances to the drying in<U+FB02>uence of the external air, with
observation of the relative duration of vitality possessed by the
di<U+FB01>erent bundles, forms the second part of the investigation.
    Other methods were next instituted to control the results of the
 foregoing, and the <U+FB01>rst of these, constituting the third part of this
 work, consisted      in tracing by post-mortem dissections each bundle of
 nerve <U+FB01>bres separated in the nerve trunk to its termination in the
 mucous membrane or in a muscle of the larynx.
     The next control method consisted in exposing the muscles of the
                                                                                  ‘
 larynx immediately after death, and direct observation of them during
excitation of the separate bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres, this being con
trolled by occasional excitation of individual            muscles themselves.
This forms the fourth part of the investigation.               The <U+FB01>fth or last
 part of the research served as a third control method, and consisted
 in  observations of the muscular degenerations which followed division
of   one or other bundle of nerve <U+FB01>bres in the nerve trunk, three weeks
after such division.
                              B. Analysis of  Results.
     Sectionl.   Separation and Excitation of the IndividualBuna'les of which
 the  Nerve  is composed—The separation was brought about by means
of an   exceedingly delicate thin-bladed knife. The divisions between
 the  di<U+FB02>’erent bundles of <U+FB01>bres could usually be seen by the naked eye,
and further guides were the minute capillary twigs which usually
 course on the surface of the nerve along these lines of division.
 When no such guides could be seen by the unaided eye, a lens was
 used to assist in their recognition.       Great care was taken to preserve
 the vitality of the nerve <U+FB01>bres by constantly bathing               them with
 warm normal      saline   solution.  Each   bundle   was  in  turn  raised  into
 the air, and stimulated      by  means  of <U+FB01>ne platinum    electrodes  attached
 to the secondary coil of a du Bois-Reymond’s           inductorium, supplied
 by a bichromate     cell. The same strength of current was used for all
 the bundles   of  nerve    <U+FB01>bres in any given experiment, and was on an
                to   7000   011 Kronecker’s inductorium scale; and the rate
 average 5000
of interruption was
                            100 per second.     The results in twelve dogs

 108              Mr. J.  S.  R. Russell.    The Abduator and             [Man    31,
 showed that excitation of certain bundles produced no effect on                  til 8
 vocal cord, while excitation of others produced abduction or adduction
 of the vocal cord on the same side, according to the bundle of <U+FB01>bre s
 stimulated; and, as far as could be ascertained, those <U+FB01>bres excita—
 tion of which produced abduction of the cord were situated internall§r
 to those which produced adduction, 6.0., the former are situated on
 the side of the nerve next to the trachea.             But of this point it        is
 dif<U+FB01>cult to be absolutely certain, as the dif<U+FB01>culties of preserving the
 nerve in its normal position during the investigation are very
 great.
      Section 2.   Relative Vitality of the respective Bundles.—It was found
  that if the bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres were separated, as has been already
  explained, and the abductor and adductor bundles of <U+FB01>bres thus
  isolated placed upon a piece of cork, and left exposed to the air of
  the room under exactly similar circumstances, the abductor <U+FB01>bres
  ceased to conduct impulses in response to electrical excitation long
  before there was the slightest sign of similar failure on the part of
  the adductors. The same strength of current and the same numb er
_-of interruptions per second were employed in each case, with the
  result that the abductor <U+FB01>bres ceased to conduct impulses in about
  twenty to thirty minutes, on an average, after transverse section of
  the nerve and separation of its component bundles; while the adductor
  <U+FB01>bres would continue to conduct impulses well for three hours and.
  more.*‘
      That this death of the abductor <U+FB01>bres did not take place throughout
  the whole length of the nerve at the same time is proved by the fact
  that when the portion under observation ceased to conduct impulses,
  an effect could be often produced by stimulating some portion of the
  bundle situated nearer the peripheral end of the nerve, until at last
  even stimulation of the nerve ends in the muscle failed to produce
   any e<U+FB01>ect.      The adductors meanwhile acted well to the original
   strength of stimulus, even when applied to the original seat of separa
   tion of the bundles.      As is well known, if all the <U+FB01>bres of the recur
   rent laryngeal nerve be stimulated simultaneously in the adult dog,
  adduction of the vocal cord results; while the same procedure in the
  young dog results in abduction of the vocal cord.               (See all previous
  observers from Legallois to Semen and Horsley.)                   In such young
  animals, even after separation of the different bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres
   in the trunk of the nerve from each other to the extent of an inch to
   an inch and a-half, it is at <U+FB01>rst impossible to get any other e<U+FB01>ect than
   abduction of the corresponding vocal cord.         But there comes a time
   when stimulation of one of the separated bundles results in abduc
   tion, while stimulation of another results in adduction. Still later
      * The experiment was never continued  longer than a. little over three hours, as
   there seemed no necessity for it.

the   abductor bundle ceases to produce this effect when stimulated
with a   moderate strength of current, and when a very strong current
is used adduction of the vocal cord follows, as in the case of stimula
[ion of the other bundle of nerve <U+FB01>bres.           The explanation of these
phenomena       seems to be that in the young dog the abductor <U+FB01>bres.
are more excitable       than the adductors, so that a strength of current
short of that necessary        to evoke action of the adductor muscles
di<U+FB01>uses     to  the abductor <U+FB01>bres, which, being more excitable, cause
 abduction of the vocal cord; but that, as in the adult animal, the
 tendency to death of the abductor <U+FB01>bres is more marked than that of
 the adductors, so that there comes a time in the young animal when
 the abductor <U+FB01>bres have so far lost their excitability        that stimula
 tion of the adductor bundle with a current strong enough to evoke
 contraction of the adductor muscles, though it still diifuses to the
 abductor <U+FB01>bres, is no longer capable of exciting them, and in the end
  the abductor      <U+FB01>bres lose completely their excitability, while the
  adductors, though relatively less excitable in the beginning. preserve
  their excitability, even in this case, longer than the abductors, which
 on their part preserve it much longer than in the adult animal.
     Section 3. (Control) Tracing the respective Bundles to their Peripheral
  Tenninations by Dissection—Having         ascertained by electrical excita‘
  tion the functions subserved by the diiferent bundles of nerve <U+FB01>bres
  in the nerve trunk, these bundles were traced post mortem.       by careful
  dissection to their peripheral terminations.      All the bundles of nerve
 <U+FB01>bres were thus dealt with, but the present research does not make
 it necessary for a description to be given of any but the motor <U+FB01>bres.
  From several such dissections, taken together with the facts ascer
 tained during the excitation experiments, it seemed almost certain
 that the abductor bundle of nerve <U+FB01>bres is situated on the inner side
 of the nerve, i.e., next to the trachea, while the adductor bundle is
 situated on the outer side of the nerve.       The abductor bundle may be
 traced to the crico-arytenoideus posticus muscle on the same side, and
 to it alone, none of the <U+FB01>bres to the adductors being contained in this
  bundle;      while the adductor bundle supplies branches to all the
  adductor muscles on the same side, and to the arytenoideus.
     Section 4. (Control) Direct Observation of the Abductor and Addnctor
  Muscles in Action after Dissection. —In six dogs the nerve was ex-.
   posed at the lower part of the neck, and the different bundles of
   <U+FB01>bres separated.     The nerve <U+FB01>bres were carefully preserved by being
   covered with a, piece of cotton      wool saturated with warm normal
  saline solution     The animal under observation was then killed by an
  Overdose of
                 chloroform,   the larynx quickly excised, and its muscles
 exposed  by   dissection.      _   I

                              cords be seen, but also the contraction of the
movements      of the vocal

muscles directly engaged in bringing about the movement of abduc
tion or adduction, as the case might be. These observations showed
that so perfectly could the nerve <U+FB01>bres concerned with the one func
tion be separated from those concerned with the other, that stimula
tion of the one set evoked contraction of the abductor muscle alone,
while stimulation of the other set evoked contraction of the adductor
muscles    alone.
   Section 5.    (Control) Degeneration Method—The dif<U+FB01>culties which
attended this group of experiments were very great.
   An attempt was made to separate one bundle of nerve <U+FB01>bres from
1he others, and to excise a few millimetres of it without injuring the
other bundles contained in the nerve trunk, and, of course, without
severing the whole nerve trunk.        As can be easily understood, the
ease with which damage can be done to so delicate a nerve is very
great, and in the absence of any means of <U+FB01>xing the nerve (such as
was a<U+FB01>orded by the ligature in the excitation experiments) without
producing damage to any but the bundle of <U+FB01>bres that were to be
eliminated, the nerve trunk rolled about so freely that the task was
attended by endless dif<U+FB01>culties.       It is, therefore, scarcely surprising
that, out of seven experiments, the results were unsatisfactory in three
instances.      But those that were successful yielded such striking
results that, in view of the great dif<U+FB01>culties attending them, further
multiplication of these experiments has been considered unnecessary.
In one instance, the adductor <U+FB01>bres in the nerve trunk were success
fully separated, and a few millimetres excised.         As in all these ex
periments, the wound healed by primary union; and when the dog
was killed, three weeks after operation, the autopsy revealed            the
following :—The adductor muscles on the side of the damaged nerve
were atrophied and degenerated, while the abductor muscle of the
same side was normal, as were naturally all the muscles of the opposite
side of the larynx.
   In two instances the abductor <U+FB01>bres were successfully divided
without injury to the adductor <U+FB01>bres.        During life in one case, there
were feeble attempts at abduction during vigorous inspiration, and in
the other there were not the slightest signs of abduction.          In both
cases the autopsy revealed atrophy and degeneration of the crico
arytenoideus posticus on the side corresponding to that of the injured
nerve, while the adductor muscles of the same side and all the
muscles of the opposite side of the larynx were normal.         In all these
three cases direct electrical excitation of the muscles con<U+FB01>rmed the
conclusions which had already been come to by observing their loss
of function and degenerate appearance.          In the fourth case, as was
supposed at the time of the operation, owing to their position, the
bundle of <U+FB01>bres divided was evidently not one of those supplying the
muscles of the larynx.       Three weeks after the operation the vocal

cord on     that side performed its excursions perfectly normally, as did
ihat of    the opposite side. Separation of the abductor and adductor
<U+FB01>bres was then e<U+FB02>'ected in the remainder of the nerve trunk, and ex
citation of these bundles evoked their respective movements of the
vocal cord on the same side.          Finally, on post-mortem examination in
this case, none of the muscles on either side of the larynx were found
atrophied      or degenerated.       It  consequently served as a gratifying
 control of    the other degeneration experiments.
                            SUMMARY Axe CONCLUSIONS.
     The results of these experiments show clearly :—
     1. That the abductor and adductor <U+FB01>bres in the recurrent lanyngeal
  nerve are collected into several bundles, the one distinct from the
 other, and each preserving an independent course throughout the
  nerve trunk to its termination in the muscle or muscles which it
  supplies with motor innervation, a condition of things the possibility
  of which was suggested by Dr. Semon more than ten years ago, from
  the evidence of pathological facts.
      2. That while in the adult animal simultaneous excitation of all
  the nerve <U+FB01>bres in the recurrent laryngeal nerve results in adduction
  of the vocal cord on the same side, abduction is the e<U+FB02>'ect produced
  in a young animal by an exactly similar procedure.
      3. That when the abductor and adductor <U+FB01>bres are exposed to the
  drying in<U+FB02>uence of the air under exactly similar circumstances, the
  abductors lose their power of conducting electrical impulses very
   much more rapidly than the adductors, in other words, they are
   more prone to succumb than are the adductors, a fact which has for
   long been recognised and insisted on by Dr. Semon as being the case in
   the human subject, and in support of the truth of which that observer
                                                      '
   has adduced so many powerful arguments.
      4. That, even in the young dog, the abductor nerve <U+FB01>bres, though
   preserving their vitality much longer than in the case of the adult
   animal, nevertheless in the end succumb before the adductor <U+FB01>bres.
       5. That this death commences at the point of section of the nerve,
   and proceeds gradually to its peripheral termination, and does not
    take place in the whole length of the nerve simultaneously.
       6. That    it is possible to trace anatomically the abductor and
    adductor <U+FB01>bres throughout the whole length of the recurrent laryngeal
    nerve to their termination in the one or other group of laryngeal
    muscles, and that these <U+FB01>bres appear to bear a <U+FB01>xed relationship to
   each other throughout
                               their course, the abductors being situated on
   the inner     side  of the   nerve or that next to the trachea, while the
  adductors    are on the    outer side.
     7_  That,  it is  possible   to so accurately separate  these two sets of

112           Fibres of   the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve.      [Man   31,
<U+FB01>bres  in the nerve trunk that excitation of either of them evokes con
traction of the abductor or adductor muscles, as the case may be,
without evoking any contraction whatever in the muscle or muscles
of opposite function.
   8. That the bundle of nerve <U+FB01>bres concerned       with one function
may be divided without injury to that concerned with the opposite
function, and that such division is followed by atrophy and degenera
tion of the muscles related to that function without any such changes
being detectable in the muscles related to the opposite function.
   Further, it was clear that the theory advanced by Mackenzie, and
which has since found favour with many, viz., that possibly the reason
why the abductor <U+FB01>bres succumb before the adductor in affections of
the nerve is because they are more super<U+FB01>cially and circumferentially
arranged, while the adductor <U+FB01>bres are situated deep in the sub
stance of the nerve, is shown by these experiments to be entirely
erroneous.
   One point which is dif<U+FB01>cult to explain is why there should be so
marked a difference between the recurrent laryngeal nerve of a young
and that of an adult dog, as regards the respective predominance of
abductor or adductor representation in the trunk of the nerve
Possibly the reason why the abductor in<U+FB02>uence is in the ascendency
in the young dog is because the power of phonation is still imper
fectly developed, and with it both the muscle and nerve <U+FB01>bres sub
serving this function are also imperfectly developed,         while the
function of respiration is from the beginning fully developed, and
with it the muscle and nerve <U+FB01>bres connected with that function.
That the reverse should be the case in the adult animal may well be
due to the fact that phonation is perfectly developed, while respira
tion has become so automatic that very feeble stimuli are necessary to
keep it going.
   My sincere thanks are due to Professor Victor Horsley for allowing
me to carry out this research in the Pathological Laboratory of
University College, London, and for being so good as to verify the
results which I obtained from time to time.
   I wish also to express my thanks to Dr. Felix Semon for having
very kindly given me access to his valuable collection of literature on
the subject, and facilitating the work of writing this paper.

                         (From the Physiological Institute, Leipzig.)
    In 1880, Ku<U+FB02>’erath“ pointed out that when both the ducti thoracici—
 right and left—and the ductus choledochus are ligatured icterus does
 not appear.    From his having only kept the dogs experimented upon
 alive from 1 to 2% hours, I was induced to test the value of the state
 ment by a series of experiments on animals kept alive for much longer
 periods.
    The following are the results obtained, conducted under the
 guidance of Professor Ludwig, to whom .my best thanks are due for
 the valuable assistance he gave me.
    The health of the animals experimented upon, I found, was not dis
turbed by ligaturing the thoracic duct,                  if,
                                              after being kept fasting a
 few days, they were carefully fed upon a fat-free diet; and not only
 so, but that they might live for weeks and months and even increase
 in weight.    Nor did the additional ligaturing of the common bile
 duct prove dangerous       done a few days previous to the application
                                if
 of the ligature to the thoracic duct, and the dogs fed on food contain
 ing only small quantities of proteids.
    On the other hand, when both the thoracic and bile ducts were
 ligatured at the same time, the animals frequently died a few days
 after the operation, in consequence of rupture of the common bile
 duct and the escape of bile into the peritoneal cavity inducing fatal
 peritonitis.
     The experiments were conducted as follows :—After being operated
 upon, each dog was kept separately in a place suitably arranged for
 collecting its urine, which was daily examined for bile pigment by
 Gmelin’s test, and for bile acid (after being treated according to
 Hoppe Seyler’s method) by von Udranszky’s test.                After the death
 of  the animal the bile in the gall bladder was analysed.             The portal
 blood-vessels   were   injected,  and,   although    the bile  capillaries  were
 greatly distended,    all attempts    made   to inject them  proved   unsuccess
ful.   In order to ascertain           the thoracic duct had been properly
                                           if
ligatured it was carefully
                                  examined, and then injected with Berlin

     By careful post-mortem examination it was ascertained that in every
case      in which bile appeared in the urine, after ligaturing the thoracic
duct, the         bile had reached             the general circulation by the development
of    collateral lymphatic               vessels.    These were found to leave the thoracic
duct at a          point under the <U+FB01>rst rib and proceed from thence to join the
right innominate vein. The only other occasions on which bile was
found in the urine, after ligature of the thoracic duct, were in those
cases where rupture of the bile duct occurred, and allowed its contents
 to escape into the peritoneal cavity.
      In every case examined, not only was bile pigment, but also bile
acid, found in the lymph of the dilated thoracic duct.
       Tiedemann and Gmelinj" Fleischl,1' and KunkelI had already
 pointed out that when the ductus choledochus is ligatured and the
 lymph collected from the thoracic duct it is rich both in bile pigment
 and bile acid, whereas the blood remains entirely free from bile.
       The analyses of the bile taken from the gall-bladders of the dogs
 in which a communication between the thoracic ducts and the right
 innominate vein had been established by the development of collateral
 lymphatic vessels, thereby permitting bile to reach the general cir
 culation, showed that, in these instances, the bile neither contained
 an increased quantity of soluble substances nor of taurocholate of
 soda, but merely an excessive amount of mucin.
       The following table contains the results obtained from the analyses
  of bile taken from the gall bladders of four of the dogs operated upon,
  and of two other healthy dogs.                       The amount of taurocholate of soda
  was calculated            from       the    quantity of sulphur found in an absolute
  alcohol extract of the dried residue left after the removal of mucin,
  and other substances soluble in ether (cholesterin, fat, and lecithin).

days   after ligaturing the ducts (Experiments 1, 2, 5, &c.), the bile
ducts were found so greatly increased in size that on making a section
of the liver, even the so-called bile capillaries could be seen by the
naked eye without the aid of injection.            In all caSes where the blood
vessels were <U+FB01>lled with injection, and the liver hardened in a solution
of bichromate of potassium, free spaces were found between the
blood capillaries and the liver cells. These appeared to be the peri
vascular lymph spaces of MacGillavry* and Budge.1-                    The enlarge
ment of the perivascular lymph spaces seem to have taken place at
the cost of the liver cells, for not only did the cells themselves
appear to be much smaller, but the nuclei of the neighbouring
hepatic cells appeared to be closer together than normal.
   Three conclusions may apparently be drawn from the results ob
tained from these experiments :—
   Firstly. That bile existing in the bile ducts can only reach the
blood through the intervention of the lymphatics.
   Secondly. Seeing that lymphatics surround the liver blood vessels,
one is forced to believe that bile pigment and bile acid cannot pass
through the endothelium of the blood capillaries in the liver; or,
perhaps, even throughout the body.            The fact that bile reaches the
blood when it has escaped into the peritoneal cavity is no argument
against this view. For in that case it would reach the blood through
the lymphatics of the diaphragm.
   Thirdly. After the left thoracic duct has been ligatured for some
time, collateral lymphatics are opened up, or developed, leading into
the right innominate vein.

    The Sauropterygia. and Ichthyosauria having formerly been com
biued in the group termed Nexipoda or Enaliosauria, it has been
rather assumed than proved that the bones which form the shoulder
girdle in those orders are homologous.                    The Ichthyosaurian shoulder
girdle     was    well  <U+FB01>gured     by   Sir  E.   Home    (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1818, Part I)
and Cuvier (‘ Oss.          Foss.,’    Pl.  258). Figures by other authors agree
 substantially       Huxley, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ p. 2441) in showing
 (1)   that    the  coracoids      meet ventrally in the median line; (2) that
 there is a notch on the anterior margin of the coracoid between the
 median anterior cartilaginous border of the bone and. the scapula and                    .
 this notch varies in depth and width with the species; (3) the
 scapula is directed outward, upward, and forward; (4) its articular
 end has a posterior part which contributes with the coracoid to form
 the glenoid cavity for the head of the humerus, a median part, which
 articulates with the anterior articular edge of the coracoid, and an
 anterior surface, which does not differ in its cartilaginous articular
 aspect or thickness from the middle portion, but which looks inward
  without any bony element of the shoulder girdle to articulate with it.
  This condition has not been explained.                                  I

120             Prof. H. G. Seeley.             The Shoulder Girdle
leads me to doubt the substantial accuracy of the early interpretations
of Home, Buckland, and Cuvier, in regarding the scapula as extend
ing an articular surface inward and forward towards the pro-articular
portion of the coracoid.            Various circumstances lead me to suggest
that the notch on the anterior margin of the coracoid is a portion of
the precoracoid foramen; that the precoracoid element                            of the
shoulder girdle        was   cartilaginous      in Ichthyosaurus;      and    that    this
cartilage usually articulated with the part of the scapula anterior to
the external articulation of the coracoid, and also with the anterior
inner processes of the coracoids, so as to complete the precoracoid
foramen anteriorly.           Among the reasons which suggest this inter
pretation    are:   (1)  It  accounts     for the structure of the shoulder girdle,
and explains its homology; (2) it brings the shoulder girdle of
Ichthyosau'rus into harmony with Nothosaurus, in which there is a
similarly incomplete (preeoracoid) foramen and similar cartilaginous
surfaces of coracoid and scapula in close juxtaposition ; (3) it brings
the shoulder girdle of Ichthyosaurus into harmony with that of the
 Anomodontia, because they correspond in the form of the scapulee,
the positions and forms of the clavicles, interclavicles, and coracoids ;
so that, if the Anomodont precoracoid were unossi<U+FB01>ed, the differences
from Ichthyosaurus would be small, except that some of the Anom
 odonts (Pareiasaurus) develop an epiclavicle of Labyrinthodont type.
 On this evidence a cartilaginous precoracoid is shown in the restora
 tion now given.

    Before the Enaliosauria were subdivided, the bone which is here
 named interclavicle was regarded by Sir E. Home as homologous
  with the interclavicle of Ornithorhynchus, but it is named episternum
 by Cuvier, Sir R. Owen, and some recent writers like K. von Zittel.
 To the best of my belief the episternum was identi<U+FB01>ed as being the
 interclavicle by Professor Huxley.               My own earliest use of the term
 in relation to Ichthyosau'rus        is in  1869 (‘ Index to Fossil Remains, 850,,
 Woodw. Museum’).              If the ossi<U+FB01>cations are membrane bones, they
 are rightly classed as clavicles ; if they are cartilage bones, they may
 be connected with the sternum, and take a sternal name.                        Each of

                       and Clavz'cular

 these three bones terminates in a sharp edge or point, and no one of
 them shows a   terminal surface which has the aspect of being carti
 laginous; there is therefore no evidence of a cartilaginous origin,
 while the mutual relations of the bones and their forms
                                                               closely                                _
 parallel the clavicles in Chelonians and some Lacertilians; they are
therefore    identi<U+FB01>ed with those          elements)“ because there is no ground
for    regarding them as parts of          the sternum.
                                  § 2.   In Sauropterygia.
  The nomenclature of the bones of the shoulder girdle in the Sauro
pterygia. has given rise to greater diiTerences of opinion.‘|'  The
Amphibian mode of ossi<U+FB01>cation of the long bones by long conical
cpiphysesx connected by a dice-box shaped shaft, coupled with a
general resemblance of the pelvis and shoulder girdle to those of
Chelonians, led to the conclusion that, while the scapula, precoracoid,
and coracoid are all separate from each other in some existing Amphi
bians, the Amphibian plan had been modi<U+FB01>ed in the Chelonia by the
scapula and precoracoid remaining undivided, while in the Sauro
pterygia the coracoid and precoracoid remained in primitive undivided
condition.     The strongest argument against this is the absence
of a recognisable coracoid foramen in Sauropterygia in the cora
coid b0ne,§ which, when present, may be supposed always to occur
at the junction of the coracoid and precoracoid elements.          At the
same time     the  clavicles were recognised in the Sanropterygia as
distinct lateral ossi<U+FB01>cations, placed at the sides of the interclavicle,
and closely united with it by suture in some species of Ples'iosaums.
    The dif<U+FB01>culty with the scapular arch is in the theoretical pos—
tulates concerning the elements of which its several parts consist.
 Sir R. Owen (‘ Brit. Assoc. Rep,’ 1839, p. 56) used the Chelonian

122            Prof. H. G. Seeley.     The Shoulder Girdle
are   similarly situate in both ordinal types, and similar in having a
scapular portion which extends vertically, and a precoracoid portion
which extends inward horizontally to the median line. On the other
 hand, there is no close resemblance between these Orders in the
 bones in question.     (1.) The coracoids are dissimilar in form, and are
diiferently   conditioned,  for they do not meet in the median line in
 any  Chelonian,  while there is no Sauropterygian in which they have
 not a mesial union.              In Mr. Hulke’s <U+FB01>gures it is only the
 anterior portion of the ventral plate of the scapula which is lettered
 as precoracoid.     Thus the precoracoid does not enter into the humeral
articulation, or hold any position which theoretically can be com
 pared with the bone in Chelonia ; while the clavicular arch is anterior
 to the supposed precoracoid in Sauropterygians, but holds no com
 parable relation in Chelonians.     This latter dif<U+FB01>culty apparently led
 Mr. Hulke to regard the bones termed clavicular as omosternal in
 Sauropterygia.       But no Chelonian possesses an omosternum; so
 that, if the identi<U+FB01>cation were demonstrated, it does not support the
 Chelonian hypothesis of the shoulder girdle.
    First, it may be observed that it is only in Anura that the precora
coid enters the anterior margin of the glenoid cavity; but in Urodela
the precoracoid appears to be excluded, so that it is not theoretically
impossible on an Amphibian hypothesis for the precoracoid to be
anterior to the acetabulum ; but the bone is always wedged between
the scapula and coracoid, and on the coracoid border the coracoid
foramen is always persistent, so that there is no analogy between
Urodele and Sauropterygian to sustain the identi<U+FB01>cation of the pre
coracoid which has been offered.        Whenever two divergent bones
form the scapular arch those two bones are the coracoid and scapula;
but there is no analogy to support the hypothesis that the precoracoid
might form the free extremity of the scapula, as in Mr. Hulke’s <U+FB01>gure
(loo.         There is no conclusive evidence of the mutual relations of
the scapulo-precoracoid to the glenoid cavity in the Chelonia, but,
unless it could be shown that the relations of these bones to the
shoulder girdle were the same in both types, Chelonian analogy with
Sauropterygia in this part of the skeleton rests upon an inconclusive
basis of fact.    In Chelonians the ascending process of the scapula
extends dorsally towards the vertebrae, while in Sauropterygia it
extends backward above the glenoid articulation for the humerus,
and there is no evidence that these structures are homologous.
   If the evidence is insuf<U+FB01>cient to sustain the interpretation discussed,
it is found that the precoracoid has disappeared as a separate element
from the skeleton in Lacertilia, and in most existing Ornithomorpha
(‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 49, p. 520). It is recognised in association
with the coracoid in certain Birds; and the persistence of the coracoid
foramen gives some evidence that the precoracoid is not unrepre

                      and Clavicular    Arch in Sau-ropterygia.                    123
   sented on the scapular side of the foramen in all members of that
   class except the Ornithosauria.        Its individuality is retained in some
   of the Sauromorpha; and, although they have no distinct osseous
   representative of the bone, the nearest analogy to the shoulder girdle
   in Sauropterygia is found among Nothosauria; and there is no doubt
   that these resemblances and those with Anomodonts are closer than
   with existing orders of animals.
       The Nothosaurian shoulder girdle contains the same number of
    constituent elements as in Sauropterygians, and the same nomencla
    ture has been applied to them. There are some slight dilferences in
    the coracoid.    In the N othosauria it lies more obviously behind the
    glenoid cavity, while in many Plesiosaurs, especially the typical forms
   from the Lias, it also has a considerable median anterior extension.
    Further, in Nothosaurs there is a notch in the anterior margin of
    the coracoid, already contrasted with the similar notch in the coracoid
    of Ichthyosaurs, anterior to which are rough cartilaginous surfaces of
    scapula and coracoid, which have the aspect of having supported a
    cartilage which completed the coracoid foramen. There is no anterior
    prolongation of the scapula in Nothosau'rus such as is seen in Ples'io
    saurus, but the clavicles are much elongated.          They form a squamous
    overlap on the visceral surface of the scapula, according to von
    Meyer, and their length, and prolongation forward, removes the
    interclavicle from contact with the coracoids. If the suggested pre
    coracoid cartilage in Nothosaums existed, it makes the nature of
    both coracoid and scapula clearer in Plesiosaums, and shows that the
    precoracoid need not be displaced into the position here assigned to
   the clavicle.
       First,  the foramen which appears to be indicated in the anterior
   margin     of  the coracoid in some species of Ichthyosaurus as a deep
   narrow    notch,  in other species widens to a concave anterior border to
   the bone ; and similarly, in the specimen <U+FB01>gured by Deecke as Lar'io
  saurus Balsami, there is no trace of the anterior notch in the coracoid
  such as characterises Nothosaurus, but that bone has a smooth sharp
  anterior concave border        such as the bone     shows    in Plesiosaums. It
  would therefore seem to follow that the precoracoid foramen of Notho
  saurus becomes the coraco-scapular foramen of Ples'iosaurus, and that
 the precoracoid in Elasmosaurs ceases to exist as a distinct cartilage.
 It cannot be inferred to be lost by connation with the coracoid, because
 the foramen might then be supposed to persist, but, as there is no
 foramen in either the scapula or coracoid<U+FB01>“ there is no evidence of the
composite nature of either bone in Plesiosau'rus. Nevertheless, since the
precoracoids meet in the median line in many Amphibians, and in
Chelonjans, and the scapulae never have a median ventral union, there
is an a prim"; probability
                                    that bones formed from cartilage, placed
      * Always subject    to the doubtful evidence of the Brit. Mus. fossil 2041*.

124             Prof. H. G. Seeley.              The Shoulder Girdle
anterior to the coracoids, meeting in the median line, should rather be
precoraooids than scapulse in such Sauropterygia as show these charac
ters.    It has already been shown to be probable that the foramen
anterior to the coracoid is the precoracoid foramen, having under
gone such an enlargement in transition from Nothosauras to .Plesio
warm as does the obturator foramen between the pubis and ischium
in transition from the pelvis of Dicynodon to the pelvis of a Mammal.
Therefore the precoracoids may have ceased to be differentiated, even
as separate cartilages, and the coracoids may have grown forward at
the expense of this cartilage, just as the scapulae extended inward and
backward at its expense; so that, while the scapulee are conveniently
so named, it may be recognised that in Elasmosaurus,      Oolymbosau/rus,
erwnosau'rus, and their allies. the parts of the bone which meet in
the median line, and are in median contact with the clavicular arch,
are theoretically in the position of precoracoid elements, which con
nect the scapulee with the coracoids.       But since the Plesiosauridae
show no such median union of scapular elements, or ossi<U+FB01>cations in
front of the coracoids, it follows that there is no evidence that the
precoracoid was ossi<U+FB01>ed at all, while the cartilage representing                       it,
                                                                                         if
present, must have been a slender bar, comparable to the suggested
precoracoid cartilage in Ichthyosaurus, as shown by the absence of a
thick cartilaginous truncation of the anterior median termination of
the coracoids in Plesiosaurus.
    In the Anomodontia the plan of development of the shoulder girdle
has been modi<U+FB01>ed by the great extension of the clavicular arch ont
ward and upward, so that the scapulaa are rather on the type of the
Ichthyosauria than of the Sauropterygia.          But the position and
relations of the Anomodont precoracoid furnish some support to the
interpretation given to the element in Ichthyosauria and Sauro
pterygia; because,        the precoracoid foramen in Anomodonts were
                          if
theoretically enlarged to the dimensions seen in Colymbosaums, Ple
siosaarus, or Lariosaurus,     would be manifest that for so long as it
                                   it
connected the scapula and coracoid       was Elasmosaurian; so long as
                                                 it
it  remained attached to the extremity of the scapula only      would be       it
 Plesiosaurian; and so long as        remnant remained of cartilage in
                                             a
contact with the inner border of the clavicle the condition would be
 Lariosaurian.
    There  is thus a fundamental di<U+FB01>erence of plan between the imper
forate coracoid of Sauromorpha and the perforate coracoid of Ornitho
 morpha, which depends upon the way in which the precoracoid bone
 loses its individuality.
          §    3.   Nomenclature      of   the Bones   in   the   Glacicular Arch.
     Early writers regarded        the median bone anterior to the coracoids             in
Plesiosaarus        as the sternum.     Sir R. Owen         named    it   epistemum.   Pro

                    and Clam'cular Arch in Sauropterygia.                        125
 fessor  Huxley regarded it as interclavicle and clavicles (‘ Anatomy of
 Vertebrated Animals,’ 18741, p. 210). In 1874 I <U+FB01>gured the clavicles
 as posterior to the interclavicle in Plest'osaurus Hawkinsi, and drew
 attention to the similar condition in Pl. laticeps (‘ Geol. Soc. Quart.
 Journ.,’ 18741, p. 444:, since <U+FB01>gured by Zittel). Mr. Hulke, in 1883
 (“ Presidential Address, Geol. Soc.,” p. 20), regards these ossi<U+FB01>cations
 as indivisible, and names the mass omosternnm, thus reverting to the
 hypothesis that the ossi<U+FB01>cations have a cartilaginous origin, and are
 episternal.      It follows from Mr. Hulke’s views that the reputed
  clavicles of Nothosa'u/rus are precoracoid, and the median bone between
  them is the omosternum.
     The late Professor W. K. Parker fully discussed the omosternnm
  in the Vertebrata.        It is found in Mammals and in Anura, but is
  not present in all Anura, and is not always ossi<U+FB01>ed.               In the genus
  Galamites it appears to extend slightly on the visceral surface of
  the precoracoids.       In the Amphibian group which it characterises
  clavicles are probably not found, so that it is in place of an inter
  clavicle, if it does not represent it. It is sometimes single, sometimes
  paired, but never tripartite, as the median bone among Sauroptery
  gians. Among Mammals Mr. Parker found the omosternnm (paired)
  uniting with the sternum, while laterally it is continued by the
  clavicles, though there is a pair of small cartilages, termed pre
  coracoids, between it and those elements of the skeleton.                   In the
  Monotremata the interclavicle is in the position of the omosternnm.
   In Anguis fragilis Mr. W. K. Parker <U+FB01>gures both interclavicle and
  clavicles, but there is no omosternnm. The omosternnm behaves
  as though it were the name given to the interclavicle when that
  element ossi<U+FB01>es from cartilage.
     A sternum is developed in every existing animal in which the
 omosternnm is present, but in no Sauropterygian is there ever any
 trace of a sternum, so that there is nothing to suggest an omosternnm.
 The omosternnm has not been recognised in any existing order of
 Reptiles, and the Sauropterygia is the only fossil type except the
 Nothosauria in which it has been supposed to be found. That sug
gestion appears to rest upon the fact that the omosternnm is found
anterior to the precoracoids in certain existing Amphibia.                  There is
the circumstance        that  the bones  in Ples'iosau'rus  extend  on  the  visceral
surfaces of    the    scapulae  and  coracoids,   while   the clavicles  in Ichthyo
saurus are on the anterior and ventral surfaces of the same bones; but
no animal is known in which the omosternnm is developed in the
                            which has been so named in Plesiosaurus, and, so
position of the bone
far 33 position     goes,  there  is no evidence known to me which suggests
that the bones       in  question    should be omosternal rather than clavi
cnlar.                                                           _

 clavicles in all animals in which they are found.
    It has never been shown thatXany one of the bones in question in
 Ples'losaurus retains a surface which has the aspect of having been
 cartilaginous.      On the contrary, every specimen which           I  have ex
 amined is more or less thin and squamous, with contours completely
 ossi<U+FB01>ed to sharp edges, even in the most immature specimens; while the
 interclavicle, when preserved, unites with the clavicles either by a thin
 squamous overlap or by sagittal sutures.           This condition seems to me
to demonstrate that the bones are membrane                 bones.    I submit it
follows that they are clavicles, and therefore that the visceral position
of the clavicular arch, although anomalous, is not inconsistent with
clavicular homology. Bone for bone, the three clavicles in Plest'o
saw-us seem to me to correspond to those of Ichthyosaurus and Notho
saurus.      In the former their union is usually squamous, in the latter
it is sutural. In Sauropterygia both conditions are found. The
proposal made to identify the three anterior bones in the shoulder
girdle in Nothosaurus as omosternum and precoracoids introduces the
precoracoid as a distinct bone,* which is not known to be paralleled
in any allied group of animals except the Anodomontia, in which
there is no omosternum, and where the precoracoids are differently
conditioned, being in the closest union with the coracoids, with a
well-developed clavicular arch. But when the supposed precoracoids
of Nothosaur'us are recognised as clavicles, which rest by squamous
overlap on the visceral surfaces of the scapulae, like the clavicles of
Plesiosaurus,     the clavicular arch is in harmony with that of the
 Sauropterygia, and the supposed differences in its composition dis
appear.
    There are two family types in the Sauropterygia de<U+FB01>ned by_ differ

characterise them have not been fully set forth.
   II.  FURTHER     EVIDENCE   OF THE NATURE        or THE CLAVICULAR ARCH
                             IN THE PLESIOSAURIDE.
                     § 1. Nature and  Limits of     the Family.
    There are four principal genera of Plesiosauridaa, which are named
Plesiosaurus,     Eretmosaurus,    Rhomaleosaurus,      and Pliosaurus.      The
family is characterised by the cervical ribs being attached to the
vertebrae by more or less completely-de<U+FB01>ned double facets and by the
scapula: being separated in the median line by the clavicular arch, by
                                 ' Hulke, lac. cit.

                    and Clacicular Arc/L in Sauropterygia.                       127
     which   they are braced to the coracoids.            In the British Museum
    Catalogue (‘ Fossil Rept. and Amph,’ Part II), the Plesiosauridae is
   made to also include the Elasmosauridw, and the genera are enume
   rated in the following order :——Ph'osaurus,             Peloneustes, Thaumato
   sa'u'rus, Polyptychodon, Oimoliosaurus,         Eret'mosaurus,  Plesiosaurus.   I
   should restrict the family to the fossils indicated by the names Plio
   sau'rus, Pelmw'ustes, Thaumatosau'rus, Eretmosaurus, and Plesiosaurus.
    Good skeletons of these genera are known with the exception of
    Thaumatosaurus, which was founded by von Meyer (‘ Palaeontograph
   ica,’ vol. 6) upon remains which closely resemble those of Pliosaurus.
   And, after examining the type specimens, which are imperfect
   cervical vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae, teeth, and portions of the hinder
   region of the maxillary bone,     I      was unable to discover any character
   inconsistent with reference of the species to Pliosaurus.               The head
   was evidently as large as in Pliosaurus ; the teeth are circular in the
   crown, and show no trace of the area more or less <U+FB02>attened and free from
   carination de<U+FB01>ned by a lateral ridge on each side which characterises
   the anterior teeth of Pliosaurus grandis, resembling in this respect the
   posterior teeth. In the late cervical vertebra <U+FB01>gured by von Meyer,
   the centrum has the same form and relative shortness from front to
   back as in Pliosau'rus; the articular facet for the rib is similarly
   elevated, has a like transverse division forming a superior sub<
   triangular part and an inferior transversely ovate part. The only
   characters in which there is not absolute agreement with the English
   species are that the articular faces of the centrums are more circular
   and more concave.          These differences may be of speci<U+FB01>c value; and
  von Meyer’s species may be classed as Pliosau'rus oolith'iaus, till it is
  fully known. For similar reasons        I     am unable to separate Pcloneustes
  from Plz‘osaurus.        And   if  the type species was originally referred to
 Plesiosaurus,* it was because I then regarded the subtriangular crowns
 of anterior teeth in Pliosam-us as a generic character, and that cha—
 racter now seems less important.                 It has been necessary thus to
 explain differences         of  nomenclature,      because the genus Thaumato
 saurus (‘ Brit. Mus. Cat.         Foss.   Rept.,’ Part II) has been made to in
 clude six species in addition to the type, which, with one exception,
are all from the Lias.           They were previously named Rhomaleosaurus
Cmmptone',       Ples'iosaurus     areaatus, P. megacephalus, P. earinatus, P.
propinguus,     .P. 'ind'icms.I     am unable to place any of these species in
Pliosaurus or         Thaumatosau'rus,       nor is there evidence that all are
referable to one genus;            and   it does not appear that a genus based
011 characters drawn
                              from this assemblage of species can displace the
de<U+FB01>nite conception of von Meyer indicated in the type of Thau'mato
swam;       Most of these species not included in Rhomaleosaurus appear
to   belong to Eretmosaum-s.

p. 159):                     consisting of a large single plate, much ex
panded transversely,     with a wide and shallow anterior notch”?        The
anterior margin of the interclavicle in this specimen resembles in
contour that attributed to Eretmosau'rus (‘ Geol. Soc. Quart. ourn.,’                      J
1874, p. 445) in its wide open curvature ; but there is no evidence to
show whether the shoulder girdle, pelvis, and limbs in Plesiosau'rus
arcuatu-s were constructed on the same plan as in Pl. rugosus.         There
is no doubt that the bone consists of three distinct elements united by
sutures.      These are a median interclavicle and two lateral bones
which     Iregard as clavicles. On the visceral aspect the triangular
clavicles are separated from each other by the wide short posterior
median bar of the interclavicle, but the clavicles extend forward so
that only a narrow transverse bar of the T-shaped interclavicle is
exposed in front of them, extending across the entire width of the
bone.     The interclavicle is 10} inches wide, concave on its anterior
margin, 1% inch from front to back at the widened extremities of the
cross-bar, and 1% inch in the same measurement towards the oblong
middle portion of the bone.        The right anterior transverse limb of
the cross-bar is 4 inches wide; the left limb is 3 inches wide.          The
middle portion of the bone is 3}; inches wide and                         232*

posterior measurement.        The sutural line which de<U+FB01>nes the inter
clavicle     sagittal,
              is       and consequently irregular.     On each side of this
T- shaped interclavicle (<U+FB01>g. 2), in contact with the posterior margin of
its transverse bar and the lateral margin of its short wide median stem,
is  a large triangular clavicle which     directed backward and outward.

and as they extend outward approximate toward the external          contour
of the bone without meeting it posteriorly in a point.
   The ventral aspect of the clavicular arch is different (<U+FB01>g. 3) owing to
variation in the positions of the sutures between the bones. The inter
clavicle no longer shows the T-shaped contour of the visceral surface,
but is a wide curved bar with an irregular sagittal termination on
its postero-lateral extremities. This is owing to the method of its
squamous interlocking with the clavicles, which overlap its visceral
surface more in front, and overlap its ventral surface more behind,
where their pointed extremities nearly meet each other in the median
line behind the interclavicle, and in the inch of space from which
they are absent there is a light distortion of the bone, and some
evidence of a median posterior notch.        The triangular forms of the
clavicles are more marked on this aspect of the bones than on the
other.
   The most remarkable character here shown is the squamous suture]
interlocking of the three bones by which their shares in forming
the clavicular arch is de<U+FB01>nitely established.        It is also shown by
diHerent directions of the lines of growth in the clavicles and inter
clavicles.
    An isolated clavicular arch in the British Museum, R. 1322,v
presents a similar character and. form, and shows in its sutures similar
evidence of composite character. It has been assigned to the species
named Plesiosau/rus megacephalus (Stutchbury) in the British Mueum
 Catalogue. It has a similar resemblance to the anterior contour of
 the interclavicle in Eretmosawus, but I am aware of no evidence by
 which the species is identi<U+FB01>ed from this bone, beyond a general
 resemblance to some specimens in the Bristol Museum.
    The correspondence     of structure in these clavicular arches with
 that <U+FB01>gured in Ples'iosau/rus Hawkins'i and Plesiosau'rus laticeps is a
 coincidence of plan, though the di<U+FB02>erence may indicate a sub-genus,
 and shows,    I submit, that the original de<U+FB01>nition of the bones was not
 a conjectural suggestion, as stated by Professor Sollas, but a recog
 nition of sutures which separate the interclavicle from the clavicles.
 And it seems to me a sound induction that whenever the margins of
 the clavicular arch are concave in front and behind, those concavities
 border the interclavicle, and whenever there are wings produced out
 ward and backward, as in the specimen now <U+FB01>gured, those wings are
 formed by the clavicles in all Plesiosauridae.
    (ii) Sir R. Owen, in 1841 (‘ Brit. Assoc. Rep.,’ p. 64), remarks on
 the shoulder girdle of Pliosa'un'us :———“The pectoral arch owes its chief
 strength to a pair of immensely expanded coracoids, having a broad
 and short entosternal bone on their anterior interspace, and support
 ing the clavicles or aeromion productions of the scapulee.”*          Subse
    * I have examined the specimens in the Museum of the University of Oxford

                     and Clarieular Arch in Sauropterygia.                            131
quently (‘ Geol. Soc. Quart. Journ.,’ 1883, p. 135) a diagram of the
shoulder girdle in this genus was given by that author, which represents
the scapula and coracoid as meeting each other on the Elasmosaurian
plan   ;  but, unlike Elasmosaurians, the          scapulae are divided from each
other on the visceral aspect by a long triangular interclavicle (named
episternnm) which shows a mesial notch in front.                   I have not seen this
specimen, which is not assigned to any species, locality, or collection.
It would appear to show an intermediate condition between Plesiosaurs
and Elasmosanrs, but it is impossible for me at present to af<U+FB01>rm this.
No specimen is known to me which shows that in Pliosaurus the
                   MiL//
scapula and coracoid completely enclose the coracoid foramina. The
evidence is imperfect, but it leads to the conclusion that the shoulder
girdle was Plesiosaurian in plan.

  132            Prof. H. G. Seeley.        The Shoulder Girdle
  which is triangular, <U+FB02>at, very thin, and has perfectly straight sides,
  which, in their hinder approximating two-thirds, are slighly bevelled.
  There is no evidence given that the bone occupied the position which
  has been <U+FB01>gured, and       I  see no reason for believing that it was not
  placed, as in other Sauropterygians, on the visceral surface of the
  slightly inclined scapulee, where there is a doubtful indication of
  what may be an imperfectly preserved right clavicle. 1f the straight
  lateral border of the interclavicle was in contact with the <U+FB02>at visceral
  surface of the scapula, the bones would be in harmonious relation.
  The bevelled margin appears to look inward, and is therefore inferred
  to have given attachment to a lateral ossi<U+FB01>cation which was still
  more delicately thin.        This condition is shown in the following
  <U+FB01>gure of the bone.
      (iii) A third modi<U+FB01>cation of the Plesiosauriau type may be* in
  dicated by the specimen in the Leeds Collection in the British
  Museum numbered 36.            It is small, and the bones are not sharply
  ossi<U+FB01>ed and     immature,    as  Mr. Leeds has always believed.           But    I
  have not observed any specimen in his collection which would, with
  certainty, represent its adult state.           The bones of the shoulder
  girdle are thick, and the scapula and coracoid are formed on the
  Plesiosauriau type, in that the inner border of the scapula gives no
  evidence of a median precoracoid prolongation backward to meet the
  coracoid.     There is no indication that the coracoids and scapqu
  ever met in the median line, even in the supposed adult condition,
  since there is no anterior median process to the coracoid; but there is a
  cartilaginous interval between them in front like that attributed to
  Pliosaurus. The scapula is a stout triradiate bone with a wide external
  process, and in form it resembles the bones attributed to Pliosaurus.
  But the cervical vertebrae have no trace of the Pliosaurian modi<U+FB01>ca
  tion, and have the aspect of the vertebrae of Plesiosaurus, except that
  the articulation for the rib is not divided in the cervical region. Some
  Plesiosaurs from the Lias have shown the closest possible approxima
  tion of those surfaces, but the divided. condition of the rib facet did not
  terminate with the Lias species, since some specimens from the Wealden
  (which are referred to Oimoliosaur'us, ‘Brit. Mus. Cat. Foss. Rept.,’
  Part II, p. 227, No. 2,444, No. 26,000) retain the character in a condition
  similar to that attributed to Thaumatosaurus carinatus (loo. cit, p. 168,
  <U+FB01>g. 57).    It may be that the imperfect ossi<U+FB01>cation causes the facet of
  bone to appear single in this Oxford Clay fossil, while its cartilaginous
  terminations during life may have been divided; but so far as the
  evidence goes it rather suggests a sub-generic modi<U+FB01>cation of the
_ genus Plesiosaurus as indicated by the scapular arch, distinguished by
  undivided articular heads to the cervical ribs, if the adult preserved
     * I  am not sure that this immature   Plesiosauriau type did not, on attaining
  maturity, become the Elasmosaurian  genus Cryploclidus.

 the  characters of the young animal. This inference is supported by
 the  evidence of the clavicular arch, and by the large size of the
radius and tibia as compared with the small size of the ulna and
<U+FB01>bula.     These bones are not in natural association, being free from
matrix; but      I   see no reason to doubt that Mr. Leeds has arranged
them in positions which are correct.              The characters of the skeleton
lead to the conclusion that the species is new, and could not become
transformed by growth and perfected ossi<U+FB01>cation into any other
known species.
   The following are measurements which help to de<U+FB01>ne the species :—
Lower jaw, 9 inches. Verteme column, as preserved and arranged,
64  inches.   Thirty    cervical vertebrae, 23 inches; two pectoral vertebrae
supporting ribs on the neural arch and centrum, 1% inch. Twenty
two dorsal vertebrae measure 22 inches; three vertebrae in the sacral
region, which support ribs, partly on the neural arch and partly
on the centrum, 2} inches.              Twenty-two caudal vertebrae measure
15 inches, but     the   extremity     of  the tail is not preserved.       The height
of the dorsal vetebree and neural arch is about 2% inches.                   The trans
verse measurement           over the transverse processes              of the dorsal
vertebrae is 41- inches.             The longest dorsal ribs measure about
9 inches.    The    ilium   is  4  inches   long. The transverse width over the
pelvic articulation is 7% inches.             The antero-posterior extent of the
pelvis is 9 inches.        The pubis measures 41% inches from front to
back.    The ischium is 3% inches in the same measurement toward the
median line.      The pelvic foramina were separated from each other by
cartilage.    The femur is 8 inches long and 41 inches wide. The
coracoid is 7 inches long by 414- inches wide; the scapula is 4;} inches
in length and width.           These shoulder girdle bones are exceptionally
thick.    The transverse width over the two clavicles is 7} inches.
   The clavicles are thin triangular bones, perfectly ossi<U+FB01>ed, with
sharp well-de<U+FB01>ned margins and no signs of immaturity, probably
because they are membrane bones.                 If they met each other in the

 median line it can only have been by squamous approximation.       Thus
 arranged they would be inclined to each other. As preserved, each
 clavicle is about 4 inches wide; and on its inner border measures
 2% inches from front to back, and at the external angle the corre
 sponding measurement        is g of an inch. The anterior border is
 straight; the inner border is sinuous and unsymmetrical on the
 opposite sides; the posterior border is 31.; inches long and concave,
 with the concavity broken on the inner third by a sharp prominence
 which separates a slight inner concavity from the longer external
 concavity.
    The external extremities of the bones are truncated and striated.
    The only specimen which distantly approximates to this in the
 large size of the radius as compared with the small ulua is an
 Elasmosaurian indicated in the Leeds Collection by the number 31.
 In that also there is no trace of an interclavicle, but the shoulder
 girdle is not perfectly preserved, and its clavicles are of dissimilar
 form. If the scapulaa in mature individuals of this species united in
 the median line and extended back to the coracoids, then the fossil
 would be Elasmosaurian, and possibly a species of Cryptoclidus.
           III.  THE CLAVICULAR ARCH IN THE ELASMOSAURIDE.
                 § 1. The Nature and   Limits of the Family.
    When the Elasmosauridae was de<U+FB01>ned in 1874 its clavicular arch
 was unknown       and supposed to be wanting, and the family was
 based upon the circumstance that the bones named scapula; met
 each other in the median line, and were prolonged backward to unite
with the median processes of the coracoids in Elasmosau'rus and
 Colymbosaurus.      I owe a knowledge of the clavicular arch in this
family to A. N. Leeds, Esq., of Eyebury, who for twenty years has
collected the fossil Vertebrata from the Oxford Clay near Peter
borough. In this family the cervical vertebrae have the ribs attached
by undivided articular heads.       The carpal and tarsal bones are poly
gonal and well ossi<U+FB01>ed.      The genera on which the family is based
are Elasmosaums, Colymbosam-us,          and Murwnosau'rus (‘ Geol. Soc.
Quart.   J ourn.,’ 1874', p. 436), none  of which appear in the ‘ British
Museum Catalogue of Fossil Reptiles,’ Part II. The only genera in
that enumeration which could be so referred are Polyptychodon and
Gimoliosaurus. Excepting Polyptychodon only, all English as well as
all American Elasmosaurians have been referred to the latter genus
in the Catalogue referred to. Hence, as it will be presently shown
that the Elasmosauridae        develop remarkable modi<U+FB01>cations of the
clavicular arch, which may be regarded as of generic importance, it
is convenient to determine as far as possible the synonymy of the
genera comprised in the family.

                     and Clavicular Arc]: in Sauropterygia.                      135
      The genus C'imoliosaurus <U+FB01>gured by the late Dr. Leidy in 1865
  (‘Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge ’) rests upon thirteen
  centrums of vertebrae without arches or processes, noticeable chie<U+FB02>y
  for their transverse width.           Fourteen other vertebrae from the
   Greensand of New Jersey are described; but there is no evidence of
  any other part of the skeleton.          Leidy expressed doubt whether his
   genus Discosaurus might not prove to be founded on vertebra of
   C'imoliosam'us. This view was adopted by Professor Cope (‘Amen
   Phil. Soc. Trans.,’ vol. 14), but that identi<U+FB01>cation only contributed a
   knowledge of the carpal and metacarpal bones. Hence the characters
   by which the genus is de<U+FB01>ned in the British Museum Catalogue
                                                  ‘                                  ’
    are not drawn from Leidy’s type.
      The generic characters of U'imoliosaurus which may be obtained
   from Leidy’s <U+FB01>gures are: Articular face of the centrum <U+FB02>at or
    <U+FB02>attened, short from front to back, transversely extended in the
    cervical region.    The neural arch is small, with compressed lamellar
    neurapophyses,    which    appear to be anchylosed to the centrum. The
    facet for the cervical rib is single, at <U+FB01>rst compressed from above down
    ward, afterwards becoming ovate; the facets are on short pedicles.
    The chevron articulations impress both the anterior and posterior
   margins of the short centrums in the middle of the caudal series. The
    carpals are transversely oblong.       The metacarpals and phalanges are
   compressed from above downward.
       The name B'm'mosaums (Leidy, ‘Philadelphia Acad. Nat. Sci.
   Proc.,’ 1854, Pl. 2, p. 72), was proposed for Plesiosaurian vertebrae
   which have the ventral surface <U+FB02>at instead of concave, as in Cimolio
  saums; but, as the genus is not mentioned in that author’s
  ‘
     Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States,’ 1865, it may be regarded
  as probably abandoned and included in O'imoliosa'wrus.
      Dr. Leidy also proposed a genus Oligosimus (‘ Philad. Acad. Nat.
  Sci. Proc.,’ 1872, p. 39). It is un<U+FB01>gured and based upon an early
  caudal vertebra.       It has the neural arch anchylosed to the centrum.
  A groove      de<U+FB01>nes   the  limit of the articular face of the centrum. The
 chevron facets only impress the posterior border of the centrum. Its
 measurements are: length, 1 inch; width, 2'3 inches; depth, 1'9
 inch.      These characters seem insuf<U+FB01>cient at present to distinguish
 the type as a genus.                                                p
     Professor    E.  D.   Cope    has  decribed     <U+FB01>ve   other   genera  which he

from Professor Cope’s <U+FB01>gures; neural arch depressed, with massive
 neurapophyses,    and small neural canal. These characters help to
 de<U+FB01>ne the genus from U'ronautes.     Phalanges remarkably short. The
author subsequently states (‘    Amer.  Naturalist,’ 1887, p. 5641) that in
 Polycotylus the neurapophyses and all diapophyses and parapophyses
 are co-ossi<U+FB01>ed   with the centra.
    In Piptomerus (‘ Amer. Naturalist,’   1887) the neurapophyses and all
 other processes of the vertebrae articulate freely with the centra.
 The cervical vertebrae are short, twice as wide as long, and deeper
 than long. The dorsal vertebrae are two-thirds as long as the cervi
 cals, deeper, and rather narrower.
    In Orophosaurus the neural arches are co-ossi<U+FB01>ed, and the par
 apophyses free.     The centrum is a little wider than deep.
    In Uronautes both neural arches and parapophyses are co-ossi<U+FB01>ed.
 All vertebrae are short, nearly twice as wide as long, as deep as wide,
 centrum biconcave, neurapophyses lamellar, neural canal large.
    In the American specimens referred to Ples'iosaums Professor Cope
 states that the neural arches of the vertebrae are loosely articulated.
    Until the American types are fully <U+FB01>gured it will not be possible to
 judge whether these genera are all founded on characters which will
 enable them to be recognised in adult individuals.
    In Elasmosa'm-us the characters given for the genus are: Neural
 arch anchylosed with the centrum ; cervical centrum longer than deep,
 deeper than wide ; ribs articulated to oval pits.    Vertebrae numerous.
 The dorsal vertebrae have strong transverse processes.       In the caudal
 vertebrae the articular chevron facets are said to be on the inferior
 face, near its posterior articular aspect.     This condition is not un
 known in early caudal vertebrae in English Sauropterygians from the
 Pelolithic strata, but no evidence has been given that it extends
 throughout the caudal series in any Sauropterygian species.            The
 scapular arch has the well-known form, with the scapulaa meeting in
 the median line, and continuous posteriorly with the coracoids, so as
 to enclose two large foramina between the bones.         The scapulo-pre
 coracoid appears to form about two-thirds of the wall of the glenoid
 cavity. No clavicle was found. The ilium appears to articulate with
 the pubis only.     No limb bone was found, nor any abdominal ribs.
    Professor Cope states that this genus is distinguished from Gimol'io
 sau'ms by the shortness of the neck in the latter, and its elongation
 in Elamosam'us. In Elasmosaurus the cervical centrum is transversely
 compressed, and comparatively long; while in Gimoliosaurus            it is
 short, broad, and vertically depressed.
    Finally, Mr. F. W. Cragin has described Trinacromer'wm. (‘Amen
-Geol.,’ vol. 2, p. 405, 1888, and vol. 7, September, 1891, p. 171) from     .

                     and Clacicular Arch in Sauropterygia.                        157
  given.     In it the ilium articulates with the ischium only, as in some
  species of .Mm-wnosaums from the English Oxford Clay (Leeds Collec
  tion, Brit. Mus).       The shoulder girdle is on the Elasmosaurian plan,
  enclosing two vacuities, but the structure of the glenoid cavity is
  distinctive. There are three bones in linear succession at the distal
  end of the humerus and femur. The tibia and <U+FB01>bula are transversely
  extended, and of oblong form, apparently resembling O'clymbosaums.
  The phalanges are unusually numerous.               The neural arch is anehy
  losed to the centrum.            The neural canal is large. The cervical
  vertebrae are sub-quadrate, depressed, and transversely wide. The
  dorsal centrum is sub-circular.             The articular faces are shallow
  concavities.
      The characters assigned to Polycotylus, Cimoliosaurus, Elasmo
   sau'rus, and Trinacromerum are such as enable the types to be recog
   nised; and, therefore, pending fuller information, it is convenient to
   adopt them as genera limited, so far as is at present known, to the
   Cretaceous period.        It is probable that all belong to the Elasmo
   sauridaa, but Elasmosaurus and Trinac'romerum are the only types in
   which the shoulder girdle is known.           The oblong form of the tibia in
   Trinacrome'rum and Polycotylus, and the transverse elongation of a
   carpal in GimoliOsaurus, make it probable that the middle segments
  of the limbs had the bones transversely elongated in all these genera.
  In none of them have clavicles as yet been recognised.
     Polyptychodon is probably to be included with these genera; but it
  is only known from teeth, cranial fragments, and vertebral centre,
  which do not differentiate the genus; though the cervical vertebrae
  (‘ Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.,’ vol. 32, p. 433) are relatively short and
  dee   .
     Tlhe Elasmosauridae       are well represented in the Cretaceous rocks of
 this   country.     Two    genera,    Mmoenosaurus and Colymbosaurus, have
 also been regarded        as   peculiar to the Oxford and Kimeridge Clays.
 These genem are best de<U+FB01>ned by the bones of the extremities.                      In
 both the bones of the shoulder girdle are essentially the same.
    In Murwnosaurus the cervical region is long. The zygapophysial
 facets have a cylindroid curve.          The articular faces of the centra are
 rather   wider than deep, though nearly circular             and biconcave.    The
 ulna   and radius are sub-quadrate. There is                no third bone   in  the
fore-arm.     The    phalanges      are stout and but    little  compressed.    The
shoulder-girdle      is on the Elasmosaurian type, with clavicles.              The
type  species  is M.   Leedsii.*

  ovate at <U+FB01>rst, but afterwards deeper.       The centrum is always wider
  than long, and has an oblique margin, which is absent in Cimolio
  saurus.    The humerus and femur are deeper than wide proximally.
  In  the   fore-arm there are three bones in a row, of which ulna and
  radius, like the tibia and <U+FB01>bula, are broader than long. There may
  sometimes be a fourth bone in this row (0. llIanselli, Hulke sp.).
  The phalanges are not compressed. The types are from the Kimeridge
  Clay, and include P. megadeirus and P. Manselli.
     These genera are distinguished by the extremities, though the
  vertebral articulation of the zygapophyses and many parts of the
  skeleton furnish diiferential characters.
     Both genera are de<U+FB01>ned from Polycotylus and Piptomerus by the
  length of the dorsal centrum. The bevelled or rounded margin to the
  articular face of the centrum separates them from Oimoliosaurus. The
  absence of side-to-side compression of the centrum distinguishes them
  from Elasmosaarus. And they are separated from Trinacromerum by the
  structure of the glenoid cavity for the humerus, and the small number
  of uncompressed phalanges in the digits. Hence, without disregard
  of generic characters, and the facts of stratigraphical distribution, it
  seems impossible to follow the British Museum Catalogue, which
  enlarges the genus Cimoliosauras to make it comprise all these
  Elasmosauridae.    And it will presently become evident that in Murceno
  saurus the diversity of modi<U+FB01>cation found in the clavicular arch is
  such as may de<U+FB01>ne sub-genera within its present limits.
     Notwithstanding the diverse aspects of the shoulder girdle in the
  Elasmosauridas and Plesiosanridaa, and the circumstance that inter
  mediate types are at present unknown, the di<U+FB01>erence between them
  is essentially in the fact that in all Elasmosaurians the supposed pre
  coracoid region is ossi<U+FB01>ed so as to come into median union with the
  coracoid by suture, and co-ossi<U+FB01>ed with the scapula so as apparently to
  be an inseparable part of that bone ; and it is these precoracoid portions
  of the scapulaa which alone meet each other in the median line, as do
  the precoracoid bones in Procolophon (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1889, B, Pl. 9,
  <U+FB01>g. 9). In all Plesiosaurians, on the other hand, the precoracoid, if
  developed, remains cartilaginous ; but I infer that a cartilage always
  extended from the anterior margin of the coracoid to the anterior
  extremity of the scapula, and by ossi<U+FB01>cation of such cartilage the
  Pleiosaurian shoulder girdle would become Elasmosaurian.
        § 2. The Clavicular Arch in the Elasmosaurians discovered by
                     Mr. A. N. Leeds in the Oxford O'lay,
     The clavicular bones may be placed anterior to the scapulo-precora
  coids, partly under them on their visceral surface, but they never
  extend back to meet the coracoid bones, as in Plesiosaurus.       Or they

 may be wedged in the fork between the anterior termination of the
scapula-precoracoid elements.             Or they may be entirely hidden from
view, and lie upon the visceral aspect of the scapulo-precoracoid
bones.         These specimens are all in the Leeds Collection in the British
Museum, or in that of Mr. A. N. Leeds at Eyebury.
    They appear to me to show three types of structure :—
    First, a clavicular arch formed of a large interclavicle with two
clavicles forming its lateral wings, joined by squamous overlap, and
not by suture.
    Secondly, species in which the interclavicle is a V-shaped triangle,
and    clavicles are doubtfully present.
    Thirdly, species in which two clavicles meet by median suture,
without any indication of an interclavicle.
    These modi<U+FB01>cations are such as might be expected to characterise
genera rather than species, and they are accompanied                  by diversities
in other parts of the skeleton.
FIG.   6.—Part of the shoulder girdle and clavicular arch of Murwnosaurus platyclis
             from a. drawing by Mr. A. N. Leeds, showing the position of the clavicular
             arch when found.     00, coracoid ; Sc, scapula; Intc., interclavicle and
             clavicles. The dark parts are missing. The light shading is a foramen.
    (i.)  In the <U+FB01>rst type the clavicular arch is formed substantially           on the
same plan as in the Lias genus Plesiosaurus,             except that the clavicles
rest upon the interclavicle by squamous overlap on its visceral surface,
and their posterior-lateral          prolongation is broken away.          Yet when
this surface is compared with that of Plesiosaurus             arcuatus an almost
 identical T_-shaped          con<U+FB01>guration of the interclavicle is exposed,
 while on the slightly convex ventral surface the clavicles are not
 seen    at   all in the specimen    as preserved.
    In the        skeleton   to which     this specimen belongs the shoulder
 girdle     is  perfectly   ossi<U+FB01>ed.    The   transverse measurement over the
 humeral articulations         is about    16  inches. The median processes of
  the coracoids are prolonged        far forward,   so as to make more than half

the inner borders of the   scapulo-coracoid vacuities.    They terminate
in transverse     sutures,  advance of which the scapulae extend for
                              in
8 inches, forming large wide <U+FB02>at plates, with oblique slightly con
cave anterior borders.    These scapulae meet in the usual way by a
 median suture for about 41 inches, anterior to which is a long median
vacuity or foramen, 315 inches long and more than 1 inch wide, with
 sub-parallel sides, which is bounded in front by a posterior concavity
in the interclavicle. A similar long median notch is seen between
 the scapulae in the Leeds Collection (Brit. Mus), No. 27, and in that
specimen there is a similar, though smaller, interclavicle, more imper
fectly preserved.
   The anterior transverse bar of the interclavicle now described is
de<U+FB01>ned by the clavicles which rest upon the bone.          It is 7 inches
wide. Owing to the contour of the clavicles, its lateral halves
increase in depth to about an inch as they extend outward.       The con
cave median notch in the anterior border is less than an inch wide.
It corresponds in form and size with the notch on the posterior border
of the bone, but is rather shallower. Between these opposite con
cavities which indent the interclavicle the antero-posterior measure
ment is    23}
             inches.  This median part of the bone, which forms the
wide longitudinal bar between the clavicles,         inches in transverse
                                                              is     2%
measurement anteriorly, but widens posteriorly to        inches.   Owing   4
to the way in which the lateral margins are concaver de<U+FB01>ned by
the overlapping clavicles, all the contours are somewhat unsym
metrical from distortion.
   The right and left bones are unequal in length as preserved: one

                   and Clavz'cular       Arch in Sauropterygia.                 141
measures     3 inches from front to hack, and the other an inch more.
Their internal borders are concave and sinuous, recalling the clavicles
of Plesiosaurus durobrivensis already described.  It is probable that
the   external           of the clavicles now broken away were directed
                 processes
outward and backward, and in form similar to that species.
         A   second Elasmosaurian clavicle, of diiferent shape appa
rently, is preserved in the skeleton N0. 23, in which 77 vertebrae
were found.      It has the vertebrae nearly <U+FB02>at at the articular ends,
with the transverse measurement and depth of the centrum similar.
Neither the neural arches nor cervical ribs are anchylosed, but both
have relatively deep attachments.
   In this species only one clavicle is preserved, but its form is per
fect.  One half of the other clavicle was found, but no trace of an
interclavicle, though         I
                           suppose both of these bones to have rested
upon the interclavicle, much as in the species just described.      The
                       4.~
bone is triradiate,    inches long and as wide. Its inner margin     the       is
shortest, and is concave and slightly irregular.      The superior and
                       FIG.   8.—Ola.vicle   of Murwnosau-rus    (sp.).
inferior processes are about twice as wide as the external process,
which is relatively long and slender.        The anterior margin          is
                                                                        concave.
What  I    suppose   to be  the  posterior    margin      also  concave,
                                                                is         but a
rounded prominence      occurs  on  its  inner  third, and  breaks  the  contour
into a long external curve and a small inner notch.
   The external termination           slightly widened and obliquely trun
                                       is
 cated, as though for attachment.

                                                    the imperfectly preserved
 ably of the same type, is represented by
 interclavicle in  the  skeleton   No.    26  in  the  Leeds Collection (Brit.
Mus).     The scapulae in this specimen are badly preserved, but they

142          Prof. H. G. Seeley.           The Shoulder Girdle
have the external ascending process elongated rather more than in
other specimens.
   The interclavicle appears to have been sub-reniform, but its margin
is imperfect all round. Its thin condition is more like that of a
clavicle. It is 4% inches wide, and 3% inches deep. It shows radiating
            FIG. 9.—Imperfect   interclavicle   of Murwnosaurus         (sp.).
lines of growth, and there are no indications of contact with other
elements of the clavicular arch. If the bone is correctly determined,
it shows an interesting modi<U+FB01>cation of the interclavicle.
   Oxford Clay Elasmosaurians show two types of variation from the
kind of clavicular arch now described. One consists in the approxi
mation of the clavicles, so that they articulate, and in this type there
is no evidence of an interclavicle. In the other modi<U+FB01>cation the inter
clavicle persists, wedged between the scapulae, and the clavicles are
probably not represented, or present as delicate <U+FB01>lms which have not
been perfectly preserved.
    (iv.) The type in which the clavicular arch reaches the smallest
dimensions known to me is in the private collection of Mr. A. N.
Leeds. Its remains compriSe the shoulder girdle, bones of the fore
limb, and some cervical vertebrae.       A vertebra which is from the
middle of the neck, and believed by Mr. Leeds to be about the 15th,
has the centrum transversely ovate, 1% inch wide,                 131
                                                           inch deep, and
1%   inch long.  The  articular face     slightly
                                         is       concave,  and margined
by a narrow border. The ribs and neural arch are anchylosed to the
centrum. The neural spine       is compressed and somewhat elongated,
rising 4% inches above the base of the centrum.
   The shoulder girdle   is  perfectly preserved.   The least transverse
measurement over the articular surfaces for the humerus             under        is

                   and C'Iavicular Arch in Sauropterygia.                        143

          clavicle. Scapulm slightly distorted at their union with anterior processes

10   inches.      The antero-posterior measurement of the coracoids is
11   inches in the median line, and that of the scapulae in the median
line is 3% inches. The scapulae are exceptionally slender, since the
least width from the concave lateral border to the foramen is 1% inch.
The least transverse width of the coracoids in the middle of their
concave sides is 6% inches. The transverse measurement                       of the
 scapulaa behind the ascending process is 91> inches.             The ossi<U+FB01>cation
between the anterior median margins of the scapulae is not complete,
 and as they extend outward they are convexly rounded.
    The interclavicle was found in situ, resting on the visceral surface in
 adepression between the anterior margins of the scapulae and not pro
jecting in advance of these bones. It is lanceolate in contour, 2% inches
 long, lg inches wide towards the slightly concave anterior margin, and
 half as wide at the rounded posterior extremity. It isalittle distorted,
 like the other bones of the shoulder girdle. has a <U+FB02>at visceral surface,
 and an angular ventral surface, due to the bone being traversed by
 an elevated median ridge, which dies away anteriorly, and from this
 ridge the lateral surfaces are inclined.              On the left side of the
 ventral surface its middle part is covered by a thin <U+FB01>lm of bone,
 which  I  suppose may be part of the clavicle. It corresponds in texture
and thickness with a detached <U+FB01>lm of bone which rests upon the
right scapula.      That ossi<U+FB01>cation is triangular, about 1} inch in each
measurement,       and has nearly straight sides.            It is quite separate
from the interclavicle,         and lies towards the external border of the
scapula;   there   is no    surface  for its articulation, for all the margins of
the interclavicle      are    sharp,   thin, and perfectly ossi<U+FB01>ed, like its

median    crest.   It  is therefore probable that the clavicles were either
loosely articulated to its margin, or extended between the interclavicle
and scapula.
FIG. 11.—Ventral    aspect of interclavicle, Mumwnosaurus beloclis ,- Clao. may be a
              portion of the thin left clavicle upon its ventral surface.
   There is no other example of an interclavicle received between the
scapnlo-precoracoids as in this species, for the anterior notch between
these bones in advance of their sntural surfaces is not unlike the
notch already described under the heading (i), except that it is less
well de<U+FB01>ned and more irregular and narrower, and it is into this
notch that the base of the interclavicle is articulated. In its posterior
part the surrounding bone is thick, forming a concave channel on
each side, which is limited in front on the visceral surface by a
tubercle, anterior to which is a small transverse notch on each side in
the scapular bone, which becomes thin as it extends forward, thus
making the clavicnlar cavity +-shaped- There is every appearance
of cartilage having extended between the opposite scapular margins,
so that the interclavicle may have been hidden upon the ventral
surface, and the anterior part of that bone may not have been in
actual contact with the thin scapular plate in front of it.                     The
position of the interclavicle appears to show that it ossi<U+FB01>ed prior to
 the bones between which it is placed.
    In this series of Elasmosaurians there is seen aremarkable change in
 the condition of the clavicular arch.             In the <U+FB01>rst species described
 it is large and much broader than long, and placed behind the

                     and Clavicular Arch in Sauropterygia.                          145
scapular      bones. But in this species it has become small, is much
longer than wide, and placed between the scapulee in a way which
shows that it might by further decrease entirely disappear, or when
ossi<U+FB01>cation obliterates the median suture it may become embedded
between the lateral ossi<U+FB01>cations of the precoracoid region, and cease
to be recognisable.             But the clavicles might still persist on the
visceral surface of the scapula: if such a change took place.
    I refer all these types in which clavicles and interclavicle are
developed, and connected in the way described, to the genus Murwno
saurus, of which the type has been already described?“=                    In all these
species    the    ulna   and   radius,  and   tibia and  <U+FB01>bula,    are approximately
equal and sub-quadrate             bones, usually with the radius and tibia
slightly the larger, meeting each other in both limbs, and enclosing
a foramen between what were in Plesiosaurus the long concave sides
of the bones.         In the species last described there is an interesting
tendency, though a slight one, to vertical elongation of the radius
and transverse          elongation of the ulna, both bones being about
2inches wide, while the radius is 2} inches long and the ulna
1% inch long.         The humerus in this type is 7 inches long and 4 inches
wide, with well-ossi<U+FB01>ed facets for the radius and ulna, which are
mutually      inclined, and     meet at a sharp angle.

     (v.) The specimen         in the Leeds Collection (Brit. Mus.) numbered
 31 has been referred to Cimoliosaurus eumerus                     (Phillips species),

                                           Brit. Mus.,’ Part     II, p. 205); but the
 different forms and proportions of all the limb bones justify its separa
 tion, and as a sub-genus of Muranosauras it is named Oryptoclidus
 platymerus.       As compared with Marianosaurus Leedsii (N0. 25, Leeds
  Coll, Brit. Mus), it has the centrum broader, shorter, and more
    1" ‘Geol. Soc.
                    Quart. Journ.,’  1874, p. 197. At that time the shoulder girdle was
  only known from fragments;       and the account now given of the scapula) corrects
  the conjectural  restoration which was based on that imperfect evidence.

concave.     The cervical and caudal ribs and neural arch are anchyloscd
to the centrum.        The cervical neural spine is short. The zygapo
physes are rather less cylindroid.          The scapulee are unfortunately im
perfect ; enough is preserved to show that they were wide anterior to
the scapulo-coxacoid foramiua, but not enough to show how they
terminated in front. The coracoids are large, and have the postero
lateral prolongation of the bone well developed, as in Colymbosaums.

                                      c, clavicles.
    There are two bones found with this specimen which                     I regard as
 clavicles. Unlike other specimens,* they unite with each other by
 an ovate suture, which is from half to three-quarters of an inch long,
 and they are inclined to meet each other anteriorly at an angle of
 45°, which is about the same as the angle of inclination of the
 scapulae.     The left clavicle is an oblong plate 41:} inches long as
 preserved, but imperfect on both the posterior and internal margins.
 The right fragment is 3% inches long.                      The anterior end is
 truncated, and hardly extends beyond                 the  articulation, where the
 transverse measurement of the bone is 1% inch.                     Just behind the
 articulation, the inner border has a concavity more than half an
 inch long, notching out the border in both specimens; but behind
 the notch the bone is broken away.                 Its smooth external border is1
 slightly concave in length, and is prolonged diagonally outward and
 backward.       The width of the left plate at the posterior fracture is
  about 2 inches.
    * Mr. Leeds informs me that he has since obtained another type in which the
  two triangular clavicles meet in the median line, without trace of an interclavicle. .

   FIG. 14.-.—Olavicles of Cryptoclidus platymerus.   art, median articular surface.
   On the visceral surfaces of the scapulse are shallow depressions
terminating outward in a sharp angle such as might have received
the external      processes of clavicles like those found with the Leeds
Collection specimen No. 36.           These impressions are symmetrical and
seen in both scapules, and so far they support the interpretation                    of
this clavicular arch now o<U+FB01>ered. No evidence of an interclavicle was
met with, and there is no evidence of its existence.
   If the clavicles are correctly identi<U+FB01>ed, their mode of occurrence
may account for the circumstance that they have not been observed
in Golymbosau'rus.         And their sutural union as in a Chelonian
may be regarded as a generic character, separating this type from
Munenosaurus.
   An important generic character is found in great vertical depth of the
radius and transverse elongation of the ulna.              It has been stated that
the ulna in another specimen consists of two separate bones“ (‘ Cat.
Foss. Rep. Brit. Mus,’ Part II, p. 206), but                  I have been unable
to   detect evidence of a suture between them, and regard the
division as a. fracture.      Extreme as is the divergence in proportion,
these bones       are   better    compared with those of Murrenosaurus
than any other type.         The separation of the ulna from the olecranon
characterises     the genus Colymbosaurus, and is seen in G. Manselli
(Hulke sp.), in which the bones are in close union, in 0'. megadeirus
apparently, and in C'. Portlandicus (Owen sp.), in which the bones are
ovate,  less perfectly ossi<U+FB01>ed, and separate.              This species, No. 31,
may be a precursor of Oolymbosaums,                 but there is no reason for
referring it to that genus, which has the humerus long and narrow.
The <U+FB01>rst row of the carpus appears to have originally comprised <U+FB01>ve
bones, as in the Mesosauria ; but the small inner and outer elements
are now blended with the carpals next them, reducing the number of
         “ The fragments,    which had been mended, have been separated.

de<U+FB01>nitions exact.
                                IV.      CLASSIFICATION.
   Characters of value in classi<U+FB01>cation show gradations of develop
ment   in the Sauropterygia.    This     conspicuous in the size and
                                                     is
form of the head, the relative length of the neck, the mode of articu
lation of the cervical ribs by two heads or by one, or by anchylosis,
the length of the centrum in relation to its breadth in the several
regions of the vertebral column, the form and mode of attachment of
the neurapophyses, the form of the zygapophyses, the structure of
the shoulder girdle, the forms and conditions of the mesopodial

                     and Cla'uicular Arch in Sauropterygia.               149
    bones,  and the arrest or development of the process of ossi<U+FB01>cation in
    the various elements of the skeleton.                                      -
       Of all these characters the last is the most dif<U+FB01>cult to value, for
   there is some evidence tending to the inference that ossi<U+FB01>cation
   became better developed with the progress of geological time,
                                                                          and
    surfaces which in Liassic types had always retained the
                                                                cartilaginous
    condition of immaturity, in Cretaceous types show the completed
    ossi<U+FB01>cation of old age. This condition is not, however, universal,
   since Eretmosaurus rugosus has ossi<U+FB01>cation perfected in a way not
   known in other Liassic genera, and Stereosaurus platyomus of the
   Cambridge Greensand has the vertebrae crowded together irregularly,
   while the extremities of the short, wide, thick propodial bones remain
   unossi<U+FB01>ed.
      And it is remarkable that many Liassic species have the articular
   faces of the vertebral centra deeply biconcave, while in many Cre
   taceous species those surfaces are nearly or quite <U+FB02>at; in the shoulder
   girdle nothing but continued ossi<U+FB01>cation apparently is needed to con
   vert the Liassic Plesiosaurian into the Oolitic and Cretaceous Elasmo
   sanrian type.      Eretmosaurus is the nearest approach to this type,
   known from the Lias.
      It thus appears as though some animals complete their embryology
  early in life, others at intervals during life, while in most types the
  embryonic      development takes place gradually during successive
  epochs    of geological time, giving rise to classi<U+FB01>cation of its stages,
  indicated as genera, families, orders; and therefore that the young
 individuals of a late period of time simulate genera of an earlier age.
     The character which appears to be most important in Sauropterygia
 as a ground for primary classi<U+FB01>cation is the presence of two facets,
 or one facet, on the side of the centrum for the articulation of the
 cervical rib.     If two are present, both facets are upon the centrum,
 and exhibit many degrees of approximation, seen in Rhomaleosaurus,
Pliosaurus,     Plesiosaurus, before the division becomes obliterated in
Murcenosaurus, Oolymbosaurus, and the Cretaceous types.            This con
dition is of further interest, from the fact that among existing
Vertebrates      a similarly divided articulation for the rib upon the
centrum is only known in the existing Urodele Amphibia.               Most, if
not all, of the Plesiosauridae have the rib facet transversely cleft;
while no Elasmosaurian is at present known in which the same
condition is found.        So that a division may be made into groups with
ribs of the      Y-type and I-type. The former sub-division includes
two extreme modi<U+FB01>cations, one with a long neck, which is well repre
sented in the Lias by Plesiosaurus homalospondylus           and P. dolicho
dei'rus; and   a   type   in which  the  head becomes  larger  and the neck
shorter, represented       by  Rhomaleosaurus   Cramptomi  in  the Lies and
Pliosaurus in the Oxford and Kimeridge Clays.

150           Prof. H. G. Seeley.     The Shoulder Girdle
   The short-necked genera are distinguished as a group by having the
two articular costal facets placed chie<U+FB02>y at the sides of the centrum,
and not at its infero-lateral angle.      This circumstance appears to
indicate that the neck is elongated chie<U+FB02>y by the addition of vertebra:
to its anterior portion. The mesopodial bones are two in number, and
more or less quadrate, with a tendency to transverse extension in the
ulna. The dorsal vertebrae are relatively long compared with those of
the neck. In Rhomaleosaums the average length of the cervical centrum
is 2'66 inches, while the average length of the dorsal vertebrw is
3'2 inches. In Rhomaleosaurus the facets remain separated to the
end of the series, but in some species of Pliosaurus there is an
approximation of the facets in the posterior cervical vertebrae which
is not seen further forward.     The relatively small size of the head in
Rhomaleosaurus as compared with Pliosaurus shows that the head is
not necessarily long in ‘all the short-necked genera.        The shoulder
girdle  in  the Rhomaleosaur    being  unknown    at present, there is no
means of comparing it     with that attributed to Pliosaurua.
   The long-necked genera have the cervical vertebrae in greater
number, and relatively longer, and, except the earliest, they are usually
as long as the dorsal vertebrae.   The articulations for the cervical ribs
are elongated from front to back, longitudinally divided, but usually
so compressed from above downward that the division is only a narrow
shallow channel, always placed at the infero-posterior angle of the
centrum. The two facets are obvious in species like P. dalichodeirus;
in many others they are only to be recognised by careful examination.
In this genus the radius is elongated, with its lateral borders concave
and ossi<U+FB01>ed, and the distal end narrower than the proximal end.
   The scapulae and coracoids never meet in the median line, unless in
the genus Eretmosaurus.    This condition has been <U+FB01>gured in the British
Museum specimen 2041 (‘ Geol. Soc. Quart. Journ.,’ 1874, p. 446),
where a wide interspace is left between the coracoids and scapulae in
the median line in front, and there is a roughness upon the scapula as
though the interclavicle or clavicle had extended upon it. The inter
clavicle usually completes the inner border of the coracoid foramen
in Flesiosaurus; but in this fossil the relations of the bones are like
those attributed to Pliosavurus by Sir R. Owen. According to Mr.
Lydekker, what     I  regard as the pro-articular part of the scapula is
the humerus of P. Hawkinsi (‘ Cat. Foss. Rept. Brit. Mus.,’ Part II,
p. 277).    This is a matter that may be de<U+FB01>nitely determined by ex
amination of the specimen, which comprises the scapula only, closely
united by suture to the coracoid.
   In the second division of the Sauropterygia or Elasmosauridse the
cervical ribs articulate by a single head with the centrum, the
scapulae, as well as the coracoids, meet each other in the median line,
the clavicles, so far as they are known, are usually slender, the meso

                    and Clavicular A   rah in Sauropterygia.              151
 podial bones are quadrate or transversely elongated, and the carpals
 and tarsals are transversely oblong. There is a certain parallelism
 between this group and the Plesiosauridee,         as though it had been
 modi<U+FB01>ed from it, and the genus Polycljtylus in the shortness of its
 centrum has some resemblance to Rhomaleosaums, just as in length of
neck and vertebrae Murwnosaurus resembles .Plesiosaurus.
   This scheme of classi<U+FB01>cation is summarised in the following
table :—

     Additional observations of the Horizontal Force, Inclination, and
 Declination have been made each month with the absolute instru
ments for the purpose of determining with greater precision the zero
values of the magnetograph curves.
   Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and
various   data have been supplied to Professors Thorpe and Riicker,
Dr. Van Rijckevorsel, Captain Schiick, and Professor Strond.
      January the Kew 9-inch uui<U+FB01>lar, by Jones, was sent to Messrs.
     In
Elliot Brothers for cleaning, and, at the same time, certain alterations
were introduced     in order to modernise the instrument. Unfortu
nately, the   heavy brass telescope support was found on examination
to
      slightly magnetic. and
     be                           was therefore discarded, and, on Feb
                                                     it
ruary 12, the magnetometer was restored to its original state, with the
exception of a brass tie-piece, which, being found non-magnetic, was
retained until the end of the year.

  On closely discussing the Declination observations of the preceding
years    was found that observations given with the old collimator

mencement     of 1891, to discard altogether the use of the old heavy
magnet for the purpose of observing Declination.

                      II. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.
      The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
  tion respectively of AtinOSphei-ic Pressure, Temperature, and Humidity,
  Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain have been
  maintained in regular operation throughout the year, with the excep
  tion of the wet-bulb thermograph.
      The readings of the last-named instrument during the winter of
  1890—91 became irregular, and it was found to vary considerably from
  its accompanying standard. It was accordingly decided to dismount the
  thermometer and to replace it by a new tube, which was done in ul_v  J
  last. On examination, the bulb showed the existence of a crack, which
   eventually extended completely around it.
      The scale value of the new tube has been determined by means of
   nearly 300 comparative readings, and new glass and ivory tabulating
   scales for it have been constructed at the Meteorological O<U+FB01>ice.
    ‘
      For controlling these values, an experimental determination of the
   zero of the instrument was made by means of melting ice.
       Experiments were made, unsuccessfully, to use 9. Richard pen with
   the Beckley rain gauge, but a BBB black-lead pencil was found to be
   more reliable in its indications than such a pen.
       The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic
   records have been duly registered.
       The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
   made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations, with
   notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual,
   to the Meteorological O<U+FB02>ice.                                       ~
                                                                          ‘
       With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, data have been
    supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society, the
   editor of ‘ Symons’s Monthly Meteorological Magazine,’ Dr. Rowland,
    and others.
       Tables of the monthly values of the rainfall and temperature have
    been regularly sent to the Meteorological Sub-Committee of the
    Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club for publication in
    their Proceedings. Detailed information of all thunderstorms ob
    served in the neighbourhood during the year has been forwarded
    to the Royal Meteorological Society, soon after their occurrence.
       Atmospheric  Electricity—The electrograph has been maintained in
    action during the greater portion of the year.      The records were,
    however, lost for forty-eight days on account of the freezing of the
    water-jet during frost in winter.
       The instrument has failed in sensibility during the last year owing
    to the large extent of diminution which the 60-cell chloride of silver
     batterv has experienced in its charge, the potential of which has
     apparently diminished by one-half.

                       Report   of the Kew    Committee.                155
     This having been reported to the Meteorological Council, it was
 decided by them to request Professor J. J. Thomson to examine into
 the subject of the measurement of Atmospheric Electricity, and,
 meanwhile, to continue the instrument in action in its present
 condition.
                          III.  SOLAR OBSERVATIONS.
     Sun-spots—Sketchcs of Sun-spots have been made on 170 days, and
  the groups numbered after Schwabe’s method.
     Time Signals—These have been received from Greenwich through
 the G.P.O. with regularity since last report, with the following ex
 ceptions :—
     On six occasions, viz., March 10; May 30; August 18, 19, and 27;
 and September 11, no signal was received either at 10 A.M. or
  1 RM.     On January 14 and February 41 it arrived two seconds late,
 and on October 8, 9, and 10 it did not record itself on the chrono
 graph, but was only observed by the galvanometer.
     Transit Observation.——Occasional solar and sidereal transits have
  been observed as checks upon the Greenwich signalled times.
     Violle’s Actinometer.—The copies of the observations made during
 1890 were duly forwarded to the Meteorological O<U+FB02>ice in January,
 and, as the Committee understand, have been handed over by that
 Of<U+FB01>ce to Mr. H. F. Blauford, who will report on the subject to the
 Solar Physics Committee.
                          IV.  EXPERIMENTAL     WORK.
    The Committee have had under trial on the roof of the Observatory
two new forms of wind registering instruments, the anemo-cinemo
graph of MM. Richard Fréres, of Paris, and the sight-indicating
velocity meter by Munro, of London.
   The <U+FB01>rst-named instrument is an improved form of the old wind
mill vanes anemometer which was used by Smeaton after Rouse and
Robins, but is best known as Whewell’s.           The anemo-cinemograph   is
similar to that which was employed on the top of the Eiffel Tower at
Paris, and the vanes, by running constantly against a train of clock
work, record directly on a sheet of paper the velocity of motion of the
Wind at any time.      Continuous records were obtained for six months,
and   the  result given would    seem to show that the indications of the
Kew     Beckley anemograph       are in   excess of those given by the new
instrument.      These   are 20 per cent. less than those of the anemo
         with winds blowing at        4.0  miles or upwards per hour, and
 graph
 12 per  cent. less with light winds which blow        at from 6 to 10 miles

  156                 Report  of the Kew   Committee.
  per hour. A reduction of the Robinson factor from 3 to 25 would
  serve to render the readings of the two instruments more nearly
  comparable.
     As  the Richard  instrument is designed to record the velocity of
  the wind in gusts as well as the total run during any de<U+FB01>nite interval,
  no detailed comparisons with the Robinson indications are possible;
  but it may be noted that during the period the cinemograph was
  under observation gusts of 45 and '43 miles per hour were recorded,
  whilst simultaneous curve readings of the Robinson gave hourly
  rates of 55 and 52 miles for quarter of an hour intervals.
     The Munro sight-indicating anemometer is a sensitive Robinson
 cup arrangement, which drives by means of a small centrifugal pump a
  column of oil up a glass tube.    Its height above a <U+FB01>xed zero mark,
 as shown on a divided porcelain scale at the side, indicates the
 velocity of rotation of the cups when converted into miles per
 hour of wind movement.       The divisions of the scale have been laid
 down in accordance with Mr. Dines’ experimental deduction. When
 the instrument, was originally set up, it was found incapable of
 recording a velocity of more than 40 miles per hour, but, during a.
 gale in November, velocities were attained during several gusts of over
 70 miles per hour, and. accordingly Mr. Munro has found it desirable
 to change the gearing of the pump so as to enable the higher values
 to be indicated.    The comparisons with the new gearing are not
 suf<U+FB01>cient in number to furnish results suitable for quotation at the
 present time, but they appear to show, during gusts, rates fully 20
 per cent. higher than the cinemograph gives.
    The instrument as <U+FB01>tted at present fails to work during frost,
 owing to congelation of the oil employed.
    Dr. E. Van Rijckevorsel, of Rotterdam, visited the Observatory in
 July for the purpose of making simultaneous magnetic observations
 with the Kew, his own, and the Utrecht uni<U+FB01>lar magnetometers,
 and of comparing the' results with those he had recently made with
the magnetometers     in use at the Observatories at Pare St. Maur,
 Wilhelmshafen, and Utrecht.
    Professor Riicker has also been investigating the differences found
to exist in similar simultaneous readings of his three uni<U+FB01>lars ; and
his assistants, Messrs. Gray and Watson, have visited Kew on numer
ous occasions in order to make the necessary observations.
    Cloud Photographs—The operations with the cloud cameras have
been conducted during the past year olely according to the simpli<U+FB01>ed
method of zenith observation, as described in last year’s report, and
results were obtained on 24 days. A joint paper by General Strachey
and the Superintendent, describing the plan of working, was read
before the Royal Society in June, and was fully illustrated by photo
graphs shown in the optical lantern.        A report, giving a detailed

                         Report    of the  Kew     Committee.                 157
 account       of the year’s work, was forwarded to the Meteorological
  Council in November last.
       Particulars, with specimens of cloud pictures, were also supplied to
 Mr. Rotch, of the Blue Hill Observatory, for communication to
 the      Committee   of the    International     Meteorological   Conference   at
 Munich.
      Experiments were also made with several new lenses kindly lent
 by Mr. Dallmeyer, in order to select one suitable for giving pictures
 covering a wider <U+FB01>eld of view than the R.R. lens hitherto employed,
 which con<U+FB01>nes the observer to clouds within 15° of the zenith.
      The results of   these experiments,       as well as others with Eastmann
 <U+FB01>lms used instead of glass plates, have been communicated to the
 Meteorological Council.
      In compliance with the request forwarded by Mr. Clayden, secretary
 to the British Association Committee on Meteorological Photography,
 for copies of photographs illustrating meteorological phenomena, or
 their e<U+FB01>ects, the Committee forwarded a selection of duplicate cloud
 and other photographs to be added to the collection which has been
 formed.
                        V.  VERIFICATION      or INSTRUMENTS.
     The following instruments have         been purchased on commission and
their constants determined :—
     1   Uni<U+FB01>lar magnetometer for the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
    1   Ditto, ditto for the Vatican Observatory, Rome.
    1   Ditto, ditto for the Meteorological Department, Brazil.

   Semtamt    Testing.—The         apparatus,    consisting of two Mawson and

                            Report    of the Kew     Committee.                   159
    Swan’s     glow lamps,       lighted by electricity derived from one of
    Pitkin’s storage     batteries,    has been successfully employed in testing
    the dark shades of sextants, when requisite, during the past year.              It
   has been found necessary to replace the lamps in two instances; but
   the initial charge of the battery has proved capable of working them
   throughout the _whole twelvemonths without replenishing.
       Telescope Testing—A second test plate has been procured, and
   mounted on a portable frame, with a re<U+FB02>ector, in order to enable the
   examination of telescopes to be prosecuted from the optical room as
   well as from the lawn. A detailed form of certi<U+FB01>cate has been pre
   pared and issued with telescopes and binoculars examined for the
   general public.
      6 Look-out telescopes have been examined and certi<U+FB01>ed for the
   Brethren of the Trinity House.
      Normal Thermometers.—M. Benoit, the Director of the Conserva
   toire'des Poids et Mesures, Paris, having completed his examination
   of the three standard thermometers, and submitted his report upon
   them to the Committee, who have placed it in the hands of Professor
   Riicker for discussion, proceeded to examine the low-range alcohol
  thermometer        which accompanied            them. Whilst conducting this
  operation,    M.   Carpenter,    the   observer,  was so unfortunate as to break
  the tube.      M. Benoit, having strongly advised that further compari
  sons at low temperatures should be made by means of thermometers
 <U+FB01>lled with toluene instead of with alcohol, has been requested by
 the Committee to order such an instrument of M. Tonnelot, the
 maker, and compare it with the Sévres standards before its delivery
 in England. The mercurial standards were safely returned to the
 custody of the Observatory by M. Carpenter in May last.
                                VI.   RATING or WATCHES.
     During      the fourteen months 709 entries of watches for rating
Were    made. They were sent for testing in the following classes :—
    For class A,     4168 ;  class B, 153    ;  and class C, 86 ; subsidiary trial, 2
Of these 161 failed to gain any award; 49 passed with C, 140 with B,
327 with      A    certi<U+FB01>cates, and 29 of the latter obtained the highest,
class   A  especially    good.
    In the Appendix will be found statements giving the results of
trial 0f the 29 watches Which obtained the highest numbers of marks
                                                                             Messrs,
during the year, the highest position being attained by
StauEer, Son, and Co., London.                 This watch was a keyless tourbillon
chronometer,        with    going    barrel,   which obtained the very excellent,
total 91'6 of marks

   Marine     Chronometers.—Oerti<U+FB01>cates             showing the    mean   daily rate

160                   Report  of the Kew   Committee.
and the variations of rate at three di<U+FB01>erent temperatures have been
awarded to 18 marine chronometers      after undergoing the 35 days’ trial.
   The Committee having had their attention drawn to the limited
nature of their trials for <U+FB01>rst-class marine chronometers, decided to
establish a second and more rigorous trial for these instruments, and
have now organised two classes, which are as follows :—
    Class A trial, extending over 55 days, comprising runs at tempera
tures of 45°, 70°, 95° Faht.; and Class B trials, which last for 35
days, and include readings at temperatures of 55°, 70", and 85° Faht.
only. For Class A tests, the individual runs are 10 days at each
temperature ; whilst for Class 13 tests, they are only 7 days each in
duration.
    The Committee have drawn up a special circular addressed to the
 directors of steamship companies, calling attention to rating chrono
 meters, and have distributed it to the managers of all the principal
companies of vessels sailing from British ports.
   As the question of the rate of a chronometer under varying tem
peratures is intimately related to the behaviour of the lubricating
material employed, when heated, the Committee asked Professor T.
Thorpe, F.R.S., to favour them with his opinion as to the temperature
to which a chronometer may be subjected to without producing a dele
 terious e<U+FB02>'ect upon its oil.
   Non-Magnetic Watehes.—Owing to the extension of the use of
electrical dynamometers, a class of watches provided with springs and
balances     of palladium or some alloy, and termed non-magnetic
watches, has been brought into more general use; and the Com~
mittee have been requested to certify as to the extent in which
they may be employed in the vicinity of dynamos without deterioration
of their time-keeping properties.
    Professor Riicker kindly undertook to arrange to conduct a
series of experiments with the dynamos at South Kensington, and
two students of the Royal College of Science, Messrs. Edser and
Stans<U+FB01>eld, have already submitted a preliminary report to the Com
mittee upon the nature and extent of the in<U+FB02>uence in the magnetic
<U+FB01>eld in the neighbourhood of a dynamo.         The experiments are still
in  progress.
                            VII. MISCELLANEOUS.
   Le'ns Testing.—-In the preliminary operations necessary to conduct
the satisfactory examination of photographic lenses, Major L. Darwin,
late R.E., has been associated with Captain Abney, and, in accord
ance with his suggestions, a special camera, capable of working with
lenses   of 4 inches aperture and 30 inches focal length, has been
constructed by Mr. Meagher, and <U+FB01>tted up at the Observatory.             A

                        Report  of the  Kew   Committee.                  161
  photometer,    on Abney’s principle, 13 feet long, has also been <U+FB01>tted
  for use  in the testing operations.
     Adetailed account of the apparatus and methods employed is in
 course of preparation by Major Darwin for publication.           Meanwhile
 circulars, respecting the proposed       scheme of examination and pre
 liminary certi<U+FB01>cates, have been printed, and 200 distributed amongst
 the leading opticians, manufacturers, and secretaries       of all the best
 known photographic societies, both at home and abroad, to call their
attention to the intended plan of examination.
    A <U+FB01>re- and burglar-proof safe has been purchased and <U+FB01>tted up for
the reception and safe custody of the lenses.
    Prepared    photographic paper has been procured, and supplied to
the   Observatories at Aberdeen, Lisbon, Mauritius, Oxford, St. Peters
burg, Stonyhurst, as well as to the Meteorological O<U+FB01>ice for Batavia,
Fort William, and Valencia.
    Other photographic material supplied to Observatories includes
developing dishes for Colaba and Oxford, as well as a camera and
requisite <U+FB01>ttings for cloud and lightning photography for Mauritius.
    Anemograph sheets have been sent to Coimbra, Hong Kong, and
Mauritius, and blank forms for entry of magnetic observations to
Padre Denza and Professor Riicker.                    _
    [library—During      the year the  library  has received as presents   the
publications    of—
    441 Scienti<U+FB01>c Societies and Institutions         of Great Britain and
         Ireland, and
    114  Foreign and Colonial Scienti<U+FB01>c Establishments, as well as of
         numerous private individuals.
    House,   Enclosure, Qa—A new stove has been obtained, and <U+FB01>tted
up   in the   clinical testing o<U+FB01>ice to replace the one previously <U+FB01>tted,
now worn out.
    Stone blocks have been laid down on the surface of the lawn, to
ensure the erection of the tripods for supporting magnetometers          used
for occasional observation, approximately in the proper meridian.
    The roofs of the Magnetic Observatory, and of the Experimental
House have been newly covered with felt, and freshly tarred.
    With the view of the protection of' the building against <U+FB01>re, and
also for sanitary purposes,     the Committee have made application to
HM. Of<U+FB01>ce of Works and Public Buildings to have the Observatory
connected with the water mains of the Corporation of Richmond, but,
owing to the expense of laying down the necessary pipe, the O<U+FB02>ice
has as yet been unwilling to accede to the Committee’s request; nor
have H.M. Commissioners         provided a gas engine for pumping from
 the wells, capable of furnishing a su<U+FB01>icient quantity of water from the
 local springs, which they have suggested as an equivalent.

162                    Report   of the Kew   Committee.
    The Committee have also represented to the O<U+FB02>ice of Woods and
Forests, the inconvenience to which they are at present subjected by
the greatly increased cattle traf<U+FB01>c through the existing entrance to
the Old Deer Park, since the change of tenants of the park; H.M.
Commissioners have for someltime had under consideration the
provision of a new entrance to the road leading to the Obser
vatory, which shall avoid the passage through the two unfenced
cattle lairs, at Clarence Street, Richmond, with their attendant
inconvenience and danger; but no change has, up to the present, been
made.
    In order to provide additional space for the accommodation of
the growing work at the Observatory, the Committee have obtained
 plans from H.M. Of<U+FB01>ce of Works for the erection of two rooms
 on the roof of the thermometer testing room in the present west
 wing.    They propose to proceed with building operations during next
 summer.
    The Librarian is still engaged in the preparation of a card cata
 logue of the library, and has now completed over 1,700 cards, which
 contain the titles, &c., of all works received by the Committee during
 the past nine years, together with those of a like title which had
 been received   previously.                  '
     The publications not yet catalogued formed part of Sir E. Sabine’s
  Magnetic O<U+FB02>ice collection, and are chie<U+FB02>y excerpts from foreign
 publications and reports.
     Workshop—The machine tools procured for the use of the Kew
 Observatory by grants from the Government Grant Fund or the
 Donation Fund have been duly kept in order.
    Mr. T. Fuller, the former lessee of the Old Deer Park, having
 resigned his tenancy, the Committee have addressed the First
  Commissioner of Woods and Forests, and he has decided that in
 future the land attached to the Observatory shall be let direct from.
 the Crown to the Committee, without the intervention of the park
 tenant.
     Exhibition  of Instruments—Several instruments were shown by
  the Committee at the twelfth      annual exhibition of the Royal Meteo
 rological Society,   which  was  composed of Rain Gauges, Evaporation
  Gauges, &c.
     Registration of the Committee under the Companies Act—The Com~
  mittee have come to the conclusion that it would be of advantage to
  them, in the transaction of their business, to obtain registration
  under Section 23 of the Companies Act, 1867; and they have ob
  tained the sanction of the President and Council to their making
  application to the Board of Trade for this purpose.        The matter is
  still under consideration.                                      '

                     MAGNETICAL      OBSERVATIONS,
 Made   at the Kew Observatory, Richmond, Lat. 51° 28' 6”
    N. and Long. 011 1m 1581 W., height 34 feet above mean
    sea—level, for the year 1891.

   The results given in the following tables are deduced from the
 magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of de<U+FB02>ection   and vibration.    These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the
9-inch Uni<U+FB01>lar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
No. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3% inches in length.
   The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VIII are pre
pared in accordance with the suggestions made in the <U+FB01>fth report of
the Committee of the British Association on comparing and reducing
Magnetic Observations.
   The following is a list of the days during the year 1891 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables.

       of Chemistry in University College, Dundee, and MARSHALL
        WARD, Sc.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., Professor of Botany in the Royal
       Indian Engineering College, Coopers Hill. Presented to the
        President and Council, May 19, 1892.
                                  Introduction.
     The interest attaching to the presence of micro-organisms in water
  originated principally   in the proof, which has been furnished by
  medical men, that some zymotic diseases are communicated through
  drinking water. In the case of two diseases, at any rate, the evi
 dence may be regarded as conclusive on the main point, and the
 communicability of Asiatic cholera and typhoid fever forms one of
 the cardinal principles of modern sanitary science, which year by
 year is becoming more widely recognised and generally accepted.
 The germ theory of zymotic disease, which has become more and
 more <U+FB01>rmly established during each successive decade of the past
 half century, was naturally soon impressed into the service of those
 who sought to explain the empirical fact that these particular diseases
 are frequently communicated by water.          It is signi<U+FB01>cant that these
 views concerning the propagation of cholera and typhoid, and the
 importance to be, therefore,"attached to drinking water in connexion
 with public health, are mainly English in origin, and were for many
 years un<U+FB02>inchingly preached and practised by English sanitary
 authorities, at a time when the germ theory of disease was a specula
 tion, and not established as it now is.     It is only necessary to read, by
 the light of our knowledge of to-day, the Sixth Report of the Rivers
 Pollution Commissioners (1868), written more than eighteen years
 ago, to be convinced of the intuitive sagacity and acumen which has
 been displayed in this country in matters of sanitation.
    The germ theory of disease having thus so early become interwoven
 with the consideration of potable waters, it is easy to understand
 with what eager interest the vigorous development             in our know
ledge of micro-organisms
                               in   general, and   of  their connexion with
   VOL.  LI.                                                         0

  disease in particular, which has taken place within the past <U+FB01>fteen
 years, has been watched by those who have had to devote much
 attention to the sanitary aspects of water-supply.
      The subject of our particular enquiry is, therefore, a modern one,
 and may be regarded as having been made amenable to successful
 treatment by the introduction of Koch’s method of gelatine-plate
 cultures in 1881, and subsequent improvements on the same?
      The publication by Koch of his beautiful and comparatively simple
 methods of bacteriological study gave an impulse to this kind of work
 throughout the civilised world. These methods, in spite of certain
 imperfections from which they never professed to be free, at once
 opened up the possibility of solving a number of problems                           con
 nected with water-supply which had long been matters of dispute
 and speculation amongst hygienic authorities.
     As is now well known, Koch’s method of gelatine-plate culture
 admits of an estimate being made of the number of living germs
present in a given quantity of any material.                  That this estimate is a
very rough one, and that there are a number of di<U+FB01>erent kinds of germs
which it is incapable of revealing, was also known, and has been more
or less admitted from the outset.               Now this possibility of estimating
the    number    of  microbes    in   a given    volume of water has been largely
made use of by numerous investigators for a number of di<U+FB01>erent
purposes.
     In the <U+FB01>rst instance, this method has been extensively employed
both in this country and abroad for determining the relative richness
in micro-organisms (capable of developing in gelatine) of various
natural waters.         On the Continent, and more especially in Germany,
it was assumed that the relative numbers of microbes present in
di<U+FB01>erent waters afforded evidence of the extent to which they had
been contaminated, and there were not wanting those who hastily set
up arbitrary standards of purity based upon a most limited experience
of the number of micro-organisms revealed by the gelatine test.                       By
those who were simultaneously employing the method in this country
    1' Koch’s <U+FB01>rst announcement of his new method was made at the meeting of the
International Medical Congress in London, in August, 1881 (see ‘Qnart. ourn        J
Microsc. Sc.,’ Oct., 1881, p. 650), and then published in the ‘ Mitth. aus d. K. Gesund
heitsamte,’ vol. 1, 1881 (see also ‘ Berl. Klin. Wochenschr.,' 1882, No. 5). It should be
noted, however, that Koch’s gelatine-plate method was an improved adaptation of one
introduced long before by the botanists Brefeld and Klebs (see Brefeld, “Methoden
zur Unters. der Pilze,” ‘Ahh. der Phys-Med. Gesellsch. in Wiirzburg,’ 1874; also
‘
                  J
  Landwirthsch. ahrb.,’ vol. 4, H. 1, and ‘ Unters. iiber Schimmelpilze,’ 1881, 6H. 41 ;
also Klebs, “ Beitr. zur Kenntn. d. Mikrokokken,” ‘ Arch. fiir exp. Pathol.,’ vol. 1,
1873, and De Bary, ‘ Lectures on Bacteria,’ Engl. ed., 1887, p. 85). A fair view        of
the matter is given by Hueppe, ‘Die Methoden der Bakterien-Forschung,’               1885,
p. 103.    To Koch belongs the credit of having applied these plates to the purpose
 of separating the various colonies of mixtures of micro-organisms.

                     Report on   the  Bacteriology of Water.              185
more      caution and reserve were exercised in this respect, the results
being      tentatively chronicled without comment or deduction as to
purity.
     The prudence       of this caution was soon apparent, when both in
England       and in Germany it was discovered in 1885 that many forms
of micro-organisms could multiply to an astonishing extent in waters
of great organic purity, including distilled water itself.      It is obvious
that this discovery at once subverted the arti<U+FB01>cial standards which
had been proposed, for, although a small number of micro-organisms
might frequently point to little or no contamination having taken
place, a large number could only under special             circumstances be
viewed as conclusive evidence of proportionate contamination.
     Another question was, however, being simultaneously attacked,
both in this country and on the Continent, viz., the effect of various
processes of puri<U+FB01>cation on the bacterial life present in water.         This
question,     which is of evident importance, could be investigated
with considerable precision by means of the gelatine-plate method, in
spite of its imperfections, for by applying the same mode of culture to
a particular water before and after puri<U+FB01>cation, it is obvious that the
defects neutralise each other, and that a true differential result can
be obtained.        In this manner, the value of a number of <U+FB01>ltering
materials      has been ascertained, and the remarkable ef<U+FB01>ciency of
 water-works sand-<U+FB01>ltration for the <U+FB01>rst time established.         Again, the
 fact that practically all surface        waters exhibit a large number of
 microbes by the gelatine test, whilst deep well and spring waters
 yield very few, or in some cases none, shows how perfect, as regards
 removal of micro-organisms,           must be the natural <U+FB01>ltration which
 water undergoes        in traversing great depths of porous strata in the
 earth.
     It has also been shown that in the subsidence of solid particles
 often a surprisingly      large proportion of the micro-organisms present
 in water are       carried to the bottom, a matter which is of par
 ticular interest      and importance in connexion with the natural
 puri<U+FB01>cation of surface waters in rivers, lakes, and storage reservoirs,
 as well as in the arti<U+FB01>cial         treatment of water-supplies by Clark’s
  softening process, and other methods of precipitation.         In applying
  the gelatine test to these various puri<U+FB01>cation processes it is, however,
  essential, if an accurate result is to be Obtained, that the water should
  beexamined immediately (within a few hours) after the puri<U+FB01>cation
  is completed, and       before the number of microbes in the puri<U+FB01>ed
  Water can have multiplied naturally.
     Another use to which the bacteriological methods have been applied
   is tothe actual discovery of pathogenic microbes        in water, and, in
   the opinion of     some, this should indeed be the primary object of
   bacteriology   in connexion with water-supply.         This view appears
                                                                   0 2

to us, however, too narrow,            as waters are surely to be condemned
for drinking purposes not only when they contain the germs of
 zymotic disease at the time of analysis, but in all cases when they
 are subject to contaminations which, like sewage, may at any time
 convey such germs.
    Notwithstanding that great dif<U+FB01>culties usually invest the discovery
 of particular pathogenic forms in the presence of large numbers
 of ordinary water microbes, the spirillum of Asiatic cholera was
early discovered in water by Koch, whilst the bacillus of typhoid
fever has more recently been on several occasions detected by various
 investigators in drinking waters which had been suspected of com
 municating this disease. It is obvious that such discoveries                       are
rather of interest on account of their con<U+FB01>rming the belief in the
 communicability of these diseases through water than of special
hygienic importance in preventing outbreaks of zymotic disease.
    The bacteriological methods of examination have been also em
ployed for a purpose of far greater importance than the mere quest
for pathogenic forms in particular water-supplies, viz., for direct ex
periments on the vitality of known pathogenic organisms in waters of
different composition and under varied conditions of temperature and
the like.       This investigation was also begun independently and
almost simultaneously both in this country and on the Continent, and
although the question appears at <U+FB01>rst sight a very simple one, it is in
reality surrounded with numerous pitfalls, which have, in some cases,
led to very discordant results.            Perhaps the greatest dif<U+FB01>culty which
attaches to this investigation consists in the very different degrees of
vitality which are exhibited by one and the same organism at dif
ferent periods of its life, and according to the previous treatment
which the individual and its ancestors have received.                           On this
             a number of individuals of a particular species, on being in
account
 troduced into a given water, may conduct themselves quite di<U+FB01>erently
from a number of individuals of the same species, but taken from a.
 different source and having another ancestral history.                    This import
 ance of individuality and pedigree, with which we are so familiar in
 dealing with the higher plants and animals, must also invariably be
 taken into consideration in connexion with these lowly forms of
 life.*
    In spite of some con<U+FB02>icting results which have thus not unnaturall y
 been obtained in these investigations, it is suf<U+FB01>ciently evident that
  some pathogenic species, and notably those which form spores, are
 capable of retaining their vitality in ordinary potable waters for a.
    * Particular    cases of the application  of these methods to the examination of
 food substances, brewing and distilling waters, the materials of clothing, dyeing
 and other industries lie beyond our present enquiry; their importance is obvious,
 as is also the utility of the methods for the-analyses of air, soils, 8w.

 long  period of time, in  some cases several months, (whilst other forms,
especially   in the  absence of spores, are very       rapidly  destroyed.  In
some   instances actual multiplication,      although but rarely on any very
extensive scale, has been observed          in  the case of some pathogenic
forms in potable water, and more frequently in badly contaminated
waters and in sewage.       In those cases in which pathogenic forms have
been introduced into waters in their natural condition, the destruction
of these forms has almost        invariably been more rapid, and in some
cases very much more rapid, than when the same forms were introduced
into the same waters after the latter had been previously sterilised.
This more rapid disappearance           of the pathogenic forms in the un
sterilised water is generally accounted for by assuming that they have
perished in the struggle for existence with the other microbes present
in the water, and which by their nature and previous history are more
<U+FB01>tted for this aquatic existence.            We are of opinion that these
results with unsterilised water must be accepted with considerable
caution, as the experimental dif<U+FB01>culties involved are very great
indeed, and the possibility of the comparatively few pathogenic forms
being undiscovered amidst the countless swarms of water organisms
must be borne in mind.
    Having thus given a general survey of the present position of our
knowledge      concerning the bacteriology of water, we shall now
Proceed to enter into each of the questions           involved in more detail,
giving special attention to the existing literature on the several parts
of our subject.
    In view of the fact that the introduction of Koch’s methods, in
1881, thus revolutionised       the subject of hygiene, we naturally com
mence our review of the literature at the period just previous to and
after the above date.      There are, in fact, practically no investigations
on the more special part of our subject anterior to this date.
    Most of the more systematic work has been done on the Continent,
and, at <U+FB01>rst, especially in the public laboratories of Germany, where
the new methods were at once applied industrioust to the examina
tion of the bacteria in the air, the soil, food stu<U+FB01>'s, water, 800.
    A number of French enquirers also arose, though it is signi<U+FB01>cant that
Koch’s gelatine-plate method to this day has not found much favour
in one of the oldest and best of the French stations, the Observatoire
de    Montsouris, whence excellent work has come.*              England, Italy,
America,    and other countries soon followed; but, although a number
Ofexceedingly valuable memoirs on special questions relating to the
general subject were published at an early date in this country and
in France, it is still noticeable that most of the prolonged and sys
tematic investigations of the bacterial life to be found in the waters

of towns, &c., and statistical comparisons of their behaviour at
different seasons, their vitality when placed in special waters, and so
on, have come from Germany.        Of late years it would be di<U+FB01>icult to
say where most activity has been displayed, the establishment of the
Pasteur Institute in Paris having led to the inauguration of brilliant
and industrious researches into every aspect of the questions we are
concerned with.     Even now, however, it is especially to the reports
of the public hygienic institutions of Germany that we must turn for
the more technical and systematic comparative researches into the
main question of our enquiry—the length of life enjoyed by speci<U+FB01>c
Schizomycetes when placed in arbitrarily selected waters.
    We propose to adopt the following plan of treatment in this
Report :—
    (1.) To give some account of what species or forms are actually
known to occur in natural waters, of various kinds, whether as more
or less normal and constant inhabitants of such waters, or as casual
foreign intruders.    Some of these are well known, others we know
very little about, while yet others require careful examination before
we can accept them as autonomous.       We also refer to a few remark
able forms found in special kinds of water, or under peculiar con
ditions, only.
    (2.) We propose to draw attention to some of the facts now
acquired, which throw light on the questions of the relations subsist
ing between the bacterial contents of natural waters, such as those of
rivers, springs, wells, reservoirs, &c., and the air and soil of the
neighbourhood, because some of these facts are of great importance
as regards the presence and supply of pathogenic germs in such
waters. This leads naturally to the discussion of recent experimental
investigations into the effects of certain factors of the physical
environment, e.g., temperature, light, oxygen, &c., in modifying the
life-actions of such bacteria as we are concerned with, and so far as
such effects may be expected to affect the general problems at issue.
    (3.) The questions, What bacteria can live in such waters as we
refer to? Can they multiply and spread in them? Can de<U+FB01>nitely chosen
pathogenic species live and multiply in selected waters; and, if so,
how long can they maintain themselves ? These, and similar questions
relating to them, will be treated in detail as fully as the literature and
our own personal experience in these matters enable us to do.
    This will, we think, cover the ground of the history and literature
of the subject, and will clear the way for our proposals as to lines of
enquiry to be entered into forthwith, and as to the methods we intend

             § 1. Schizomycetes actually Detected                          in Natural      Waters.
     It           been known that natural waters, of rivers, springs,
           has long
ditches, wells, lakes, &c., contain bacteria, often in enormous quanti
ties; and prolonged experience has shown that no kind of ordinary
water, whether running or standing, is entirely devoid of these
organisms      though the rule

                                                    is
tain many more organisms       than those of lakes or large reservoirs.
Mountain streams are generally less rich in bacterial life, while
stagnant or slowly moving waters usually contain niany and often
peculiar species.                                                 ,
   Some of the best studied and longest known aquatic species are
the followingz—C'ladothrim dichotoma (Cohn), Orenothr'lm       Kuhm'cma
(Rabenh.),                  Sphazrotilas       natans        (Kiitz.),     Begg-iatoa     alba   (Vauch.),
 Spirillumpl'icatile (Ehrenb.), Bacillus erythrosporus (Cohn), Bacterium
ja/nthinum (Zopf), Bacterium merismoped'ioides (Zopf).            There are,
 however,  many other forms known to occur in water: e.g., Sarcina
Reitenbach'ii (Caspary), S. hyalina (Kiitz.), Spirillum serpens‘l‘ (Miller),
S.  tenue* (Ehrenb.), S. undula" (Muller), 5'. columns"           (Ehrenb.),
 Monas vinosa‘" (Ehrenb.), M. Okenii‘l‘ (Ehrenb.), M. gracilis (Warm.),
 Rhabdomonas rosea“ (Cohn), Myconostoc grega'r'lum (Cohn), Spiro
monas Cohnii (Warm.), Micrococcus crepusculu/m’l“ (Ehrenb.), M. griseus
(Warm.),               O'lath'rocystis         Tosca-persiciua           (Kiitz.),     Bacterium.    Termo*
(Dnjard.), B. lineola (Muller), Bacillus                                  tremulus     (Koch), B. Ulna“
(Cohn),   B. 'u'irens (Van Tiegh.), and many others:
   With regard to this last list, two remarks are necessary.          In the
<U+FB01>rst place, most of the species or forms named are characteristic of
waters containing      much vegetable or animal matter in a state of
decay,  whence     they are commoner in marshes, ditches, ponds, 860.,
than in running streams, rivers, and wells; and, in the second, some
of the so-called species are certainly not good ones, but what are
usually termed “form-species,” requiring further examination, and
especially by means of continuous cultures.          The latter applies par
                                 ’1‘ in the

is at least not impossible that the forms described as Bacterium
sulphumtum,          Merismoped'la littoralis, M. Reitmtbach'i-z', llIonas cinosa,
M. Warmingii, M. e'rubescens, M. Okem'i, M. gracilis, Spir'lllum viola
ceum, Rhabdomouas rosea, &c., by di<U+FB01>erent observers are merely
form-phases of Lankester’s species?“                  So long as investigators are
content with recording and naming forms without cultivating them,
such dif<U+FB01>culties as the above will increase, and most of the trouble
met with in the literature of bacteriology—so far as their morphology
is concerned—is traceable to this error.
     A still longer list of bacteria are recorded as having been occasion
ally met with in various waters, though most of them are not
characteristic of such habitats.              Among these are: Bacillus subtilis
(Ehrenb), Proteus vulgaris (Hauser), Bacillus anthracis (Cohn),
Spirillum cholerae-as'laticaa (Koch), Bacillus typhosus (Eberth-Ga<U+FB01>ky),
B. aquatilis sulcatus (Weichselbaum), B. dysente'ricus (Aradas), B.
thermophilus (Miqu.), Micrococcus agilis (Ali-Cohen), and others?
     Here, again, it must be remarked that many of the forms are un
satisfactory as regards their autonomy—e.g., Proteus vulgaris, Micro
coccus agilis—and that we <U+FB01>nd no record of the authority for B. dysen
te'r'lcus, referred to by Aradas.
     We have decided to omit detailed references to numerous other
forms, recorded as occurring in water, but under names which
convey no speci<U+FB01>c meaning, though some of them are not necessarily
bad records; others, again, are referred to by the authors in such a.
loose way that it is impossible to accept them until they have undergone
revision. Thus, Eisenberg refers to rodlets which he dubs “ Violette'r
 bacillus,”
                 “ Gasbildender-bacillus,”       “
                                                    Ver<U+FB02>ussigeuder-bacillus,”         &c.,1
 and     Perdrix, in an excellent paper§ in other respects, speaks of
 Bacille amylozyme, a form met with in the rivers of Paris.                      So far as
 it has been possible we have given these in the lists in Appendix B;
 but we desire to point out that the labour of hunting up the synonyms
 recorded for these and other imperfectly named forms is very great,
 and that, therefore, omissions may possibly be discovered with regard
 to some of them.
     Among such forms we may also mention Bacillus arborescens, B.
 liquidus, B. vermicularis, B. uubilus, B. ramosus, B. aurant'iacus, B.

   Enough has been said to give point to the statement that Schizo
                                                                 Some of
mycetes of various kinds are common in ordinary waters.
the forms referred to are almost universally distributed, at least in
Europe and America<U+FB02>'         Others are mostly con<U+FB01>ned to foul or con
taminated waters, containing decaying animal and vegetable matter,§§
&c., such as pools on moorlands, dirty ditches and canals, docks, &c.
   There remains, however, a very large amount of work still to
be done in connecting particular forms with particular kinds of
water and with particular sources of contamination, which would
enormously extend the scope and enhance the value of the bacterio
logical examination of water from a sanitary point of view.
   Other forms, again, are not known to be characteristic of any par
ticular class of waters, but have occurred at intervals in anyHH of
them, suggesting that they have gained access as casual intruders. At
the ,same time it may be noted that the systematic determination of
forms in natural waters has not yet been su<U+FB01>iciently extensive to warrant
de<U+FB01>nite and positive statements as to the habitats of the Species. A
shorter list, but one that is growing longer every year, includes forms
which are not typically characteristic of waters at all, but are patho
genic species, which have almost certainly been introduced into the
waters with foreign matters<U+FB01>i {i
   We have so far con<U+FB01>ned our attention to waters which are at least
sometimes employed for household purposes, and are generally known
as

contrast those of dirty rivers with those of clear streams, or those of
open moorlands and marshes with those of wells and springs, and so
forth.

      But     there     are micro-organisms in other classes of waters, not
  usually employed for domestic purposes on a large scale, e.g., the sea,
  salt marshes and springs, sulphur springs, and mineral waters of
- various kinds.          As a rule, the  bacteria of such waters are different from
  the above, and often appear to be more restricted in species. Thus :—
       In the sea are found Sarcina literal'is (Oerst.) ; Bacterium fusiforme
  (Warm.); B. P<U+FB02>iigeri (Ludw.) ; Beggiatoa mirabilis (Cohn); Phrag
  midoth'ria: multiseptata (Engler); Bacterium litoreum (Warm.); Beg

   (Warm.) ; Monas M'iillemli“ (Warm.),             and some others.         Here, again,
  an enormous <U+FB01>eld exists for further research.
       Spirillum Rosenbergi'i (Warm.) and S. attenuaium (Warm.), and
  some other imperfectly studied forms, affect brackish waters; while
   Crenothm'x polyspo'ra, Cladothm'x dichotoma, and Leptothrix ochmcea
   (Kiitz.) are described as especially occurring in stagnant waters rich
  in iron<U+FB01> and certain other species are found in sulphur springs, and
   even secrete sulphur in their cells :—-e.g., Beggiatoa. alba, Monas
   Okenii,       Olathrocystis 'roseo-pers'icina,    Sarcina sulphumta (Winogr.),
   Menus vinosa, and a series of other forms:
       Others, again, are met with in warm springs, e.g., Sphoerott'lus
   thermalis (Kiitz.), and Sph. lacteus (Kiitz.), Detoniella lutea, (Kiitz.),
   Beggiatoa arachnoidea (Ag), B. alba. (Vauch.), and others.
       Many of the foregoing species, and others referred to in Appen
   dix B, p. 244, may be regarded as water-bacteria, i.e., as forms more or
   less habituated to life in natural waters; but, as already stated, some
   must be looked upon as occasional intruders, introduced temporarily
   with foreign matters.
        Owing to the importance of some of these forms in causing
   diseases in man and other animals, it is necessary to look with grave
   suspicion on waters that give evidence of their presence, and we must
   devote special attention to these, as most closely connected with the
   subject which we have in hand.
       The literature concerning these pathogenic forms in water is almost
   daily increasing : quite recently '1‘ils§ has found Staphylococcus pyo
   genes aureus in town water.
        Passing over the strong presumptive evidence that Koch’s Spirillum
   cholerw as'iaticw is an aquatic form native to the waters in Bengal, it

§   II.   On some Relations between       the  Bacteriological Contents of Water
                                and the Environment.
     Although the evidence on which the above statements are founded
is of unequal value in different cases, it may be regarded as estab
lished that the germs of pathogenic Schizomycetes do occasionally
occur in waters used for domestic purposes, and the records of medical
literature fully bear out this conclusion<U+FB01>“
     The next point for discussion is, How do these germs <U+FB01>nd their
 way into potable waters?
     It seems capable of proof that water, as such, does not necessarily
contain any bacteria at all, for if it is examined at the source of deep
springs, or in the deep subterranean layers tapped by artesian well
pipes, it is found to be either wholly or practically free from
organisms at or near the source.                  Moreover, it is an axiom that,
in cases where the water-supply is drawn from rivers, there are more
 bacteria as we go towards the mouth, and fewer as we ascend the
heights of the watershed; whilst the gain in bacteria, both as
regards forms and numbers of individuals, is marked below each
town or inhabited area through which the river <U+FB02>ows.T
      We now proceed to the questions, Why are the deep waters below
the sub-soil free from germs?               How do they become contaminated

   subsequently P And, what relations subsist between the facts eluci
   dated and the questions concerned in our enquiry ?
       The purity of the subterranean waters is certainly not due directly
   to the rain which falls on the land (and which is, of course, the
   original source of such waters) being devoid of germs; because, in the
   <U+FB01>rst place, much of this rain is already contaminated before it touches
   the soil, by bacteria suspended in the air, and secondly, because the
   instant that the rain touches any ordinary soil it becomes abundantly
   contaminated with micro-organisms.
       So long as this water is near the surface of the soil, it forms, in
  fact, a medium admirably adapted for the growth and multiplication
  of the myriads of Schizomycetes and other organisms with which the
  surface soil teems.
      It is this surface water <U+FB02>owing off the land into our rivers, open
  wells, &c., which so abundantly contaminates them by carrying with
  it, not only the microbes themselves, but also the soluble organic and
  mineral matters which serve them as food materials?
      As the rain water percolates into the land, however, more or less
  of it soon sinks to levels below those at which there is danger of its
  emerging as a contaminating <U+FB02>uid, and in this process of percolation
  two important changes take place.                  Firstly, as the water passes from
  the surface soil to the sub-soil, it leaves behind it both soluble and
  suspended matters: certain of its salts are retained in the <U+FB01>lms on
  the surfaces of the particles of earth, whilst other salts become dis
  solved in it; it is also, to a great extent, deprived of its dissolved
  oxygen, and a large proportion of its suspended germs are held back
  in the capillary interspacesxt              In the subsoil, the water is in contact
  with Schizomycetes of quite different nature from those in the well
  aérated surface soil, rich in organic and other food materials, and
  although these anaerobic organisms of the deeper layers are not
  necessarily less injurious, or otherwise, than the aerobic forms in the

-  1" The remarkably   impure deep well water examined by Rohn and Wichmann
(‘ Mitth. d. Oesterr. Versuchstat. f. Brauerei u. Malzerei,’ H. 2) must surely have
been connected with surface waters !

      It is also clear that pathogenic forms <U+FB01>nd their access to such
 waters by the same routes as saprophytic and harmless ones, a point
 of primary importance when we re<U+FB02>ect on the danger of such being

 Bacillus anthracis <U+FB01>nd their way from the bodies of animals to the
 surface waters of meadows, and thence into rivers, must be accepted
 as proved by the researches of Pasteur and Koch)“ and our knowledge
in this connexion suggests only too plainly what may occur in other
cases, thus explaining the observed facts that the microbes of typhoid,
cholera, septicaamia, &c., do occur in exposed waters; and connecting
the presence of other pathogenic forms, known to be cast off in secre
tions, dejecta, &c., with the suspicious aroused from the washing of
milk vessels, &c., with such waters.
     It is necessary to bear in mind, however, that although the vista of
possibilities here opened out is a real one, most of the bacteriological
examinations of water support the conclusion that by far the majority
of the Schizomycetes met with in natural waters are harmless, or at
least are not capable of producing disease directly in those who drink
the waters.
      Such conclusions have led to speculations, in di<U+FB01>erent directions, as
to why the bacteriological examination of waters has, so far, seldom
led to the detection of pathogenic forms, although such waters are
exposed to contamination.
      Firstly, it is possible that a Schizomycete should lose its virulence
Or be weakened, or even die, when transferred from a suitable medium
into one so thin and innutritious as any ordinary potable water would
be; secondly, quite apart from the scarcity of food materials, it
requires some re<U+FB02>ection to thoroughly grasp how great must be the
changes in the circumstances which a given pathogenic form—say, the
anthrax bacillus, for argument—meets with when it leaves the living

  body of a sheep and is carried into a stream.                 In considering this
  example,     the  observed    facts as to  the susceptibility of anthrax to low
  temperatures        should    be  borne   in  mind.     The great reduction in
  temperature would alone suf<U+FB01>ce to impress it with e<U+FB02>’ects very different
  from those of its previous environment—the tissues of a warm
  blooded animal—and matters would be made no simpler by the
  di<U+FB01>erences in exposure to the oxygen of the air, the light of the sun,
  and so forth.“"                                                 ,
      That such     a  view is not without foundation is suf<U+FB01>ciently proved
  by recent researches on the action of heat, light, and oxygen on this
  very bacillus in question.
      To take the case of temperature <U+FB01>rst. It is generally agreed that
  Bacillus anthracis cannot go on growing and dividing below about
  15° (1., nor above about 45° 0., and that it thrives best at some
  temperature near 35° 0.; it is also agreed that it is markedly
  susceptible to the presence of free oxygen in its normal development.
  Although undoubtedly favoured by presence of oxygen, the anthrax
  bacillus will grow in the presence of only a very small quantity of air,
  (Liborius, ‘Zeitschr. f. Hyg.,’ l, p. 170).          Under favourable circum
  stances, but only if oxygen is present and the temperature fairly
 high, the bacilli form spores in their interior.                 This complicates
 the matter under discussion, for these spores are sometimes capable
 of remaining uninjured for long periods under conditions which would
 inevitably kill the vegetative rodlets.
      Now Roux? has lately shown that in a given culture containing
 these spores some individuals are more resistant than others, and that
 when germinating it is of importance to a given spore whether it is
 near the surface of a liquid or deeper down; that at high tempera
 tures, in contact with free atmospheric oxygen, the virulence of a
 given culture can be attenuated,I though no such attenuation results
when out of contact with air.
     These are by no means all the facts that have to be regarded, however.

                        Report on the Bacteriology           of lVater.                 199
        A large number of investigators, by                means     of researches <U+FB01>rst
     started   by Downes and Blunt in 1877,”" in this country, and carried
     on ever since by others, have shown that the action of the sun’s rays
     has to be taken into
                              consideration when dealing with questions of the
     vitality or rate of growth, &c., of the spores and rodlets of this and
     other Schizomycetes.
        The controversy is too long for full treatment in this report, but
     the upshot of the whole may be summed up as follows.                   Certain rays
    of light, apparently more especially those known as the “chemical
    rays/’1' so a<U+FB01>ect the germinating spores of certain bacteria (Bacillus
    typhosus, Bacteria anthracis), in presence of air, that their growth is
    inhibited. The presumption is that the solar rays enhance certain
    oxidation processes in the living protoplasm, but questions also arise
    in some cases as to possible e<U+FB01>ects on the nutritive media as well,
    though Janowski certainly seems to have eliminated these in his
    cultures of the typhoid bacillus}:
        A second possible view as to the fate of a given species of bacterium
   When suddenly washed into a stream is that it remains there un
   altered, and that the chances are so enormously against its being
   detected, or (what, from some points of View, is the same thing)
   against its <U+FB01>nding a suitable nidus in a living animal, that it simply
   wanders passively in the waste of waters surrounding it for an in
   de<U+FB01>nite period, or until it reaches the sea.
       This View also must be faced as one not altogether unsupported by
   observations, but only on the understanding that the microbe is in the
   spore stage, or, at least, passes into that condition soon after reaching
  the water, for the weight of bacteriological experience is distinctly
  against the probability of a living Schizomycete, in the simple vege
  tative condition, remaining as such for any length of time, at any rate
  in such a dilute medium as potable water.
       With spores the matter is different. Dnclaux found old spores of
  certain forms which had been kept out of contact with air for several
  years to be still capable of germination when sown in suitable

 media,* and it is well known what extremes of temperature, &c.,
 spores can withstand. At the same time, since the rule is that a spore
 germinates in even dilute solutions, when transferred thither, in
presence of oxygen and if the temperature rises, it may be regarded
 as probable that, for aerobic bacteria at any rate, the changing con
 ditions in a river, &c., will prevent its remaining merely passive—
 all available evidence is rather in favour of its either growing or
 else dying if it cannot adapt itself to the circumstances, although
 the death of spores may be delayed for many months and possibly
 even longer.
    Indeed, recently, strong evidence has been produced, showing that
pathogenic microbes may sink to the bottom of lakes and rivers and
there remain in a living state, amongst the sediment or mud, for very
long periods of time, until in fact, some <U+FB02>ood or other disturbance
causes them to become once more suspended in the water, when they
may be carried by a stream or current to another place. It is obvious
that this hitherto but little recognised factor is of the very highest
importance in connexion with the supply of water from rivers subject
to objectionable      pollutionj'
   A third view is possible, viz., that the Schizomycete <U+FB01>nds the new
environment at least not unsuited to its immediate requirements,
and that it grows and multiplies more or less successfully in the large
mass of water.
   This unquestionably happens with some forms, which, as we have
seen, are so well adapted for life in rivers, ponds, and even pipes,
that they have long been known as aquatic speciesl        As has been
stated, and will be seen more clearly shortly, however, this is also
true, to a limited extent, of many forms, including certain patho
genic species, which are only met with in natural waters as in
truders; they are able to maintain themselves alive for variable
periods, and then usually succumb.
   Before passing to this part of the subject, we wish to remark upon
the method for a long time employed in the bacteriological examina
tion of water, and on some of the general results obtained.
   Since 1881 it has been almost universally the custom to employ
the gelatine-plate cultures as devised by Koch.      A measured small
quantity of the water to be examined is added to the nutrient gela

 need not go into the particular         methods of sterilisation, protection,
 incubation, &c.; suf<U+FB01>ce it to say that in a few hours or days colonies
 of bacteria appear on the culture plates, and the number of indi
 vidual     bacteria in the measured sample of water is estimated from
 these,    on the assumption       that each colony has sprung from one
 germ.
     The comparison of numerous researches         made in recent years, and
 the   experience   gradually being gained in all branches of the technique
 of the subject, have slowly led to the detection of numerous fallacies
 in the almost established mode of procedure.
     In the <U+FB01>rst place, it was soon apparent that the mere numbers of
 bacteria, per cubic centimetre of water, are in no sense a satisfactory
 guide to the <U+FB01>tness of such water for domestic          purposes; it may be
 quite     true  that   one  revolts  from  a  water  proved   to yield large
 numbers of colonies of       bacteria, and  one can understand that a water
yielding even 500 colonies per cubic centimetre should be preferred
to one yielding, say, 5000 colonies        per cubic centimetre, but, so long
 asthis choice is based on the assumption that more numbers decide
the safety       or danger of the water, it 'is utterly fallacious.        The
 500 colonies may contain some which have been developed                 from
pathogenic germs, while the 5000 may have all arisen from harmless
forms.        This consideration entirely invalidates all the older conclu
sions, which were made in some quarters, as to a given water being
good or bad according          as it yields few or many colonies per cubic
centimetre on plate cultures; the only test is to determine what the
bacteria of the different colonies are, and the only general deduction
0f any value to _be drawn from mere              quantitative bacteriological
determinations        is, that a water obviously containing a number of
di<U+FB01>erent species is, on the whole, more likely to have been subjected
to contamination than one which contains but few different kinds.
    A water should be suspected, therefore, and subjected, to further
examination, if it yields several di<U+FB01>erent kinds of colonies unknown
to the    investigator.
    As a matter       of practical experience, it is certainly impossible to
rapidly identify more than a few colonies in such cultivations;           if a
complete investigation of the life histories, &c., of all the forms were
attempted, the bacteriological examination of a single sample of water
might take years, and consequently this part of the subject is the one
which awaits and invites the attention of numerous and energetic,
properly equipped workers.
    Then as to the primary assumption which lies at the base of all the
 older plate cultures.        This was that each colony has taken origin
                                                                   P 2

from one germ, isolated at the time of infecting the gelatine, and
which developed in the medium during the period of culture.
   In the <U+FB01>rst place, the conclusion that each colony has sprung from
one germ is a mere assumption, and it is to be viewed with suspicion
at the outset.   Cramer’l“ showed that bacteria have a habit of sticking
together in the water, and several other observersf have shown that
this is a. real danger in all bacteriological analyses, and that indi
vidual colonies often result from the growth, &c., of not one, but
many agglomerated spores or segments.            Many observers have
 attempted to get over this dif<U+FB01>culty by shaking the sewing in
 distilled water, before infection.    Wol<U+FB01>hiigel and Riedel suggest the
 possibity that there are dangers connected with this method also, e.g.,
 removal of gases, oxidation, dzc.     It is even asserted that prolongedI
 mechanical shaking affects the growth of bacteria, but this concerns
 the transit, &c., of cultures rather than the point under discussion.
    It has been suggested that the best method for ensuring separation
from one another of the bacteria would be to pass the water through
sterilised glass wool, as Elfving did f0r spores of fungi ;§ only there
would be some loss.       Thoroughly sterilised cotton wool, or even <U+FB01>lter
papers, may   be  used,  but there is danger of washing traces of soluble
substances from these.
   The question as to whether the colonies result from a single germ
or from an agglomeration is, after all, not a matter of such grave
importance as might at <U+FB01>rst sight appear, for if the precaution be
taken, as it invariably should be, of violently agitating the sample of
water immediately before making a plate cultivation, it is obvious
that any conglomerate which may be present and does not yield to this
treatment          is,
               for practical purposes,      single source of infection, and
                                                            a
will thus give rise to a single colony.

volume of the infecting water as will yield a manageable number of
such centres of liquefaction.
  But these are by no means the only sources of fallacy incidental to
the methods of gelatine-plate cultures. It has been implied by some
of the       earlier workers, rather than de<U+FB01>nitely assumed,                  that all the
living germs in the sample of water mixed with the nutrient gelatine:“
will give rise to colonies, provided the plate culture is thin enough
to       ensure the access of oxygen to all parts, the sample small enough
to        ensure isolation of the individual    bacteria or spores, and the
temperature         a suitably high one to promote rapid growth,                       without
preventing the proper solidi<U+FB01>cation of the medium.
  As matter of fact, there are serious fallacies traceable        to all these
implications.         Many bacteria      are now known which are incapable of
growing in presence of the oxygen of the air, while others will only
withstand partial pressures of that gas; it may be safely concluded
that the   gelatine-plate cultures give no account whatever of these
forms,  although they may and often do occurin tap waters,1‘ &c.
  Moreover, even the thinnest layer of gelatiue may so far hinder the
access of oxygen to completely submerged aerobic forms as to retard
their growth, and so they become dominated by the more rapid de
velopment of other colonies.     This domination is not necessarily due
to the mere <U+FB02>ooding of the suppressed    forms with lique<U+FB01>ed gelatine:
GarréI showed a short       time  ago that some bacteria, growing on
gelatine side by side with other species, can inhibit the life-actions of
the latter by the poisonous in<U+FB02>uence of their metabolic products, and
Miquel§ claims to have proved similar actions in water, and even to
have isolated the toxic principles, and rendered other water immune
by their aid.

    Again, as is well known, there are several forms which will not
 grow on gelatine at all,"E and there are others which grow so slowly
 that they will not be counted in the estimations made by gelatine
 plate cultures, either because the colonies formed in the time are too
 small to be seen, or because they succumb to dominant forms-for it
 must never be forgotten that, among competing Schizomycetes, it is
 especially the early forms which gain the advantage, as elsewhere in
                      '
 nature.
    Finally, since the temperature has been shown to be such a deter
 mining factor in the growth and multiplication of bacteria, we may
 be sure that this item affects these plate cultures also, and it is well
 known that di<U+FB01>erent numbers are obtained according to the tem
 perature of incubation, and with reference to this point it is especially
to be noted that the Optimum temperatures for different bacteria
may differ considerably.i'
   Taking all the facts into consideration, therefore, it is necessary to
regard the gelatine-plate method as an imperfect one at best. But if we
inquire whether there is a better one, we are bound to reply that there
is not, at any rate for general purposes; but for special requirements
it is possible to devise several modi<U+FB01>ed methods for the culture of par
ticular forms, and this has been done in certain cases.
             §    III.    The   Vitality of Micro-Organisms in    Water.
    It is now time to enter upon the special literature dealing with the
behaviour of selected forms of Schizomycetes in particular samples
of water, and we propose to treat this somewhat more in detail, and
in chronological order, so far as possible, because it bears directly
on the subject of our enquiryl
   This invesigation followed as the natural corollary to the discovery
that some micro-organisms can multiply to a most extraordinary
extent in waters almost entirely destitute of organic matter, like
distilled water. The <U+FB01>rst recorded instance of such multiplication
   * Some of these are of the highest importance in connexion with the chemical

in distilled water was made by one of us in 1885,* on which occasion it
was   found that in the course of forty-eight hours the number of
microbes had increased from 1073 in the cubic centimetre to 418,100
in the same volume.     Similar instances of multiplication in the pure
spring water supplied to Munich were published shortly afterwards,
by LeoneJ whilst the same phenomenon was observed by Crameri in
the case of the microbes present in the waters of the Lake of
Zurich.
     Similar               phenomena           formed the subject of more extensive investiga
tions contained  in three memoirs, which appeared almost simul
taneously in 1886 by Wol<U+FB01>hiigel and Riedel,§ by Meade Bolton,"
and by one of us<U+FB01> Each of these not only con<U+FB01>rmed the rapid and
extensive multiplication of microbes, even in the purest natural
waters, but di<U+FB01>ered from the predecessors in recording the results
of experiments in which speci<U+FB01>c pathogenic forms were introduced
into natural waters of di<U+FB01>erent kinds, including sewage.    It will be
convenient to discuss, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, these three contributions
to the subject along with another by Heraeus, which appeared     shortly
afterwards.
   In Meade Bolton’s paper,** after referring to the literature regard
ing the general bacterial contents of ordinary waters, and criticising
the various methods hitherto in vogue, the following generalisations
are made -—                                                         '
   1. Ordinary waters always contain some bacteria.
   2. The numbers of individuals and species vary in different waters,
and from time to time.
   3. Certain forms predominate, because they can multiply readily
in such waters, as is proved by their rapid increase when the water
is allowed to stand for a few days.
   4. After the climax of increased numbers has been obtained, the
bacteria gradually diminish in quantity.
   Bolton established the truth of these conclusions, and showed that
the growth and increase of these water bacteria differ according to

  the     kind of water, the temperature and other external conditions
  remaining the same.
       He gives examples showing that the increase is most rapid, as a
  rule, during the <U+FB01>rst thirty-six hours, and then a diminution sets in,
  day after day, ending in the water containing a smaller number than
  at <U+FB01>rst.
       This gradual diminution was not due to mere precipitation, but
  was, perhaps, in part to be accounted for by the coherence of the
  germs in clamps, and in part to actual death.
       He then isolated and described sixteen of the commonest species,
  which were shown to actually grow and multiply in ordinary drinking
  waters.
       Two of these forms were shown to be capable of easy multiplication
  in such waters, and that quite independently of the chemical con
  stitution of the waters. He found that they <U+FB02>ourished in the purest
  distilled water he could obtain, as well as in “bad” water, and assumes
\
  that this is because the very small amount of organic nutriment they
  demand“ is never absent.
       Bolton concluded from his experiments that variations of tem
  perature, and in the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water, were
   far more important factors than the chemicals dissolved in ordinary
   waters.      In this conclusion, however, he is neither supported by his
   own. nor the previous experiments of Leone, for it was found by both
   that the multiplication was almost equally rapid if a stream of
   hydrogen or a stream of air was passed through the water.
       He further inferred that, in practice, the accumulation of bacteria.
   in pipe waters is due to the multiplication of forms (carried in by
    surface drainage in the <U+FB01>rst instance) in the standing water as the
    temperature rises.
        He then tried the effects of (1) distilled water, (2) common drink
    ing waters, and (3) badly contaminated waters, on speci<U+FB01>c pathogenic
    and other bacteria, obtained from pure cultures and added to the
    waters with as little traces of the culture medium as possible.                   In
    many of his experiments, however, he has apparently failed to secure
    this last-named condition, as in most cases the number of organisms
    introduced into the particular waters is recorded as “ un-countable,”
    thus clearly pointing to insuf<U+FB01>cient dilution before inoculation.                 To
     save repetition it must be mentioned that           all of Bolton’s experiments
     were made with waters previously sterilised by heat.
        * It is, however, much to be regretted that in not a single instance is the
     chemical composition of any of these waters recorded by the author.
        It may be observed here that we cannot accept,without reserve, general statements
     to the e<U+FB01>ect that pu/re water is capable of supporting the life of bacteria.  Miquel
     shows how such water, which may be obtained in quantity by simple condensation
     (‘Annlyse Bact. des Eaux,’ p. 156), is incapable of supporting bacterial life
     (pp. 157—158).

     He found that        spore-free bacilli of Bacillus anthracis rapidly die
  o<U+FB02>‘  in tap water;      whereas, in the condition of spores, this organism
  may remain alive in such waters for nearly a year.
      Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus may live for from ten to twenty, to
 upwards of thirty days in ordinary and bad waters respectively.
     Microcoocus tetragenus rapidly disappeared in every case in less than
 four to six days.
     Bacillus typhi abdominalis lived in some cases upwards of fourteen
 days in the absence of spores, and upwards of thirty to forty days in
 the form of spores.
      In all these cases the two most important factors were the presence
 of spores and the temperature; the bacteria were eliminated the more
 rapidly the higher the temperature ; they resisted the longer the
 more they had matured their spores.               This was true, assuming that
 no proteids or other assimilable organic bodies were added to the water.
     None of Meade Bolton’s experiments were made with simultaneous
presence of water bacteria: on the whole, subsequent researches
have shown that the presence of forms which easily <U+FB02>ourish in
ordinary waters hurries the elimination of the intruding pathogenic
forms.
     Heraeus<U+FB01>‘ in his general conclusions supports those of Meade
Bolton in most of the important respects, and especially the rapid
increase of individuals of the bacteria in ordinary waters.                  He insists
on the fact that certain forms multiplied in solutions absolutely
devoid of organic materials.
    At the same time, he concludes from his experiments that a “ bad”
water suits the bacteria better than good drinking water; and this
conclusion is of course in accordance with all ordinary experience,
since a
             “ bad ” water contains relatively much organic matter.
     The important paper by Wol<U+FB01>hiigel and Riedel<U+FB01> which may next
be    examined, is full of excellent hints on methods, and of references
to     work bearing        on   the subject, and contains several valuable
warnings as to sources of error in such investigations.                    The authors
insist that the composition of the water is of importance, and in this
 respect place themselves in direct antagonism to Meade Bolton}
 They employed both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, and
 sterile as well as normal waters.

 little stress on the constitution of the water.

    These authors prove that very minute traces of organic materials in
a water induce rapid multiplication            of certain species, that the tempe
rature and quiescence of the water are important, and discuss the
question as to the effects of mechanical shakings“ of the waters, e.g.,
in transit. They leave this matter undecided, but are of opinion that
it will have to be reckoned with by bacteriologists.
     As regards pathogenic species, they found that Bacillus anthracis
multiplied in the dirty water of the River Panke, both normal and
when sterilised by heat,+ so long as the temperature was high enough
(12—15° C. to 30--—35o C.) ; but that at low temperatures the bacilli
did not <U+FB02>ourish, and even died off.
     Typhoid bacilli (“ ileo-typhus ”) lived for some time, and even
multiplied, in (sterilised) ordinary drinking water, as well as in the
(sterilised) bad waters.          In distilled water they gradually died out,
though they may require twenty days or more to do so. In non
sterilised waters they found that they grew so slowly that they were
swamped by other forms on the gelatine-plate test-cultures, thus
showing how dif<U+FB01>cult it is to obtain a satisfactory result in such
experiments.
     To obviate this dif<U+FB01>culty they placed the typhoid bacillus in
selected waters, containing selected water bacteria, and they then found
that it lived so long that they felt constrained to warn us that this
dangerous form may maintain itself for weeks : they also prove that
milki is a good vehicle for it, and that the belief in the danger of
washing milk-cans with water containing typhoid bacilli is a well
founded one.
     Cholera spirilla were found to maintain themselves for seven days
at least in all kinds of sterile waters, and to be still present in some
cases even after eighty-two days.               In unsterilised waters, however,
this form is soon overcome.             Here, as in other cases, the temperature
was found to be important.
    A curious result is worth noting. They found that the cholera
spirilla take some time to accommodate themselves to the exigencies
of a water containing competing forms, and consequently the latter
usually dominate and eliminate the former. But in certain cases the
cholera spirilla do accommodate themselves to the circumstances for a
time, and if such specimens be then removed and placed in a fresh
sample of the water they multiply at once, and are much more

      In distilled water the cholera spirilla usually died off rapidly,“i but
  cases happened where they lived for thirty-three               days; possibly the
  distilled water contained impurities in these cases.
      The authors insist on the danger of cholera germs in water, and
 expecially in ordinary river, well, and tap waters, which showed the
 presence of living cholera germs seven months after infection.
      In the paper by one of us1' the particular waters submitted
 to examination were those of the rivers Thames and Lea before and
 after <U+FB01>ltration by the several London Companies, as well as the deep
 well water from the chalk supplied by the- Kent Company. It was
 found that the microbes in the un<U+FB01>ltered waters underwent but little
 multiplication, and in some cases very considerable diminution, on
 standing at the ordinary temperature of the air, whilst at a tempera
 ture of 35° C. very rapid multiplication took place, which was followed
 by subsequent decline.           In the case of the <U+FB01>ltered river waters, on
 the other hand, there was invariably a large increase, especially at the
high temperature, also followed, however, by a subsequent decline.
By far the most rapid multiplication was observed in the case of the
organically pure deep-well water; thus on one occasion the numbers
rose from 7 to 495,000 in the course of three days when the water
was kept at 20° (3.; the tendency to a subsequent decline was, how
ever, also exhibited. On these surprising results the author points
out that the deep-well water is at the outset almost wholly free from
micro-organisms, and that it has never before been inhabited by such
living matters, and that it is only reasonable to infer, therefore, that
these of its ingredients which are capable of nourishing the particular
micro-organisms which <U+FB02>ourish in it are wholly untouched, whilst in
the case of the river waters, the most available food supply must have
been largely explored by the numerous generations of micro-organ
isms which have inhabited them.                   Further, he remarks that the
number of different varieties of micro-organisms is far greater in the
case of the river waters than in that of the deep-well water, and that
in the latter case, therefore, the organisms present will probably have
 a freer <U+FB01>eld for multiplication than in the presence of competitors,
 some of which may not improbably give rise to products which are
 hostile to others.
     In a similar manner he explains the greater capacity for multipli
 cation exhibited by the <U+FB01>ltered as compared with the un<U+FB01>ltered river
    ‘                                                                        ‘
        As the authors point out, this agrees with Babes’ results (Virchow’s Arch. f.

  (‘Revue d’Hyg.,’ 1885, No. 5, p. 353).     Since the latter employed liquid cultures
 of the bacilli, they probably introduced food materials into the water.

varieties of micro-organisms is largely reduced, as is at once seen by
the inspection of the plate cultivations, and those varieties which
remain have, therefore, a more favourable opportunity for reproduc
tion than in the presence of more numerous varieties.*                            '
     The speci<U+FB01>c forms experimented with were the Bacillus pyocyaneus
(from green pus), Finkler-Prior’s Spirillum, and Koch’s Spirillum 0f
Asiatic cholera ; they were in all cases introduced into sterilised waters
only.
     The Bacillus pyocyaneus was found to multiply extensively in distilled
water, <U+FB01>ltered Thames water, deep-well water, and London sewage.
Finkler-Prior’s Spirillum, on the other hand, exhibited a most extra
ordinarysusceptibility        to immersion in water, for in none of these
waters could its presence be demonstrated after the <U+FB01>rst day.
     The results obtained with Koch’s Spirillum of Asiatic cholera were
particularly instructive, for when this was taken from a- weak culture
in gelatine, the spirilla were no longer demonstrable after the <U+FB01>rst
 day in the infected waters, but when the spirilla of the same cultiva~
tion were revivi<U+FB01>ed by cultivation in broth and then introduced into
 the aqueous media they were found to multiply abundantly in the
 sewage, whilst in the deep-well and <U+FB01>ltered Thames water they
 underwent numerical reduction in the <U+FB01>rst instance, followed by
 slight multiplication, which was again succeeded by decline, and on
 the ninth day they were still demonstrable.              A temperature of 35° C.
 caused their more rapid destruction, as con<U+FB01>rmed by the results of
 other investigators.
     In a later paper by one of us1' the author <U+FB01>nds that the cholera
 spi’rilltl have remained alive for eleven months in the sterile sewage,
 and in further experiments with Bacillus anthracis, he found that in
 sterile distilled and in sterile <U+FB01>ltered Thames water the organisms
 remained alive for upwards of sixty days, a considerable diminution
 taking place during the <U+FB01>rst days, after which the numbers remained
  practically constant. The initial diminution, he suggests, is due to
 the dying off of the bacilli, the spores alone surviving.               In sterile
  London sewage Bacillus (mthmcis underwent considerable multiplica
  tion. Experiments were also made with the Streptocoecus of e'rysi
 pelas (Fehleisen), which was apparently destroyed within one hour

    Kraus contributed a valuable paper in 1887.“ After pointing out
that,     important as are the results of Meade Bolton, and of Wol<U+FB01>hiigel
and Riedel, to science, they have very little practical utility, because
(1) they concern chie<U+FB02>y sterilised waters, which do not occur in the
open, and (2) the temperatures employed were too high to be com
pared with what happens in daily life, this author proceeds to
describe his results with ordinary drinking waters kept at about
105° C.
     He found that the typhoid bacillus under these circumstances soon
succumbs to the rapidly increasing “ water forms,” and that it was
eliminated in seven days.

      Kraus concludes that much more must be put down to the direct
 effect of the competing bacteria in such cases, than to the quality of
the water or the original number 0f forms contained in it.
     We may remark in this connexion that it bears out what is also
deducible from the preceding results of Bolton and Wolffhiigel and
Riedel,I and further, that this view of Kraus is distinctly supported
by our knowledge of the competing action of dominant forms, due to
their successful seizure of oxygen, food materials, &c., on the one
hand, and to the toxic actions of their metabolites on the other.§ It
is not improbable            that sterilisation by heat acts both by setting free
food materials in the form of dead bacteria, as well as by destroying
                                                                              '

    1' These and similar results        with mixtures of microbes must be received with
 great     caution, as already pointed out, for it has been proved by Gruber (‘ Wiener
 Mediz. Wochensch.,’ 1887, Nos. 7 and 8) that on placing the cholera spirilla in
 contact with ordinary putrefaction bacteria, the latter, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, gain an
 enormous numerical ascendency over the cholera spirilla ; but if the struggle
 between the two be suf<U+FB01>ciently protracted, the cholera spirilla can, at the close of
 the putrefaction process, be still found in the living state.
     : Bolton, however, made no experiments with unsterile water; and Wol<U+FB02>’hiigel
 is far from convinced        as to the destruction    of typhoid bacilli by water bacteria,
 putting down their absence on the plate cultures rather to experimental dif<U+FB01>culties of

of the competing bacteria, and the vitality of the cholera germs them

     Among other factors which in<U+FB02>uence the life of microbes in water,
carbon dioxide may be assumed to be of importance: most forms are
in<U+FB02>uenced more or less adversely, whilst perhaps some are not sus

     At the same time, the preliminary diminution of numbers during

 Braem has shown pretty clearly that in some cases, at any rate,*
 distilled    water kills anthrax and cholera bacilli,            as well as Staphylo
 coccus    pyogenes aureus, though not always rapidly.                    Thus cholera
 lived for 24 hours, anthrax from 8 to 12 days, while the Staphylo
 coccus required 25 to 50 days for its elimination.
    Braem says that the typhoid bacilli were still active after 60 days
in     distilled water, and were not eliminated till 188 days had
passed.
    In the present     state   of our knowledge such results          can most reason
ably be        explained    on    one    of the three following assumptions :—
(1) Either the distilled water was not pure (i.e., it was contaminated
in the still, or more probably by food materials carried in during in
fection) ; or (2) the products of decomposition of the dead and dying
bacteria during the sojourn in the water, afforded food materials
for the rest.          Most probably both sources of error occur in
those cases where the increase is very marked and prolonged: of
course the products of decomposition of previously living bacteria
would only account for a smaller number than the original, i.e., the
usual case. Whilst                 the possibility may be suggested, that the
progeny formed in the distilled water is of a degraded order, in which
the individuals have a smaller dry body weight than the original
forms introduced.                                      .
    Uffelmann,1' experimenting with the waters of Rostock, <U+FB01>nds that
typhoid bacilli, at ordinary temperatures, can hold their own for from
several days to two weeks; and that Bacillus anthracis remained alive
for three months. Although cholera germs are much less resistant,
yet they, also, may be carried in such waters as are used for domestic
purposes.
    KarlinskiI investigated          the bacteria of <U+FB01>ve Innsbruck           waters,  and
then determined their normal behaviour at 8° C. : in all, the numbers
of Schizomycetes increased when the water was allowed to stand at
this temperature.          He then infected these waters with the bacilli of
typhoid,      cholera,  and   anthrax, and kept them also at 8° 0., and found
that these all diminished rapidly in numbers in the struggle with
the increasing and eventually dominant water forms.                       Cholera could
not maintain itself for three days, typhoid not beyond six days, and
 anthrax three days at the given temperature. It will be noticed that
 this is a valuable con<U+FB01>rmation of Kraus’s results at 10'5° C.

     In   a second  paper,‘ Karlinski goes more deeply into the question
of the maintenance of the typhoid bacillus in a natural water, work
 ing in the open in order to avoid the errors due to con<U+FB01>ned samples
in the laboratory. The temperature, chemical constitution, and
 bacterial contents of the water were examined, and the well was then
infected with a bouillon culture of typhoid germs.
     Daily examination of the contents, continually stirred to prevent
precipitation, showed a rapid increase of the normal water bacteria,
and a corresponding decrease of the typhoid bacilli, till none of the
latter remained after fourteen days.
     The chemical constitution of the water, examined daily, also re
stored itself during the fourteen days through which the infection
lasted.      Other experiments con<U+FB01>rmed these results.
                     §  IV.    Summary and Conclusions.
     If  we now  try to put together the results of the various investiga
tions referred to, it is evident that the inquiry into the vitality of
micro-organisms in ordinary waters is by no means to be carried out
merely by putting such germs into a given water, leaving them there
for    a time, and simply determining their relative increase or decrease
during a given period.
     The <U+FB01>rst fact to be <U+FB01>rmly grasped is that water, as met with in
actual life, is a very variable medium indeed ; and that even when it
is admitted that such rough distinctions as are implied by the names
river water, spring and well water, distilled water, soft and hard
water, and so on, classify the subject but imperfectly, the matter
is by no means ended.           Not only are no two river waters alike in
constitution, but probably no two samples of distilled water are abso
lutely so when the original water has been taken from diiferent
sources in the <U+FB01>rst instance.
     The second great fact to be clearly apprehended is that a Schizo
mycete      is not only a very minute organism, but that it requires
correspondingly minute traces of food materials for its nutrition :
consequently there is less cause for surprise than is sometimes ex
pressed at the existence of such large numbers of these micro
organisms in a natural water which has passed over the soil in. con
tact with the atmosphere, and attained an ordinary temperature.
     A less obvious truth—but one that mu st be insisted upon—is that
a Schizomycete is an extremely delicate organism, simply because it
is a living being, and therefore its reactions to a medium such as an
ordinary water are far more delicate and complex than those of the
usual chemical reagents: furthermore, and this is one of the most

     important points of all, the                 living Schizomycete is          a variable factor       in
     itself, because     it has a variable organisatiou.* When, therefore, we
     place     bacteria in water, we must not expect the resulting reactions to
     be   constant.
          The matter is obviously rendered                  still     more complex when we turn
     a              of Schizomycete into a water already peopled with
          given species
           (and, therefore, presumably well adapted) forms of different
     aquatic
  species; for the whole teaching of biology shows that the competing
  organisms cannot exist side by side without alfecting the welfare of
  each.
          If   we assume           the simplest case,      for   the sake of argument, we have
  to      remember at least the following                  :—
          (1.) The water               itself a<U+FB01>ects the living speck of protoplasm we
 place          in it, not only mechanically, but              more especially physically
 and         chemicallysl'
             gases dissolved in the water exert pronounced elfects, as
         (2.) The
 is  known from the relations of oxygen and carbon dioxide to plant
 life in general, and from the effects of these and various other gases
 on       bacteria        in particular.
                Any dissolved or             suspended substances                in the water must
 exert   de<U+FB01>nite                 actions on the living organism.                This applies not only
 to the  minerals and organic substances in solution which are directly
  useful as food materials, but also to products of metabolism or of
 other chemical changes which are injurious to the life of the proto
 plasm of the microbe.    Moreover, it applies to suspended particles
 which exert surface attractions towards the suspended micro-organ
 isms,I or which affect the water in any way.
    (4.) The temperature of the water        as has been seen, of the is,
utmost importance for the life or otherwise of any given species   and                               ;
it requires but a moment’s consideration to see that this factor exerts
an important in<U+FB02>uence on all the preceding.
   (5.) Although we are still very ignorant of the relations of light
to   this subject, it   at any rate clear that in some cases at least
                                       is

cient quantity on water containing bacteria in suspension, and organic
substances in solution, but it is not probable that this forms an impor—
tant factor in the case of natural waters which cannot be subjected
in their entirety to direct insolation.
    (6.) The evidence is still less conclusive as regards mechanical
disturbances in the water, so far as they directly a<U+FB01>ect the living cells
of the micro-organisms, but it is at least highly probable that every
wind-raised wave, every tumble over a fall or weir, and every pause in
a backwater or lake, must affect the matter, if only in so far as it
alters the gaseous contents of the water, or the relative distances
between the individual micro-organisms.
    Enough has been said to show that the bacteriologist who attacks
the question before us must at least bear these facts in mind.‘
    Now, as to the questions of distilled as opposed to non-distilled
water, and of sterilised as opposed to non-sterile waters.
    It will be conceded forthwith that distilled, and we will assume
pure, water offers little scope for practical enquiry.                      Such water is
unknown in nature, except momentarily or in inaccessible forms, and
the only lessons to be expected from its action on bacteria are of
purely scienti<U+FB01>c and philosophical interest; distilled water, therefore,
should be used in check experiments, and the results compared with
those obtained with other waters, not forgetting that “ distilled
           ”
water is not a constant medium.
    As to experiments with sterilised water, the matter is very different,
for most observers are unanimous as to the longer vitality of patho
genie forms in sterilised water than in the same water before sterilisa
tion; the experiments in sterilised water may thus furnish us with the
 ultimate limits of vitality, and will, therefore, act as valuable guides.
     It must, however, be remembered that there are two ways of sterilis
 ing a W8,t61‘,1_' (l) by heat and (2) by <U+FB01>ltration. In both cases the con
 stitution of the water may be altered. Where heat is employed the
 gases are driven 01?. in whole or in part; soluble products may be
 rendered insoluble, e.g., carbonates precipitated ; the proteids, &c., of
 the killed micro-organisms are placed more or less at the disposal
 of the living ones which follow; and the solution (which a natural
 water really is) becomes more concentratedi                     Moreover, many meta
    * We have not thought it necessary to discuss the question             as to the action of
 electricity    on bacteria:   the results  hitherto   are negative, excepting   in so  far as
 electrical    currents  alter the chemical constitution of the medium.         For literature
 and.   criticism see Duclaux (“Action de         l’Electricité sur les Microbes,” ‘Ann. de
 l’Inst. Pa'st.,' vol. 4, 1890, pp. 677—680).
    1- It is obviously unnecessary to discuss sterilisation by means of antiseptic and
 poisonous substances, although this is, of course, of great importance in connexion
 with the treatment of sewage, &c.
    1 Though,      of course, there is not necessarily diminution in volume in the process
 of sterilisation.

 holites       of   the nature of ptomaines        and the like must       be altered   or
 destroyed.
   Filtration, through porous <U+FB01>lms of porcelain, certainly acts less
 violently on the water; but it must by no means be concluded that
 either the chemical constitution or the physical character of such
 <U+FB01>ltered water is absolutely unaltered. 1n the case of ordinary <U+FB01>ltra
 tion one series of changes alone, viz., the alteration of the propor
 tions of the gaseous contents owing to the dilference of pressure on
 the two sides of the <U+FB01>ltering <U+FB01>lm, will illustrate this.*
    On the whole, however, we may conclude that in cases where it is
 necessary to eliminate the living bacteria of a natural water, the
 process of <U+FB01>ltration through porous porcelain is a better method than
that of sterilisation by heat.
    There can be little doubt that some of the discrepancies between
the results of the various observers, referred to on pp. 204—214, are
chie<U+FB02>y due to the sources of di<U+FB01>erence here indicated.
    It may be concluded, with some show of certainty: (1) That the
numerical results obtained by the gelatiue-plate method, are, on the
average, too low.
    (2.) That several workers employed temperatures too high for
comparison with what occurs in natural waters in this country.
         That many of the results are vitiated by small quantities of
very concentrated food materials having been introduced into the
waters with the pathogenic germs employed for infection.
    (4.) That the conclusions drawn from experiments with distilled
water must be recelved with great caution, and are of little practical
value.     On the whole we may regard “pure” water as a worse
medium for the life of pathogenic bacteria? in spite of apparently
contradictory results in the hands of some of the investigators.
    (5.) That the conclusions drawn from cultures in sterile waters
must also be received with due regard to all the facts, and especially
those where the water was sterilised by heat.
    On the other hand, the enormously greater experimental di<U+FB01>iculties
attending the investigations in which unsterilised waters are 'used
necessitate that the results should also be very carefully scrutinised,
and should     not be <U+FB01>nally accepted until con<U+FB01>rmed by numerous
investigators attacking the question from different points of View, and
using different methods of research.

free from pathogenic  germs capable of living, any more than it is to
suppose that water in the form of ice, snow, hail, or rain is incapable
of conveying infection during times of epidemics; and that, in point
of fact, any water whatever may convey living pathogenic germs from
one place to another.
   (7.) That the periods through which pathogenic bacteria can live
in water vary according to a long series of circumstances, depending
especially on the nature and vigour of the germs, whether they form
spores or not, the chemical and bacteriological nature of the contents
of the water, the mode of contamination, and the temperature.
   (8.) That in all ordinary waters the rule is that the pathogenic
forms die out sooner or later, with or without previous temporary
multiplication; very commonly this <U+FB01>nal result is reached in three
stages : (a) a preliminary diminution, due to the death of large
numbers occasioned by the shocks induced by their altered environ
ment; (1)) a longer or shorter period of more or less active growth
and multiplication;      and (a) gradual diminution in numbers and
vigour, as the available food materials become exhausted.
   (9.) As regards speci<U+FB01>c forms of pathogenic bacteria, existing
information extends chie<U+FB02>y to the following :—*
   Spirillum cholera? asiaticw has been shown to live, and even multiply,
in drinking waters, though the results as to time are very con<U+FB02>icting;
whereas some found it dead after a couple of days, others state that
it lives a yearl' in such waters. It is impossible to reconcile all the
statements; the only points of general agreement seem to be that
cholera can be conveyed by water, and that it is, as a. rule, not very
resistant towards the competing forms.
   Bacillus typhosus.~——This seems to be much more resistant than the
cholera spirillum in most cases. Meade Bolton pointed out that it
needs far less organic material than cholera for its successful propa
gation in water. The results of several observers point to its being
able to retain its powers for at least three months in drinking or
river waters; but it seems to be eliminated more rapidly at higher
temperatures (above 18—20° C.) than at moderately low (8—12° C.)
ones.    It may certainly be regarded as more able to hold its own
against the resident forms in bad waters than is the cholera spirillnm,
 and some results even suggest that the presence of other forms
favours it (Hueppe, Hochstetter).       Karlinski’s and Holz’s researches,
 however, are decidedly opposed to this;

results.

     Bacillus anthracis.+The vegetative rodlets of this form are inva
 riably found to be less able to hold their own than the spores, a
 result quite intelligible from what is known of this well-studied
 Schizomycete. All agree as to the general fact that the spores of
 anthrax may live in sterile water for months without injury, provided
 the temperature is not too high.
     The Streptococcus of erysipelas appears to be remarkably susceptible
 to immersion in water; it was found to- be almost immediately
 destroyed in distilled water, and survived only <U+FB01>ve days in sterile
sewage and drinking water.
    Micrococcus tetragenus, according to Straus and Dubarry, can main
tain itself for 18—30 days in various waters, whilst Meade Bolton
gives it a much shorter lease of life.
                                                                                         i
    Bacillus tuberculosis lived for more than 115 days in distilled water,
and 95 in river water, according to Straus and Dubarry.                       Cornil"
kept     it alive   in Seine water  for  70 days.
    Staphylococcus pyogenes au'reus is said to live for more than 19 days
in  river water (Straus and Dubarry).
    The same observers give more than              50 days for the bacillus of
glanders, 30 days for the micrococcus of fowl-cholera, 17 days for the
bacillus of swine-plague, and 20 days for that of mouse-septicaemia.
Ferrari? found this form alive for several weeks in distilled water.

             A very valuable contribution, full of suggestions and facts.
   We now     append Lists (Appendix B) of all the species of Schizo
mycetes    detected  in various kinds of waters, so far as we have been
able to get at the records.
   The question of synonymy is, in the present state of bacteriology, a
very di<U+FB02>icult one; we have, in most cases, placed the best known
name <U+FB01>rst, but those who prefer to adopt other names may be referred
to Saccarrdo’s ‘ Sylloge Fungorum,’ vol. 8, 1890, for the synonyms and
descriptions of most of the species. Some of those recorded here are
new, having been published since the above work appeared; in the
case of these forms, the descriptions will be found in the memoirs
quoted.

                               VISION.
   The Committee on Colour-Vision appointed by the Council of
the    Royal Society on March 20, 1890, and consisting of the
following members :—The Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S., Chairman;
The Lord Kelvin, Pres. R.S. ; Mr. R. Brudenell Carter; Prof. A.
H. Church, F.R.S. ; Mr. J. Evans, Treas. R.S.; Dr. R. Farquharson,
M.P.; Prof. M. Foster, Sec. R.S.; Mr. F. Galton, F.R.S.; Dr. W.
Pole, F.R.S.; Sir G. G. Stokes, Bart, M.P., F.R.S.; and Captain
 W. de W. Abney, C.B., F.R.S., Secretary, now submit their Report,
with Minutes of the Evidence taken.
   The Committee have held 30 meetings, and have examined
more than 500 individuals as to their colour-vision.       They have
tried various methods and apparatus, including Holmgren’s wool
                 J
test with Dr. eaffreson’s and Dr. Thomson’s modi<U+FB01>cations, Lord
Rayleigh’s colour-mixing apparatus and that of Captain Abney,
Dr. Karl Grossmann’s system, the lantern devised by Mr. F.
Galton, and Mr. Lovibond’s tintometer.        They have taken the
evidence of Captain Steele, of the Board of Trade; Mr. Rosser,
a private instructor in navigation; Messrs. J. J. Hanbury,
A. S. H. Wadden, and Bambridge, connected with the colour
testing departments of certain railways; Captain Macnah, of the
Liverpool Board of Trade; Captain Angove, of the Peninsular
and Oriental Steamship Company; and the following surgeons
and experts in colour-vision testing :—Mr. Priestley Smith,
Mr. T. H. Bickerton, Mr. E. Nettleship, Staff-Surgeon T. J.
Preston, Dr. G. Lindsay Johnson, and Dr. Edridge Green.          The
Committee are under great obligations to Captain Abney, not
only for having of<U+FB01>ciated as Secretary, but also for his very con
siderable labour in the determination of colour-constants, the
registration of colours, and the examination, by spectral methods,
of particular cases of defective colour-vision.
   After weighing the evidence which they have obtained, the
Committee have unanimously agreed upon the following recom
mendations :—
    1.  That the Board of Trade, or some other central authority,
         should schedule certain employments in the mercantile
         marine and on railways, the <U+FB01>lling of which by persons
         whose vision is defective either for colour or form, or who
          are ignorant of the names of colours, would involve
          danger to life and property.
   2.   That the proper testing, both for colour and form, of al
          candidates for such employments should be compulsory.
                                                              U2

         Cated by the central authority.
    .  That the test for colour-vision should be that of Holmgren,
         the sets of wools being approved by the central authority
         before use, especially as to the correctness of the three
         test colours, and also of the confusion colours.      If the
         test be satisfactorily passed, it should be followed by the
         candidate being required to name without hesitation the
         colours which are employed as signals or lights, and also
         white light.
    .  That the tests for form should be those of Snellen, and that
         they should be carried out as laid down in Appendix
         VI. It would probably, in most cases, su<U+FB02>ice if half nor'
         mal vision in each eye were required.
  O.   That a candidate rejected for any of the speci<U+FB01>ed employ
         ments should have a right of appeal to an expert approved
         by the central authority, whose decision should be <U+FB01>nal.
    .  That a candidate who is rejected for naming colours
         wrongly, but who has been proved to possess normal
         colour-vision, should be allowed to be re-examined after a
         proper interval of time.
     . That a. certi<U+FB01>cate of the candidate’s colour-vision and form
         vision according to the appointed tests, and his capacity
         for naming the signal colours, should be given by the
         examiner; and that a schedule of persons examined,
         showing the results, together with the nature of the
         employments for which examinations were held, should be
         sent annually to the central authority.

         scheduled employments       should be examined for form
         VlSlOl'l.
 10. That the tests in use, and the mode of conducting examina
         tions at the different testing stations, should be inspected
          periodically by a scienti<U+FB01>c expert, appointed for that
          purpose by the central authority.       .
 11. That the colours used for lights on board ship, and for lamp
          signals on railways, should, so far as possible, be uniform,
          and that glasses of the same colour as the green and red
          sealed pattern glasses of the Royal Navy, should be
          generally adopted.
 1% That in case of judicial inquiries as to collisions or accidents,
          witnesses giving evidence as to the nature or position of
          coloured   signals or lights should be themselves tested
          for colour- and form-vision.

            Report    of  the  Committee   on  Colour-Vision.        283
    The reasons       on which the Committee         have based these
recommendations       are set forth in the following pages.
     The subject of colour-sense and its imperfections            is one
                                                                          InmducmrL
 which is necessarily of great scienti<U+FB01>c interest; but it also
 has a practical importance,          as it a<U+FB01>ects a de<U+FB01>nite     propor
tion of the men who are engaged in the two great indus
 tries of railway traf<U+FB01>c and of navigation.            Amongst railway
 men, at least,        if not also amongst sailors, a suspicion
 has been excited that the methods adopted for testing colour
 sense are not entirely trustworthy, and have had the effect of
 excluding some individuals from employments,              the duties of
 which they were well quali<U+FB01>ed to discharge.             On this ground
 alone, if on no other, it has seemed advisable to the Committee
 that the reasons for their recommendations should be so stated
as to be intelligible, as far as possible, to all those who are
 interested in the matter.
     Every colour, and among colours for convenience sake are
 included black and white, can be de<U+FB01>ned by three qualities z—lst,
 its hue—thus we talk of red, green, violet; 2nd, its purity, or
 the measure of its freedom from admixture with white—which is
 expressed by such terms as “deep” or “pale;” and 3rd, its
 brightness or luminosity—thus we say a colour is “bright,”
-or “dark.”       Two colours are identical only when they can
 be de<U+FB01>ned as possessing the same three colour qualities, or
constants as they are called, and if they differ in any one
 they are no longer the same. When two objects are compared
 together for colour, the large majority of persons will agree as
 to their identity or difference.        Their verbal descriptions of the
 difference may vary slightly, but practical tests show that
in reality they recognize the same variations, and hence their
 Vision is termed normal vision.            There is, however, not an
 inconsiderable minority, as will presently be shown, whose per
ception of colour diHers very widely from that of the majority,
 and, for want of a better term, members of this minority are
 called ‘* colour-blind.”     By this term it is not intended to convey
 the idea that there is absolute insensibility of vision, or even of
 colour-vision, but merely that the ordinary distinction between
 certain colours is defective          The variations in the amount of
 this de<U+FB01>ciency in colour-perception are numerous, and when
  small, are often exceedingly dif<U+FB01>cult to classify.
     We have to regard these deviations from normal vision more
 from a practical than from a theoretical standpoint, and in
  testing for them we have to take the broad view that the colour
  blindness which has to be detected is that which may be dan
 gerous to the public in the industries already mentioned.
     There are some few people who fail to distinguish blue               Character of
 from green, and others, equally few, who only see in mono-               °°_1°\u"  .
                                                                          bhndness'
 chrome, but the colour-blindness which is most common, and,
  therefore, most dangerous, is the so-called red-green blindness,
  in which there is a failure to distinguish between red and

              284        Report   of     the   Committee on Colour-Vision.
                  green; that is to say, a red-green blind person will regard a
                  certain hue of green as identical in colour with some hue of red,
                  another of green as identical with white, and some will also
                  fail to see red at all of another particular hue.        When it is
                  considered that on our railways white, green, and red lights are
                  used as safety and danger signals at night, and that the same
                  colours are not unfrequently used for a similar purpose by dayr
                  it is very obvious that to place persons who are red-green blind
                  in positions where the colours ought to be correctly recognised
                  may be the cause of disasters.     The same objection to the emplo '
                  ment of persons with defective colour-vision applies also to
                  navigation, for at night the presence of a green or red light on
                  the port or starboard side indicates the course that a vessel is
                  taking, and if either those in charge, or on the look-out, are
                  colour-blind, serious risks of collisions are run.
Descriptionof        It is proposed to enter somewhat minutely into the
tlle<U+FB02>l>°¢l"1'lm1- characteristics    of red-green blindness, showing how it may be
                  divided into two species.         For this purpose it is necessary
                  to appeal to the spectrum.            When a thin slice of white
                  light falls on one or more prisms, or on what is known as a
                  diffraction grating, it is decomposed into a parti-coloured band
                  which we call the spectrum, the principal colours, as given by
                  Newton, being red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
                  If the light be that from the sun innumerable black lines will
                  be seen interrupting this series of colours, some more marked
                  than others.      It is found that these lines always occupy the
                  same position as regards the colour in which they are situated,
                  and hence the more pronounced ones will act to the spectrum as
                  milestones do to a road.      Different coloured rays have di<U+FB01>erent
                  lengths of undulations in the all-pervading medium which is
                  called ether, and the wave lengths of the coloured rays which,
                  if present, would occupy the place of the principal black lines
                  have, notwithstanding their minuteness, been determined with
                  extreme accuracy, and this enables the position of any particular
                  hue of spectrum colour to be numerically <U+FB01>xed by a. reference to.
                  the wave lengths of these lines.         We have said that the prin
                  cipal spectrum colours are those stated above, but it must be
                  understood      that they are only fully recognized by persons
                  possessing normal vision; for the spectrum would be described
                  by a. colour-blind person in very different terms.      For instance,
                  some red-green blind would              say that the red,     orange,
                  and yellow were all yellow;            red would be described       as
                  dark yellow, orange as less dark, and yellow as bright yellow,
                  whilst the green part of the spectrum bordering on the yellow
                  would be described as yellow diluted with white.         In the pure
                  green would be pointed out a white or grey band, and the blue
                  green would be described as blue diluted with white;            whilst
                  the blue would be called light blue, and the violet dark blue
                  (see No. 2, Plate1).      Others, again, whilst similarly describing
                  the blue and violet part of the spectrum would substitute green.

           Report of     the Committee   on Colour- Vision.        285
 for yellow in the_above description of red, orange, yellow, and
 yellow-green, the brightest red would be called dark green,
 and they would fail to see at all in the extreme red, the
 spectrum being shortened.         These latter would also recognize
 a white or grey band, but it would be in a position rather
 nearer the blue of the spectrum than in the <U+FB01>rst case (see
 No. 3, Plate I).    It is needless to say that to normal vision this
 white or grey band is non-existent, and whenever a person
 under examination sees such a band the evidence is conclusive
 that he is colour-blind.       These differing descriptions    of the
spectrum show that this form of colour-blindness may be
 divided into two classes, which for convenience sake may
be termed green- and red-blindness.        Another point of difference
 between them is the part of the spectrum               that appears
brightest.     To the normal eye it is the yellow, and to the
green-blind it is nearly at the same place, but to the red
blind it is the green.         This, perhaps, may give a. clue to
the designation of the spectrum colours by these two classes.
To the green-blind, red and yellow are the same colour, but
the yellow being the brighter he looks on red as degraded
or darkened yellow.         On the other hand, to the red-blind
green is brighter than yellow or orange, and these appear as
degraded green.
   Experiment has shown that every colour in nature, as seen by
a normal eye, can be expressed        as a. mixture of three, so that
normal vision is tri-chromatic.        In a. similar sense the more
pronounced types of ordinary colour-blind vision are di-chromatic.
These colour relations must be regarded as purely subjective, for
enough is now known of the nature of light to exclude the
possibility of a. three-fold physical constitution.   In the theory of
Young, subsequently, and independently, brought forward and
developed by Helmholtz, light is supposed to be capable of
exciting three distinct primary sensations, combined in varying
proportions, and dependent upon the quality of the light. As to
the character of the three sensations, Young identi<U+FB01>ed them
with red, green, and violet; and no widely-di<U+FB01>’ering choice
is possible, unless upon the supposition            that the primary
sensations, in their purity, are quite outside the range of
our experience.     The yellow of the spectrum, for example, cannot
be primary, for it is capable of being matched by a, suitable
mixture of red and green.        According to this view each primary
sensation is excited in some degree by almost every ray of the
spectrum; but the maxima. occur at different places, and the
stimulation in each case diminishes in both directions, as the:
position of maximum is receded ‘from.

                  sensations are alone to be found, hence at those parts the sensa
                 tions are simple.
                     According to this theory, the two.types of complete red-green
                  blindness are attributed to the absence of either the red, or else of
                  the green sensation, the absence of the former corresponding to
                  red-blindness, and of the latter to green-blindness.       Where the
                  violet and green curves cut, the red-blind person will see
                  what to him        white, and where the red and violet curves
                                    is
                  out the green-blind will also similarly describe his sensation
                  of colour.     To the normal eye these parts of the spectrum
                  appear as bluish-green and green,            as there        stimula

          Report of      the Committee          on Colour- Vision.   287
   In considering the question as to how far red-green blindness
can be regarded as a mere de<U+FB01>ciency in colour-perception, it is
important to bear in mind that, according to recent observation,
considerable deviations from the normal type may occur without
any approach to colour-blindness.     If we imagine a di-chromatic
system be derived from an abnormal tri-chromatic system by the
suppression of one sensation, it will differ from a di-chromatic
system similarly derived from a normal system of colour-vision.
   Blindness to violet, and shortening of the violet end of the            Violet colour
spectrum, have been described, but the instances are very few.             blindnm'
One case of apparent violet-blindness of which the Committee
have cognizance answers accurately to the Young-Helmholtz
theory, on the supposition that the violet sensation is absent
(see No. 4, Plate 1).
   Three other cases of congenital colour-blindness investigated
by the Committee deserve special mention; two (brothers) in
which there was but one sensation, answering probably to the
violet sensation of the Young-Helmholtz theory, and the third in
which the principal sensation was a pure green with perception
of white and probably       slight trace of red.
                              a                     As these were
all cases of congenital colour-blindness, they are mentioned as
in some measure con<U+FB01>rming the theory in question (see Note a).
   Another theory, that of Hering, starts from the observation that        Hering’s
when we examine our own sensations of light we <U+FB01>nd that                    theory   of
certain of these seem to be quite distinct in nature from each             C°l°ur'“5‘°“
other, so that each          something sui generis, whereas
                              is                                 we
 easily recognise all other colour sensations as various mixtures
 of these.    Thus, the sensation of red and the sensation of
yellow are to us quite distinct: we do not recognise anything
common to the two; but orange           obviously
                                           is       mixture of red
                                                          a
and yellow.      Green and blue are equally distinct from each
other and from red and yellow, but in violet and purple we recog
nisea    mixture of red and blue. White again         quite distinct
                                                              is
from all the colours       the narrower sense of that word, and
                             in
black which we must accept as a sensation, as an affection of
consciousness, even      we regard
                        if              as the absence of sensation
                                           it
from the <U+FB01>eld of vision,      again distinct from everything else.
                                  is
Hence the sensations, caused by different kinds of light or by the
absence of light, which thus appear to us distinct, and which we
may speak of as “native” or “fundamental” sensations, are white,
black, red, yellow, green, blue.   Each of these seems to us to
have nothing in common with any of the others, whereas in all
other colours we can recognise     mixture of two or more of these.
                                       a
   This result of common experience suggests the idea that these
fundamental    sensations are the primary sensations, concerning
which we are inquiring.         And Hering’s theory attempts to
reconcile, in some such way as follows, the various facts of
colour-vision with the supposition that we possess these six
fundamental    sensations.  The six sensations readily fall into
three pairs, the members of each pair having analogous relations

     288         Report   of    the Committee        on   Colour-Vision.
      to each other.     In each pair the one colour is complementary to
      the other; white to black, red to green, and yellow to blue.
         Now, in the chemical changes undergone by living substances,
      we may recognise two main phases, an upward constructive
      phase in which matter previously not living becomes living,
      and a downward destructive          phase in which living matter
      breaks down into dead or less living matter.             Adopting this
      view we may, on the one hand, suppose that rays of light,
      differing in their wave-length, may affect the chemical changes
      of the visual substance in different ways, some promoting con
      structive changes (changes of assimilation),         others promoting
      destructive changes (changes of dissimilation); and on the other
      hand, that the different changes in the visual substance may give
     rise to different sensations.
         We may, for instance, suppose that there exists in the
      retina a visual substance of such a kind that when rays of light
      of certain wave-lengths—the longer ones for instance of the red
      side of the spectrum—f all upon        it,
                                          dissimilative changes are induced
      or encouraged, while assimilative changes are similarly promoted
      by the incidence of rays of other wave-lengths, the shorter ones
     of the blue side. But,        must be remembered, that in dealing
                                    it
     with sensations      it    di<U+FB01>icult to determine what part of the

     apparatus     causes them      ;we may accordingly extend              the
     above view to the whole visual apparatus, central as well as
     peripheral, and suppose that when rays of          certain wave-length
                                                              a
     fall upon the retina, they in some way or other, in some part or
      other of the visual apparatus, induce or promote dissimilative
     changes and so give rise to         sensation of
                                             a            certain kind, while

      rays of another wave-length similarly induce or promote assimila
      tive changes and so give rise to      sensation of a different kind.
                                                 a
         The hypothesis of Hering applies this view to the six fundamen
     tal sensations spoken of above, and supposes that each of the three
      pairs is   the outcome of       particular set of dissimilative and
                                         a
     assimilative    changes.   It supposes the existence of what we
     may call    a  red-green visual substance, of such         nature that so
                                                                  a
     long as dissimilative and assimilative changes are in equilibrium,
     we experience no sensation, but that when dissimilative changes
     are increased, we experience a sensation of (fundamental) red,
     and when assimilative changes are increased we experience a
     sensation of (fundamental)      green.   A similar yellow-blue visual
     substance   is  supposed to furnish, through dissimilative changes,
     a yellow, through assimilative changes          blue sensation; and
                                                          a                 a
     white-rblack visual substance similarly provides for         dissimilative
                                                                   a
     sensation of white and an assimilative sensation of black.            The
     two members of each pair are therefore not only complementary
-»   but also antagonistic. Further, these substances are supposed to be
     of such a kind that while the White-black substance          in<U+FB02>uenced in
                                                                   is
     the same way, though in diHerent degrees, by rays along the whole
     range of the spectrum, the two other substances are differently
     in<U+FB02>uenced by rays of di<U+FB01>erent wave-length.          Thus, in the part of

             Report of    the Committee     on Colour-Vision.          289
the spectrum which we call red, the rays promote great dissimi
lative changes of the red-green substance with comparatively
slight effect on the yellow-blue substance; hence our sensation
of red.

    The vertical shading represents the red and green, and the horizontal
shading the yellow and blue, antagonistic pairs of sensations.    The thick
line indicates the curve of the white sensation.
   In that part of the spectrum which we call yellow the
rays effect great dissimilative changes of the yellow-blue substance,
but their action on the red-green substance does not lead to an
excess of either dissimilation or assimilation, this substance being
neutral to them ; hence our sensation of yellow.         The green rays,
again, promote assimilation of the red-green substance, leaving
the assimilation of the yellow-blue substance equal to its dissimi
lation; and similarly blue rays cause assimilation of the yellow
blue substance,        and leave the red-green substance           neutral.
Finally, at the extreme blue end of the spectrum, the rays once
more provoke dissimilation of the red-green substance, and by
 adding red to blue give violet. When orange rays fall on the
retina, there is an excess of dissimilation of both the red-green
and the yellow-blue substance ; when greenish~blue rays are per
ceived there is an excess of assimilation of both these substances;
 and other intermediate hues correspond            to varying degrees of
dissimilation or assimilation of the several visual substances.
   When all the rays together fall on the retina, the red-green
and yellow-blue substances remain in equilibrium, but the white
black substance undergoes great changes of dissimilation ;- and
 we say the light is white.
   According to this theory what are called red and green blind
 ness are identical.     The yellow-blue and white-black sensations
 remain, but the red-green sensation is absent in both.        The white

Colour-blind      The kinds of colour-blindness so far alluded to are the congenital

              moSt common, and so far as we have ascertained, is incurable,
              but the latter may be induced at any period of life, and in very
              many cases is capable of improvement or cure.
                  Colour-blindness induced by disease or injury exhibits dis
              tinctive features of its own, which are not present in cases of
              congenital colour-blindness. It is usually con<U+FB01>ned to the central
              region of the retina, and the extent of the diseased area varies
              largely. Defective form-vision is an invariable accompaniment, and
              it can be usually diagnosed by the recognized tests. (For these
              tests see Appendix VI.) In several cases induced by excessive use
              of tobacco, as also in that induced by progressive atrophy of the
              optic nerve, the Committee have found in examinations made with
              the spectrum that the sensations of white and blue alone were
              perceived in the central portions of the retina.           The blue seen
              corresponded with the blue region of the spectrum, and all other
              colours were described as white.          In other cases, a faint yellow
              in the yellow portion of the spectrum was perceived together
               with the blue and white, as in the <U+FB01>rst-named cases (see No. 5,
               Plate I). That these sensations were rightly described is to be
              assumed from the fact that these persons when in health have
               normal vision, and also, that on healthy portions of the retina
               all colours stimulate the normal sensations.        (See Appendix C.)

               and who found among them 802 colour-blind, or 4-12 per cent.
               Among 14,764 females, he found only 11 cases, or 00084 per
               cent.   In 1880, the Ophthalmological Society of London appointed
               a Committee to inquire into the subject, and they found that
               amongst 14,846 males, 617 or 4-16 per cent. were colour-blind.
               Amongst 489 females, 04 per cent. were defective in colour-vision.

are not con<U+FB01>ned to one nationality or race.          The small per

of this neutral band they see but green or red, more or less diluted

                     The table shows that a signal exhibiting certain hues of green
                  might be mistaken for a red one, since they both might appear to
                  the one class green and to the other red ; and that with one hue of
                  green (di<U+FB01>ering slightly in the two cases, however) it would give
                  the same sensation as white.   In only one case, viz., that in which
                  the dominant spectrum colour to the normal-eyed is well on the
                  blue side of the neutral points, would the signals be distinctly
                  different in colour.

          Report       of   the Committee on Colour- Vision.            293
relative brightness, and by their dilution with neutral colour.
Thus, a bluish-green signal might be distinctly known by
its blue hue, whilst if yellowish-green, it might be recognized
by the neutral colour being slightly tinged with the only other
spectrum colour which they see.         Again, a green whose hue,
whether pure or diluted with white, accurately coincides with
that part of the spectrum where the neutral band is situated,
might probably be mistaken for white, though, even from that,
it might be distinguished by its lower luminosity. The practical
tests the Committee have carried        out con<U+FB01>rm this view; men
who are absolutely colour-blind having passed such a test
without being detected.         It might be supposed that if the
colours of signals could be rightly recognized in the testing
room they would be equally well recognized elsewhere.                 It
must, however, be recollected that the atmospheric conditions of
the testing-room are often very different from those which are
found outside.     As a rule any judgment of the colour of a signal
which depended upon its brightness would be fallacious. A
dirty glass, or a misty atmosphere, would introduce a liability to
error. The red signal of danger might then be mistaken for
the green or white signal of safety, and vice versd.           It must
also be remembered that a signal light, as a rule, has no
 white light adjacent to it with which to compare          and thus

slightly shortened spectrum, who are yet able to distinguish all
 colours, and see no neutral point.     These cannot be considered
 to be practically colour-blind. There are again others to whom
 the spectrum     is considerably shortened, but not to the extent

               circumstances should be allowed to take a post for which this
               defect renders him physically un<U+FB01>t, and with this object in view
               the tests employed in the examination should be of a nature to
               at once detect, not only pronounced colour-blindness but defective
               colour-vision of the above character.
Most suitable     On some railways white lights instead of green have been used
colours for    as safety signals, but the former are liable to be confounded with
signals, and   other white lights which are not signals, more particularly in the
causes which

                  It has been suggested, on theoretical grounds, that all danger
               of misreading signals would be avoided by using for one a
               red and for the other a pure blue, as each of these colours is

               present themselves in practice which preclude the employment            '
               of the blue, more especially for night signals.        The desiderata
               for signals are, that they should be as bright as possible, and
               that their colour should be distinct when viewed at a distance.
               A red glass transmits about 10 per cent. of the luminosity of
               the lamp-light behind it; it is also a saturated colour, and
               appears unaltered in hue from whatever distance it may be
               viewed.     A blue glass, as ordinarily met with, will appear purple,
               or even whitish, by lamp-light, as it transmits,         besides blue,
               a large proportion of red rays, and, if it be pale, it will also
               transmit a variable quantity of all the colours of the spectrum:
               moreover, the luminosity of the light transmitted is, at the
               best, only some 4 per cent. of the naked light.        If two glasses,
               one of blue-green and another of cobalt blue, be placed together,
               in front of the light, the red rays will be cut off, and the light will
               be a fairly pure blue, but the luminosity will be reduced to about
               2 per cent.      When the e<U+FB01>ect of foggy weather on the carrying
               power of different lights is considered (see Note a, page 303),
               it will be understood how this small luminosity will be again
               diminished, and that it will become practically nil.        In making

    the selection of signal colours, these facts have to be taken into
    account.    The choice of a red light as a signal light is one in
    which theory and practice really agree, and it is in the selection of
    a colour for a second signal that the dif<U+FB01>culty arises.           The
    only colour for the latter, which the red-green blind would be
    able with certainty to distinguish from the red, is the pure
    blue,-and this has been shown to be an impracticable choice.
    This being the case, the second signal should be of the kind
    most suitable for normal Colour-vision without regard to the
    requirements     of those who are colour-defective.         Evidently
    for carrying power it should be as near the brightest part of the
    spectrum as possible, but far enough away from the red to render
    the signals easily distinguishable.     A yellow or greenish-yellow
    is inadmissible, as it might be mistaken for a white light under
    some circumstances, as is also the case with those greens which,
    when sufficiently light to be e<U+FB01>ective, allow some red rays to pass.
    It is for reasons such as these that most railway companies have                Colours for
    adopted as a danger signal a rich ruby-red, and for a safety                    signals
     signal (where a white light is not used) a blue-green, which                   adopted by

                296          Report  of the Committee   on Colour- Vision.
                the present time.      Allowing for those whose colour-vision has
                been found defective by the inadequate tests used, and who
                may not be a<U+FB02>oat, it is certain that out of the 120,000 seamen
                who are employed, there must be a large number who are colour
                defective, and consequently      a source of danger to life.    The
                 statistics of the examinations of eyesight on railways, so far as
                 they have come before the Committee, are eminently unsatis
                factory. Although candidates for employment are occasionally
                 rejected for defective colour-vision, yet the percentages of the
                 rejections on different railways differ widely from each other,
                 and from the average perCentage of colour-blindness of the male
                 population. The evidence taken on this subject points to these
                 differences being due to the variation in ef<U+FB01>ciency of the tests
                 employed, and the Committee have been forced to the conclusion
                 that some men, whose vision is defective for colour and for form,
                 are in all likelihood employed in positions where normal vision is
                 essential for public safety.
                    The evidence, moreover, points to the fact that steps have not
                 hitherto been taken (at least, as a rule) in judicial inquiries
                 relating to the causes of accidents, to ascertain whether they
                 were due to defective vision.      The Committee are strongly of
                 opinion that in cases of collision or accident, where the evidence
                 is con<U+FB02>icting as to the recognition of a coloured light, witnesses
                 should be examined both for colour- and form-sense.
                    The Committee have had before them evidence regarding the
                 colour-vision testing of the marine service as laid down by the
                 Board of Trade.
Board of            Tests may be divided into two classes: one dependent upon

                 detection of colour-blindness that of colour-ignorance, or the
                 defective knowledge of the names of colours.         The last class
                 are intended to detect colour-blindness alone, colour-ignorance
                 being independently tested.        The tests which the Board of
                 Trade have ol<U+FB01>cially adopted, are described in Appendix
                 II. The examination consists in requiring the examinee to name
                 correctly the colours of cards by day-light, and of coloured
                 glasses by lamp-light. The correct naming of the colours is
                 alone insisted upon.
Naming              The Committee consider that the tests themselves and the
colours, as
                 method of applying them are necessarily open to very grave
defective test.
                 objection.    The Board of Trade test cards and coloured glasses
                 can be procured from dealers, and the Committee have no hesitation
                 in saying that the colours may be correctly named in the testing
                 room by colour-blind persons after a certain amount of instruc
                 tion, which would consist in teaching them to distinguish the
                 different cards or test glasses by their different luminosities.
                 The glasses are red, pink, three kinds of green, yellow,
                 neutral, standard blue, and pale blue, all of which are viewed
                 by arti<U+FB01>cial light, usually that of an oil lamp. In trials made

  before the Committee, several people, whom Holmgren’s test had
 proved to be colour-blind, passed this lantern test,a fact sul<U+FB01>cient
 to show that it is unsafe to trust to it. But besides this uncertainty
 as to the rejection of the colour-blind, it appears to the Committee
  that an injustice may also be done to the candidates by its use.
  They believe that a perfectly normal-eyed person, who has been
 educated to observe colours, would not be able to speak positively
  as to the precise names of the colours            of some of these
  glasses when       illuminated by lamp-light.         Less educated
  candidates would be much more liable to make mistakes in these
  puzzling tints (which the Committee consider have neither use
  nor signi<U+FB01>cance), and, from sheer confusion, to misname those
 colours which are the only real tests, and thus to fail to pass the
  examination.    The only safeguard to a candidate thus rejected
 lies in the fact that he can be re-examined, and that more than
  once.   Cases have been brought before the Committee’s notice
  where a candidate who has failed at <U+FB01>rst has passed in a subse
 quent examination.       It the test for colour-blindness used by the
  Board of Trade were fair to the candidate, and perfectly e<U+FB02>icient,
 such a re-examination would be unnecessary, and passing upon re—
  examination would be impossible.
     The evidence given by representatives of various railway Railway com.
 companies shows that very few have any adequate system of panies’ tests.
  testing. Nearly all the methods employed are defective, and even
 where the wool-test is applied it usually breaks down from a choice
 of improper colours, both for standards and comparisons.      In some
 instances, a person, whom the Committee know to have very
 defective colour-vision, has been passed in theirpresence by
 railway examiners as possessing normal eyesight, and the im
 pression made on the Committee is that many have probably been
 passed into the service who should most certainly have been
 excluded.
    The Committee      have had the opportunity of examining the Tests in the
 different tests carried out by the Royal Navy, and are glad to Royal N :wy
 <U+FB01>nd that they are most e<U+FB01>icient, and of such a nature that it
 may be presumed that no one can pass them who is suf<U+FB01>ciently
 defective in colour-vision to be any source of danger.            The
 long periods over which the examination lasts, however, pre
 cludes the adoption in their entirety of these tests used for
 railways or the mercantile marine.       The sealed pattern glasses
 for signals are excellent, and, as already stated, the Committee
 would suggest their adoption as the universal signal colours.
    The Committee       are of opinion that the tests for colour- Tests for
blindness should be of such a character that they will readily colour
determine whether a man is or is not colour-blind, but that, except bllndness
for scienti<U+FB01>c purposes, it is not necessary that they should
indicate what kind of mistakes he is likely to make.          The fact '
that a person is found to be colour-blind by an ef<U+FB01>cient test,
properly applied, is amply su<U+FB01><U+FB01>cient to show that his employment
in certain occupations is a danger to the public. We lay some

               stress    on this point, as, if it were required from the examiner
                that he should specify what would be the nature of a mistake
                that an examinee would be likely to make, it would open the
                door to controversy, and thus defeat the ends for which an
                examination      is instituted.     What should be required of the
                examiner is merely a statement that the candidate has either
                passed or failed in the examination.         In cases of failure, where
                the candidate is under the impression that a mistake has been
                made, an appeal to some properly appointed expert should be
                allowed, and his decision should be <U+FB01>nal.

mm”                They are of opinion that tests which involve the naming of
               colours should be avoided in deciding the question of colour
               blindness. Failure to satisfy these tests may be due to colour
               ignorance, and lead to the rejection of persons who are not really
               colour-blind. A candidate who fails should be informed to what
               cause his failure is due, whether to colour-blindness or to colour
               ignorance, with a view to subsequent re-examination in the latter
               case.     On the other hand, if the objects which the examinee is
               required to name are few in number and accessible to the public,
               since the chances are that no two of them are exactly alike
               even to a colour-blind person, he might be instructed as to the
               names which he is expected to give them, and thereby persons
               who are really and seriously colour-blind might be passed by the
               examiner as being free from any defect.            Besides trustworthi
               ness, the tests should be adapted for the examination of large
               bodies of men, and, provided e<U+FB01>iciencybe not sacri<U+FB01>ced, they should
               be of an inexpensive         nature.    After practical trials, and also
               from theoretical considerations, the Committee are of opinion that
               the simplest e<U+FB02>icient test is the wool-test of Holmgren, applied
               either in the form which Holmg‘ren himself recommends, or in
               that of Jeaffreson, which is based on precisely the same principles.

                   Itis   most important that the standard test-colours should be
               ofa    proper character both as to hue and also as to dilution with
               white, the ef<U+FB01>ciency of the test depending almost entirely on               a
               proper selection.      The Committee recommend that sealed patterns
               of all three test-colours should be kept by some central authority
               —such as the Board of Trade; and that every set of test-wools

from themselves the fact that the wools are apt to deteriorate

true that the order might be changed; but in an examination
of this character, where large numbers may be under trial, any

                blindness in individual cases.     Those of Dr. Grossmann are a
                 good example .of this class of test.       An opinion has been
                 expressed, and with some plausibility, that the only fair tests by
                 which to prove that a man’s colour-vision renders him un<U+FB01>t to
                distinguish coloured lights or signals are the coloured lights
                themselves when seen under the same circumstances as those
                under which they would have to be observed.          It has already
                been shown that, with practice, it may be possible for a colour
                blind person to distinguish between colours by their different
                luminosities and dilution with white, but it has also been pointed
                out that such recognition would be rendered uncertain by differing
                states of the atmosphere and by other conditions.         If it were
                possible to eliminate the chances of correct guessing, which
                would be very large when using such tests, it would be necessary
                that the examination should be a prolonged one, being repeated
                many times with di<U+FB01>ering conditions of weather.       If it were not
                carried to this extent, it might equally well be conducted in a.
                testing room, where the apparent size of the signals to the eye
                could be imitated with great exactness.     But the uncertainty of
                this method, even when the variable factor of weather is absent,
                is exempli<U+FB01>ed by the results of the examination of railway
               employés at Swindon, conducted by the Committee.         They found,
                as already stated   (see Appendix VII), that several     passed the
               lamp-test who had failed to pass the wool-test, and that some
                passed one lamp-test, but failed to pass another similar one on
               the same occasion. Had the examination of these men been to
                ascertain their <U+FB01>tness for certain employments requiring normal
               colour-vision, and been conducted by the lamp-test only, some
                would have been admitted into the service, and have been a
               source of danger to the public.
Colour_igno,._     The Committee have had to consider whether what has been

                                                    ignorance as to the names
                of colours,is   as objectionable as colour-blindness for certain
               employments.     The possibility of the existence of real colour
               ignorance,   such as would lead to        a non-recognition of the
               true Colour of a signal, appeared to them very doubtful until
               they had taken the evidence of Staff-Surgeon Preston, RN. for  ;
            it     was hard to conceive of ignorance which would lead to con
               fusion in naming red,
                                a        agreen, and a white signal. His evidence,
               however, was conclusive of its existence at certain recruiting
               centres, and more especially in     a certain class of recruit.    It
               may be mentioned that in the actual testing of large bodies of
               men by the Committee, in no case was there         atrace of colour
               ignorance exhibited by those possessing normal vision, unless in
               regard to nondescript colours. Red, green, blue, and white were
               always correctly named, except where the person examined was
               proved to be colour-de<U+FB01>cient.

                      is    one type of colour-ignorance which of course may
               often be encountered;      a foreigner on board an English-com

he were unable to name the colours in English.        It is in evidence
before us that in navigation it is often requisite that the
look-out man should, without a moment’s delay, pass to the
oliicer in charge the name of the colour of a light, and that
hesitation, whether caused by true colour-ignorance or from
want of knowledge of English terms, might involve disaster.
This being the case, the Committee are strongly of opinion that
for the marine services the examination for colour-vision should
exclude not only men who are colour-blind within the limits                Ignoranr-e of

appear that such tests are undertaken with the idea that colour-
blindness 0f the congenital type may have become more pro
nounced, or may have induced it by disease, but rather with the
view that those who have been previously tested may have been
passed improperly.      No doubt these re-examinations are a safe
guard; but if the tests already passed had been such as to
render detection a certainty, there would be no necessity for
repetition except for the detection of such colour-blindness as may
be due to disease, injury, or over-use of tobacco.    Colour-blindness
due to these last causes is at <U+FB01>rst very seldom appreciated by the
sufferer, and is usually only discovered upon his consulting a.
medical man for impaired form-sense.         This raises the question
as to whether defective        colour-sense   other than congenital
might not, in some cases, be found in those on whom the lives of

                It should be remarked that it is quite possible that the Holm
                gren wool-test might be passed satisfactorily by colour-blind
                people of this type, more particularly when the diseased area is

                stringently carried out, than on instituting another colour-test

                for form, and the Committee are of opinion that he should
                be required to obtain a certi<U+FB01>cate           of competency from some
                duly constituted authority.          Testing, such as we have recom
                mended, requires careful training, and is not to be learnt
                except by practice, for it requires not only a registration of
                absolute mistakes, but also a ready observation of the manner in
                which the candidate acts whilst under examination.                 The Com
               mittee would not insist upon the examiner being a medical prac
               titioner, but it is probable that a medical training would be of
               advantage.       They are further of opinion that there should be
               a periodic inspection of the different testing stations by duly
               quali<U+FB01>ed ophthalmic surgeons, who should report upon the con
               dition of the testing appliances and ,upon the mode in which the
               tests are carried out; and who might be the authorities to whom
               an appeal from a rejected candidate should be referred.
                   In no case should any test be allowed in substitution of
               those recommended, though supplementary tests might be tried if
               desired. The passing or rejection of the candidates should always
               be based on the tests which have been laid down.
Periodic           As colour-blindness          of the congenital character is never
examination.   acquired, it is unnecessary            that any one who has already
               been examined for colour-vision by ef<U+FB01>cient tests should be
               re-examined.        But as tobacco-blindness           is not     uncommon,
               the form-sense of those men whose failure in vision would be

    The cause of the different sensations which are conveyed to cases of
 the brain is a matter which is still in doubt.       It is di<U+FB02>icult to abnormal
conceive that matter which is so comparatively gross as the rods 00,1011!“

 and cones which are situated on the retina can be affected by the
 merely mechanical action of the vibrations of light.
    The little we know about the actual nature of sensations leads us
rather to believe that the nervous processes which are the founda
 tion of sensations are, like other nervous processes, the outcome
 of chemical changes in nervous substances.        And it has been
 suggested that vision originates in the chemical changes of a
certain substance ( or substances) in the retina, that the chemical
 condition of this substance, which has been called visual sub
stance, is especially affected by the incidence of light, and that
the changes so induced determine the beginnings of visual
impulses and thus of visual sensations.       We know that light
 can decompose a substance by acting on its molecules,              and
thus induce a chemical change in it.                I
    In photographic processes, for instance, we know that the
molecules of the sensitive substance are split up by white light,
and further, that when these comparatively simple substances
are exposed to the spectrum, although it is found that a con
siderable extent of it produces chemical changes, there is one
particular part which acts more strongly than the rest of it.
The curve of sensitiveness        exhibits the same characteristics
as those of the colour sensations in the Young-Helmholtz theory.
If   it be conceded that the retinal substance acted upon by light
is a mixture of three analogous compounds, each having a
maximum sensitiveness ata different point of the spectrum, we _
can account for the three fundamental sensation curves shown
in the diagram at page 286.
                               NOTE  ([2).

               retina all sensation of colour, varying according to its luminosity
               and its hue, is lost, though light is still seen, the ordinary appli

Hering's           It may seem that Hering’s theoryis fully capable of explaining
theory and     most of these phenomena, but there are facts against its accept
colour-blind   ance which are very weighty.        For instance, according to this
ness induced
               theory, the sensations of red and green, and of yellow and
by disease.
               blue, ought always to be present together, but in some cases
               of colour-blindness caused by over-use of tobacco, and atrophy of
               the optic nerve, the blue is the only colour sensation felt, the
               yellow being absent from that part of the spectrum in which it
               should be present.       Again, when the intensity of the light
               producing the spectrum is reduced the sensation of red disappears
               long before that of green, which shows that the two sensations
               are not always co-existent. The shortened spectrum of what are
                called the red-blind is also opposed to the theory, for the
               luminosity of the green is proportionally much greater to them
                than the red than it is to the green-blind.

                   The neutral point of the spectrum will vary in all cases
                of colour-blindness according to the whiteness of the light
                 with which the spectrum is compared.          Even to the normal
                eye there is a ray near the yellow which can match very
                closely indeed the light of a gas lamp or candle, though there
                is none which matches the whiteness of ordinary day- or
                sun-light.    Now a match made by the normal eye of a
                coloured light with some ray of the spectrum will be equally
                a match to the colour-blind of either type, since in both the
                colourand its match in the spectrum the same one sensation
                will be absent. It therefore follows that their neutral point, with
                a candle or oil lamp as a standard of whiteness, must be the same
 Shift of the   yellow ray, but to the red-blind this ray would appear greenish
 neutral point
                if compared with the white of day-light, and to the green-blind
 in the spec
 trum caused reddish.
                            If the mental picture of white light were that of
 by different   day-light,  then  evidently the green signal light would have to
 qualities of   be much bluer to the colour-blind than to the normal eye, to
 white light.   prevent a confusion between it and their neutral colour than
                would have to be the case when lamp-light is the mental image
                of white light.     In testing a large number of men by lamp
                light it was invariably fohnd that its light was always called
                 yellow or orange by the normal-eyed, and we may therefore
                 suppose that the general idea of whiteness is derived from

           Report   of the Committee  on  Colour-Vision.        305
day-light.   As this is the case with the normal-eyed,       it may
be assumed that the same mental standard of whiteness would
be adopted by the colour-blind.
                             N on: (d).
   In discussing the most suitable colour of signals, the question. Effect of fog
of the possible alteration of hue by the interposition of fog on the colour
between them and the observer must be taken into account. 0f signals
There are white fogs and yellow fogs, the difference between the
two being chie<U+FB02>y in the size of the particles of water, dust, or
soot which are to be found in them.      In a white fog away from
large towns the particles are chie<U+FB02>y water, but whilst the great
majority must be large compared with the length of a wave of
light, yet some will be present which are very much smaller.    In a
yellow fog the <U+FB01>ne particles are much more largely present, and
the yellowness is largely due to this fact, for when particles,
Whose sizes are comparable to a wave-length of light, are present
between the source of light and the observer, the law of scattering
requires that the blue part of the spectrum of the light reaching
the latter should be much more enfeebled than the green, the green
than the yellow, and the yellow than the red. A blue-green
signal glass will therefore appear rather less blue in a White fog,
and even yellowish-green in a yellow fog, and it may happen
that the loss of what are blue and green to the normal eye
will shift the colour of the signal to the red side of the neutral
point in the spectrum of each type of a colour-blind person, and
then both red and green signals will appear of the same tint
to him, though the latter will appear more diluted with the
neutral colour.    It follows therefore that in a fog the liability
of the colour-blind to mis-read signals is very much greater
than in ordinary clear weather.

306         Report   of the Committee on Colour- Vision.
         EVIDENCE        TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE.
    Evidence of Mr. HANBURY, of the Metropolitan Railway.
   In the    engine    department,  the men are examined as to
perception   of colour before they can qualify for drivers, but
I think not for porters. If there is any doubt, we examine
those engaged in traf<U+FB01>c matters again, but not unless.          We
examine with the wool test, which I have here.            We place
this (a horizontal bar, from which were suspended skeins of
wool about <U+FB01>fteen inches in length, and all bright colours)
on the table in front of the man to be examined, and also a few
skeins of wool, as an independent test.           We ask the man
what he understands by a danger signal; he says “red,”
naturally; then I ask him what colour represents a caution
signal ; he says “ green.” I say, can you <U+FB01>nd the colour repre
senting the danger signal. He looks, and perhaps picks out red ;
if he hesitates at all in his <U+FB01>rst choice, we ask him if he is quite
sure it represents the danger signal. He perhaps says it does.
Then we ask as to the caution signal; also test him with regard
to the skeins of wool, and request him to pair or match the colour
with a similar one on the frame; and if there is any doubt, we
ask him as to brown or blue. Suppose he were to take this
(mauve), we should test him again.       I have not found many such
cases on the Metropolitan Railway.        Men sometimes mis-name
the colours.     We do not ask him the names of colours, but ask
him to match them. We also ask him to pick out the " danger ”
or “ caution” signal colour, and we sometimes ask for the best
red.   We allow the man examined to make a minute examination
between the colours.      I cannot tell exactly how many men we
have personally examined in this way, but I started my exami
nations in 1869, and have perhaps met with three cases of colour
blindness.    I cannot give an estimate as to the number examined.
The wool test is the <U+FB01>rst test which my Chief undertakes, but
when going on the footplate (on the engine) I examine them
again myself.      Agricultural labourers as a rule answer the
questions as to the colour of the signals correctly.        I never
heard of the engine drivers rejecting the <U+FB01>remen, nor the case
of a man going colour-blind subsequently.
   Question—DO      you have a certain proportion of men over
running the danger signal in a way which cannot be accounted
for ?—I know of the case of a man at King’s Cross passing the
danger signal—an aged man—but I found his colour-sight good.
The positions of the coloured wools on the bar are not shifted.
The <U+FB01>remen are only tested once or twice as to colour, and
afterwards if promoted to be drivers.          We do not test with
lamps, nor as to alteration of colour by fogs.        We test them
with regard to other colours than red and green if there is an

            Report of the Committee   on Colour- Vision.        307
evidence of the necessity.    We explain that the red signal is a
danger signal, but we very seldom <U+FB01>nd a man ignorant of this,
they generally know something of the work. There is no test
with lamps, because the glass which gives the green light is blue
by day-light.    It is not a signal green glass, it is a blue glass
[the  glass  is peacock  blue].  We test by day-light.       If we
have green glass with the lamp we <U+FB01>nd it an indifferent light.
The glass we use with gas is of a very de<U+FB01>nite green.
   In case of hesitation, would you ask the man for some
further examination, such as to pick out wool which was not
far from a given colour ?—We should not pass them if there
was any doubt.     If a man chose the wrong colour I should not
think of passing'him. It rests with the examiner and not with
a doctor to pass a man.    Cases have occurred wheremen have
not been able to pass the examiner’s sight test and have been
sent to the doctor, who has given a certi<U+FB01>cate,        We have a
sight test; the test is with the single eye—one being covered;
also with both eyes uncovered.       We do not test our men at
night as well as by day-light, further than already explained.
   If accidents only happen at night, should they not be tested
in that respect P—No, I think not.      We take it for granted if
a man can tell red in day he can at night.
   The CHAIRMAN: Suppose that there were wools here, none of
which matched that (red) exactly, but some nearly; if you
were to ask a man to pick out a near match, and he showed
hesitation, would you regard him as suspicious P—If he picked
out the nearest, I should consider he had answered correctly.
The picking out of an exact match does not prove that a man is
not colour-blind.   I have seen a man pick out brown, and call it
red. Red represents the danger signal, green represents caution.
On the Metropolitan Railway our signals are so arranged that in
the event of any breakage of the glass the white light is treated
as a danger signal.     [Mn Rix was here called, and the witness
applied the different tests to him, the questions being answered
to the satisfaction of Mr. Hanbury, who remarked that Mr. Rix
had good sight.    He was,h0wever, informed that that gentleman
was colour-blind.    Mr. Hanbnry stated that they would pass him
on the Metropolitan Railway.       Mr. Rix was recalled, and his
colour-blindness proved by Dr. Grossmann’s test]
   The CHAIRMAN: Do you ever use Holmgren’s test ?—I have
never seen it.
   Mr. BRUDENELL CARTER: If Mr. Rix were confronted with
a single light he would not be able to tell which was green.    His
deliberation shows he cannot do it in a moment ?—I must admit
that Mr Rix being colour-blind is an eye-opener.          We have
about 500 men engaged in machine work, or on the engines.
   Mr. BRUDENELL CARTER: Could you let me test them at
some time by arrangement; it would not take long P—Yes,
I should be very pleased to. I do not think painters painting
various colours on the carriages and other things make mistakes

308         Report   of  the Committee    on Colour- Vision.
in colour.     If they did, it would be discovered during their
apprenticeship.
   (By Dr. POLE): I do not know of any other railway using
blue instead of green glass.        I do know whether they use pure
green.    I have remarked that some glasses are bluer than others.
We call them a better green. They are blue in daylight, but not
by night.
                      (The   Witness then withdrew.)
Evidence of Mr. WADDEN,          of the London and South Western
                                Railway.
   The men entering the service of our Company are tested
when they <U+FB01>rst enter, and again when they are promoted to
be <U+FB01>remen, and every second year after that; and if during
one of these biennial periods a man is promoted to driver, he
is specially tested then.       In the tra<U+FB02>ic department, every man
is tested upon entering the service. They are tested in this way.
I have brought the material in actual use for the purpose. These
wools [the wools consisted of browns, drabs, sombre greens, one
brighter green, and nondescript colours of very low tone] are placed
upon a horizontal rod promiscuously, and the man asked to pick
out three or four reds, blues, or greens, and if he makes an error in
one of these, he is tested again with other colours.       A man may
have a good notion of colours, and not know what to call them.
\Ve do not <U+FB01>nd they mistake red for green.           In addition to this
test for the trallic department, in the locomotive department there
is a night test.    The room is darkened, and a box is <U+FB01>tted with a
lamp at the back, and various coloured glasses are put in front,
commencing with a small disc, perhaps the size of a pin’s head,
and gradually increasing till we get to one the size of a sixpence,
the man being asked what colour he thinks is being shown to
him.    He is ten or twelve feet from the lantern.        The smallest
disc is the size of a pin’s head, about one-eighth of an inch, or
hardly as much, perhaps.         We <U+FB01>nd the men are not so ready
with the night test: they are more accustomed to colours by
daylight, and <U+FB01>nd it easier in daylight to distinguish the colours
than at night.      These colours (wools) were provided by our
storekeeper.     I am not prepared to say under whose instruction.
   Mr. BRUDENELL CARTER: Among these there is not a single
red. I should say they were selected by a colour-blind person 1
   Capt. ABNEY: I am not colour-blind, but I should not know
what to call some of these.
   The WITNESS : Our locomotive foreman says many men fail in
green who do not in red.        I am told some men looked at that
(green) and called it red. A further test is sometimes tried by
sending men to the Ophthalmic llospital, where there is a doubt,
and I have been told that the hospital authorities con<U+FB01>rmed our
examination.     This wool test is what we call the daylight test,

            Report   of  the  Committee   on Colour- Vision.        309
and the night test is with the absolute colours of signals.         We
give some puzzling colours at night, one of which is an orange
light. The tints are graduated, we only use 4 glasses; white, red,
green, and orange.      All the glasses are of the same intensity. We
do not try to imitate fogs, we simply have the lamp at the back
of the glass, and the man in front; the room being darkened.          I
<U+FB01>nd larger lights are more easy to distinguish than smaller ones
The light behind the coloured glass is 10 or 12 candle power. It
is not used with a bull’s eye; it is a perfectly plain glass.       Our
signals are with bull’s-eyes, with plain glass in front for colours.
The plain glass is certainly a more severe test than with a bull’s
eye, for I myself can see the <U+FB02>ame through the colours.
    Question.—-If you look at the blue glasses in a lamp outside a
chemist’s shop, you often see the <U+FB02>ame is red.            Might not a
mistake he made somewhat in this way ?—-I think it might confuse
men not accustomed to arti<U+FB01>cial lights.         I think our test a very
severe one, and a large number of men fail to pass. I could hardly
say what percentage.       The diameter of the lights used on the lines
is about 6 inches. The man can see these lights a mile away. At
300 yards with a 6-inch light across he could see to stop a. train
well.    I am speaking approximately, of course. The test at
3 yards with the disc as large as a sixpence is about equal to the
6-inch light at the distance of 24 yards. The man is wanted to see
the latter at 300 yards, but we have the smaller light, which is
perhaps only §th of an inch.       [Mn Rix, who is colour-blind, was
here called and tested by the witness, Who stated that he had
passed to his satisfaction]     Witness explained that with the traf<U+FB01>c
men the question is not of such importance as with drivers and
<U+FB01>remen, who are in charge of the train and mind the brakes ; the
sight of the traf<U+FB01>c men is not tested so severely as the drivers
and <U+FB01>remen.       [Witness exhibited the specimens of the glasses
actually in use in the signals and in the lamps; also samples of
the coloured signal <U+FB02>ags]
    Mr. PRInsTLEY    SMITH’s evidence was to the following effect:—
    “Acquired Colour Blindness differs in one important respect from
congenital Colour Blindness—the congenital defect is often asso
ciated with a normal form-sense, while the acquired defect is
always, or almost always, associated with more or less loss of the
form-sense; that is to say, a man who has once had a normal
colour-sense cannot lose it without losing more or less of his
 form-sense.     (Leber has collected several supposed exceptions to
 this rule, but they are not conclusive, and are doubted even by
 Leber himself. ‘Graefe-Saemisch Hand-Book,’ vol. v, p. 1037,)
    “ In
          testing the visual function it is important to distinguish
 between the central and the more peripheral parts of the <U+FB01>eld.
 The centre of the retina—the macula lutea—is the part used in
 looking accurately at any object.       The object is seen with much

  310         Report   of     the Committee    on Colour- Vision.
  greater precision when pictured on this area than when pictured
  on any other part of the retina.              Colour-vision becomes pro
  gressively less and less acute from the centre to the periphery
  of the retina.                                                 .
     “ Hence, in considering defects of vision, it is important to dis
  tinguish between those which affect the centre of the <U+FB01>eld and
  those which affect the more peripheral parts.           A defect involving
  the centre implies an impairment of colour-sense and of form~
  sense at the point where they are most acute.
     “The form-sense at the macula lutea is tested by ascertaining
  what is the smallest type which can be read at a given dis
  tance—according to the principle laid down by Prof. Snellen.
 (Snellen’s Test-types.)
     “ The colour sense at the macula is tested by holding a small
 coloured object on the end of a black wire or rod at a convenient
 distance in front of the patient, and moving it in such a way that
 its image moves across his retina from the periphery to the
 centre.    If there is a defect at the macula the colour, instead of
 appearing most intense at that part, appears less intense, or is
 lost altogether.      I     commonly employ a circular piece of red
 sealing wax on the end of a wire. 1 make the patient stand with
 his back to a window, cover one eye with his hand, and look
 straight at my forehead with the other.            \Vatching that he does
 not move his eye,         I   hold the red object before him at 30 or
 40 degrees to one side of his line of vision.         I ask him the colour.
 He says ‘ red.’      I   try again at the other side, and above, and
 below the line of vision, with the same result.            I  then move the
object into his line of vision, and repeat the question.                If his
vision is impaired at the macula he says ‘it looks brown,’
or ‘ dull,’ or ‘dirty,’ or ‘
            '           ’
                                     I  can’t see it at all.’      He has a
‘
   central    scotoma      ;    a central    area of defective       vision—
an ‘absolute scotoma’ if vision is entirely lost in this area;
a ‘colour scotoma’ if the object is still perceived, but not its
colour.    A saturated colour gives the clearest indications; a pale
colour is a more delicate test for slight defects, but requires
better power of observation on the part of the patient.                Red is
practically the most effective test.              When red is lost, green
is lost also. Green is said to be lost before red.            I cannot speak
positively of this from my own observation.             In order to test this
point it would be necessary to choose a green and a red of pre
cisely equal intensity—21a, of equal white-value.
    “ Central Scotoma is caused by various affections of the optic
nerve, the choroid, and the retina.           I  exhibit charts taken from
three cases of the kind, which show the position and extent of
the affected area.
    “Central Colour Scotoma due to excessive use of Tobacco, is one
of the commonest forms.            I  hand in some statistics which show
that this condition——known as tobacco amblyopia—constitutes
rather more that 1 per cent. of eye disorders in my own hospital
practice; rather less that 1 per cent. in my private practice.

             Report  of  the Committee    on Colour- Vision.      '311
 The scotoma has usually an oval shape, the long axis being
 horizontal; it includes the macula and extends as far as the
 optic disc.
     “Persons who suffer in this way are usually what would be
 called heavy smokers, and they usually use strong tobacco.          In
 a large proportion of cases there has been some mental shock or
depression as an additional cause.      The patient may have been a
 heavy smoker for many years without apparent injury ; then his
wife or child dies, or he loses money or employment; sleep and
appetite fail, his strength is reduced, and within a few weeks the
tobacco begins to take effect.
    “Entire disuse of tobacco usually effects a great improvement
of vision in a month or two, or even sooner; complete recovery
is not uncommon.       I do not know that tobacco amblyopia is
commoner in seaport towns than in Birmingham.            Many sailors
smoke heavily, but their out-door life would probably render
them less liable than the less robust inhabitants of manufacturing
towns.
    “ In relation to the present enquiry, tobacco amblyopia is pro-
bably the most important form of acquired colour defect, for it
comes on insidiously, without known cause, without pain, and;
without other sign of illness; it affects both eyes, and it does
not prevent the man from doing rough labouring work. The;
patients who come to us are often still occupied in rough work;
a clerk affected in like manner is quite unable to follow his.
occupation.
    “Tobacco amblyopia would prevent a man from recognising
the colour of a distant lamp.      Possibly he might recognise it by
viewing it indirectly, that is eccentrically, but as a matter of fact
I  think that such a man would always look directly at the lamp,
if he could still see it at all, and would therefore fail to recognise
its colour. On the other hand he would recognise the colours of
large surfaces, for the retinal pictures of these would extend
beyond the scotoma.       I think he would recognise the colours of'
skeins of wool, such as are used in testing the colour sense.
    “Persons suffering from tobacco amblyopia complain of bad
sight; they never complain of being unable to see colours properly;
they are seldom aware that they have lost the power of seeing
the colour of small objects, until the fact is pointed out to them.
    “Peripheral and Eccentric Defects of Colour-sense are common.
They are present whenever the <U+FB01>eld of vision is contracted.      They
may co-exist with normal vision for form and colour at the centre
of the retina, but in many cases central vision is impaired also.
\Vherever the defect be situated, the colour-sense and the form
sense are impaired simultaneously, but the sense of colour is lost
before the sense of form. Green is said to be lost <U+FB01>rst of all;
certainly green and red are lost before yellow and blue.

                    Amblyopz'a is one of the conditions in which the

disturbances, shock, &c.

312               Report of the Committee on Colour-Vision.
    “The function is lowered throughout the whole of the <U+FB01>eld of
vision.    The <U+FB01>elds for white and the several colours are contracted
or abolished.    As regards area, the least active region, viz., the
periphery, fails <U+FB01>rst; the most active, the centre, fails last. As
regards colour-perception, the feeblest, viz., that for green, is
 said to fail <U+FB01>rst; the strongest, that for blue, last.        I
                                                            have not
tested the precise order in which the different colours are lost,
but   I  have ascertained in some cases that blue and yellow are
 still recognised when red and green are no longer recognised.
    “ These cases are characterised by undue proncness to fatigue
 of the visual function.  The <U+FB01>eld contracts while the eye is under
 examination.    The test is made with the registering perimeter.
 The limit of the <U+FB01>eld is determined in each meridian in succession,
 and on going round the <U+FB01>eld a second time, we <U+FB01>nd a further
 contraction in each meridian, and obtain a spiral line as seen in
 the chart exhibited. A blue glass placed before the eyes often
 enlarges the <U+FB01>eld and raises the acuteness of vision, presumably
 by cutting off the more exhausting rays.                ‘

Review,’ May, 1884.)”
   The practical outcome of the foregoing appears to be that a
man who has once been found to have normal form-sense and
normal colour-sense, need not be re-tested for colour so long as
his form-sense  remains normal; that is to say, if at any future
time he can still read the normal line of Snellen’s types, he is
certainly not suffering from any acquired defect of colour-sense
at the centre of the retina.

             Report of the Committee      on  Colour- Vision.       313
Evidence of Mr. BAMBRIDGE, Senior Examiner of the Midland
                                Railway.
    Every applicant for employment, and every servant of the
Company on promotion, is examined as to their eyesight. The
apparatus used is that which I show. The tests employed are
Dr. W. Thompson’s tests, consisting of a series of skeins suspended
over a bar, and numbered with numbers which have reference to
the colour. Three test skeins are used as standard skeins, the
<U+FB01>rst a blue-green, the second a rose colour, and the third an
ordinary scarlet.      A candidate is required to match with the
<U+FB01>rst test skein the skeins on the suspended bar, which comprise
greens, greys, drabs, pinks, slate colour, and other colours corres
ponding to Holmgren’s colours.           (The tests were practically
carried out after the Holmgren method.)          The tests are carried
out by daylight, though gaslight tests are sometimes employed.
Doubtful cases are re-tested by Holmgren’s plan.          This method
of testing has been in force for eight or nine years; before that
the Army test was employed.           The witness believed that the
method now employed was very perfect.               Should a. signalman
fall ill he is always tested before he is allowed to rejoin his post
with the ordinary signals. In reference to colour-blindness pro
duced by disease, he never saw a man who passed once fail on a
further examination.     It is quite possible that a man may fail in the
wool test who rightly reads signals.      The gaslight test takes place
in a covered corridor with green and red lights; but, in addition
to this test of signalmen, the wool test must also be passed. The
position of the skeins of wool on the bar is not altered, and in
case of doubt as to collusion the Holmgren test is adopted.
About 2% per cent. of the whole who are examined fail. Some
times a man may be allowed a second chance of examination if it
appears that he fails through ignorance, but he never found that
practice enabled a really colour-blind person to pass in a second
examination.      A man is always examined for colour-blindness
after an absence due to an accident in case any alteration in
his colour-vision should have occurred. As before said, a man is
tested at every stage of promotion, and every applicant has to
come to Derby for this purpose.        With the aid of assistants, but
under the witness’s personal supervision, between 1,500 and
2,000 candidates for employment are examined each year, and in
all 2,500 if old hands are included.     Candidates are also examined
for form, as in the Army test. The method is by means of dots
separated by intervals equal to their diameters.
    A distant signal is often three-quarters of a mile away from
the signal box, and the signalman has to see if the arm works
in the day time, or if the proper light is shown at night. An
engine driver must see a signal about half-a-mile off in order
that he may stop his train if necessary.        Witness never heard of
 a case of an engine driver reporting a <U+FB01>reman for want of colour
 perception.     Cases have been heard of in which the colour of
 light has been mistaken, and in such cases the man would be at
                                                                Y2

once     suspended until he were re-tested. 'After a candidate has
  been tested at the of<U+FB01>ce, he is sent to a medical man, and it has
  occurred that he has rejected a man who has passed the test.
  In such a case the man is tested for colour at the office again,
  and if he again passes, which he always does, he is not rejected
.for colour defect.             All testing is done under the immediate
  supervision of the witness. Should a candidate show a slowness
  in selecting colours to match the test skeins, he would be reported
  as hesitating, and though the defect in vision might be tri<U+FB02>ing,
  he would be considered as unsuitable for an engine driver or for
  a signal man.        Of the two tests, the witness preferred the heap
  (Holmgren’s) test as the better, but it took longer to carry
  out than the bar (Thompson’s) test, the latter only occupying a               a
  couple of minutes for each candidate.
     The witness examined Mr. Rix, who is colour-blind. for his
  colour perceptions, and said he should not have passed him. He
  gave the following table of statistics to the Committee :—

            Evidence    of Mr. T. H. BICKERTON,           of Liverpool.
    I do not know that 1 have got much more to say than I have
 already said in my pamphlets, although a few new facts have
come under my observation.
    The main point I have had in writing these pamphlets has
 been to point out to the Board of Trade in particular, and to the
public in general, the great dangers incurred by the employment
of colour-blind men, and of defective-sighted men, in pesitions

           Report of   the   Committee    on Colour- Vision.    315
where the correct interpretation of coloured lights is essential
to the safe navigation of vessels.
  I   have shown, and I think conclusively, the great dif<U+FB01>culty
there has been in the past in getting the Board of Trade to
recognise these dangers, and that when at last they did recognise
the dangers, they instituted methods of testing for colour
blindness which are not ef<U+FB01>cient, this being shown by the facts
that these said methods, while they in very many cases allow
colour-blind men to pass, in some cases cause the rejection of
men as colour-blind who have a perfect colour sense.          I have
also shown that while the methods of testing are inef<U+FB01>cient for
the purpose intended, viz., the detection of colour-blindness,
the regulations dealing with these colour-blind men when so
detected are thoroughly bad. Colour-blind officers are granted
the higher certi<U+FB01>cate, which is simply endorsed “This of<U+FB01>cer
                        ”
has failed. in colours;   and the fact that he is colour-blind is no
bar to his continuing in a responsible position.      In the case of
men applying for a Second Mate's Certi<U+FB01>cate, it is true he does
not now receive his certi<U+FB01>cate, but he is at liberty to continue
his profession.    So far as the Board of Trade regulations go,
colour-blind pilots, colour-blind “look-outs,” colour-blind A.B.’s,
and colour-blind apprentices are quite competent to assist in the
navigation of ships, and may remain sailors-to the end of their
days.  I   believe that no regulations, however elaborate, with
the object of preventing collisions at sea, and of preventing loss
of life at sea, can be successful so long as men who have not
good distant sight, and men who are colour-blind, are tolerated in
the Mercantile Marine.     Again, improvement in the methods of
testing alone will not remedy the evils nor do away with the
great hardships entailed on colour-blind men. At the present
time a compulsory colour-test is only applied to those men
wishing to advance themselves, and thus it is only after years of
labour that their defect is discovered.   To remedy the evils and
the hardships, it is essential that a colour test be employed at
the very commencement, and those who are colour-blind should
be stopped before they begin the sea life. At the present time
there is no test, and of a total of 956 boys who were being
brought up for the sea life on training ships,     I
                                                   found thirty-tour
who were colour-blind. These were boys who were going to
be sailors, and every sailor has responsibilities    with regard to
“look-out” lights, and I have proof that the large majority
of these boys wentto sea.          I am told that the captains of
reformatory training ships are compelled to accept boys even
                                                          ‘
though they know them to be colour-blind.
   The CHAIRMAN: Your <U+FB01>rst point        that all these boys should
                                         is,
be prevented from going to sea?
   The WITNESS: Yes. The Board of Trade cannot settle this
question by improving their tests unless they at the same time
prevent colour-blind boys entering the Service.       It seems to me
the action of the Board of Trade all through has been inexplicable

316          Report of the  Committee  on  Colour-Vision.
At <U+FB01>rst they would not believe in         the existence of colour
blindness   ; then when the dangers of colour-blindness could not
be denied, they said the number of colour-blind cases were very
small ; and now they say the number of cases are so numerous
that it would cause great hardship to rid the Service of them all.
At the present moment no care whatever is taken to prevent
colour-blind boys from being brought up to the sea life. Some
three or four years ago   I examined the boys of the training ships
 Conway, Akbar, Clarence, Inde<U+FB01>ttigable, and Clio, the <U+FB01>rst four
ships being in the River Mersey, the latter in the Meuai Straits.
   On the Conway, out of 154 boys 2 were colour-blind.          One,
aged 14, had been on board two years ; the other, aged 13%, had
been there eighteen months.       Both were fond of the sea; both
were unaware of their defect; and both, on their friends being
informed of the matter, were removed from the ship.               On
the Akbar there were 4 colour-blind out of 148 boys; on the
Indefatigable, 12 out of 238; on the Clarence, 7 out of 158; and
on the Clio, 9 were colour-blind out of 258 on board.
   On these <U+FB01>ve vessels, therefore, there were at the time of
my examination a total of thirty-four colour-blind boys being
specially trained to a profession which they were physically and
morally un<U+FB01>tted to enter.       In addition to these, of 200 boys
in the Seamen’s Orphanage eight were colour-blind, and it is
purely a matter of chance whether the boys have gone to sea or not.
    Question—Do you know if there is any examination in the case
of the boys on the Britannia ?
   The WITNESS: I do not, but      I should think there is. There
is a careful examination as to form-vision, and they reject all
boys who have not perfect vision of both eyes.                 Since
the two colour-blind boys were discovered on the Conn-m, the
Committee      of that vessel have, I understand, insisted that
 every boy joining the ship shall bring a certi<U+FB01>cate stating that
he is not colour-blind.     I do not know if they are particular as
to who gives the certi<U+FB01>cate.
                                                       I
    Question—Can you make any numerical statement as to per
 sons on the seas whom you regard as un<U+FB01>t for their duties?
    The WITNESS: I am aware of (a) eleven colour-blind men who
 were bound apprentices, and who at the time I was consulted
 had been at sea for periods varying from four and a half to eight
 years; (b) of four colour-blind able seamen whose years of
 service were respectively thirty-<U+FB01>ve years, twenty-one years,
 twelve years, fourth unknown; (0) of seven of<U+FB01>cers holding
 high and responsible positions, the length of whose services
 were respectively twenty-six years, eleven years, six years,
 ten years, twenty years, twenty years, thirty years, making
‘a total of twenty-two colour-blind sailors.
                                               (In addition to these
 actual sailors, there are the thirty-four colour-blind boys, the
 majority of whom are now at sea, unless they are dead or left
 the service.) Some were obliged compulsorily to give up their

                                                           A
             Report   of  the Committee on Colour-Vision.         317
positions    as officers owing to their being discharged by the
owners. WVhether they have gone to sea in the employ of less
particular companies, I cannot say.       I can only state positively
that four of the twenty-two have not gone to sea. One of these
four is the case of Captain John Smith, whose case has been
brought prominently before the notice of Sir Baden Powell, who
wrote to Sir G. G. Stokes about the poor fellow. The letter
written by Capt. Smith, and published in the Shipping and
.llercantile   Gazette and Lloyd’s List, dated 13th August, 1889,
explains itself :—“ On the 19th of June you were good enough to
insert in your valuable paper a letter written by me on colour
blindness, and I am pleased to <U+FB01>nd that my letter and your
article commenting on same has attracted considerable interest,
notably by the Board of Trade. My object in again troubling
you is to impress upon the Board of Trade the necessity for a
more perfect means of testing sight. I have lost my position as
 chief of<U+FB01>cer in the employ of one of the best and most in<U+FB02>uential
<U+FB01>rms in this port, in whose service I had been for a period of six
and a half years, and with a near prospect of command, through
not being able to conform to owners’ rule and produce a colour
test certi<U+FB01>cate from their examiner, who, on the contrary, styled
 me    colour-blind.     I, however, doubted the accuracy of the
report, and presented myself to an oculist, but found, alas I
the Company’s examiner’s report too true.         Now, I call this a
very painful case, after being thrice passed by the Board of
Trade for Second, First, and Master’s Certi<U+FB01>cates.            If the
 Board of Trade examination on any of these occasions had
been true, I would have directed my energies towards another
 way other than the sea to obtain my livelihood.      I may say that
 the defect in my vision has been, in the oculist’s opinion, there
 from birth. I am now, morally and conscientiously, incapable of
performing the duties of an of<U+FB01>cer on board ship at sea, though
my Certi<U+FB01>cate bears no endorsement of any kind by the Board of
Trade. Many owners I know do not require their of<U+FB01>cers to
pass the colour-blind test, being satis<U+FB01>ed with the Board of Trade
Certi<U+FB01>cate. But I should think my case ought to be a warning
to shipowners not to place reliance on the present Board of Trade
test.    My colour-blindness has destroyed my means of livelihood,
and I fearlessly say that the Government test of sight is to blame
 for this. I am informed that I cannot claim compensation from
the Board of Trade, because they have not interfered with my
Certi<U+FB01>cate; but suppose I follow my avocation and get into
 collision through my defect, what then? and who would be to
blame?       I am a young man of thirty-three, and I have a wife
 and family depending upon me, and my position at present is
 very distressing. The best part of my life (Capt. Smith has been
 at sea for twenty years) has been passed in useless toil. My
 energies and prospects for the future have been unrewarded and
 blighted through no fault of my own, but through the lax and
 imperfect way in which I was examined and passed in sight by

318          Report of  the  Committee   on  Colour- Vision.
the test that was adopted by the Board of Trade throughout the
whole of my examinations.”
    When   I  <U+FB01>rst saw this gentleman on May 11th, 1889, a more
hearty man than he appeared could not be. He had been getting
£9 a month, and a bonus of £1 from his Company.              The Com
pany, on dismissing him from his ship, behaved very kindly,
 giving him shore employment at about £5 a month. But the loss
 of his situation, the having to give up the sea, and the destruc—
tion of his hopes so preyed upon his mind and body, that in May
 last he became the victim of acute phthisis, and died.
    Up to the day of his dismissal he had not had a day’s illness,
nor had he had occasion to consult a medical man.          The Board
of Trade were well aware of the case, for on June 19th, after his
letter had appeared in the press, he was sent for by the Liverpool
Board of Trade, and asked if he was the writer of the letter, and
his object in writing it ; and, when he said it was in order to get
employment, he was told to the effect that, as the Board of Trade
had not interfered with his certi<U+FB01>cate, he had no claim upon
them, and that if shipowners chose to make laws for themselves,
it had nothing to do with them, and did not prevent him going
again to sea, as he could go to other companies.       It must not be'
thought this is an isolated case.      It is now no uncommon thing
in Liverpool to hear of of<U+FB01>cers being dismissed for colour
blindness who have held, in some cases for years, lucrative and
responsible appointments      on board ship.     Everyone will admit
the justice of these dismissals, for upon the correct colour-vision
of the o<U+FB01>icer on watch depends the safety of the ship, and, in
 many cases, the lives of hundreds of helpless passengers, and
property to the extent of hundreds of thousands of pounds, but
 everyone will at the same time admit the hardship—nay more,
the injustice—done these men by the use of bad Government
tests and regulations.       This brings me to another point, that
 many of the shipowners of Liverpool will not take a Board of
 Trade certi<U+FB01>cate now.      Up to the time   I wrote my second pam
 phlet the Liverpool shipowners believed that the Board of Trade
 certi<U+FB01>cate was a positive proof that an o<U+FB02>icer was not colour
blind.    Now many of them refuse to take it.       They do not test
the men themselves.      Many of them send their of<U+FB01>cers to medical
 men or to opticians, or ask them to again go to the Board of
               I
Trade, and may here mention that sailors have a considerable
objection to being tested by opticians; and      I have been told of a
case where a sailor, on being rejected by a surgeon attached to
an Atlantic liner, remarked, he “ didn’t see why he should not go
to sea, because a common ship’s doctor said he was colour
blind.” These men have the Board of Trade certi<U+FB01>cates already,
but since   I  pointed out the defects in the Board of Trade tests,
many of the owners of the large Atlantic passenger steamers insist
on a re-examination of their o<U+FB02>icer's’ colour-sight and form-sight.
    I think there should be an ef<U+FB01>cient examination in the <U+FB01>rst
instance.     No improvement in the mode of testing can be satis

 factory unless it is applied at the threshold of the sailor’s career,
and not, as at present, when about to obtain the reward of his
years of labour. Before an apprentice or man be allowed to put
his foot on board ship as a sailor, he should be compelled to
produce to the Captain or Shipping Clerk a certi<U+FB01>cate of good
colour-sight. The matter entails no dif<U+FB01>culty. At the present
time a sailor is obliged to keep by him his various certi<U+FB01>cates of
discharge, it would be no hardship for him to keep a colour
certi<U+FB01>cate also.
     The CHAIRMAN: How can we give a numerical value to your
observations? You know of several cases of of<U+FB01>cers who are
colour-blind, and are sailing the seas, to what extent can you
give percentages?
     The WITNESS: It is di<U+FB01>icult to do this, but we may presume
that the percentage of congenital colour-blindness among sailors
 is the same as that among any other community of males, and
by taking the average of the percentages given by three reliable
authorities :—
      Holmgren examined 32,165 men—1,019 colour-blind, 3168 per cent
                                                                      '
      Joy Jeffries    ,,    10,387 ,,   431     ,,     4'149     ,,
   .  London Com.     ,,    14,846 ,,   617     ,.     4'156     ,,
this is found to be 3824. By the census of 1881, the number of
sailors in the Mercantile Marine Service in England was 95,093;
in Scotland, 14,143, and in Ireland, 10,886; making a total of
 120,122; and this does not include such men as pilots, canal or
lighter men. Calculating 3-824 per cent. of this number to be
colour-blind, we have a total of 4,593 men holding at the present
time positions in which the correct interpretation of coloured
lights is essential.
     I am not making allowance for those rejected. But might    I
call attention to the great variations in the Board of Trade per
centages of rejections, which render their report unreliable.        In
the o<U+FB01>icial report, published in February, 1885, it is stated 123
men were colour-blind out of 21,720 examined, this giving the
percentage of '586, and a careful study of this report will show
that thirty-one out of eighty-<U+FB01>ve colour-blind men eventually
were granted unendorsed licenses.            But the public attention
called to this question has raised the percentage, for we are told,
in the report of 1888, that between the months of January and
May, no fewer than 320 sailors were examined by the Superin—
tendent of the Mercantile Marine, at Tilbury Docks, and among
them sixteen, or <U+FB01>ve per cent. were found unable to discriminate
red and green in the degree requisite for safe navigation. This
percentage one may positively state is as ridiculously high as the
former quoted is ridiculously low. Something therefore must be
wrong, either with the tests themselves, or with the way in
which they are applied.
     All who have consulted me have done so on account of their
colour-blindness. A very considerable number of these came to me
because they did not believe they were colour-blind.         The defect

320         Report of  the Committee   on Colour-Viszon.
had been found out accidently, or owing to their being compelled
by their employers to undergo a re-examination,         as to their
colour-vision by the Board of Trade or by opticians.     I examined
them for colour-blindness by all ordinary tests.
   I                                                   I
     use a good many, but Holmgren’s is the one that trust fully.
I   have not kept records of those who were not colour-blind,
but they were very few, for there could be no reason for a man
who was not colour-blind coming to see me.         I can, however,
remember two cases, and one of them whose case is fully
quoted in Pamphlet N0. 2, page 7, shows clearly that by the
present Board of Trade testing a man who is not colour-blind
may be, by their tests, rejected as colour-blind.
   The CHAIRMAN: Taking any one company, can you form any
idea as to how many of<U+FB01>cers in their employ are colour-blind P
                               I
   The W'ITans: No, because do not examine for any company;
but Dr. Hodgson, of Bootle, who examines for the Cunard Com
pany, told me he rejected <U+FB01>ve out of 120 of<U+FB01>cers in the employ
of the Cunard Company for diseases of the eyes. This company,
long before the Board of Trade took up this matter of the
sailors’ eye-sight, recognised the grave responsibility resting
with them in the selection of men (look-outs and of<U+FB01>cers) for
a duty which they considered of paramount        importance.     For
this they deserve every credit, and it is no doubt one reason of
the freedom this company has had from disaster (ride Pamphlet 3.
page 12).
    The CHAIRMAN: Have you details of the diseases of the
 rejected men?
    The WITNESS : No, but the same doctor quoted the case of an
of<U+FB01>cer who could not tell the colour of his ship’s funnels, and did
not know that the <U+FB02>uid issuing from his nose on one occasion
was blood, until told by the bystanders.
    The CHAIRMAN: The point you want to bring before the Com
mittee is that a test for colour-vision should be instituted at the
commencement ?
    The WITNESS: Yes, at the very commencement, and those who
have not perfect colour sight, and also good distant sight, should
not be allowed legally to enter the service at all.
   The CHAIRMAN: You wish further to point out that the
methods of testing by the Board of Trade are wholly insuf<U+FB01>cient?
   The WITN'Ess: Yes.
   The CHAIRMAN : And that although you are not able to make a
numerical statement, you are convinced there are many persons
now in the Mercantile Service who are colour-blind?
   The ‘IVITNESS: Yes.
   The CHAIRMAN: There are a number of training institutions for
the poor where destitute boys are sent, I believe?
   The \VITNEss : Yes; the Indefatigable, Akbar, Clio, Clarence.
To the three latter vessels boys brought before magistrates
for vagrancy are sent without any reference being made as to
their <U+FB01>tness for the sea life. Everybody to be employed as

           Report   of   the Committee    on Colour- Viszon.            321
 sailors should be examined as to their colour-vision.         I do not
 include <U+FB01>remen and stokers.       At the present time individual ship
 owners have the men in their employ tested; but this is of little
 avail unless all men in every company are tested, for it takes
 two ships to make a collision.
    The CHAIRMAN: Have you ever thought whether it is feasible
 by altering the coloured signals, say by substituting a <U+FB02>ashing
 light as in the army, the dif<U+FB01>culty might be got over?
     The WVITNEss: Yes, I have thought of       it,
                                                  but believe
                                                      I            to be
                                                                   it
 impracticable.    The shipping men themselves say so. In this
 question of coloured light there    is   one eminent gentleman who
 has, in my opinion, done much harm.         Admiral Colomb has been
a    great power in preventing this subject of colour-blindness
 receiving the attention      it  deserves. I   have in Pamphlet          2,
 page 11, given my reasons for believing the means recommended
 by “Select Committees for the Prevention of Loss of Life at
       ”
  Sea    are and must remain futile so long as the very essential of
  safety, namely, perfect eyesight on the part of of<U+FB01>cers and men,
is   ignored. Admiral Colomb thinks differently, but, as   I    believe,
  wrongly, andI    would have no hesitation in taking the popular
  vote on the point between us. In the course of an able paper
 delivered by him on the subject of the Washington Maritime
 Conference, at the Society of Arts, and reported in The Times of
 March 28th, 1890, he made the following remark :—
     “ As to the quali<U+FB01>cations for of<U+FB01>cers and seamen, the Conference
 (Washington) dealt wholly with the question of colour-blindness
  on account of its danger with reference to the red and green
'side lights.    He never knew himself      a  case of collision where
  colour-blindness was in question.     The statements were generally
 perfectly clear that wrong helm was given deliberately in the
  face of the colour seen, and as no authoritative teaching had
  existed to show that   it  mattered what colour ,was seen so long
 as danger was denoted, he had never been able to lay stress on
 the colour-blind question.”
     Mr. Baden Powell, R.N.R., who followed in debate declared
  “that in all cases of collision at sea there was no default of the
 rule of the road at sea, but they generally arose from negligence.
 The rule of the road at sea was perfectly well understood by
 intelligent men, and    it was the ‘lubbers’ and the careless who
  did not act according to it.”
     Admiral de Horsey considered “collisions at sea were caused
 principally by three faults—a bad look-out, ignorance of the
 rules, and neglect of the rules.”
     In his reply Admiral Colomb “expressed his opinion that
 collisions at night occurred through the helm being ported to
 the green light, and starboarded t0 the red; and he could not
  agree that the collisions occurred wholly through negligence,
  for he thought that they largely occurred because our seamen
  were not taught what they should do, and the collisions occurred
  through ignorance.”

322           Report of the Committee on   Colour-11782011.
    Now I say that there are a number of well authenticated cases
 where disaster due to colour-blindness     and to defective sight
 actually occurred, or was narrowly averted; and it is surprising
 Admiral Colomb does not know of them.             I would also ask
 whether Admiral Colomb knows of a single case out of the
 thousands that have occurred where, after collision, the colour
 sight of the of<U+FB01>cers and men was tested by an expert. Would
 it not be as well if Admiral Colomb were to eliminate this cause
 before denouncing it? One might have thought that, as in most
 shipping enquiries, the evidence as to the colour of the lights,
 and as to the distance at which they were <U+FB01>rst seen, is bewildering
 in its coutrariness, the <U+FB01>rst step towards a solution would
  be to examine      on the spot the far sight and colour sight
  of the witness; but those who adjudicate at these enquiries
  think differently, and take it for granted that the witnesses
  coming before them have perfect far sight and perfect colour
  sight. It is my opinion that if the eyesight of sailors on colliding
  vessels were tested in Court, we should <U+FB01>nd that the cause was
  in many cases neither ignorance nor negligence, nor due to
  “ lubbers,” but that it would be found in the colour-blindness or
  defective sight of the of<U+FB01>cers and men on watch.
     Capt. ABNEY thought Admiral Colomb must have realised the
  fact that there are mistakes as to the colours, and was a man
  very much open to conviction, and ready to adopt improvements.
  He could not think he was antagonistic to anything in the
  way of advance.
     The Wrrnuss: In opposition to the opinion of these eminent
  gentlemen, I will quote the opinion, in which         I   fully agree,
  expressed by a gentleman who wrote to the Liverpool Daily
  Post in the following terms :—
     “Is it reasonable to believe that steady married seamen with
  families depending on them, and who have had years of experience,
  suddenly lose all judgment and common sense, and steer their
  vessels on clear nights, sometimes in broad daylight, so as to
  deliberately ram each other, thereby losing their lives and ships,
  and the lives of the passengers?      Surely not.     In none of the
  other professions or calliugs can we <U+FB01>nd anything approaching
  a parallel case; therefore, in some cases their eyesight must be
  defective.”
     If Admiral Colomb would only take the trouble to examine
  personally a colour-blind o<U+FB01>icer, I feel sure that this subject
  would have in him a distinguished convert and an able and
  powerful advocate.
_    The CHAIRMAN: Have you any special evidence to give as to
  accidents   ?
     The Wrrnnss: Yes, in Pamphlets 1, 2, and 3 I have related many
  cases of accidents due both to colour-blindness and to defective
  sight on the part of those in charge of the vessels.       The Liver
  pool Board of Trade use the ordinary Board of Trade tests.

              Report of      the  Committee on Colour-Vision.         323
     The CHAIRMAN: What authority has the Liverpool Board of
  Trade?      Is it simply limited to Liverpool?
     The WITNESS: Yes, the powers of the Central Board of Trade
  are given over to the Liverpool Board for Liverpool.
      Question—Will you give us your practical experience with
  regard to different methods of testing?
     The WITNESS : I have very little hesitation in saying that all tests
  requiring a man to name colours are defective.         Practically, that
  brings them down to Holmgren’s, which is the simplest, and, for
  ignorant men, the best one. I consider that test perfectly trust
  worthy, and it has one great advantage—it can be applied
  irrespective of nationality.
     The CHAIRMAN: As a matter of practical experience, about
  what time do you <U+FB01>nd it takes in using Holmgren’s test?
     The I/VITNESS:       I  calculate about 40 boys an hour, or 100
  girls in the same time. The time taken depends a great deal
  upon the social standing of the children.         At Eton or Harrow it
  would be very different to that at reformatory schools, where
  perhaps only thirty boys could be examined in an hour, as they
  are so ignorant that a test has to be explained to them over and
  over again in order that ignorance may not be mistaken for
  colour-blindness.       I am acquainted with Professor Grossman’s
  test, and I think it a test for experimental purposes, but not for
 practical use.        Captain Smith, of whom I have already spoken,
 passed it without dif<U+FB01>culty. He was examined by the Board of
 Trade card test and lanterns.         He was then asked by Sir George
 Powell to see Dr. Grossman, and Captain Smith told me he named
 the letters rightly. I tested him on two or three occasions with
,Dr. Grossman’s       test, and he never made a mistake.
     Question. —Did Dr. Grossman supply the test you used?
     The WITNESS:       I  got it from the optician from whom he said it
 might' be obtained.        In many cases it would be di<U+FB01>icult to reject
  with this test, although feeling sure the candidate was defective.
 An educated colour-blind man would get through. There is also
 the disadvantage that it takes considerable time to apply.
     The CHAIRMAN : -What was the nature of Captain Smith’s
 colour-blindness ?
     The WITNESS: I do not for the moment remember.              I do not
 <U+FB01>nd the great distinction which is laid down between the different
 kinds of colour-blindness.         The one class appears to run into the
 other.
     I think different classes do exist, and in great number.
     I have not examined cases with regard to the shortening or
 non-shortening of the spectrum.
     The CHAIRMAN : You have no suggestion to make with regard
 to tests?
     The WITNESS : None, except that I pin my faith to Holmgren’s
 test applied by an expert examiner, and carried out according to
.I-Iolmgren’s    instructions.

    In connection with this test I should like to hand in a letter
 which I received lately from Mr. Clement E. Stretton,C.E., of the
 Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen :—

     “DEAR    Sm,-I am always glad to read a letter on the eye
 sight   question, as I trust it will all lead to something being done
  to avoid that which may soon turn to a strike against ‘ dots and
  wool.’ In order to save the men their situations the Railway
  Societies are having the men taught in wool shops with <U+FB01>rst-rate
 results.
     ‘
       The present tests are useless for railway men, and very un
  fairly applied when required to get rid of the men.
     “The Illechanical World and Invention of to-day each have
 important information upon the subject.
     “ I would strongly advise you to apply to Mr. Harford, Rail,
  way Servants’ Society, 55, Colebrooke Row, London, N ., for the
 practical side of the question.

                                   “CLEMENT E. STRETTON.”
    The complaint which Mr. Stretton makes as to the unfair way
 in which railway men are treated is no doubt grounded on just
 cause, but he is in error when he attacks, as he has on many
 occasions done, Holmgren’s test, which has with reason been
 accepted as a reliable one by those more competent to judge.
 The “dot and wool” test of the Railway Companies is not the
 wool test of Holmgren, and the fact, as stated by Mr. Stretton,
 viz., that the railway men can be educated to pass the test is, if
 any were required, positive proof that the test applied to them
 is not Holmgren’s. It would, however, appear that there is cause
 to believe that the men are badly treated, as'the following letter
 will show; and until Holmgren’s test becomes the of<U+FB01>cial test,
 and is applied by those who understand           its use, and who are in
 an independent      position, the friction which is at present felt is
 likely to continue :—

    “ DEAR SIR,—At the last Meeting of the Executive Committee
 the testing of the eyesight of drivers, <U+FB01>remen, guards, signal
 men, and other servants of the various Railway Companies was
 considered, and from the facts submitted it was felt that the
 usual tests were often most unfairly applied, more especially in the
 case of the older servants, and that, in consequence, men were
‘being reduced or removed from the service under the plea of
 defective sight. From this there being no appeal, the Executive
 Committee considered that the tests were being used so as to

    give a pretext for getting rid of men who have grown grey in
    the service, and whose lengthened experience and faithful servi

        “In order, then, that men so tested may have the opinion of
    their fellow members as to whether their sight is defective, I am
    instructed to enclose you a card used for testing sight with which
    members may test each other, and in the event of the unfair tests
    being used by the Companies’ of<U+FB01>cials, a reliable protest can then
    be made, backed up by the verdict of the branch, which would,
    of course, submit any member said to have defective sight to the
    usual tests in order to satisfy itself, before expressing an opinion.

     case is to be found in the Annual Report of the Supervising In
     spector-General of Steam-boats, to the Secretary of the Treasury,
     dated Washington, 1880, and reads as follows :—
         “ On the the night of the 5th July, 1875, there was a collision
   , near Norfolk,      Virginia, between the steam-tug Lumberman,
     and the steam-ship Isaac Bell, the former vessel bound to, and
     the latter from, Norfolk.      The accident occurred about 9 pm. on
     an ordinary clear night under circumstances which, until recently,
      seemed more or less mysterious.       The master of the steamer and
      all his officers made oath that at the time signals were made to
      the tug, the latter was from one to two points on the steamer’s
      starboard bow, and consequently the steamer’s green light only
      was visible to the approaching vessel.        Yet the master of the
    ‘tug,   whose   statement   was  unsupported  by  any other testimony,
      asserted that the steamer’s red light was exhibited and signalled

    326        Report   of  the Committee on Colour-Vision.
    accordingly.    The discrepancy in the statement was so great
    that many persons uncharitably charged the master of the tug
   with being intoxicated, although no evidence was offered in
    support of the charge. By this accident ten persons lost their
   lives. Upon a visual examination of this of<U+FB01>cer under the rules
   during the past summer, and during which time there had been
   no question as to sight by the Sergeant of the Marine Hospital
   at Norfolk, he was found to be colour-blind, two examinations
   having been accorded him, with an interval of ten days between
   them.”
      A second case is mentioned in the Shipping and Mercantile
    Gazette and Lloyd’s List, dated 29th June, 1881 :—
      “The pilot of the City of Austin, which was lost in the
 (harbour of Fernandia, Florida, last April, is proved to be colour
   blind. In this way it would appear he mistook the buoys, and
   his mistake cost the owners 200,000 dollars (£40,000).           An
   examination showed that at a distance of more than six feet he
   could not distinguish one colour from another. The physicians
   attribute the defect to an excessive use of tobacco.   The services
   of the marine surgeons were tendered to the local authorities
   without fee two years ago, but were declined.”
      A third case is recounted in a letter from Messrs. Macintyre
   & 00., Liverpool, shipowners :—‘
      “Our ship Carbet Castle collided in the South Channel, bound
   from Dundee to Cardiff, in 1879, with the T. H. Ramz'en, due, as
   far as we can make out, to the colour-blindness, or short-sighted
   ness of the chief o<U+FB02>icer.”
      The following account is written by Captain Coburn, who was
   for many years in the employ of Messrs. Leach, Harrison and
   Forwood, of Liverpool, and is to be found in the Mercantile
   JIarine Reporter, vol. xiv, No. 162 :—
      “ The steamer Neera was on a
                                          voyage from Liverpool to
  Alexandria. One night, shortly after passing Gibraltar, at about
   10.30 p.m., I went on the bridge, which was then in charge of
  the third of<U+FB01>cer, a man of about 45 years of age, and who up to
 that time I had supposed to be a trustworthy of<U+FB01>cer, and compe
’
  tent in every way.      I walked up and down the bridge until about
   11 pm, when the third o<U+FB02>icer almost simultaneously saw a light
  about two points on the starboard how. I at once saw it was a
  green light, and knew that no action was called for. To my
  surprise, the third of<U+FB01>cer called out to the man at the wheel
  ‘port,’ which he was about to do, when I countermanded the
  order, and told him to steady his helm, which he did, and we passed
'the other steamer safely about half a mile apart.     I at once asked
  the third o<U+FB01>’icer why he had ported his helm to a green light on
  the starboard bow, but he insisted it was a red light which he had
.<U+FB01>rst seen.      I tried him repeatedly after this, and although he
  sometimes gave a correct description of the colour of the light,
  he was as often incorrect, and it was evidently all guess work.
  On my return, I applied to have him removed from the ship, as

              Report    of the Committee    on Colour- Vision.            327
   he was, in my opinion, quite un<U+FB01>t to have charge of the deck at
   night, and this application was granted. After this occurrence I
   always, when taking a strange of<U+FB01>cer to sea, remained on the
   bridge with him at night until I had tested his ability to
   distinguish colours. I cannot imagine anything more dangerous,
   or more likely to lead to fatal accidents than a colour-blind'
                                                                          man
   on a steamer’s bridge.”                                          .
      A similar experience is thus related by Captain Heasley, of
   Liverpool :—
      “After passing through the Straits of Gibraltar, the second
  of<U+FB01>cer, who had charge of the deck, gave the order to ‘ port,’
  much to my astonishment, for the lights to be seen about a point
  on the starboard bow were a masthead and green light, but he
  maintained that it was a masthead and red, and not until both
  ships were nearly abreast, would he acknowledge his mistake.              I  _
  may add that during the rest of the voyage I never saw him
  making the same mistake.           As a practical seaman, I consider a
                                                           ”
  great many accidents arise from colour-blindness
      In the collision which   occurred  in February,   1889,    between the
  steamship   Nereid   and  the sailing-vessel  Killochan,  the   vessels had
  had each other in sight for at least two miles, and it was a per
  fectly clear night. The Times, in commenting on this disaster,
  remarks, February 5th, 1889, that “all inquiries respecting the
  cause of disaster lead to the same conclusion, that it was due to
  one of those astounding errors of judgment on the part of one
  or other of the navigators, which seemed to deprive all attempts
  at reasonable exouse.       Each blames the other.”                        -
     As we know that there are many colour-blind men holding
  of<U+FB01>cer’s certi<U+FB01>cates, it will not be surprising if it were found that
 the officer in charge of the steamship Nereid was colour-blind.
 The explanation of the accident would be similar to that <U+FB01>rst
 quoted, namely, that he mistook the green light for a red one, and
 ported in order to go, as he erroneously would think, astern
 of the Killoehan.
     So long as colour-blind men are tolerated in the Mercantile
 Service, these accidents will occur.
     Question.—But could not many of the people on board have
 seen how these accidents occurred?
     Yes, and the evidence in these cases is always con<U+FB02>icting.
 Everybody will remember the loss of the Oregon.               It was said
 to have been run into by a coal boat.         The evidence was contra
 dictory, the light seen being described as white, red, and green.
     But the idea of examining the men’s colour-sight was never
 thought of. In the following case the steamer Toronto on the
 night of January 18th, 1888, ran down the Norwegian barque
 Freidie~ in the Irish Channel, on which occasion thirteen lives
 were lost. The evidence given at the Board of Trade enquiry as
 to the lights seen may be brie<U+FB02>y summed up as follows :—The
 captain, the mate, and the quartermaster saw <U+FB01>rst a red light
~and
       then a green one.      The look-out man saw no red light, only
     vet. LI.                                                           2

the green light.   Asked if he was colour~blind, he replied that
he was not, and that he had never made a mistake in reporting
the colour of a light ; and, in answer to the question as to what
in his opinion was the cause of the collision, he had no hesitation
in stating that it was owing to his own captain porting his
helm.     In a letter published and commented upon in the leading
Liverpool shipping paper, the Journal of Commerce, referring to
this case, it is remarked that “the negative evidence of the
look-out man that he did not see the red light cannot weigh
against the positive evidence of the captain, two of<U+FB01>cers, and the
quartermaster that they did see         and          it,
                                             has yet to be ascertained
                                                            it
why was not seen by him.” But the Court chose to take the
      it
 look-out man’s statement as against that of the of<U+FB01>cers.           The
 o<U+FB01>icers of   a ship being considered the responsible men navigating
a  ship are therefore tested for colour-blindness by the Board of
 Trade, but the Board of Trade do not admit that the look-out
 men are responsible.     They argue in this way :—
    It not for the look-out men to say what the colour of lights
      is
 are they see.      They merely have to report that there         light,             isa
 and
      it
      is    left to the o<U+FB01>icers to say what that light is; but when
 collision cases come into Court the Judges invariably ask the
 “ look-out” as to the colour of the light seen, and as often as not
 take the word of the irresponsible “look-out” against that-of
the responsible of<U+FB01>cer, who          supposed to do the best for his

    Mr. Bickerton subsequently communicated the following results
 of an examination for colour-blindness that he held :—
    “I examined again on Monday and Tuesday last the boys of
the Seamen’s Orphanage in order to obtain some cases for a
lecture.     The results of the two days’ examination were most
curious-—

        The VVITNESS: It\generally affects both eyes, and causes a
    lowering, but seldom complete loss, of the functions of the central
    part of the visual <U+FB01>eld.     Except in very severe cases perception
    of black and white remains, but there is,          Ibelieve, always a
    disproportionate lowering of perception of colours over that area.
    I  believe the usual form it takes is blindness to the complementary
    colours—red and green.                       1
        For detecting the presence, and roughly estimating the size
    and density, of the defective area (scotoma), it is enough to
    use a small piece of coloured paper on the. end of a stick or a
    pen; the coloured piece should vary in diameter from 5 mm. or
    less, up to 25 mm. or more, according t01the'severity of the
    case; the more the sensibility to red, e.g.', is lowered the larger
    must the retinal image be, 2'.e.,' the greater the number of units
    excited, in order that thesensation of red may be produced;
    also the greater the defect the brighter must the colour be.         For
     accurately mapping the scotoma of course the perimeter must be
     used.    As the loss of colour perception on the greater part of the

    the size of the scotoma and its exact outline, like the size and
     exact outline of the normal <U+FB01>eld for any colour, vary according
    to the size and quality of the colour used, and also to some
    extent with practice and attention on the patient’s part.
    I      usually take red <U+FB01>rst, because any defect in that       is most
    easily apparent;         not so easy to get pure green, and many
                         it
                         is                       a
     people are uncertain between blue and green, or do not know
     the names.     In very slight cases, however, ‘we sometimes use        a
     pale green in preference.      The green     Iuse    as pure
                                                           is      a   light
     green as
            I     can get.   “Emerald green” conveys to me the idea
     of a   bluish-green, but perhaps erroneously. Light-green baize    '
     would be the colour,     Ishould think.
         Question—Could    you describe the green you mean in wave
     length ?--I have no knowledge of colour expressed
                                                    '
                                                                in terms of

       The detection of the scotoma depends in         certain degree on
                                                       a
    the luminosity of the test-colour employed; coet. pan, the lew'er
    the saturation of the coloured spot, and the smaller the diameter
    of the coloured spot, the' more easily        isthe defect perceived
    (see answer  to  a previous  question).                            .
    I    do not test with mixed colours for instance, purple
                                              :                    Ifound
    unsatisfactory, except in slight cases of tobacco amblyopia, where
    you must either take an extremely. small spot of pure colour or         a
    larger spot of carefully mixed colour. Such patients will sometimes
    say mauve   is  red.  Something depends on the patient’s training
    and intelligence.    I had    acase of central scotoma from tobacco
    smoking in   a   man who had been accustomed to deal in artist’s
    pigments; he recognised every colour, pure and mixed, in spots of
.   various sizes, tillI   tried  a dark sort of mauve, which appeared
    to him blue or bluish in the centre of the <U+FB01>eld.     He said that'the

 “ smalt.”
               [The witness here handed in a number of charts illustra
 tive of cases of tobacco amblyopia, and atrophy of the optic
 nerves, and explained with reference to then]
      Question—They do not lose the sense of form, only the
 colour ?—The test is used only for its colour.        The form of the
 spot is not spoken of, and is of no importance.
      Question—ls not the defect of Colour-vision generally accom
 panied by defect of Form-vision ?—Yes, always.           I have never
 seen a case in which the loss has been entirely a colour loss.
 The form loss (loss of acuteness of vision at the centre of the
 <U+FB01>eld) is always recorded <U+FB01>rst. Speaking broadly, the loss of
 form-sense, as it is commonly tested, z'.e., by black letters on a
 white ground, is about proportionate to the loss of colour-sense at
 the centre of the <U+FB01>eld.        One commonly records the form-sense,
 however, only at the exact centre of the <U+FB01>eld, whilst in the
 cases of central (or approximately central) scotoma, one tests the
 loss of colour-perception over an area extending several degrees
 from the centre in every direction. If the scotoma area be re
 presented as a cloud, we shall have to say that in different cases
 the total area of the cloud varies, as well as its average density,
.and that .its nucleus or densest spot, though always very near to
 the exact centre of the <U+FB01>eld, seldom coincides precisely with that
 point, being usually 2 0r 3 degrees to its outer (temporal) side,
rsometimes inclined upwards, sometimes downwards.             The cloud
 usually forms an oval, extending further into the outer than the
inner part of the <U+FB01>eld, and frequently including the blind spot.
  If the cloud be very large it may be co-extensive with the <U+FB01>eld
 for green or for red, and then those colours will not be recognised
anywhere; but in the ordinary tobacco cases the cloud is smaller
  than the red <U+FB01>eld, ifnot smaller than the green <U+FB01>eld, so that a
  red-perceiving zone is left of greater or less width and perfection.
  (Several of the charts illustrate these various points.)       In the
  cases to which I have referred the patient has come for advice
  on account of defect of Form-vision, and has seldom said anything
 about Colour-vision. One of the <U+FB01>rst complaints made is often of a
  mistiness that prevents the patientfrom recognising the features
 -of a person at 1a distance (the scotoma when small covering the
  .person’s face at a distance), and at the same time of dif<U+FB01>culty in
 reading, which is not removed by spectacles.         Occasionally they
  -w ill say that people’s faces look unnaturally pale.   I have known
  two cases in which sportsmen found out the defect whilst very
   slight by their bad shooting: they could see the birds rise
  (eccentric vision) but just when they aimed the bird “was lost.”
      Question—When      you have had a man who could not see red,
   and have shown him a red object, say a bit of sealing wax, what
   does it looklike'to him ?—In accordance with what has been
   already said this .vvill depend largely upon (1) the size and (2) the
   brightness (saturation) of the test object.   If it be three or four
  inches long, and an inch or so wide, he will (unless very bad)
  usually recOgnise the colour, either because some part of its

              Report  of  the Committee   on Colour- Vision.        331
retinal image falls on the undamaged part of the red-perceiving
.<U+FB01>eld, or because, though the image falls on none but damaged
 percipient elements, it occupies so many of them that a correct
  sensation is the result. But if the red test be of from 5 to 20 mm.
  diameter,    the patient will call it variously “no colour,” or
  “brown,” or “black,” or later on, perhaps, “white;” <U+FB01>nally,
  after having recognised it correctly in the eccentric parts of the
  <U+FB01>eld, he may continue to, recognise it correctly, though as a
  “paler” a “duller” red, even at the centre. If a light-green
  spot be used as the test, it will commonly be called “white,”
  sometimes “ grey," on the defective area.           I think they never
  call pure red yellow ; certainly not often.    'l‘hey more often call it
 brown.
      Question—With reference to tobacco amblyopia, is there any
particular kind of tobacco you have found to cause it more
.than others ?-—All strong tobaccos, especially “shag,” cavendish,
                                                                  ‘
  and strong cigars.
      Question—Are     cases sometimes     caused by alcohol, or by
tobacco only P—There is a great difference of opinion as to
 whether alcohol alone can produce this form of amblyopia, or
  anyform at all commonly.          Some think it often causes central
  amblyopia, though I have never seen a case where alcohol alone
  had done so. There is abundant evidence that tobacco alone can
  cause it in cases of teetotalers.  We also know tobacco cases occur
  in women smokers.        A large number of carefully recorded facts
  by various observers, bearing on the in<U+FB02>uence of alcohol and
  many other points in relation to this so-called “toxic” amblyopia
  will be found in the “Transactions of the Ophthalmological Society
  of the United Kingdom,” vol. vii, p. 36 (1887).
      Question—In cases of persons who are heavy smokers of
  strong tobacco who get amblyopia, is it not usually some mental
  depression such as would be caused by the loss of a wife or
  child that causes the tobacco to take effect ?—Yes; I have for
  many years insisted strongly on the frequency with which the
  onset of failure of sight in smokers has been preceded by
  something which, directly or indirectly, has caused a lowering
 -of general vigour.     It is comparatively seldom that when tobacco
  amblyopia comes on the subject is in his usual vigour and health.
      Questi0n—-Do you think these cases of scotoma in railway
  servants and others are not common enough to be worth con
  sideration ?—They are not at all so rare as to be unimportant
  from the point of view of signal reading, but the safeguard is
  that they always suffer from defects of form-sense, and that
  causes them so much inconvenience that they take advice for it.
  Though they might now and then manage to carry on their signal—
  ling duties for a time, such an event would be rare.
      Question—Do     you <U+FB01>nd that people engaged in the open air
   suffer less in this respect than those employed indoors, such as
   clerks ?—I do not know that it affects any class particularly,
   apart from depressing or exhausting causes.

  332          Report    of the Committee      on Colour- Vision.
     Question—You think it would be advisable after a railway
  accident to test the driver and guard for central amblyopia ?—
  Yes;    I  think it would be well to do so some little time after
  the accident, since shock is one of the causes of the lowered
  vigour which so often precedes this failure of sight.            I had the
  following case in pointz—A railway servant jumped off the
  foot-board of a train moving at about 10 miles an hour.                   He
  was badly shaken, and his general symptoms were for a time
  suspected to indicate grave degeneration of the brain and spinal
  cord.     His sight also failed, and this was also thought to point
 in the same direction, until it was found, on careful examination,
 that he had the scotoma of tobacco amblyopia, and that he
  smoked.       His sight returned perfectly when he left off smoking;
 he also gradually recovered from the symptoms of shock.
     Question—Your opinion is that, contrary to the ordinary
 so-called colour-blind persons, these people with central scotoma
_have a suf<U+FB01>cient defect of form-sense to warn them                  ?-It    is
 always great enough to be a safeguard.                It is the same with
 other diseases of the optic nerve, but the clinical features
 of cases of atrophy of the optic nerve, from whatever cause,
 are, generally speaking, less uniform than those of the axial
 neuritis that occurs commonly from tobacco smoking,                       and
 perhaps       Occasionally   from other toxic in<U+FB02>uences, and as a
  substantive disease.       The axial neuritis group presents tolerably
 uniform symptoms, because only certain bundles of <U+FB01>bres of the
 optic nerve are diseased, VIZ/r, those which supply the central area
 of the retina, the disease very seldom spreading to the other
 bundles. The symptoms in other forms of optic nerve disease are
 less constant, because the malady does not show any such constant
 selective a<U+FB01>nity for certain strands of <U+FB01>bres, but may affect some
 or all, and with various degrees of severity and of permanence,
 according to the seat and nature of the originating cause. In
 one very important group of cases, the group known generally
 as “progressive atrophy ” of the optic nerve, it is the rule to <U+FB01>nd
 that the <U+FB01>eld of vision in the earlier stages is curtailed at its
 circumference, either all round (“concentric contraction),” or
 more commonly by the loss of sector-shaped pieces.                 Together
 with such total loss of portions of the <U+FB01>eld there is usually a
 lowering of sensibility over the area that remains, so that “ acute
 ness of vision” is damaged also; but sometimes the centre
 remains very good in spite of great loss of peripheral vision.
 This “ progressive atrophy ” is most commonly a part of a similar
 disease affecting the spinal cord (and sometimes the brain)
 in the form of tabes dorsalis or locomotor ataxy.                    Marked
  colour-blindness is the rule in progressive optic atrophy, but,
 according to my own rather rough clinical notes, the loss
 (if colour perception does not stand in a perfectly uniform
 relation with loss of (central) acuteness or with loss of <U+FB01>eld;*
    " I have not collected any observations on this point since publishing
           I then had, in 1883, in vol. iii of the “ Trans. of Ophth. Society,”
 p.     .

    nevertheless, in by far the majority of cases of this sort, as in
    central amblyopia from tobacco. &c., acuteness of vision is so
    much lowered as to be for the patient the most important symptom.
    I remember only one case in which the patient, a sailor, who had
    been accustomed to steer and to look out, discovered his inability
    to distinguish the colour of ships’ lights, whilst his acuteness of
    sight still remained good enough for ordinary purposes about the
    ship. (Wm. B. “ T.O.P.,” iii, 33.)     How the loss of colour-vision
    stands in relation to loss of light perception in cases of optic nerve
    disease, I cannot say.    People suffering from disease of the optic
    nerves often come saying they want glasses for failing sight, and
    naturally think the defect can be remedied by glasses.          Glasses
    do not help the matter, though they of course may remedy the
    form so far as the defect is due to the images not being properly
    focussed.
        Question—It has been alleged on behalf of railway workers
    that the sense of colour-vision becomes impaired             after long
    hours of work and want of rest ?—I have no evidence on that
                     I
    subject ; but should not have thought it likely to be true.
        Question—Have you had any experience of hysterical colour
    blindness ?—Yes, but           I
                                  have not put together my facts about
    it. Contraction of <U+FB01>eld and lowering of acuteness of form-per
    ception are nearly constant; but the state of colour-perception,
    according to my experience, varies greatly. The <U+FB01>elds sometimes
    show spiral contractions, but not always. The spiral contraction
    is, asa   rule, put down to exhaustion.
       About congenital colour-blindness         Ihave not much to say,
    except that            common in men and very rare in women.

    have ever seen of the kind.         It not common green-blindness;

I       think   it must be blue-blindness.      She never makes mistakes
    about green, and          always wrong about other colours.
                              is                                   I     use
    Holmgren’s test.
        Question—You have had some experience with the use of
    a lamp? Can you make any statement about that ?—-The results
    with the lamp vary very much.           Icannot quote statistics; but
                                                                        I
    think  it   is true that as      rule people congenitally colour-blind
                                       a
    will make fewer mistakes with such           a  test than those whose
    colour-defect has come on with disease of the optic nerve, e.g.,
    tobacco cases.        But both classes are liable to make mistakes
    if  taken off their guard by varying the colour of the glass,
    the size of the aperture, or the brightness of illumination.
    A further cause of variation lies in the interest or attention
    that the examinee shows; he may make mistakes at <U+FB01>rst, but
     learn to correct them         the tests are repeated.
                                   if                      I     should not
     myself, as at present advised, rely upon        a   lantern-test alone,
    either as    a   scienti<U+FB01>c test of colour defect, or as a   trustworthy
     guide for the detection of those whose colour-defect    is   dangerous.
     The wool-test       is much less open to these objections, because
-
     the number of tints and shades         isso much larger, and possibly

 also for some optical reasons.       In my testing lantern I have a
 diaphragm with holes of different sizes, representing the regular
 railway lights at different distances, with red and green glass
 supplied by one of the Companies, and in addition a number of
 bits of smoked glass.      I   often, but not always, succeeded in
 getting the persons tested to confuse red and green, and also
 white smoked light with coloured lights. The persons tested
 should stand at a distance of 12 feet, and I vary the. size
 of the hole so as to represent a railway signal at different dis
 tances.   Some time ago my colleague, Mr. Lawford, examined
 an engine driver from the South Western Railway, who came to
 St. Thomas’s Hospital because he had been rejected that morning
 on account of colour-blindness, although he had been two years
 previously tested and passed. His eyes were perfect but colour
 blind. \Vith Holmgren’s <U+FB01>rst series be matched green and red;
 and with the next series he confused greens and greys. He was
tried with the lamp, and then confused red and green in both
 large and small dots, making more mistakes with green than
with red glass.      Such a man, if he were very much on the
watch, might go on for many years with safety.               He said
he never experienced any dif<U+FB01>culty in telling the colours of
the signals because the red “glistened.”         I had a somewhat
similar  case   with a  medical   student who  had   been at sea.  In
trying him with one of Stilling’s tests, consisting of coloured
letters on a black ground, I found he could not see green on
black. I asked him if he could tell lights at sea, and he said,
“Yes, quite easily; there is the red light and the black light.”
I lately saw a man who had been a stoker on the Great Eastern
Railway for a number of years and now wanted to pass as a
 driver; but on being tested was rejected as colour-blind. He
did not believe himself to be so, and came to Moor<U+FB01>elds Hospital
for a certificate that his colour-vision was perfect.     He proved,
however, to be an ordinary red-green blind.        On the other hand,
we have had men appealing to us there because they had been
rejected who really saw colours quite well.
    Question—That probably occurred through using the naming
tests P—Yes, I suppose so.
    Question—Does night-blindness throw any light on the question
 of colour vision ?—I do not think so. Patients who have night
 blindness are certainly not colour-blind.     In such cases I think
 all colours disappear equally, together with form, but I cannot
 speak with any authority on this point.          A very night-blind
 person would be de<U+FB01>cient in the day also.          Temporary night
blindness is due to some want of nutrition of the retina, and is
 often associated with scurvy. It is now a rare disease in this
country. The ordinary varieties of night-blindness are due to
disease of the retina.
    Question—Does     this failure (the permanent night-blindness
due to disease) come on in middle life ?-—It varies; some are born
with the disease which causes      it,  and with others the disease

             Report  of  the Committee   on Coldur- Vision.      335
  comes on later.    In most cases it gets worse. 'It is not due to
  the pupil not dilating, though a <U+FB01>xed small pupil does cause a.
 slight degree of the symptom.                                '
     There is a group of cases of colour-blindness always associated
 with defective acuteness of vision, the peculiarity of which is
 that the affected persons see best by dull light, and cannot see
 nearly so well in bright light—“day-blindness          with colour
 blindness.”     The condition is due to disease occurring very
 early in life, and is stationary.       It generally affects several
 members of a family, and the females as much as the males.
 Usually the colour-blindness is complete, and often total.
  Probably some of these cases have from time to time been taken
 for examples of ordinary congenital colour-blindness.
     Evidence of Captain MACNAB, of the Local Marine Board at
                               Liverpool.
     1 am Chief Examiner and Secretary to the Local Marine Board
at Liverpool, established under the Merchant Shipping Act.
 I  supervise the colour-testing, and frequently conduct it myself ;
in fact, I examine more than anyone else. We have a dark room
 in which we take the candidates, and have the usual lanterns
 supplied by the Board of Trade, with the uniform slides. We place
 the man 18 ft. away from the light, and ask him the usual
 questions.    We also ask him to name colours; if he succeeds in
 passing all these tests we give him a certi<U+FB01>cate, and, if not, we
reject him.
     Question.—VVhat are the usual questions P—VVe use the usual
 shades, and ask the man to name them.           They are the same
 colours as the Board of Trade use. Both of<U+FB01>cers and men are
 examined by me.        They are examined on <U+FB01>rst entering, and
 afterwards.     The o<U+FB02>icers generally come from schools, and are
 of the apprentice class 3 we also get a great number of men from
 large steamships—common        sailors.
     Question—Are either the of<U+FB01>cers or men allowed to enter the
 service of the Companies without passing the prescribed examina
tion for colour-vision P—Yes, anybody can go to sea without pass
ing the colour examination. The last come because large steam
 ships <U+FB01>nd it wise to have them tested.    They come direct from the
ships.     As a general rule, some of<U+FB01>cial from the docks, who has
to look after the gathering of the crews, comes and brings a batch
of men—quartermasters and sailors—with him. A quartermaster
is simply a man who steers, and keeps the gangway.          He wears
the Company’s uniform.         He would often have to take the
look-out duty. On an emergency, say, if a large number of the
crew were down with fever or dysentery, they might take a lower
class of men, who had not been examined for steering and look-out
duty. WVhen      I was at sea it was customary to take “ look-outs”
from anywhere.        The examination for colour-blindness had not
then been instituted. It is usual now to submit men to be tested

for colour-vision in the best Companies, such as the White Star,
Cunard,      Guion, National, and Inman—all the large Atlantic
Companies        They get no higher pay on account of having a.
certi<U+FB01>cate.     They would not be admitted in the large Companies
if rejected by me. Every officer who applies for a certi<U+FB01>cate of the
coasting Companies is tested in colours. There are two di<U+FB01>erent
ways of applying to be examined ; one, when a man applies to be
come an of<U+FB01>cer, and another, by which any one can come, without
formality, by paying Is. to be tested, and, if passed, certi<U+FB01>cated
on the spot.     If a man fails, he can come up again. We had one
who came up four times.          I have had cases where they have
failed once, and afterwards succeeded, but this happens very
seldom. I have seen a fair number of failures.         From May 1, 1877,
until December 31, 1889, in my own port, 12,272 persons were
examined for certi<U+FB01>cates as of<U+FB01>cers; 90 failed, which gives 1 in
 136, or '73 per cent. for that class.    I cannot tell in what propor
tion those men who had already passed were to those examined
for the <U+FB01>rst time.     In the <U+FB01>gures I gave the same man is not
counted twice; they are individuals, and I can say, speaking from
memory, that I do not believe there were two people who had
been failed at other ports and passed at ours.             Prior to 1885
there was great diversity in the mode of conducting the examina
tion, the appliances being different: Liverpool, before that date,
 was, I believe, the only port that had a dark chamber and a decent
 lamp; after that, the Board of Trade issued uniform lamps and
 glasses. With reference to the failures, there is another class show
 ing a higher percentage than the of<U+FB01>cers, viz., those paying
 the shilling fee, principally quartermasters       and forecastle hands.
 Since May, 1880, when the 1s. fee system began, we have
 examined 942; out of these, 34 failed.          During the four years
 1887—1890, when the records were kept more accurately, 22 out
 of 777 failed—a percentage of 2'83 Most of the applicants were
          seamen, with some few of the o<U+FB02>icer class who had failed
gorilgh                                      ‘
   e ore.
     Question—Have you any explanation to give why a man
succeeds after once failing P-Perhaps by getting the colours and
 being coached up. His colour sense might be improved, but              I
 think not.
     Question—Do     you <U+FB01>nd many people ignorant of the names of
 colours ?—That is one of the great di<U+FB01>iculties        I have never tried
 to solve; it is a scienti<U+FB01>c question.     I   have never tried with two
 lights at the same time, and asked the candidate to name them.
 I  always conduct the examination exactly in accordance with the
 Board of Trade instructions. Men do appeal from my decision
 and go to an oculist; in fact, if ever      I  do fail a man, and he is
 young and possibly curable,      I  advise him to go to an oculist in
 order to ascertain whether he is colour blind and incurable, or
 colour ignorant and curable.      I sometimes <U+FB01>nd in testing a man
 coming up for a higher certi<U+FB01>cate, that he fails the second time,
  although he has once passed.          I   do not trace this to any

            Report    of  the Committee   on   Colour-Vision.         337
 peculiarity of vision, but I believe, in most cases, the <U+FB01>rst passing
 was a <U+FB02>uke.
    Question—I suppose that if it is possible to pass by a <U+FB02>uke, the
 method of examination is not satisfactory ?—-I am not prepared
 to say that I think the colour test, as conducted at present,“is
 unsatisfactory, if properly applied.        If I have any doubt          I
 always make a man repeat the names of the colours in his own
 language.
    Question—I     think you said something about crammers.              If
 they cannot develop colour sense, how do they help the candi
 dates ? Is it by showing them the lamps,_or using the apparatus?
 —I believe they provide themselves with a set of colours as
 nearly like ours as possible, or the same.       I know one case of a
 teacher with a similar set. He would show a colour to the man
 who would say, perhaps, “it is red,” and tell him that whenever
 he saw that which appeared to him to be “ red
                                                       ”
                                                          he was to call it
 “
   green.”    I am not quite satis<U+FB01>ed as to the proper names to be
 given to all the coloured glasses we use. There are some you
might perhaps be in doubt about if you had' not been told the
names.     These are the confusion tints.
    Question—Do you think there is anything beyond colour, any
kind of perception, which would enable a man to distinguish
colour ?—No,     I  think not.   I sometimes use the wool test, which
consists of different coloured wools with a number attached to
each.    I  give him a test skein, and tell him “to toss over all of
this sort of colour.”      I apply this test to perhaps three cases in
 a year.   I think the ignorance in naming colours is getting less.
 I believe many of the <U+FB01>rst failures were recorded because a man
did not know the names of colours.              I  think it of supreme
importance     in our business to ask candidates               the names
of colours, and it is better than asking them to match colours,
because the man must transmit the name of the light he sees
to the of<U+FB01>cer of the watch, and if he gives the wrong name it
might mean disaster.
    Question—Your impression is that colour knowledge is as prac
tically important as colour vision ?-—Precisely; only that the one
can be acquired, but not the other.       Something ought to be done
as to vision ; we have no authority to test for that.
    Question—Do you take a man with weak eyes ?—We cannot
stop such a man going to sea, though he would not see in a heavy
wind or rain.
    Question—Do      you think fog interferes with the lights ?—
Certainly; it takes from the carrying power, and turns a green
light to white.
    Question—Have you any means of explaining as to this to men
                                                                       '
joining the service ?-—No, it is not within our scope.
    Question—Gould      you  make  any suggestion     ‘as  to what should
be used as a test for acuteness of vision and power of seeing at
a distance ?——Not beyond standing by the man, and ascertaining
how he can see things at a distance.         It would not be sul<U+FB01>cient

338         Report    of   the Committee    on   Colour- Wsion.
 for him to pass such a test once; he should be re-tested every
 ten years at least.     Not many men come to me wearing glasses.
 They consider it rather infra dig., and glasses would interfere
 with the discharge of their duty, being affected by rain, &c.
    Question—What is your opinion on the practical importance of
 the question of colour-sight in the Navy and Mercantile Marine,
 and as to any facts which have come under your notice, that tend
 to show it is an occasional cause of disaster ?—I have no statistics
 or cases on record, but it seems to go without saying that, if a
 man cannot describe colours, it may lead to disaster, and there
 may have been many disasters that could be traced altogether
 to it,  although we cannot prove it.           The importance of the
 question   cannotbe    over-estimated.    I  know   of no instances of
 collision or shipwreck where the colour-vision of the persons
 psssibly in fault has been tested in legal or other enquiries, but     I
 know an instance of       aman who was chief of<U+FB01>cer of        asteamship
 and had been in the Company many years, and was promoted
 to the command of a large vessel, and then asked to get his
 certi<U+FB01>cate for colours.     He tried at London and Liverpool and.
 failed at both, and then realized the fact that he was hopelessly
 colour-blind. If the Company had not asked as to his colour
 vision he would probably be at sea at the present time. That
 man had passed the Board of Trade examination in navigation
 and seamanship, but not for colour-vision.        Another man     Iknow
 of, who has failed in colours six or seven times.     I   have seen in
 command of    a  vessel with the Board of Trade highest certi<U+FB01>cate
 as an extra master, but he     is unable to distinguish colours.     He
 passed his examination for navigation, but his certi<U+FB01>cate         is en
 dorsed “colour-blind."       The Board of Trade cannot forbid the
 employment of such    a  man.    It very unsatisfactory that a man
                                      is
 who has failed to pass the colour test should command a vessel,
 andI    should recommend legislation to alter this, as that       is the
 only way it   can be stopped.   I   think that beyond being able to
 distinguish red and green lights when they are together,          a man
 should know the green, even         if he could not see the red light,
 and many of these colour-blind people would be able to dis
 tinguish between red and green            ifthey saw both together,
especially if   crammed up beforehand.           The diminution of the
inability to recognise green becomes of great importance.           There
 are only two roads to go, and you must be either right or wrong.
I  sometimes <U+FB01>nd candidates call our green light white.
    Question—Supposing      they could distinguish on board ship a
 green light, by its appearing to them white, and the other red,
 would that be suf<U+FB01>cient ?—No, because they might mistake a
 steamer for a   <U+FB01>shing boat. It essential to be able to distinguish
                                     is
 green as accurately as possible, and at as great          a distance as
 possible, and   if this power   is   diminished to    a certain extent,
'danger may be apprehended.
    Question—There    is  often no time for deliberation in forming a
judgment ?—N0. Often the light cannot be seen until the vessel          is

              Report   of   the Committee   on   Colour- Vision.             339'
close, and one false move precipitates calamity. Stormy weather is
at times the clearest, but often the condition of weather is such
that a man, upon seeing the lights, is close upon the other vessel,
and has very little time to make up his mind.      That    in fact,is,
the normal condition of affairs round the British and American
coasts.   The man who can see green thoroughly and easily will
have a larger margin for action.      In the case of man whose
                                                             a
vision    imperfect, he would waste his time in making up his
         is
mind as to the colour, and pride would not allow him to call any
body to his aid.
   Question—You have had large experience at sea ?—Yes.
   Question—Do you think red and green are the best lights P—
The best up to the present, but we want better green;

weak.    It    apt to turn white in
              is                        fog. It does occasionally
                                            a
happen in enquiries that there        a difference in the evidence
                                       is
about the light shown, but          cannot answer from my own
                                      I
experience.    I have never given evidence before the Admiralty
Court.
   Question—Would you recommend, in cases of collision, that
an examination should be made as to the colour-vision of the
of<U+FB01>cer in charge of the vessel ?—Yes, whenever there was
reason to doubt about it.        p
   Question—Have you any knowledge          of training ships P—I
                                  ”
examine boys from the “ Conway and “ Indefatigable,”as of<U+FB01>cers,
in one case, and sailors in the other.       The examinations are
systematic.    If reject them,

blindness a good way to get out of it.       had one case in which
                                                 I

his colour-blindness was genuine.
   Question—Then after receiving all the advantages of the
training he might be rejected P—Yes, and he might be made a
junior of<U+FB01>cer before he appears for the examination, and perhaps
be in charge of the ship in <U+FB01>ne weather. The authorities are
very careful with regard to colour-vision, and reject a good
many.    I  examine 40 to 60 of the “Conway” lads in       year.   a

                  Evidence of Staff-Surgeon PRESTON, R.N.
       I have had three years’ experience with the testing for Colour
    vision in the Navy, that              is,
                                     the examination of recruits for the
    Marines, domestics, stokers, and boys; also of every class of
    o<U+FB01>icer entering the Service, at the Admiralty. In 1888, for which
    year only examined a proportion of the cases, the total number
        I
    examined was 2,935, in 1889 3,856, and in 1890 3,961.            With
    regard to the Service,     it   matter of great importance that we
                                     is   a
    should not have any persons either with defective vision or im
    perfect perception of colours, and with           view to that end a
                                                                 a
    printed form     isalways forwarded to the parents or guardians of
    any young gentlemen coming up for naval cadetships, or assistant
    clerkships, recommending      that previously to their educational
    examination for these posts by the Civil Service Commissioners,
    they should be medically examined by their own private practi
    tioner, and special stress      laid upon the fact that the candidate
                                      is
    would be un<U+FB01>t for the Service             affected with blindness, or
                                                      if
    defective vision, or imperfect perception of colours. [The Witness
    here handed in a copy of the form referred to, calling special
    attention to paragraph 4.      The larger number of those entering
    the Service, principallyb lie-jackets, stokers, and Marines, have
    nothing of that sort submitted to them, but they are subjected to
    a  preliminary examination by couple of Sergeants, before being
                                                a
,   passed on to me as medical examiner.        The preliminary, or rough
    test, consists of the ordinary asking of questions as to bright
    colours on card-board.      Imay remark that      see about 3,000 men
                                                                 I
    and boys     a year at the Rendezvous, but there are nearly three
    times that number who come in the building applying to enter the
    Service, or raised by the Recruiting Sergeants; only one-third,
    however, come to me, the rest being rejected for some cause or
    other.   With regard to the men—stokers, Marines, servants, and
    dockyard apprentices—I simply use the ordinary colour test.
    [Test board handed in.] Each person in succession has to cover
    one eye, and then     a colour      pointed out, and he
                                                is             asked what is
    colour  it is. If there       the slightest hesitation in replying,

    used for many years with men and boys, and            have found, as
                                                                     I           a

    to colour ignorance, and appears to be con<U+FB01>ned to men and
    boys raised in the country recruiting centres of England and
    Scotland.     In many instances these persons will confuse the
    brighter colours, yellows and blues; they understand green, but
    frequently, especially with boys raised in the Eastern Counties,
    where they are recruited from agricultural labourers, they cannot
    detect some of the test greens, although they will at once
    recognise grass-green     with Holmgren’s wools.           am speak  I
    ing of boys from the country as contrasted with those raised in
    London or twenty miles round, of whom large number come to  a
    us every day.

              Report  of the Committee   on Colour- Vision.        341
     In the ordinary examination the candidate would be told to
  point out all the colours on the board. We <U+FB01>nd it necessary to
  state to the candidates that there are four simple colours—no
  crimsons, oranges, or violets.
      In case a candidate fails to name correctly the colours on the
  board, we satisfy ourselves further by using the wool test.      The
  men who are going to be examined have no access whatever to the
- test board, and to vary the positions of the colours we turn the
  board round.      We carry our tests much farther in the case of
  o<U+FB01>icers, particularly naval cadets and engineer students, who are
  required to have absolute normal vision and colour vision, each being
  examined separately by Snellen’s test, supplemented by <U+FB02>ags and
  wools. They stand at a distance of 16 feet, and are shown each of
  the <U+FB01>n gs separately, and have to name them in quick succession,
  tested with either eye.      That is the <U+FB01>rst test, and the next is
  Mr. St. Clair Buxton’s marine telechrome.    [The Witness exhibited
  this apparatus, and explained its use] The glasses in this lantern
  are used at the same distance as the <U+FB02>ags (16 feet), with red, blue,
  violet, green, and white lights inquick succession, and with the
  fogging apparatus, which is simply a piece of glass fogged on
  one side, with no lens whatever. Supposing a candidate mistakes
  between red and green, we take a further test.         The candidate
  is allowed to wait while the rest of the examination is proceeded
  with, and is then re-examined on the doubtful point, as it is
   absolutely necessary that an executive of<U+FB01>cer should discern. at
   once every coloured <U+FB02>ag, either of our own or foreign nations.
  In several cases the Medical Director-General has allowed a
   young gentleman to come up a second time for examination one
   or two days later, but    I have looked through the records and
   <U+FB01>nd they are never successful when once defective colour percep
   tion has been detected.
      The <U+FB01>gures giving the proportion of candidates rejected are as
   follows :—In 1888 there were 214 examined for Naval Cadetships,
   and of those, onewas rejected for inability to distinguish greens
  from browns, .and another was found ignorant of the names of
   colours.   It appears, however, in the records that upon being
   examined subsequently the same day he was passed.           In 1889,
   out of 293 examined, there were 1-02 rejections for defective
   colour perception. Of these one was rejected for confusing greens
   and browns; one was absolutely colour-blind; and one in the
   immediate perception of colours was uncertain.         In 1890, 305
   naval cadets were examined, the percentage of rejections being
   1'31.    Of these one was rejected for inability to distinguish
   between greens,reds, and browns; and three were rejected for being
   unable to distinguish green from red.      These were boys whose
   parents had received the warning as to defective sight; but, as a
   rule, parents do not care to go to the expense or trouble of a.
   medical examination beforehand by their own doctor.           .
       Although  I have laid great stress upon promptness in replying
   to the questions in examination, we do not reject candidates for

   342        Report  of  the Committee on Colour- Vision.
   want of promptness. If there is the slightest doubt we re-examine,
   always testing such cases with Holmgren’s wools before <U+FB01>nally
   rejecting them.    Naval cadets and engineer students have four
  examinations in colour-perception before they are declared unfit.
      The conclusion in the case I referred to as totally colour-blind
  must have been arrived at in the ordinary way by Holmgren's
  wools, the <U+FB02>ags and buntings. I may mention that if boys, when
  sent to the training-ships from our Rendezvous, are suspected with
  regard to their colour-perception, it is reported, and they are,
  when on the ship, tested by night as well as day : by day
  with the telescope up to, say, the distance of a mile, and at night
  time with the coloured lights at the full length of the ship.  [The
  \Vitness here exhibited a specimen of the Admiralty green glass,
  as used in the lights, and explained with reference to it]
      We never <U+FB01>nd anybody who can distinguish the Admiralty
  green who cannot distinguish a greener green.         Where candi
  dates persistently confuse red and green in the lantern, but sort
  the wools correctly in using Holmgren’s test, it is the fault of
  the lantern not being suf<U+FB01>ciently green.       Speaking of colour
  blindness which is not congenital, I should say that all the naval
  cadets to which I have referred were, as far as our registers
  show, rejected for colour-blindness which was congenital, but I
  should have dif<U+FB01>culty in getting further information upon that
  point.
     We have no records of men with normal vision among whom
  colour-blindness has been brought on by disease.
     Naval of<U+FB01>cers are never examined after their appointment,
 and, therefore, they might be suffering from tobacco amblyopia;
 but naval cadets and engineer students are not allowed to
  smoke until they are eighteen years of age, and on the Britannia
 they are, of course, constantly being examined with colours.
     When they have once been passed into the Service they would
 not be examined again systematically ; but if there was any
 suspicion as to colour perception, they would be examined by the
 medical of<U+FB01>cer of their own ships, and invalided, and if found to
 have defective colour-vision, be removed from the Service.
     There have been a few cases of blue-jackets who, upon offering
 themselves for rating as signalmen, were rejected as colour-blind,
 but upon closer examination it has been found to be due to defects
 of the accommodation of the eye.
     This would be brought out in the following way:—Upon a
 man being examined for signalman he would be required to read
 hoists of 20 or 30 <U+FB02>ags at once, and upon being asked by his
examiner what a <U+FB02>ag was would answer “w” instead of “q,”
 and upon reference it would be found he mistook red for green.
This might be due to defective vision rather than defective
colour perception, but this would come out in examination at the
shorter ranges.
    All men are examined, as every man is a look-out man more or
less.    All pass a course of musketry and gunnery instruction,

            Report   of the Committee  on Colour- Vision.         343
and before this are medically examined to test their power of
vision, because if this were not absolutely normal the training
would
'
         be time thrown away.
    They are examined by the of<U+FB01>cers of their own ships by the
method laid down in the Queen’s Regulations: coloured <U+FB02>ags
supplemented by Holmgren’s wools.
    I do not know of any case of an of<U+FB01>cer becoming colour-blind
through disease.      The defects that are found are generally those
of accommodation, and occur primarily with of<U+FB01>cers about 45
years of age who are presbyopic.
    To the best of my belief, there is no of<U+FB01>cer in the Service at
the present moment at all defective in colour-vision ; that,         I
believe, is so with regard to the executive branch, and engineers
who are in charge of the machinery of torpedo boats.         I  do not
think that there are any Marine or medical of<U+FB01>cers defective
in colour-vision.
    I know of no cases of collision, where there has been a court
martial on the loss of a ship, in which any doubt has arisen as to
whether it occurred through inability to read the signals, except
that of the Iron Duke and the Vanguard, where the look-out
man was said to have been myopic.        In such a case the question
 would undoubtedly be thoroughly gone into, because it would be
the sole defence of the man.
    The look-out men are put through the card test as boys, and
 are for <U+FB01>ve years after undergoing a constant test by their
 instructors, with <U+FB02>ags and bunting, from a few yards to a mile,
 and with the telescope as well.
    If a man was wrong in his signals, he would be detected, and
 examined by the medical of<U+FB01>cer, and then sent to hospital for
 further observation.
    With reference to the statistics as to recruits in the Marines,  I
 have looked back for six or seven years, and <U+FB01>nd none rejected as
 far as the Medical Of<U+FB01>cer was concerned, but they have been
 previously sifted by the Sta<U+FB01>-sergeants, who examine for colour
 and form-perception, using Holmgren’s decided colours.         I only
 see one-third of those who come up, the Staff-sergeants having
 probably rejected the rest.
    N0 recruits who have passed the wool test are found to be
 inef<U+FB01>cient subsequently among Marines, domestics, and arti<U+FB01>cers;
 but a small percentage,       and with boys but an in<U+FB01>nitesimal
  number, failed subsequently.    It often happens that a boy who
  passes our test in London, and <U+FB01>nding a life on board ship per
  fectly new to him, gets discontented, is told by somebody that
  by saying he does not know what certain colours are he may
  be sent to hospital, and invalided out of the Service; but they
  are examined at the hospital, and in all cases returned to their
 vessels.

344          Report of the  Committee  011  Colour- Vision.
            Evidence of Dr. GEORGE LINDSAY JOHNSON.
   The CHAIRMAN: You are aware, perhaps, Dr. Johnson, that
this Committee is investigating the general subject of colour
blindness.    We gather that you have given your attention to
the subject, and should be glad of any information you can give
the Committee as to your experience of practical testing by
various methods ?-—I am acquainted with most methods.           I have
used the spectroscope, and recently a simple form of Captain
Abney’s method.       I have also had a little experience with
Donders’ method.       Some of my testing has been with the
spectroscope with a graduated circle, in which you read Off the
point where the spectrum appears to the patient to end. It is
only with red-blind and green-blind cases I have had much
practical acquaintance; although I have had one violet-blind.
In using the spectroscope, I ask the patient to <U+FB01>x the point where
the spectrum appears to end, and read it off on the scale, to see
if I can get an improvement bene<U+FB01>ting the patients who are
red-blind, and in order to practically measure the improvement
under special treatment.      I may say with coloured wools or
ordinary re<U+FB02>ected colours I do not think it is so easy to ascer
tain whether patients make a de<U+FB01>nite improvement                as by
measuring with a Vernier’s scale, with which the exact limit to
 which the red end extends can be made out.
    Some patients <U+FB01>nd a dif<U+FB01>culty in <U+FB01>xing the exact limit to
which the red extends ; but, as a rule, with intelligent patients,
they can <U+FB01>x it pretty de<U+FB01>nitely.
    The source of light I have hitherto employed has been a
candle at Moor<U+FB01>elds Hospital, and a para<U+FB02>‘in lamp at home.
    I <U+FB01>nd there is a variation according to the light used, and to
prevent error on this account I have always used with the same
patient the same source of light.          Sky-light gives different
results to candle-light, and also with regard to the <U+FB01>elds of
vision.
    In taking <U+FB01>elds of vision I generally use Dr. Priestley Smith’s
perimeter, which I have modi<U+FB01>ed somewhat myself. I am not
 quite satis<U+FB01>ed with the dead or pigment colours, but adapt to the
perimeter an instrument for taking <U+FB01>elds of vision, which I have
 had constructed for use with a 2-candle power incandescent
electric-light.
    [The Witness handed in a diagram illustrating the apparatus
 referred to, and explained with reference to its use]
     Question.—Does your experience go to prove that the spectrum
 colours all disappear at the same angle as Landholt holds, or do
 you <U+FB01>nd a difference in the disappearance according to the
 intensity of the light employed ?—Yes. I am certain the di<U+FB01>er
 once is in accordance with the intensity of the light.     1 have not
 got <U+FB01>gures at present with regard to the exact point where the
 colours stop with the spectrum, and do not think my <U+FB01>gures
 would be of much use, unless interpreted by Fraunhofer’s lines.

                Report  of  the Committee   on  Colour- Vision.         345
     With regard to results obtained in increasing the sensibility of
the eye to red in red colour-blind cases        I have had a patient who
came to me originally at Moor<U+FB01>elds, who had been rejected by
the Board of Trade because he could not see bluish-green or red
lights on board ship. He was extremely colour-blind with regard
to red, the red colour being shortened nearly up to the orange, so
it occurred to me that acting on the supposition that in his case
the trouble was probably central and not peripheral—for             I  could
<U+FB01>nd no change whatever in the disc—I got him a pair of goggles
so as to completely exclude all daylight except what <U+FB01>ltered
through the best red photographic glass with which they were
<U+FB01>tted.        I told him to wear these goggles the whole day long
until he went to bed at night, not taking them off until the lights
 were out. He followed my instructions, and            I tested him every
 consecutive       month   with   Holmgren’s  wools,  and  noted on a list
 the colours in which he made mistakes.            At the end of a month
 I   found a considerable improvement, and at the end of three
 months his colour-vision was nearly perfect, being wrong in only
 three out of forty, whereas at <U+FB01>rst he was wrong in thirty out of
 forty.       I sent him again to the Board of Trade for re-examina
 tion, and they found he was so much better than before that
 they told him still more, he might come to them again and they
 would grant his certi<U+FB01>cate.          He went up again and passed com
 pletely in the red and green glass test with the lantern, but
 failed on the card test in the light pink and light blue.        The last
 time     I   heard he had got the post of mate of a vessel trading
 between London and the Netherlands.
      He were these coloured glasses up to the time he passed. He
 said it was a great trouble seeing everything red, but insisted on
 keeping to them, notwithstanding the inconvenience; and upon
  testing him with the spectroscope—which is the only absolute
  test we possess—there certainly was an improvementin his vision
  as far as the extent of light towards the red end was concerned.
  I  asked him to de<U+FB01>ne red, but from what          I could gather he had
  always had congenital colour-blindness, and it was very dif<U+FB01>cult
  to say whether his sensation of red was the same as ours. It is
  my <U+FB01>rm conviction that the continual stimulation of some part
  of the conducting <U+FB01>bres or sensorium—whether peripheral or
  central—of red, awoke a faculty of perceiving something which
  may be called red.         I  did not try whether his colour-blindness
  was central, nor whether he relapsed after leaving off his
  glasses, but will make enquiries.
      I tried with two other similar cases, which got a little better,
  but afterwards they gave up the goggles, saying they could
  not see well enough to go about with the glasses.               I   do not
  think the case      I have mentioned was due to tobacco, as the man
  hardly ever smoked, and his vision was very acute, being gths,
   or one line below normal, in either eye.
      With regard to detecting colour-blindness by the ophthalmo
   scope    I  may say that    I have  strong reasons for believing there
                                                                 2A2

are two forms of colour-blindness,      viz., central or cerebral; and
peripheral, or connected with the optic nerve, as in retro-bulbar
neuritis, or in the retina itself, or the choroid.    In those cases in
which colour-blindness is congenital         I  can detect absolutely
nothing with the ophthalmoscope which would lead me to suppose
that the patient was colour-blind.         I  can, on the other hand,
exhibit a number of diagrams showing marked changes in patho
logical colour-blind cases. The portion of the disc affected is
more extended, and there is that wedge-shaped triangle on the
outer side of the disc which is so characteristicof tobacco and
other narcotic amblyopias, only in these cases it is generally more
extended.
    [The Witness here handed in a number of charts illustrating
cases of colour-blindness, and called special attention to a pale
spot on the retina which was characteristic of such cases]
    I have brought with me a patient who has perfect colour
vision with one eye, while in the other she has no colour what
ever.     She describes the appearance of the spectrum as being
like a grey smear.      I  cannot <U+FB01>nd that she has any perception of
violet.
    Q uestion— I think you said you had another point to bring before
the Committee ?—Yes.           I have some information, the result of
two or three years’ study“ which I am not sure exactly regards
this Committee, but I have made some experiments showing that
if you place glass in front of the eye so as to wholly exclude
daylight as far as possible, and have glasses made so that only
the blue-violet end of the spectrum passes through, cutting off
orange and part of the yellow, the <U+FB01>eld of vision for white, if
contracted, will after a week become enlarged to normal, and that
holds good with some cases of detachment of the retina.          I was
induced to make a large number of experiments with rabbits to           -
 ascertain the reason. They were kept in a hutch-like photo
graphic chamber so that no other light than that through the red
 or blue glass could reach their eyes.      After a certain time they
were killed and put in a black bag, their eyes being <U+FB01>xed in
 osmic or nitric acid.       I found a distinct anatomical difference
 between the retinas of the animals under the different glasses;
 and these differences come under four heads :—
    Firstly, in the animals kept in the blue light the rods of the
 retina adhere much more closely to the little processes of the
 hexagonal prism, so that the retina cannot be easily detached
 after death. Secondly, the pigment under blue glass is increased.
 Thirdly, the retinas take up <U+FB02>uid more easily than they do in the
 opposite colour; and lastly, not only do they stain much better
 in the staining <U+FB02>uids, but are also more developed, and seem to
 increase and multiply more than in the red glass.          These four
 points hold good for all rabbits.      It seems to me that animals
 kept under a constant source of blue wave-lengths have certain
 changes effected in the retina differing from those under the red
 end of the spectrum, and that possibly may account for the

           Report  of  the Committee   on Colour- Vision.        347
reason that  I <U+FB01>nd the  <U+FB01>eld of vision increased in almost all cases
of patients whose <U+FB01>eld of vision has been contracted beforehand,
if kept for a length of time wearing the goggles I have referred
to.   I am not prepared to say whether if the rabbits are exposed
to ordinary light the retinas would return to their former con
dition.
    Question—It is said that photographers suffer from working
constantly in a red light; do you think that is so P—No; but I
think they suffer from bad ventilation, as a rule.
    Question—You say that after death there is more dif<U+FB01>culty in
the detachment of retina after keeping the animals in a particular
light; would that have any application to colour-blind cases, or
point to any cure ?—I cannot positively state an instance of a
detached retina going back, but in almost all cases of slight
detachment of the retina, where the <U+FB01>eld of vision has been cut
off ever a certain area, that area has been considerably increased
after wearing blue glasses, except when separated by effusion
and forms of umbrella detachment, when the retina becomes, as it
were, bleached.
    Question—Have you had any experience with progressive
atrophy, as to whether persons suffering from it have a lack
of colour-sensation P—I <U+FB01>nd their <U+FB01>eld of vision, both for white
and for colours, is extremely contracted,       and that nothing I
have ever tried for them has done the slightest good.         I have
taken the <U+FB01>eld of vision for a great many atrophies, and <U+FB01>nd
blue is the last colour to disappear, as well as the most extended.
I have never found a patient with a blue <U+FB01>eld and no other, but I
have found blue extends further than any other.       According to
Herring, the blue and yellow <U+FB01>eld ought to be co-terminous, but
I do not <U+FB01>nd that to be the case.
                  Evidence of Dr. EDRIDGE GREEN.
    The CHAIRMAN: I believe you have paid a good deal of atten
tion to the question of colour-vision, and perhaps you will be so
good as to describe to the Committee the methods you have used
in your colour tests, and the general character of the results
obtained P—[Witness handed in a diagram illustrative of psycho
physical colour-perception, and explained as follows] :—
     The theory is that the perception of colour is a perception of
difference; colours are confused by the colour~blind, not because
of any loss of substance, but because the individual cannot
perceive any di<U+FB01>erence between the rays of light included
in a portion of the spectrum which appears monochromatic
to him.     The size of the monochromatic         band varies   with
the individual. A person who has very defective colour-perception
has a monochromatic      band so wide as to include several colouls
which are easily distinguished by a normal sighted person.

       348         Report of  the Committee    on Colour- Vision.
          In some cases seven colours are seen, and then the seventh.
       colour appears at the point where it should appear by theory.
       In the <U+FB01>rst degree of colour-blindness only <U+FB01>ve colours, or points
       of di<U+FB01>erence, are seen in the spectrum; in the next degree four ;
       in the next, three; then two. Then a neutral band appears at
       the blue-green junction, and this increases in size in different
       cases until total colour-blindness is reached.        Therefore, the
       vision of the normal-sighted being hexachromic, the vision of
       the colour-blind is pentachromic,      tetrachromic, trichromic, or
       dichromic.   It will be noticed that the greatest difference is to
       be found between the 3-unit and the 2-unit cases of colour
       blindness, the primary colours for each being quite different.
       The two primary colours for the 2-unit are yellow and blue,
       and they each represent half of the spectrum.         In the case of
       the 3-unit the three primary colours          are red, green, and
       violet. Red combined with green forms yellow; violet combined
       with green forms blue ; so it is evident that these colours occupy
       the positions which I theoretically allotted to them.
          The above refers to the number of approximate psycho
       physical colour units.     An approximate psychophysical colour
       unit is a portion of a physical series which contains physical
       units that are not easily distinguished from each other, and
       are so much alike as to be called by the same name.        An abso
       lute psychophysical colour unit is a portion of a physical series
       which contains physical units that cannot be distinguished
       from each other even under the most favourable circumstances.
       It will be seen that an approximate unit contains several abso
       lute units, but in each case the similarity between them is greater
       than the dissimilarity;    for instance, there are many hues of
       red, but the character of redness enables them to be classed
       together.
          The other chief cause of colour-blindness is shortening of one
       or both ends of the spectrum.        This is probably due to some
       retinal defect, as neither light nor colour are perceived at the
       shortened end.      It is distinct and separate from diminished
       psychophysical perception, which is due to defective size of the
       colour-perceiving centre in the brain.
           Question—How would you establish the six or any other
       number of colours with the person you were examining P—A
       person who sees six will at once say so.             I test with a
       spectroscope    provided with two shutters in the eye-piece,
       showing the examinee in the <U+FB01>rst instance red, orange, yellow,
       and yellow-green, because these are of nearly equal luminosity.
        I make him indicate the junctions of the colours; any colours
       can be cut off with the shutters, so that the person examined is
       not able from one colour to guess the others.      I use an ordinary
       spectroscope (one prism), provided with shutters, as explained.
       The actual procedure in using this test is as follows :—I ascertain
       where the spectrum commences, where it terminates, what
       colours are seen, and where the junctions of the colours are, the
Imam-—

patient using the shutters until he is satis<U+FB01>ed that he has
obtained the correct junction.
   Question—If you had say <U+FB01>ve points of di<U+FB01>erence, would they
always come exactly in the same place ?—Yes; such a case
would not see orange as a de<U+FB01>nite colour.
   Question—Would a patient recognise no orange, supposing a
single colour was suitably chosen and distributed over a sensible
<U+FB01>eld, and beginning from the sodium line ?—A 5-unit case usually
objects to the term orange; he would probably call it reddish
yellow.
   I have not come across any 1-unit cases; that is the
only one on the diagram that is not drawn from my own ex
perience.    I should explain that the diagrams are all drawn
the same lengths, to demonstrate the psychophysical diminution
of colour-perception and not the shortening of the spectrum, in
which case another effect is produced, viz., the junctions of all
colours are altered; a 2-unit, with shortening of the red end
of the spectrum, puts the junction of his two colours nearer the
blue than a 2-unit with an unshortened spectrum.
   Diagram No. 6 shows a transition from red to violet; in such
cases there is no neutral band in any part of the spectrum.
The one colour passes into the other without any de<U+FB01>nite
intermediate   point.
   In examining for     scienti<U+FB01>c purposes the spectrum would be the
<U+FB01>rst test, afterwards wools, pigments, or lights, in accordance
with the spectrum examination.
   Question—Would it not be easy to coach a person for this ?—
No, because he would never be able to hit off the exact junctions
of the colours.
   Question—Which class of the colour-blind would you consider
as representing dangerous         cases for signalling purposes ?—-I.
Those who possess a psychophysical colour-perception with
three or less units. II. Those who, whilst being able to perceive
a greater number of units than three, have the red end of the
spectrum shortened to a degree incompatible with their recogni
tion of a red light at a distance of two miles.        III. Those who
are affected with central scotoma for red or green.         The 3-unit
would be unsafe, for though he would always recognise red and
green, even to the lowest degree of luminosity, he would confuse
yellows, especially dark yellows, with reds and greens, and
generally call them reddish-greens; in fact, yellow has been
described by such a patient as being of the same colour as a red
clover <U+FB01>eld in full blossom.        The 2-unit cases and below are
absolutely dangerous.        The 5-unit and 4-unit are safe.

its use, Captain Abney being asked to pick out all the shades

other by red ‘?—Yes;           I
                           should describe such a case as not seeing
orange.
   Question—I understand Dr. Brown’s test comes out under your
patronage; may we therefore take it that you approve of that
method ?—Not at all.         A medical man might roughly test
with it.
   Question—D0 you test by nomenclature          or matching ?—By
nomenclature, combined with matching.         Many normal sighted
persons fail with Holmgren’s test because they think a shade
is a colour, paying as much attention to the one as the other;
                  I
if you say “ want you to pick out all the greens,” you give them
something tangible to go upon. If a person in picking out
twenty or thirty greens also picked out half-a-dozen reds, it
would be certain he was colour-blind; but if he has to match a
green wool he might pick out with the greens a light brown, and
not be colour-blind at all, and the error could be recti<U+FB01>ed by
explaining to him that the colour he selected was greenish
brown, reddish-brown, or yellow-brown, as the case might be.
\Vith Holmgren’s test, under the same circumstances, he would
have failed. This might be con<U+FB01>rmed by asking him to classify
the whole 150 colours.
   Question—Do        I
                    understand you that a normal sighted person
might pick out brown instead of pale green ?—Yes, because he
might pay more attention to shade than to colour.         In testing
practically   Ishould <U+FB01>rst use the Classi<U+FB01>cation Test.            I
                                                              should
not begin with the spectrum with a practical test; it would not
be convenient, and persons would object to it.
   [At this point the witness was asked to apply the Classi<U+FB01>cation
Test to Mr. Rix. Mr. Rix was <U+FB01>rst requested to pick out all the
shades of orange he could see, and in so doing be selected two
skeins of wool of a decided light green.        Dark blue and violet
were matched as being of the same colour.          In matching reds,

experienced examiners might not have to depend upon the
Lantern Test—in which not more than twenty answers are
required. I     do not use the Board of Trade colours with that
test, but my own.        The person examined should be able to
distinguish between the red, green, and white lights, either
alone or modi<U+FB01>ed with the neutral glasses.
    Question—Why do you think        necessary to have a preliminary
                                        it
test to this ?—In order that an inexperienced examiner may feel
certain that the mistakes made with the Lantern Test are not
due to colour ignorance.
    Question—Have     your investigations been with pathological or
congenital colour-blind cases ?—With both.
   The principles upon which        examine are as follows :—The
                                      I
<U+FB01>rst principle which guided me in the selection of colours may be

                                                       a
              Report  of  the Committee    on Colour- Vision.         351
  illustrated in the following way :—Let us take an ordinary 2-unit
  colour-blind, and, having given him the set of wools belonging
  to the Classi<U+FB01>cation Test, ask him to pick out all the reds.          On
  examining the pile of wools selected as red, it will be found that
  the majority are red, but in addition there will be some browns,
  and yellow-greens.       If he be then told to pick out the whole of
  the greens, the greater number of those selected will be greens,
  but there will be also greys, browns, and reds. In each case it
  will be seen that the majority of wools are of the desired colour.
      If another 2-unit colour-blind be examined in the same way it
  will be found that, though he may not make exactly the same
  mistakes, he will in all probability pick out the same greens to
  put with the reds, and the same reds to put with the greens.
  The same result will be Obtained if the colour-blind persons be
  asked to name a large number of colours.            They will in most
  cases name the colour correctly.        It will be noticed that the
 greens which were put with the reds when classifying the
 colours, will be called red in naming them.           It is evident that
  the same idea has guided the colour-blind in each case.
     This shows that, though a person may be red-green blind, he
 is not absolutely red-green blind in the sense of being totally
 unable to distinguish between the two colours.          This is what we
 should expect, as the red and green are included in an approxi
 mate, not in an absolute psychophysical unit. The fact that they
 are actually judging by colour may be demonstrated             by giving
 them coloured materials of different kinds, or by asking them to
 name a large number of coloured objects.           To a person with a
 spectrum of normal length and no neutral band in the blue-green,
 it is necessary that the colours, to be considered as identical,
 must be included in an absolute psychophysical unit. One of the
 most de<U+FB01>nite signs that persons with a neutral band in the blue
 green have a more defective colour-perception than the ordinary
 Z-un'it, is that they will put together as identical a red and green
 which are distinguished by the ordinary 2-unit. In addition to
this, they will mistake the reds and greens which have been
confused by the ordinary 2-unit.
     It will be seen that if we take a 2-unit and ask him to name a
number of red and green wools, in the majority of instances he
 will name them correctly. But as, almost invariably, the same
wools are chosen, for all practical purposes the same result would
be obtained by asking a person to name a few of these wools.
What more decided and brighter greens could we have than
Nos. 76 and 94 of my Pocket Test? yet these are two of the
greens which are called reds by the 2-unit.            We should have
accomplished      as much by asking a colour-blind person to name
Nos. 76 and 94 as if we had asked him to name a large number
of greens.      The colours in a test should, therefore, be those which
the colour-blind are particularly liable to miscall. At the same
time, their nature should be unmistakable to the normal sighted.
     My second principle is that a colour-blind person will name

                   b
352         Report   of the Committee    on Colour- Vision.
colours in accordance with his psychophysical colour-perception,
and thus show distinctly to which class he belongs.
    The third principle is that colours may be changed to colour
blind persons whilst leaving them unaltered to the normal
sighted.
    Fourthly, the phenomena of simultaneous contrast are much
more marked with colour-blind than with normal sighted persons.
Two colours not changed to the normal sighted, on being con
trasted, apparently alter considerably to the colour-blind.
    These tests are described in full in my book on Colour-blindness
and Colour-perception in the International Scienti<U+FB01>c Series.
    Question—HOW would you proceed, supposing you were asked
by a railway company to test 500 men?            What arrangements
would you make, and how long a. time would the examination be
likely to occupy ?——I should examine each separately, taking
care that the others did not look on. I should <U+FB01>rst examine with
the Classi<U+FB01>cation Test, and then put them through the Lantern
Test, taking twenty answers in each case. The process would
only take about <U+FB01>ve minutes for each man, with even one
examiner, because one man could be going on with the classi<U+FB01>ca
tion whilst another was being examined with the lantern.            I
allow ten minutes for each man,because I think that it is a great
mistake to hurry, or be in any doubt about a case.
    Question—At that rate it would require 80 or 90 hours to
examine the 500 men ?—It would mean a considerable expenditure
of time. You want to know if a man can distinguish between
red, green, and white at a distance of two miles.         You might
commit yourself to the Lantern Test alone; but if one man was
 sorting the wools while another was being tested with the lantern,
 it would take little or no longer to employ both tests, and in
 rejecting a man the double test would be conclusive.       I regard
both tests as desirable, and the Lantern Test as essential, for
that would detect sootoma, whereas the Classi<U+FB01>cation Test would
not.
     Question—You said you tried a progressive atrophy case, and
 that he was a 2-unit man, and his junction at about the E line ?—
 I cannot say without referring to my note-book, but he saw one
 part of the spectrum as whitish and the other blue, only seeing
 those two colours.                                  I
                         [Capt Abney said :-—When tried him the
 junction of the white was at )t 4-733, between F and G, and
 nearer to F, there being a sudden commencement of blue at this
 point.   At 26-5 of my scale he saw a little blue, and at 26-75 no
 colour._
     The essential part of my theory is that psychophysical percep
 tion is due to the brain and not to the retina.        The theory   I
  have formed is that the visual purple is liberated from the rods
  by light, and forms a photograph at the back of the retina, and
  that the cones only act as transferring organs of the percipient
  <U+FB01>bres, transferring the impression      of the photograph to the
  brain.

             Report of the Committee on Colour- Vision.            353
     Question—Is not that something like Kiihne’s theory ?—No; he
 took a different view, the objection to which was that there are
 no rods in the yellow spot; but according to the theory I have
 advanced it would be essential that there should be no rods
  at the yellow spot.
                       Evidence of Capt. ANGOVE.
    The CHAIRMAN.       You are, I believe, the Captain Superintendent
 of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company ?-—
 Yes, the Marine Superintendent.
    You are probably aware that this Committee is investigating
 the question of colour-blindness, and the precautions taken by
 steam-shipping companies and railway companies against accident
 from this cause; we are therefore anxious to hear what is the
 practice of your company with regard to examining of<U+FB01>cers P—
 One of the Managing Directors and myself <U+FB01>rst examine applicants
 with regard to objects at different distances from the windows,
 then the Company’s Medical Adviser examines them with coloured
 wools and for distance sight. They have to arrange and name
 the different colours.   The vision for distance is tested by placing
 the candidate at the regulation distance from ophthalmic large
 test types, and the near vision by corresponding small type.        It
 is required that both eyes should be equal to the average of
 good sight. We <U+FB01>nd, I am sorry to say, a great number who
 are not up to the standard, and often have to reject candidates in
consequence.
    Question—That is the procedure for candidates for the posts
of of<U+FB01>cers ?—-Yes, but there is also a Board of Trade examination
before coming to us which they have to pass in getting their
 certi<U+FB01>cates for various gradespf of<U+FB01>cers.
    Question—Do you take pupils in your Company ?-—N 0, not now;
in former years we had two training ships, but they have been
discontinued, so that every of<U+FB01>cer must now hold the Board of
Trade certi<U+FB01>cate, which includes colour-vision. We often <U+FB01>nd
candidates de<U+FB01>cient, and reject a great number for defective
sight.
    Question—Then that points to the Board of Trade examination
being unsatisfactory P—Yes, I do not think their examination is
sui<U+FB01>cien tly rigid.
    Question—Would you in- your examinations reject candidates
both for colour-vision and form P—Yes; and we give equal
attention to weakness of sight with regard to seeing at long
distances.
    Question—Do     you give rejected candidates a second oppor
tunity P—No, but some go to an oculist’s on their Own account,
and we get a special report from him. The weakness may be only
of a temporary nature.        I attribute a great number of cases
to over-smoking with young men.               We have traced several

354          Report  of  the Committee    on  Colour- Vision.
instances to that cause, and where the smoking has been dis
continued the sight has improved.
     Question—You said,    I think, that in deciding for colours candi
dates have to arrange coloured wools?—Yes,               they have to
 arrange greens, reds, &c. ; they are all mixed up, and the candi
 dates have to pick them out, compare them, and sort those of
 the same colour.     It is really the Holmgren test.
     Question—After a candidate has been passed and admitted
 into the service, are there any tests subsequently applied ?—Not
 unless he is reported by his commander.         We have found some
 men colour-blind after being some years at sea and in possession
 of Board of Trade certi<U+FB01>cates.         There was one instance of an
 of<U+FB01>cer who was found to be quite colour-blind, and was conse
 quently tranferred to a clerkship in the of<U+FB01>ce. He had been
 passed by the Board of Trade, but not by us, as at that time
 we accepted Board of Trade certi<U+FB01>cates, and did not have our
 own examinations for sight. Since we have found these various
 cases, we have realized the necessity of having our own examina
 tion, and have called the notice of the Board of Trade to the fact.
 I   have with me copies of correspondence which passed between
 Mr. Barnes and Sir Thos. Gray pointing out the fact to him that
 we have to reject so many young of<U+FB01>cers for defective sight.
  The Board of Trade admit the test should be more severe.
     QuestionF-Have you never heard of cases in which the failure
  of the eyesight of officers has led to accidents ?—1 cannot say
        I
  that have. The case of the gentleman           I have mentioned who
  was colour-blind was discovered,         I suppose, simply from his
  being on the bridge of the vessel with another commander.          He
  rose to be a chief of<U+FB01>cer before it was discovered.        His weak
  ness might have led to accidents.
     Question—Have you any statistics drawn up with regard to
  these cases ?—Not beyond these . facts that we are rejecting
  young of<U+FB01>cers.    In a letter dated the 9th April, 1889, to Sir T.
  Gray, Mr. Barnes referred to the many painful interviews with
  candidates who have wasted six or seven years learning their
  profession with the expectation of entering our service, and who,
  when the height of their ambition is about to be realised, <U+FB01>nd
  we are compelled to reject them on account of defective vision.
  In one case a young fellow, with a new Board of Trade certi<U+FB01>
  cate, who seemed a desirable man, could not read letters 2 to
   15 inches long 20 yards from the window.        In the last two years
  a considerable   percentage of the candidates passed by us, as in
  other respects satisfactory, have failed in the sight test for
  colour or distance vision; mostly the latter.
      Question—Do you <U+FB01>nd any improvement in the Board of Trade
   examinations since you have written to them upon the subject of
  colour-vision ?—1 think they are getting more particular, from
          I
   what can learn from young of<U+FB01>cers.
      Question—Another      branch of our enquiry is as to what
  precautions are taken as to the vision of seamen ?—We accept

          Report     of     the Committee   072   Colour- Vision.         355
the Board of Trade certi<U+FB01>cate which they have to obtain.     With
out that we do not admit them.     We have no test for Lascars.
Some of our ships are manned by them; but the look-out men
are always Europeans.
    Question—That leads to the question of what are the responsi
bilities of look-out men ?—It is a very important position, as they
have to report everything seen by them to the of<U+FB01>cer in charge
of the bridge; though often he sees objects before the look-out
man, because he is in a higher position.   It would be a bad thing
                                                         ‘
if a look-out man was colour-blind.
    Question—Does    he only have to report “light ahead?”—-Yes,
or on one how or the other; but he usually gives the signal
with a gong, striking once if the light is right ahead, twice if it
is on the port bow, and three times if on the starboard bow.
He would very likely sing out, “green light,” or whatever it
 might be, after striking the gong.
    Question—Do you think the question of colour for the seaman
importantP—Not so important as for the of<U+FB01>cer.
    Question—Supposing    a vessel suddenly emerged from a fog,
and a green light was seen on the port side and a red one some
where else, would it be necessary for the look-out man in that
case to say where the green and red light was ?—Yes, it would
 be of great importance if he could.
    Question—Supposing    you had a foreigner, say a Welshman,
who only knew Welsh, if he sang out the Welsh for red, which
 I believe is very like green, would it not be nearly as bad as if
 he were colour-blind ?—Q,uite.
    Question—And    then take the case of a German seamen, for
 instance ?—-They all understand the colours.   We should not ship
him unless he had suf<U+FB01>cient experience to know port from star
 board and red from green, and was familiar with the English
expressions   for   them.
   Question—If you rejected him he could probably be shipped
somewhere else ; I presume you think the company or vessel
might be at a disadvantage by shipping a man who was colour
ignorant although not colour-blind ?—Yes.
   Question—There     seemed to be some doubt as to whether it
was necessary for the look-out man to have perfect vision for
colour and form P—It is most necessary (especially when in close
proximity to a light, and the vessel perhaps altering her course).
The look-out man should sing out immediately red or green light,
as he may see it before the of<U+FB01>cer on the bridge, should a sail,
for instance, happen to hide it from him.
    Question—Do    you know of any accidents that have been
traced to absence of colour-vision ?—I cannot say we have traced
 one actually to it, but we have had suspicions about       and theyit,
naturally have led to special enquiry.     In addition to the case
I  have mentioned there was another of<U+FB01>cer,      second of<U+FB01>cer, who,
                                                     a
 upon being questioned, was found to have his sight affected.
 In all such cases we insist upon their leaving.

 356        Report of the Committee on 00101er Vision.
    Question—\Vith regard to shipping Lascars, you say they do
 not take look-out duty ?—They are a sort of assistant look-outs;
 they have no responsibility, as that always rests with a European.
 There are generally two on the look-out together, one European
 and one Lascar. As a rule they pick up a certain quantity of
                                                       I
 English, and they have very good eyesight, though do not know
 as to their colour-vision ; they do not go through any examina
 tion.   Between the two, that is to say the European who has
picked up a certain amount of Hindustani, and the Lascar a
 certain amount of English, there is an understanding between
 them.
    Question—D0 you think the precautions taken by the Board
 of Trade with regard to seamen are suf<U+FB01>cient ?—I would
 not say they are stringent enough.      They examine by means of
coloured lights in a narrow passage, and the man has to call the
colours.    The naming of colours I consider to be a right test, as
 well as matching colours, on account of cases of colour-ignorance.
Seamen might not know the names of all colours possibly; but
as long as they name red and green without mistakes, that
would be suf<U+FB01>cient.
    Question—Have     you ever met anybody who called a light a
black light P—No.
    Question—Do you consider that the coaching for the Board
of Trade certi<U+FB01>cate. which is known to be practised, might be
the cause of the comparative ease with which defective colour
vision men get the certi<U+FB01>cate ?-—I do not think the coaching is
su<U+FB02>icient to account for it.
    Question—Does your examination      include coloured lights ?—
No, coloured wools only; the Board of Trade ,use the coloured
lights.
    Question—“Te    may take it that you examine all the o<U+FB02>icers,
and you accept the Board of Trade shilling certi<U+FB01>cate for the
men ?~Yes, we always insist upon that.         All of<U+FB01>cers, from the
<U+FB01>rst to the <U+FB01>fth, go through our tests.
    Question—Have you any suggestions you would like to make
with regard to the tests ?-—I think not, except that the Board of
Trade cannot be too severe with their examinations, and a little
strong pressure might be brought to bear upon them in this
direction.   “Te should be glad to have the examinations made
sufficiently reliable to relieve us of the necessity of doing what
they ought to do.

to the tests used on this Railway for Colour Vision, I have the
pleasure to hand you herewith some small samples of the
different coloured glasses used for signals, and also a couple of
pieces of red and green bunting, which are portions of <U+FB02>ags used
for hand signals by our Guards and Permanent-way men. The
white bunting is made of the same material.

signal colours, and the labels on the glasses enclosed describe
the colours and the uses the glasses are put to.
   “With regard to the tests employed, I may state that the
Company’s Medical Of<U+FB01>cer examines, on their appointment to the
service, the men in the Traf<U+FB01>c Department, and for this purpose
skeins of coloured wools are used, as well as coloured discs.
   “ In the Locomotive Department the Drivers and Firemen <U+FB01>rst
commence as Engine Cleaners, when their eyesight is tested by
the Inspectors, the colours shown being red, green, and white, at
short distances.    On being promoted to Firemen it is again tested
at a distance of about 420 yards with red, green, and white
boards, of about half the size of semaphore signals, and this test
is again repeated when they are promoted to Drivers.                      .

this subject, I beg to state, so far as concerns the practice of this
Company in this matter, in connection with those entering their
service, it is as follows :—Candidates for employment as Porters,
&c., are required to match colours from a collection of coloured
objects or wools of various tints, and the medical man also uses
the tests known as Snellen’s tests.
   “Applicants for employment as Engine Drivers enter the
service as Engine Cleaners, and as a preliminary, a collection of
coloured wools is placed before the candidate, and he is requested
to pick out various colours as directed, and unless he is able to
distinguish the colours readily and correctly, he is not considered
eligible.
   “ In time an Engine Cleaner is promoted to a Fireman, and on
this taking place, the colour test is again applied, supplemented
with tests with hand <U+FB02>ags at various distances.

of 15 feet, and made to count the dots on a test dot card, <U+FB01>rst

read the names of stations which are printed on cards at the
same distance.    If satis<U+FB01>ed with the examination on this point,
I  then test for Colour Blindness by the use of Holmgren’s
coloured wools.      They consist of a collection of small skeins of
coloured Berlin wool, each of which is loosely twisted up. In
this bundle is included wools of red, orange, yellow, yellow
green, pure green, blue-green, blue, violet-purple, pink, brown,
grey, several shades of each colour.             These worsteds being
placed in a pile on the table, I lay aside a skein of a special colour
desired for the examination, I then require the man to select
from the wools other skeins which most closely resemble the
colour of the sample, and to place them by its side. The Colour
Sight is decided by the manner in which he performs his task.
I hold up the different colours to him at a distance of 15 feet.
Test 3 is a con<U+FB01>rmatory test, and specially useful in examining

 the normal eye are darker than scarlet.              The green blind will

    “ DEAR     SIR,—In accordance with your instructions of
July    5th to report on the means employed to test the railway
servants on L.C. & D.R. as to their ability to detect colours, the
following apparatus is in use.
    “ It consists of a hollow tube about 12 inches square and 22 inches
long. At one end of it is a revolving disc having let into it as near
as possible the seven primary colours, great care being taken
that the red, green, and purple are of the same hue as the actual
signals :—
   “ The disc is illuminated at the back, thus giving the colours
much the appearance they have on the signals.
   “This appliance meets with all necessary requirements, and is
a fair test as to the men’s capabilities of detecting colour.
   “On examination they are instructed to look down the tube,
and by means of a handle any one of the colours can be shown
at will, so that no two men coming up need have the same series
of colours.     This is very important, as when a number of candi

dates   come up together, they immediately communicate                to the

   “ The actual cases of Colour Blindness are very scarce, but it
is not at all an unfrequent occurrence to <U+FB01>nd men coming up,
more particularly from the rural districts, quite unable to name
the colours correctly, purely from want of education.            These men
are always rejected.

   “SIR,—We regret we have not been able to reply earlier to
your letter of the 23rd ult., which was duly received, but we are
pleased now to give you the information you desire.
   “Every navigating of<U+FB01>cer who enters our service has his sight
specially tested, and he is not accepted unless he poesesses good
normal vision in both eyes.
   “ The method by which the vision is tested is as follows :—
One of Pickard and Curry’s (of Great Portland Street) large
sheets of test types is enclosed in a frame and hung on the wall
of a room.       The prescribed distance has been measured and
marked, and the candidate is placed with his toes to this line.
First one eye is covered up and he is asked to read all the lines,
beginning with the very large type at the bottom line.                        If
the eye <U+FB01>rst examined proves satisfactory, it is covered up and
the other eye is examined in a similar way. Should the candidate
prove to have good long sight in both eyes, his short sight is
tested by his being asked to read a list of proper names printed
in small type, the sheet on which the names are printed being
gradually brought closer to his eyes until the words cease to be
distinct. This distance is noted, and if shown to be the normal
distance, his sight is considered good.        WVe attach importance to
good short sight as well as good long sight on account of the
necessity of reading, marking on charts, &c.
   “The candidate having shown himself to possess good long
and good short sight, is tested as to colour-sight by being asked
to name the colours of an assortment of the usual coloured wools,
obtained for the purpose from Pickard and Curry.
   “Preliminary to this examination, the candidate’s power of long
sight is usually roughly tested by his being asked to read letters
on sign-boards, &c. at various distances in the street, but it is on
the accurate tests above described, which are never omitted, that
we place reliance, and on 'the results which they give we base
our decision regarding the acceptance of the candidate so far as
his vision is concerned.      All seamen have to produce Board of
Trade Colour Certi<U+FB01>cates before being shipped by this Company’s
vessels.                  “ WVe are, dear Sir,          -

                       Statistics  of Colour-blindness.
   The following schools and institutions were examined by the
Committee of the Ophthalmological Society of London :—
Westminster School.                      Jews’ School, Greek Street,
Eton.                                       Soho.

City of London School.                   Various Schools in Dublin.
Jews’ School, Bell Lane.
   It will be observed that some of the foregoing institutions
would supply subjects derived from special classes of persons,
such as Jews and deaf-mutes; while others would be fairly
representative of the whole community.             The examinations were
conducted        by Holmgren’s method, supplemented,             in some
instances, by the use of coloured            lights, and the examiners,
sixteen in number,        were all of them surgeons          engaged in
ophthalmic practice.       The Committee introduced their Report by
the following prefatory observations :—
   “Your Committee becomes more and more convinced that a
competent examiner is not made in a day, or even in a month,
and that, even with large experience, much judgment and
capacity are needful to interpret rightly the acts of the examined.
This necessity is perhaps most strongly exhibited in the case of
intelligent persons who are incompletely colour-blind.               Such
persons, though they may have a much feebler appreciation of
the difference      between red and green, for example, than is
normal, may, after accurate observation and comparison, separate
the red skeins of wool from the green.            When tested, however,
at various distances with coloured lights, their defects              are
strikingly apparent, and it becomes clear that they are totally
un<U+FB01>tted     for responsible posts in which rapid appreciation of
colour at a distance is required.
   “ Colour-blindness is here taken as
                                              implying a defective recog
nition of the difference between colours.          No account is taken of

             Report of the Committee     on  Colour-Vision.         369
incapacity to distinguish between different shades of one colour,
 or even of an inability to distinguish between such colours as
blue and violet or blue and green, when these are the sole defects.
 It is perfectly and clearly distinguished from a defective naming
 of colours, and from de<U+FB01>cient acuteness of vision.”
    The actual results of examination are stated as follows :—
    “ The total number of persons examined was 18,088, of whom
 16,431 were males and 1,657 females.
    "'
       The examination of certain classes of persons was undertaken
in the expectation of some peculiarities, which the result amply
justi<U+FB01>ed.
    “
       Deducting these, we have 14,846 males, of whom 617 were
colour-blind, giving an average percentage of 4'16.            Making
similar deductions in the case of the females, we have 489
persons, with 0-4 per cent.      And even this small percentage is
entirely made up of persons with very slight individual defects.
    “Taking the exceptional groups of females, we <U+FB01>nd those of
Jewish extraction, the members of the Society of Friends, and
the inmates of deaf and dumb asylums, to be more defective
as regards colour than the average.       Thus, among the <U+FB01>rst (730)
examined as high a percentage as 3-1 was touched, though the
cases were almost entirely of slight character.            Among the
members of the second group who happened to be the subjects
of examination (216 in all) the percentage was even somewhat
higher (5'5), though the cases were clearly even slighter still.
Among the deaf and dumb females (122 examined) there was a
somewhat high percentage (2‘4) of slight cases.
    “Colour defects exceeded the average in the male members
also of the same classes.       It is possible to draw more exact
comparisons between the normal and colour-blind males than of
females, because the former show much more pronounced cases.
Thus, the slight individual differences of examiners will cease to
 be a source of error for males, for no examiners, however low
the standard they exact, could omit to detect and record as
colour-blind those persons who matched red, or the full shades
of brown or grey, with green.
        “
          Enumerating in this manner, we have—
        “Among males generally (14,846 examined) 3'5 per cent. of
            pronounced cases.
        “
          Among male Jews (949 examined) 4'9 ditto, ditto.
        “
          Among male Friends (491 examined) 5'9 ditto, ditto.
        “ Among male deaf and dumb 145
                                      (     examined) 13-7 ditto, ditto.
    “It    must be noted, however, that the Jews were, on the
average, in a poorer condition of life than any other class
examined.       The deaf-mutes were mostly poor.          The Friends
were mostly of the middle class; their mistakes were chie<U+FB02>y
con<U+FB01>ned to the paler shades, and were therefore, in general,
slight in degree, especially as compared with the Jews, whose
defects, though less numerically, were usually well pronounced
in character.      The wealthier Friends are much less liable to
                                                        I

370        Report of   the Committee     on Colour- Vision.
colour-defects than their poor ; but even among them the males
exceed the average.
   “There are naturally dif<U+FB01>culties attending the examination of
the deaf-mutes.     But after repeated examinations had made the
process perfectly clear to them, it was apparent, from the nature
of their mistakes, that there was among them a very high
average of colour-defects.      Those examined inhabit schools in
London, and naturally live in a condition of considerable isolation
from the surrounding world.
   “It  is worthy of note that, when in any class of persons
colour-defects exceed the average in number and intensity,
there is often an unduly high proportion of red-blind as com
pared with green-blind.      This is especially marked among the
Jews, for among them the pronounced cases of red-blindness
were 3'6 per cent. of the whole number examined, against
1'3 per cent. of green-blindness; whereas among males generally
the red-blind were 2 per cent., and the green-blind 1'5 per cent.
   “A large number of male children (2,859) were examined in
Dublin by Mr. Swanzy. Their average is somewhat higher than
that found in England, being 4-2 per cent. of pronounced cases.
But as the examinations were necessarily made by different
hands, and as the boys examined in Dublin were, on the average,
of poorer class than those furnishing the corresponding statistics
in this country, we must be cautious in inferring a greater average
percentage of colour-defects in Ireland than in England.
   “ Interesting results are derived from a comparison of the
percentages in the different groups examined, especially with
regard to their different positions in the social scale, by which is
implied presumably a corresponding difference in education.
   “ Thus, in
               England, among the police (4,932 examined), and in
schools of about the same social rank (1,729 examined), the
pronounced cases form 3'7 per cent.        In middle-class schools the
same form 3-5 per cent.      In the professional class, as represented
by medical students and sons of medical men (435 examined), the
same form 2'5 per cent.      Among the boys at Eton the same form
246 per cent.
   “ And even more
                      striking instances are recorded in Ireland, by
Swanzy, who <U+FB01>nds the percentage among the sons of artisans
and labourers (2,486 examined), to be nearly twice as great as
among the sons of the professional and wealthier classes.
   “Nor can any observer fail to be struck by the much greater
certainty and rapidity with which the children of the upper
classes pick out the various shades of the same colour.        And the
momentary confusion of blue and green, which is not uncommon
among the poorer classes, independently of any defect of colour
vision, is very rarely seen among the others.”

            “EXAMINATION        BY DAYLIGHT (CARDS).
“ In conducting the examination by daylight the examiner
      should do it in three ways :      -
   “1. The cards should be mixed up. The examiner should
        then hold up each card separately, and ask the candidate
        to name the colour; and if the candidate does so without
        hesitation, he is to be regarded as having passed the
        daylight test.
   “ 2. If the candidate hesitates in any of his answers so as to
        raise a doubt in the mind of the examiner as to his ability
        to readily distinguish colours, the examiner should put
        all the cards on the table and require the candidate to
        select all cards of a colour or colours named by the
      examiner.
  “3. Having   done that, they should all be mixed up again,
      and the candidate should be required to sort the cards
      into eight heaps, putting all of one colour into each heap.
  “4. The result of the examination should be noted and
      recorded in each case.
            “EXAMINATION BY ARTIFICIAL           LIGHT.
“ The room should be dark.
“The lamp lighted and placed in the lanthorn.
“The applicant should be seated or should stand so as to be
    opposite to the opening of the lanthorn; and, at least, 15
    feet from the front of the lanthorn.
“ He should <U+FB01>rst of all see the light in the lanthorn without the
    interposition of any glass, and be asked if it appears to
    him to have any colour, and if so what colour?
“The slide with the ground glass should then be put into the
    opening at the front of the lanthorn which is nearest to
    the light, and the applicant asked the same question.
“ The slide with the ground glass is to be left in, and the slides
    with the coloured glasses placed one by one, and separately,
    in front of   it,
                   and the candidate asked in each case to name
     the colour or tint.
“The result Of the examination should of course be noted and
     recorded in each case.

         red or bright green; or the plain ground glass any colour,
         the case should be reported for record.         In short, if the
          candidate’s perception or impression of these tints does not
         agree with the perception of the examiner, the case should
         be reported on the Form Exn. 173.
    ‘The only reasons for which a candidate is to be reported as
         having failed are inability to distinguish red from green,
         or either from black, by daylight; and red from green, or
         either from the ground glass, by arti<U+FB01>cial light.
   u     a candidate fails in the colour test when the ground glass
         is in the lanthorn (as it is always to be when the coloured
         glasses are shown), he may also be tried over again with
         the coloured glasses without the intervention of the
         ground glass, and the result noted and recorded.”
   The regulations under which candidates             are admitted for
examination are detailed in another circular (a slightly altered
revision of that previously in force) issued in January, 1886.          It
runs as follows :—

         examination for a master’s or mate’s certi<U+FB01>cate must be
         made on Form Exn. 2. Such examination will commence
         with the colour test ; and if the candidate does not at the
         time of making application hold a certi<U+FB01>cate of competency
         at any grade, and should fail to distinguish correctly any
         one of the colours used in the test, he will not be allowed
         to proceed with the examination in navigation and sea
         manship.

      “6.  The fee he has paid for examination      for a certi<U+FB01>cate of
           competency will include the fee for the colour test, and,
           with the exception of 1.9., will in such event be returned
           to him.
      “ 7. A candidate for
                            examination for a certi<U+FB01>cate of competency
           who at the time of making application does not possess a
           certi<U+FB01>cate, and who fails to pass the colour test, may not
           be re-examined until after the lapse of three months from
           the date of his <U+FB01>rst failure. If he fails a second time he
           will be allowed a third trial at the expiration of another
           three months from the date of his second failure. A fresh
           fee must be paid at each succeeding examination.
      “8. It is therefore obviously to the advantage of candidates

           blind, will be made on his inferior certi<U+FB01>cate before it is
           returned to him.
      “ 12. Holders of certi<U+FB01>cates which bear the statement of their
           having failed to pass in colours, and who may desire to
           have the statement removed from their certi<U+FB01>cates, must

            Honmomm’s Marrron        or Tns'rmc ron    COLOUR.
     The method of testing consists in asking the candidate to
  select from variously coloured objects those which appear of the
  same colour as one which the examiner selects.        The most suit
, able objects and at the same time the most readily obtainable
  are skeins of wool, which can be procured of almost every
  desired hue and tone.        Another advantage of skeins of wool,
  besides portability, is that, owing to their want of gloss, they
  appear of approximately the same tone from whichever side they
  are viewed. The colours of the skeins to be selected include reds,
  oranges, yellows, yellowish-greens, pure greens, blue-greens,

blues, violets, purples,    pinks, browns, and greys.          Several
shades of each colour, with at least <U+FB01>ve gradations of each tint,
should be procured, from the deepest to the lightest greens and
greys. Varieties of pinks, blues, and violets, and of light grey,
together with shades of brown, yellow, red, and pink, must be
especially well represented.      The test skeins with which the
examinees are to compare the colours should be three in number: a
light green, a pale purple or pink, and abright red. These three
colours will suf<U+FB01>ce to indicate approximately the amount and
kind of colour-blindness which may exist. The light green skein,
which is a tolerably pure green mixed with a large proportion
of white, is chesen as the colour which closely matches the
spectrum colour which the red- and green-blind distinguish as
white or grey. It is chosen of a pale tint, as it then becomes
puzzling to the colour-blind to distinguish its colour by its
luminosity. A light grey or drab skein will present the same
brightness to him that this pale colour does, and although he
may be trained to distinguish bright colours by their relative
luminosities, in the case of these pale varieties he will be unable
to do so. The light purple or pink is chosen for similar reasons,
and in fact it is nearly a complementary        colour to the green.
The purple is, according to the Young-Helmholtz theory, a mixture
of two fundamental       colours, the blue and the red, and as in
the green-blind it excites both the blue and red sensations it
may be confused with grey, or with a green.        In the red colour
blind it excites in excess the blue sensation mixed with what they
call white. A blue or violet may therefore be matched with it.
    The method of examination is as follows :—
               “ Method      Examination   and Diagnosis.
                         of
    “ The Berlin wools are placed in a heap on a
                                                          large table,
covered by a white cloth, and in broad daylight.        A skein of the
test-colour is taken from the pile, and laid far enough away
from the others not to be confounded with them during the
examination.     The person examined is requested to select other
skeins from the pile most nearly resembling it in colour, and ‘to
 place them by the side of the sample.           At the outset, it is
necessary that he should thoroughly understand that he is required
to search the heap for the skeins which make an impression on
 his chromatic sense, and quite independently of any name he
 may give the colour, similar to that made by the test-skein.
 The examiner should explain that resemblance in every respect
 is not necessary; that there are no two specimens exactly
 alike; that the only question is the resemblance of the colour;
 and that, consequently, he must endeavour to <U+FB01>nd something
 similar in shade, something lighter and darker of the same
 colour, &c. If the person examined cannot succeed in under
 standing this by a verbal explanation, resort must be had to
 action.   The examiner      should himself pick out the skeins,
 thereby showing in a practical manner what is meant by a shade,

and      then restore the whole to the pile, except the sample-skein.
  As it would require too much time to examine every individual
  in this way, it is advisable, when examining large numbers, to
 instruct them all at once, and to ask them to attentively observe
  the examination of those preceding them, so as to become
  more familiar themselves      with the process.        This saves time
  and there is no loss of security, for no one with a defective
  chromatic sense will be able to <U+FB01>nd the correct skeins in the
 pile the more easily from having a moment before seen others
  looking for and arranging them.            He will make the same
 characteristic mistakes; but the normal observer, on the other
 hand, will generally accomplish his task much better and more
 quickly after having seen how it has to be done.
     ‘-
        The coloured plate (see Plate 11) is for the purpose of assisting
 the examiner in the choice of his colours, and to help him to
 decide the character of the colour-blindness from the mistakes
 made.      The colours in the plates are of two characters :—
     “ 1st. The colours                                        is,
                                                              those which
                        for samples (test-colours); that
 the examiner presents to the persons examined; and
     "2nd. The ‘con<U+FB01>tsion colours         that
                                           ;’      to say, those which
                                                      is
 the colour-blind will select as matches with the sample.
    "'
        The <U+FB01>rst are shown on the plate as horizontal bands, and are
 distinguished by Roman numerals         the second as vertical bands,
                                             ;
 under the test-colours, and are distinguished by Arabic <U+FB01>gures.
    “The coloured table       not intended to be used as
                                 is                             test;
                                                                 a            it
                                                                              is
 simply to assist the examiner in his choice of correct test-colours,
 and to help him to diagnose the special form of colour-blindness.
    “ As to the similarity between the confusion-colours of the
 plate, and the wools which the colour-blind take from the
 heap, reliance must be placed simply on the hue, and not on
 their brightness or degree of colour saturation.            In all cases
 where we have to vary from this rule we must hold to the
 relative rather than the absolute saturation.            The confusion
colours shown in the plate are only to illustrate the mistakes
 which the colour-blind will make, and for this purpose they serve
 perfectly. Having made this explanation, we can pass directly
to the test itself. The following are the directions for conduct
ing   it,  and for making    diagnosis from the results :—
                                a                                      ‘
    “TEST I.—The green test-skein             presented.
                                                 is          This  sample
should be the palest shade (the lightest) of very pure green,
which       isneither yellow-green nor
                          a                  blue-green to the normal
                                                 a
eye, but fairly intermediate between the two, or at least not
verging upon yellowish-green.                                                 -'
    “ Rule—The examination must continue until the examinee
has placed near the test-skein all the other skeins of the same
colour, or else, with these or separately, one or more skeins of
the class of confusion colours’ (1-5), or until he has suf<U+FB01>ciently
                 ‘
proved by his manner that he can easily and unerringly dis~.
tinguish the confusion colours, or given unmistakable proof of a
di<U+FB02>iculty in accomplishing it.
                                                                     2c   2

 378             Report    of  the Committee   on   Colour-Vision.
      “ Diagnosis.—An         examinee    who places     with  the test-skein
 ‘ confusion                ’
                   colours    (1—5)—that is to say, <U+FB01>nds that it resembles
  the ‘test-colour’—is colour-blind, whilst it he evinces a manifest
  disposition to do so, though he does not absolutely do so, he
  has a feeble chromatic sense.
       “ Remark—“’6 might have taken more than <U+FB01>ve colours for
  ‘ confusion; ’ but we must remember
                                                that we are not taking into
   consideration every kind of defective colour-sense, but only those
   which are important in connection with railways.
       “As to No. 1, which represents a grey, we would remark
   that too much stress must not be laid on its luminosity, or
   on any slight difference in its hue from the grey skeins which
   the examinee puts with the sample.
       “ If it is only required to determine whether a person is colour
   blind or not, 1 0 further test is necessary, but if we want to know
   the kind and degree of his colour-blindness, then we must proceed
   with the next test.
       “Tnsr II.—A purple skein is shown to the examinee. The
   colour should be midway between the lightest and darkest. It
   will only approach that given in         II of Plate II, as the colour of
   the wool is much more brilliant and saturated, and bluer.
       “ Rule—The trial must be continued until the examinee has
   placed all or the greater part of the skeins of the same shade
   near the sample, or else, simultaneously or separately, one or more
   skeins of ‘ the confusion-colours
                                             ’
                                               (6—9).    If he confuses the
   colours he will select either the light or deep shades of blue and
   violet, especially the deep (6 and 7 ), or the light or deep shades
   of one kind of green or grey inclining to blue (8 and 5)).
       “ Diagnosis.—-1. A person who is proved colour-blind by the
   <U+FB01>rst test, and who, in the second test, selects only purple skeins,
    is incompletely colour-blind.
        “ 2. If, in the second test, he selects with the
                                                              purples blue and
    violet, or one of them, he is completely red-blind.
        “ 3. If, in the second
                                   test, he selects with purple only green
    and grey, or one of them, he is completely green blind.
        “Remark—The red-blind never selects the colours taken by
    the green-blind, and vice versd.        The green-blind will often place
     a violet or blue skein by the side of the green, but it will then
     only be the brightest shades of these colours.             This does not
     a<U+FB01>ect the diagnosis.
        “The fact that, in this test, many green-blind select, besides
     grey and green or one of these colours, also bright blue, has led
     to misunderstanding. Some have concluded from this that red and
~
     green blindness may exist together in the same individual; others
     have thought that these two kinds of colour-blindness are not
 '
     readily distinguished by this method.          The <U+FB01>rst conclusion is not
     correct.     The two kinds of colour-blindness have great similarity,
     but differ in innumerable slight variations.             They are to be
     considered as two sharply de<U+FB01>ned classes.
         “ The second conclusion can
                                           only arise from not understanding

              Report of   the  Committee    on Colour- Vision.          379
 and    not using the method correctly. The especial purpose of
  this method must be kept constantly in view, viz., to <U+FB01>nd
  the characteristics of the defects in colour-perception of those
 examined.        The characteristic of green-blindness is the confusion
  of purple with grey or green, or both.        This confusion is the point
  to be determined ; everything else may be neglected.         A complete
  colour-blind, who confuses purple with grey or green (bluish
  green), or with both, is green-blind, do what else he may. This is the
  rule, and the careful and observant examiner who understands
  the application of the test, will at once distinguish it. It is,
  indeed, often possible, in marked cases of incomplete colour
  blindness, to decide to which class it belongs to by the way
  the examined acts with his hands.        \Ve do not mean by this that
 the diagnosis is always very easy.         Practice and knowledge are
 necessary.       As there is a long series of degrees of incomplete
 colour-blindness between normal vision on the one hand, and
 complete colour-blindness on the other, there must naturally be
 a. border line where       di<U+FB01>erences of the two kinds of colour
 blindness cease to be recognised.
     “The examination may end with this test, and the diagnosis
 be considered as perfectly settled.         It is not even. necessary,
practically, to decide whether the colour-blindness is red or
 green. But to more thoroughly convince railway employés and
 others, who are not specialists, of the reality of the colour-blind
 ness, the examination may be completed by one more test.              It is
 'not necessary to the diagnosis, and only serves as a con<U+FB01>rmation.
     “ TEST III.—The red skein is presented to the examinee.          It is
necessary to have a vivid red colour, like the red <U+FB02>ag used as
 signals on railways.        The colour should be that of 11b of the
plate, rather towards yellowish-red.
     “ Rule—This test, which is applied only to those
                                                               completely
colour-blind, should be continued until the persomexamined has
placed beside the test skein all the skeins belonging to this hue
or the greater part, or else one or more ‘confusion colours’
(IO-13).       The red-blind chooses, besides the red, green and
shades of brown, which (IO-ll), to the normal sense, seem
darker than red. 0n the other hand, the green-blind selects
shades of these colours, which appear lighter than red (12—13).
     “ Remark—Every case of comparatiVeI y complete colour-blind
ness does not always make the precise mistakes we have just
mentioned.        These exceptions are either instances of persons
who are not quite completely colour-blind, or of completely colour
blind persons who have been practised in the colours of signals,
and who endeavour not to be discovered.           They usually confound
at least green and brown ; but even this does not always happen.
     “Mono-chromatic       Vision—The absence of all except one
colour sensation, will be recognised by the confusion of every
hue having the same intensity of light.
     “ Violet-blindness will be recognised by a genuine confusion of
purple, red, and orange in the second test. The diagnosis should

380          Report     of  the Committee on Coiour~ Vision.
be made with discrimination.             The <U+FB01>rst test often shows blue to
be a ‘confusion colour.’ This may, in certain cases, be the
sign of violet-blindness but not always.              We have not thought
it advisable to recognise defects of this kind; and only the
marked cases, that other tests establish as violet colour-blind
ness, should be reckoned in the statistics."
    Dr. Joy Jeffries, in his book on colour-blindness, gives a
translation of Holmgren’s special directions for conducting the
examinations :—
              “Special     Dz'reclz'ons for  Conducting the Test.
    “The   method, as we have said, plays an important part in an
examination of this kind, not only trom the principles upon which
it rests, but also from the manner in which it is used. The best
plan for directing how to proceed is by oral instructions and
de risu ; but here we are obliged to accomplish this by description.
Now, this is always defective in some respects, especially if we
wish to be brief. What has been said Would evidently su<U+FB02>ite
for an intelligent and experienced physician; but it may not he
super<U+FB02>uous to enter still further into detail to provide against
any possible dif<U+FB01>culties and loss of time. The object of tie
examination      is to discover the nature of a person’s chromatc
sense.     Now, as the fate of the one to be examined and that           if
others depend upon the correctness of the judgment pronounced
by the examiner, and that this judgment should be based uprn
the manner in whirh the one examined stands the trial, it is of
 importance that this trial should be truly what it ought to be,—
a trial of the nature of the chromatic sense, and nothing else,”
 an end that will be gained if our directions are strictly followed.
 It is not only necessary thatthe examiner should carefully observe
 them—which does not seem to us di<U+FB01>icult—but that he also should
 take care that the individual examined does thoroughly what is
 required of him. This is not always as easy as one might
 suppose.     If it were only required to examine intelligent people,
 familiar with practical occupations and especially with colours,
 and with no other interest connected with the issue of the
 examination than to know whether they are colour-blind or not,
  the examination would be uniform and mechanical;                but it is
  required to examine people of various degrees of culture. all of
  whom, besides, have a personal interest in the issue of the
  examination.      Different people act very differently during the
  examination     for many reasons.         Some submit to it without the
  least suspicion of their defect; others are convinced that they
  possess a normal sense.         A few only have a consciousness, or at
  least some suspicion, of their defect.          These last can often be
 recognised before'examination.               They will keep behind the
  others, and attentively follow the progress of the trial; and.I if
  allowed. will willingly remain to the last. Some are quick; others,
  slow.    The former approach unconcemedly and boldly; the
  latter, with over-anxiety and a certain dread. Some have been

          Report   of   the   Committee     on Colour- Vision.             381
perhaps already tested, and practised themselves in preparation
for the trial; others have never been familiar with colours.
Among those already tested some may be colour-blind. Some
of these latter are uncertain about their mistakes, and act with
great care; whilst others again, having been practised in dis
tinguishing signals, conclude that their colour-sense is perfect.
They make the trial quickly and without thought; of course
regularly making the mistakes characteristic of their special
form of colour-blindness.
   “ The majority, however, desire to perform their task as well
as possible; that    is,  to do what the normal-eyed does. This
of course assists in testing them. provided       does not lead to too
                                                 it
great care, as then the testing the colour-blind        more dif<U+FB01>cult;
                                                       is
the trouble being that much time           thus wasted.
                                           is              Only   avery
 small part haVe a contrary desire; namely, to pass for colour
blind, though normal-eyed.         We will speak of these later, and
now only concern ourselves with those who stand the test in
good faith with the desire to appear normal, though perhaps
they are colour-blind.
   "The trial generally goes on rapidly and regularly. We will
only mention those hindrances and peculiarities which most
frequently occur.     The examiner must watch that no mistake               is
 made from not understanding.         The names of the colour need
 never be used, except to ascertain        the name learned hides the
                                           if
subjective colour-sensation,     or to <U+FB01>nd the relation between the
name the colour-blind employs and his colour-perception.
   “The person examined who thinks more of names than the
test itself (this being generally     asign of school-learning) selects
not only the wools ot' the same shades—that              is,
                                                          those of the
same colour to his eye—but all which generally have the name
of this colour: for instance. in the <U+FB01>rst test           not only the
                                                        I,
green like the sample, but all that are green; and with the
second test, not only the purple (and what are generally called
red), but all which look reddish, scarlet, cinnabar, or sealing-wax
red.    Thisis  of no importance; for those who only do this have
scarcely such defective chromatic sense as that with which we
are concerned.     Heis   either normal-eyed or violet-blind. Simply
asa   test of violet-blindness in the interest of science, we can go
on with the examination, and ascertain how far the grouping of
the two colours was due to      a confusion of names or to defective
colour-perception. Otherwise this examination does not concern
the practical point we aim at.
   “ Under any circumstance      it    better to correct the mistakes
                                      is
just mentioned, when arising from misunderstanding. and           even
                                                                  is
                                                                 it
necessary, in reference'to the mistakes we explained might Occur
with the <U+FB01>rst test.     It might be said that was suf<U+FB01>cient
                                                  it                the
                                                                      if
examined confounded the test-colour with green only; that                   it
was indifferent whether he distinguishes carefully between the
 various kinds of green.      But. in fact, this  not so unimportant.
                                                  is
We must give full weight as to whether the infraction of the

382          Report   of  the Committee    on Colour- Vision.
rules arises from misunderstanding,          or lack of practice with
colours, or, <U+FB01>nally, from a true chromatic defect.                To in
clude all that is green would render the test tedious and
impractical.     In fact, no little judgment has been exercised in
the selection of the very lightest shade of the green proposed as
a test-colour;      for it is exactly what the colour-blind m0st
readily confounds with the colours (1—5) of the plate. If the ex
aminee were allowed to depart from the narrow limits established
by the trial, it would include every shade of green; the resultv
of which would be that he would prefer to select all the vivid
shades, and thus avoid the dangerous ground where his defect
would certainly be discovered.        This is why it is necessary to
oblige him to keep within certain limits, con<U+FB01>ning him to pure
green specimens, and, for greater security, to recommend him
to select especially the lightest shades; for, if he keeps to the
darker shades, as many try to do, be readily passes to other tones,
and loses himself on foreign ground, to the great loss of time
and of certainty of the test.       What we have just said of green
applies also, of course, to purple.
   “The principle of our method is to force the examinee to
reveal, by an act of his own, the nature of his chromatic sense.
Now, as this act must be kept within certain limits, it is evident
that the examiner must direct him to some extent.               This may
present, in certain cases, some di<U+FB01>iculty, as he will not always be
guided, and does either too much or too little.         In both cases the
examiner should use his in<U+FB02>uence, in order to save time and gain
certainty; and this is usually very easily done. This intervention
is of course intended to put the examinee in the true path, and is
accomplished in many ways, according to the case in point.
   “ We will here mention some of the
                                             expedients we have found
useful   :
    “
       (A)  Interfering  when the Examined    select 100 many Colours.
   “  It is not always easy to con<U+FB01>ne the one examined within the
limits of the method.       He easily slips amongst the sorted colours
for the <U+FB01>rst test, for example, a yellow-green or blue-green skein
among the others, and. as soon as there is one, others follow
usually; and it thus happens that in a few moments he has a
whole handful of yellow-green, a second of blue-green, a third of
b0th these shades at the same time.          Our procedure has assisted
us in more than one case of this kind.
   “
      (a) When the person examined has begun to select shades of
one or several other colours than those of the sample, his ardour
is arrested by taking from him the handful of skeins he has
collected, and asking him Whether his eye does not tell him
there are one or several which do not match the others, in
which case he is solicited to restore them to the pile. He then
generally remarks that there is some obscuration, and proceeds
in one of the following manners :—
   “ 1. He rejects, one after the other, the foreign
                                                               shades, so

 that the correct remain, which is often only the sample-skein.
 He is shown what mistake he has made. Names are used to
 remind him that one class of green may be yellow-green; and
another, blue-green; and, to induce him to avoid them, he is
 advised only to select skeins of the same shade as the specimen,
although they be lighter or darker, and have neither more yellow
nor blue than that.         If his <U+FB01>rst error arose only from a miscon
ception    or want of practice in handling colours, he begins
generally to understand what he has to do, and to do properly
 what is required of him.
    “ 2. Or else he selects and rejects immediately the skein of
the sample itself.         This proves that he sees the difference of
 colour.    He is then shown the skein as the only correct one, and
 asked to repeat the trial in a more correct manner.          He is again
put on the right track as just before; and the trial proceeds
rightly, unless the error arose from a defect in the chromatic
sense.     Many seem, however, to experience a natural dif<U+FB01>culty
in distinguishing between yellow-green and blue—green, or the
dull shades of green and blue. This dif<U+FB01>culty is, however, more
apparent than real, and is corrected usually by direct comparison.
If the method requiring the name of the colour to be given is
used. a number of mistakes may be the result. If a skein of
light green and light blue alone are presented to him, asking
him to name them, he will often call blue green, and green blue.
But  if, in the <U+FB01>rst case, blue skein
                                  a              is
                                             immediately shown him, he
corrects his mistake by saying ‘this             blue,’ and ‘that green.’
                                                      is
In the last case          happens so mutatis mutandis.
                           it                              This is not the
place for an explanation.         It must suffice to say that the error
is corrected by        direct comparison between the two colours.
                       a
   “There        is,
                   according to the theory, one class of the colour
blind—violet-blind—who, in consequence of the nature of their
chromatic sense, and, therefore, notwithstanding the comparison,
cannot distinguish blue and green.         But our method has nothing
to do with this class of the colour-blind, because such are not
dangerous on railways.
   “(6) Another Process—Iftlw one examined place by the side
of the sample        shade, for instance, of yellow green, the examiner
                       a
places near this another shade, in which there            more yellow, or
                                                                 is
even a    pure yellow, remarking, at the same time, that,              the if
<U+FB01>rst suit, the last must also. The other usually dissents from
this. He        isthen shown, by selecting and classing the inter
mediate shades, that there             isgradation, which will diverge
                                            a
widely     if logically carried out as he has begun.            The same
course     isfollowed with colours of the blue shades,          the blue
                                                                      if
green were <U+FB01>rst selected.          He sees the successive gradations,
and goes through with this test perfectly            his chromatic sense
                                                           if
is correct.
   “To ascertain further whether he notices these additions, or
the tints of yellow and blue in the green, we can ourselves take
the yellow-green and blue-green to ask him     he <U+FB01>nds this to be
                                                            if

384         Report   of the Committee   on Colour- Vision.
so.   We can judge by his answer of his sense with regard to
these shades, and the object of this investigation is accomplished.
   “ It results from all this that many who are <U+FB01>nally considered
to have a normal         chromatic sense may occasionally cause
embarrassment.       In the main, the normal observer of this
kind causes greater loss of time than the colour-blind.            It is
astonishing to see with what rapidity the colour-blind betray
their defect. At least it is found, in the majmity of the cases
examined by us, that the <U+FB01>rst skein of wool selected from the
pile by the colour-blind in the <U+FB01>rst test was one of the ‘ colours
of confusion.’
      “
        (B) Interfering when the Examined select too few l'l'ools.
   “ Those who evince too great slowness also
                                                  require the inter
ferences of the. examiner in another manner.      We can lay aside
here those cases in which, at the sight of the complex colours of the
heap of wool, the examined <U+FB01>nds it dif<U+FB01>cult to select a skeiu
resembling the sample in a collection where all the particular
colours seem to differ from each other, and in consequence declares
immediately that he can <U+FB01>nd none resembling the specimen.             It
is replied that an absolute resemblance is not demanded, and
that no one asks impossibilities; that time is limited, many are
waiting, &c. But there are people who--from natural SlOWllQSr,
from being unaccustomed to such business, from fear of making
mistakes, especially if they have been previously examined and
been suspected of colour-blindness, or from many other motives—
proceed with the greatest caution.       They do not even wish to
touch the wool; or they search, select, and replace with the
greatest care all the possible skeins without <U+FB01>nding one 001
responding with the sample, or that they wish to place beside it.
Here, then, are two cases: on one hand, too much action with
the <U+FB01>ngers, without result; on the other, too little effort.        The
examiner is forced to interfere in both cases.
   “
     (a) At the time of a too great manual action, without
(corresponding practical    result, the examiner must be careful
that the eye and hand act simultaneously for the accomplishment
of the desired end.
   “ Some
            people forget that the hands should be subservient to
the eye in this trial, and not act independently.     Thus they are
often seen to <U+FB01>x their eyes on one side while their hands are
engaged on the other.       This should be corrected, so as to save
time and avoid further labour.       When, from the manual activity
of the one examined, or by the unobserved aid of the examiner.
all the correct skeins, or only a portion, are found in the pile, it
is wise to stop, and invite the former to cross his hands behind
his back, to step back a pace, and quietly consider all the skeins,
and, as soon as his eye has met one of those for which he is
looking, to extend his hand and take it.        The best plan is to
advise him to look <U+FB01>rst at the sample. and then at the pile, and
to repeat this manoeuvre until his eyes <U+FB01>nd what he is looking
for.                               -

             lieport of     the  Committee   on, Colour- Vision.        335
     “ This
              stratagem generally succeeds when nervousness from
  over-anxiety causes his hands to tremble; but it is not always
  easy to induce him to keep his hands behind his back until the
  moment for taking the skein in question.
     “(6) In cases of great caution, the trial is hastened, if the
  examiner come to the assistance of the other, by holding above
  the pile one skein after the other. and requesting him to say
  whether it resembles the colour of the sample or not. It will be
  advisable <U+FB01>rst to select the skeins that a colour-blind person
  would approve.       If he is so, he will approve of the selection, and
  the question is settled; if not, he rejects them, not without a
  characteristic   smile, or with an expression of wounded dignity.
  This also enlightens us as to his chromatic sense. But even the
  colour-blind may, in such a case, refuse what is presented,
  especially if his caution is premeditated, and he suspects that a
, snare is intended.       It is found quite frequently that he rejects
  the correct shades likewise presented with the others.             This is
  not the case when one, having a normal chromatic sense, is slow
  and deliberative when subjected to the test under this form.           He
  has an eye alive to the correct colours.
     “One process, in cases of this last kind, is to select false
  samples, which are placed close to the correct one, by the
  side, above, or below, to attract the attention of the examined
  from the right side. It is necessary so to proceed that the true
  sample be displaced when the others are drawn out, so that the
  person examined may see it move.           It does not, however, always
  happen to catch his eye.         The best means is then to make him
  examine the whole, with his hands behind his back, and invite
  him to freely make his choice.        But, whatever the process, it is
  necessary, in every case where one has been assisted in selecting
  a certain number of skeins which he has found analogous to the
  sample-colour, to make a rule not to conclude the trial without
  examining into the effect of the aid accorded.         It is necessary to
  hold in the hand the approved package, and ask if he is satis<U+FB01>ed,
  or if‘ he would desire any change.        If he approve the choice, the
  diagnosis is established.       The same course must be pursued with
  the defective chromatic sense, that the trial may be made with             -
  or without assistance.        To be thorough, the name given by the
  colour-blind to the colours in question may be likewise asked.
     “In cases where any one suspected of colour-blindness has
  remained some time to see the trial of others, and where, as
  often happens, he has remarked the samples belonging to a
  required green shade, he may of course pro<U+FB01>t by it in his own
  trial. But this can be prevented by furtively concealing one or
  two of these samples.         If he seem to be disposed to confound
  green and grey, it will be very easy to entrap him.             If we do
  not succeed, even when assisting him, in entrapping him in this
  snare. the hidden samples may be put back into their places, to
  be convinced that the trial is correct.
     5‘ From the     above, it is seen that many arti<U+FB01>ces may be

386         Report   of  the Committee   on Colour- Vision.
necessary     in our examination.      It may be regarded as an
advantage of our method that it has at command a great variety
of resources.     We have by no means mentioned all; and yet
many who have only read this description will probably reproach
us with having devoted ourselves too much to details which
seem to them puerile.        But we believe that those who have
examined the chromatic sense of a great number of persons, and
acquired thereby considerable experience, will think differently.
    “ We are convinced that time is saved by such arti<U+FB01>ces, and a
more certain result obtained; whilst a practised surgeon, who
has become to a certain degree a virtuoso, will accomplish his
object quicker and surer by such arti<U+FB01>ces than one who neglects
them.     Recent experience fully con<U+FB01>rms this. All those who
have familiarised themselves      with my method, and have had
experience with colour-blindness,    and of whose competence there
can be no doubt, report, without exception, that it is to be fully
depended on—the most practical and the best.
    “ An
          advantage of the method was shown to be that those
who were to be examined could be present and see each individual
tested, without this interfering in the least with the certainty of
the result.    The individual test is even hastened thereby. The
colour-blind, and even the normal-eyed who are not familiar with
colours, are generally rather shy about being tested, in whatever
way it is done. As the method, however, is carried out, they have
more con<U+FB01>dence.       The majority are even amused. The old adage
holds true here, that it is easier to <U+FB01>nd fault than to do it
yourself. The surgeon, who watches not only the examined,
but. also those around, can often see from their faces how closely
the latter observe the person being tested when he takes out the
 wrong colours, as also when he neglects the right ones under
 his eye.    This gives those looking on con<U+FB01>dence and assurance,
 till their turn comes, when they appear as uncertain as before
 they were con<U+FB01>dent.         There is something attractive in the
process, stimulating the interest, and hence is not without bene<U+FB01>t.
     “From this we see that our judgment of a person’s colour
sense is made, not only by the material result of the examination—
the character of the wools selected—but often also by the way
the examined acts during the test.        We should mention a very
common manner of persons on trial, which, in many cases, is of
great value in diagnosis. Often, in searching for the right colour.
they suddenly seize a skein to lay it with the sample ; but then
notice it does not correspond, and put it back in the heap.       This
is very characteristic; and, if an examiner has often seen it, he
can readily recognise and be assured that it is an expression
of difficulty in distinguishing the differences in the colours. \Ne
frequently see this in the <U+FB01>rst test, with shades of greenish-blue
 and bluish-green.    Here it means nothing important ; but it is quite
 the reverse, however, when it concerns the grey or one of the
 confusion-colours   (1-5). Uncertainty and hesitation as to these
 colours, which the colour-blind do not distinguish from the test

              Report   of   the Committee        on Colour-Vision.          337
colour, even when directly comparing them, is positive proof of
mistake, implying defective chromatic vision of the complete
colour-blind type. No doubt the form of chromatic defect which
we have called incomplete colour-blindness exists in several kinds
and degrees.     This is not the place to further discuss our
experience on this point; and, for the practical purpose we have
in view, it is not necessary.  As we have explained, there are,
among this class, forms gradually approaching normal colour
sense.   How they are distinguished has been described.        We
designated them as possessing feeble colour-sense.
   “ It is, perhaps, not easy to detect this special form by any
other method, or even by our own; we therefore give the
following as means of so doing. The only way of getting at
                a                                                            it
is by determining at what distance the examined can distinguish
a small coloured surface.     We have to do, in fact, with feeble       a
colour-sense, which does not prevent the colours from being dis
tinguished, but only renders      dif<U+FB01>cult. We may suppose, in com
                                        it
parison to the normal- that the feeble colour-sense       due either to
                                                               is
a weaker response to the stimulation of the colour-perceptive
organs of the retina, or else to          stimulation of
                                             a               relatively
                                                                    a
smaller number of these organs. In either case this method would
give us the same result, judging from our experience in testing
the eccentric portions of the <U+FB01>eld of vision with the perimeter.
    “The method we here speak of shows us also the effect of
habit and practice on the colour-perception, and           worth while
                                                             it
                                                             is
to dwell on this point. It not unfrequently happens that person         a
who by test No.        Ihas been noted ‘incomplete colour-blind.’
after they know of their mistake and have practised themselves
in distinguishing colours, will so comport themselves at         second a
trial that we have to simply mark them as of ‘feehle colour
sense.’    This fact might support Dr. Favre’s idea that defective
chromatic vision may be improved. This possibility, however,
dees not militate against our hypothesis from the theory, as to
the nature of feeble colour-sense.           It does not change our
standpoint in the question.       The same will sometimes happen
with test No. II, and          explainable by what we have said;
                              it   is
namely, that, between the complete lack of chromatic sense and
the incomplete, there          series of gradations, and that in such
                              is   a.
cases practice would affect the result of examinations.
    “ All the examples given prove that many seeming tri<U+FB02>es and
stratagems are of value in making the examination—amongst
others the keeping the sample          little way off from the heap of

examined doubt and uncertainty. We must not, therefore, let

worsteds in the hand at once. We must make the person being
examined place each skein, as he takes              up, either with the

experience shows, that, so long as the question of improving colour
blindness is an open one, we must consider as over the border
the slightest chromatic defect that our method can detect, or the
slightest degree of incomplete colour-blindness; that           feeble              is,

its nature.   These indications include, as we have already said,
the diagnoses complete red-blindness, complete green-blindness,
incomplete      colour-blindness,           or a feeble chromatic sense.
  t‘ Our method adheres strictly to the theory; but, on account
of the transition-forms, the diagnosis cannot always meet the
very exact demands of the theory. If we class with complete
colour-blindness only those cases in which one of the three
elements of the visual apparatus       wholly wanting or com
                                                         is
pletely paralyzed, and with incomplete colour-blindness only
those cases in which none of the three are wholly wanting, but
simply the susceptibility of one is very much reduced, we shall
ham to group many cases of the latter class with the <U+FB01>rst. On
the other hand, we shall often have to consider the lower grades
of incomplete colour-blindness with feeble chromatic sense. We
must, however, recallcases of aperson—especially     he have sub          if
sequently practised     himself—being at the <U+FB01>rst examination
marked as completely colour—blind, whilst on    second time they     a

   390         Report  of the Committee  on Colour- Vision.
  have appeared as only incompletely colour-blind; and others
   where a person was at one time incompletely colour-blind in the
  fullest sense of the word, whilst at another only feeble colour
   sense could be shown.     In such cases the record should state,
  in addition, ‘incomplete colour-blindness,’ approaching complete
  red or green, or incomplete colour-blindness of slight degree, &c.
      “ The same strict rule should be
                                        applied to those already em
  ployed as to those seeking service, and all should be discharged
  who show any lack of colour-perception. This would certainly
  most    fully protect the railroad service from danger. Such a
  general law, however, has its dif<U+FB01>culties, especially as we must
  recognise, in respect to the danger of confounding the signals, a
  great difference between complete colour-blindness and a feeble
  colour-perception. The different cases of incomplete colour
  bliudness vary also in degree. To draw a line here, and say before
  hand who shall be dismissed and, who retained, will be as easy
 in regard to the <U+FB01>rst as dif<U+FB01>cult in reference to the latter;
  for we are convinced that every case of complete colour-blind
 ness of both kinds, as well as every case of incomplete of the
 higher degrees, should be immediately dismissed.            But, as
 regards those who may be retained, it is clear that the <U+FB01>rst
 question concerns those who, at the time of the trial, were
 regarded in the diagnosis only as having a feeble chromatic
 sense, and then those who in the <U+FB01>rst test merely confound grey
 with the sample-colour.      But we do not venture to lay this down
 as a principle; for, if it should be proved that these individuals
 can generally distinguish the light of coloured lanterns with
 su<U+FB01>icient accuracy, this does not prove that it is so in every
 case, and especially not at every distance such as are required in
 the service.    This is why we know nothing better to advise than
 to refer all such cases to competent specialists, as long as the
 transition period of which we have spoken lasts.
     “ It
           may be asked, How will the specialists         themselves
 proceed?      To answer this, however, would require a much more
 extended scienti<U+FB01>c discussion of the various methods than we
 have proposed here to make.       We would only give some hints.
 A specialist who is familiar with this subject has all known
 methods at his disposition; and, if these fail, he need but invent
others.     As, however, I have been in the position of the specialist
in reference to the reform on the railroads of Sweden, I will
here say how I have proceeded.
    “In the examination of doubtful cases submitted to my
judgment, I determined according to several of the methods
mentioned in one of the preceding chapters.        In general, these
persons were all subjected to a trial according to the methods
of Seebeck and Maxwell, and an examination by means of
the visual perimeter and of coloured shadows, as well as the
lanterns of my invention and coloured glasses.     These last means
have capacity especially in View; and they are very suitable for
the object, when it is desired to investigate those who have

been already discovered,    by my method of Berlin \vorsteds, as
having    a defective chromatic sense.
    “The light of coloured lanterns and illuminated surfaces
generally, conveniently arranged and methodically used, may
serve especially in such cases to enlighten us as to the faculty
of the person examined for appreciating coloured signals. Our
experiences of this kind have shown us that the majority of
colour-blind railway employés, however much practice they have
had, are utterly incapable of recognising and distinguishing hed
regulation colours of lanterns, especially when they are employte
in the shades which are not most commonly in use in the service.
This applies not only to the completely red- and green-blind, but
also to the incompletely blind. These last require the most
circumstantial investigation, and it is not to be assumed that the
lower degrees can stand the trial. They may often, it is true,
distinguish the signal-lights at a short distance with suf<U+FB01>cient
 accuracy; but they do not succeed at a comparatively greater
 distance.    As the places Where the trials are usually made do
not command such distances as railways for observing signals,
 signal-lights cannot of course be used for these trials. They are
replaced by small illuminated surfaces, which, seen from a
 suitable distance, produce exactly the same effect as lanterns at
a   great distance.   Such surfaces are made by placing a screen,
with a suitable opening covered with a coloured glass, before
the <U+FB02>ame of a lamp.
    “ We have, however, said
                                enough in reference to means to be
 employed     in such cases.      We had no wish to enter into
 further details, and doubt whether this would on the whole be
 advisable.”

  394       Report   of   the Committee on Colour- Vision.
 In any    examination it is essential that both the examiner and the
   examinee should see the test colours at the same time, or at least
   that the former should by some means know exactly what is
   being shown. For a simultaneous view it is advisable that the
   spectrum should be formed by a source of light at least as
   bright as the lime-light, when it has to be thrown upon some white
   re<U+FB02>ecting surface.     If the apparatus be so made that a patch
   of monochromatic      light from any part of the spectrum can
   be thrown upon some one spot of the white receiving surface
   the examination will become easy, more particularlyif a patch of
   white light can also be thrown separately or together with the
   monochromatic light on the same spot, as this enables any dilution
   of the pure spectrum colour to be effected, and gives a means of
  detecting imposition.      As already pointed out, every decidedly
  colour-blind person secs some one part of the spectrum as—what
  he calls—white.      If the spectrum colours alone were thrown on
  the screen, it is quite possible that the examinee might be taught
  that when a colour which formed the patch appeared white to
  him he ought to call it green or bluish-green, and thus detection
  of the imposture would be di<U+FB01>icult.
     But if the mode of testing be arranged as follows, the dif<U+FB01>culty
  would be overcome :—
     A patch of any coloured light should be thrown on the screen,
  and the candidate asked to indicate if it was white. The colour
  might then be diluted with white, and the question again asked.
 A pure white patch might then be put on the screen ‘and the
  question repeated. The colours should be gradually changed until
 his neutral point was approached. At this place the colour seen as
 white would be mistaken for white, as the changes would be
 made by dilution or by omitting the colour altogether.           This
 test involves no naming of a colour, but only a knowledge of
 white. The discovery of a neutral point would infalliny indicate
 that the candidate was colour-blind.
    Another simple test    'is  to mix three spectrum colours to
 form white, one of the rays being situated near the neutral
 point of the red-green blind.      The white would be the same to
 the colour-blind as to the normal eye, and  it     would still remain
white to the colour-blind whether the colour at the neutral point
were increased or diminished.         No amount of coaching would
enable the examinee to make constantly correct answers.
    By placing a     bull’s-eye of
                                 a    lantern in this patch, and by
arranging that the three colours, the blue-green of the neutral
  oint, a green closer to the red, and  a     red, and also the white
should all have about the same luminosity,        a    further test in
imitation of signal lights could be carried out.
    The question as to the character of the colour-blindness need
not be investigated; but   ifa   patch of light from the extreme red
of the spectrum were thrown on the screen, and diluted slightly
with white light, the green-blind would see     it    coloured red or
yellow, whilst the red-blind would see only the white.

          Report      of   the Committee     on Colour-Vision.     395
   An instrument based on the principle of Clerk-Maxwell’s
colour-box could also be used in much the same way as indicated
above, but in this case the examiner would not see the patch of
light, and could only examine the case after the positions of the
different colours had been accurately determined beforehand.

    All, tests of form-vision depend upon the principle that the
magnitude of the image formed upon the retina, by any object,
depends partly upon the magnitude of the object itself, and
partly upon its distance from the observer; or, in other words,
upon the magnitude of the visual angle which it subteuds, while
the retinal image must itself attain a certain magnitude before
the object from which it is derived can be clearly seen. The
precise character of the test object is not important, and perhaps
the best is furnished by groups of equal circular dots, each one
separated from its neighbours by an interval equal to its own
diameter.     For all practical purposes, however, printed letters are
su<U+FB01>cient, and it is found by experience that capital letters, in
block type, are easily distinguished by the majority of mankind
when they are placed at such a distance that each limb or part of
a letter-'1 is seen under a. visual angle of one minute, and each
letter as a whole under a visual angle of <U+FB01>ve minutes.          Sets of
“ test-types ” were <U+FB01>rst made on this principle by Dr. Snellen, of
Utrecht, and are commonly called by his name. They consist of
lines of letters of different sizes, each size marked by a number,
which corresponds with the number of feet 01‘ metres of distance
at which it will subtend the visual angles mentioned above, and
at which it should therefore be- clearly legible. The acuteness of
vision is expressed by a fraction, of which the numerator is the
distance of the observer from the tests, while the denominator is
the number of the smallest letters which he can read at that
distance.      Thus if at 20 metres he can read N0. 20, he is said to
have gg, or normal vision; but if at 20 feet he can only read
No. 40, or  if,   in order to read No. 20, he <U+FB01>nds        necessary to
                                                          it
approach within 10 feet, he would, in the former case, be said to
have 72%, and in the latter %%, of normal vision, in either his
vision being equal to        %. The test    rapidly applied in practice
                                             is
by hanging up     a   sheet of propelly constructed letters in good
daylight, by placing the person to be tested at              measured
                                                               a
distance from them, and by desiring him to read the smallest he
can.     The letters may be procured from any optician, and, in
testing large numbers of people,              desirable to have some

the examiner may not be deceived by the lines having been
previously learnt by heart by the examinees.

          April    6, 1892.
       The doctrine referred to is that stated     by Maxwell in his paper
   “On the Average Distribution of Energy in           a System of Material
   Points ” (‘ Camb. Phil. Soc. Trans,’ May 6, 1878, republished in vol. 2

       “ In the ultimate state of the
                                       system, the average kinetic energy of
   two given portions of the system must be in the ratio of the number
   of degrees of freedom of those portions.”

between B and the equal bodies A and C on its two sides must

before and after these collisions, to the average kinetic energy of C.

included in the average: the average of the sum of the potential and
kinetic energies of A is equal to the average kinetic energy of C.    But
the potential energy of A at every point in the space HK is positive,
because, according to our supposition, the velocity of A is diminished
during every time of its motion from H towards K, and increased to
the same value again during motion from K to H. Hence, the
average kinetic energy of A is less than the average kinetic energy
of C!
   This is a test-case of a perfectly representative kind for the theory
of temperature, and it effectually disposes of the assumption that the
temperature of a solid or liquid is equal to its average kinetic energy
per atom, which Maxwell pointed out as a consequence of the sup
posed theorem, and which, believed to be thus established, has been

        Received April 2, 1892.
                                . , _ ,   (Abstract)
      This paper is in continuation of one read before the Society in
  May, 1869?“ It contains an account of observations made by other
  investigators on turacin and on the occurrence of copper in animals ;
  a table of the geographical distribution of the Touracas, and a list of
  the twenty-<U+FB01>ve known species; a chart of turacin spectra (for which
  the author is indebted to the kindness of Dr. MacMunn); and a
  further examination of the chemical characters and the composition
  of turacin. The more important positions established by the present
 inquiry are these :—
     1. The constant occurrence in eighteen out of the twenty-<U+FB01>ve known
 species of Masophagtdce of a de<U+FB01>nite organic pigment containing, as
 an essential constituent, about 7 per cent. of copper.
    2. The “turacin-bearers”      comprise all the known species of the
 three genera, Tumcns, Gallirerr, and Musophaga, while from all the
 species of the three remaining genera of the family lilasophagidoe,
 namely, Corytha’ola, Schizo'rht's, and Gymnoschizorhis, turacin is absent.
 Furthermore, the zoological arrangement of the genera constituting
this family is in accord with that founded on the presence of turacin.
    3. The spectrum of turacin in alkaline solution shows, besides the
two dark absorption bands previously <U+FB01>gured, a faint broad band on
either side of line F, and extending from 7t 496 to X475.
   4. The spectrum of isolated turacin in ammoniacal solution shows,
besides the three bands already named, a narrow fourth band, lying
on the less-refrangible side of line D, and extending from R605                   to]

 X589. It probably arises from the presence of traces of the green
 alteration-product of tnracin formed during the preparation of that
 pigment in the isolated condition, an alteration-product            which is
 likely   to prove  identical with  Krukenberg’s turacoverdin.
     5. Turacin in ammoniacal solution remains unchanged after the
 lapse of twenty-three years.
     6. Turacin in the dry state, when suddenly and strongly heated,
 yields a volatile copper-containing red derivative, which, though
 undissolved by weak ammonia-water, is not only soluble in, but may
 be crystallised from, ether.
     7. Turaein in the dry state, when heated in a tube surrounded by
the vapour of boiling mercury, becomes black, gives off no visible
vapour, is rendered insoluble in alkaline liquids, and is so pro

sponding derivative of haematin.            But copper is present in the
derivative of turacin, while iron is absent from its supposed analogue,

    It will   conduee   to clearness  to give some account here of the
objects and      aims  of what is to follow. The part of the paper suc
ceeding this Introduction is in three main divisions : The, groundwork

  1892.]           Mathematical     Theory   of Electra-magnetism.                 401
  of the theory, The establishment of general results, and The detailed ew
  amination of these results.
     The groundwork of the theory, though not the longest of these,
  calls for most attention here. It is divided into two parts—Funda
  mental assumptions and Preliminary dynamical and thermodynamical
  considerations.     I  do not propose to give here are'sume' of the di<U+FB01>erent
  parts, but   to   call attention to certain prominent features.
     The two most important of the fundamental assumptions are,
  perhaps, <U+FB01>rst, that in all cases 476 = VVH, which               I take to be one
  of the most characteristic features, if not the most characteristic, of
  Maxwell’s theory; and, secondly, that the modi<U+FB01>ed Lagrangian
 function per unit volume, though of course it contains H, does not
 contain any term involving magnetic moment per unit volume
 or magnetic induction.            Neither of these assumptions seems to
  be at variance with Maxwell’s, and, as hinted, the <U+FB01>rst is taken
 up mainly because it is a, fundamental feature in his theory.
  From the <U+FB01>rst it follows that C must obey the laws of incom
  pressibility, and this naturally leads to the assumption that D
 also invariably obeys those laws. The second leads to very important
 consequences, which         I believe have not before been traced, and which
 I  wish to call attention to here. Though not put quite in this form
 below, they amount to this, that -Hvl, where l is the modi<U+FB01>ed La
 grangian function per unit volume of the standard position of matter,
 obeys the law of incompressibility, that round every circuit there is
 an electromotive force equal to the rate of decrease of the surface
 integral of 47r<U+FB02>vl through the circuit, and that Hvl—H/Mr appears in
 subsequent equations in such a manner as to compel us to identify it
 with the magnetic moment per unit volume.* It is clear then that
 47rHVl is, according to the present theory, the magnetic induction.
 As the theory is developed below, it is convenient to de<U+FB01>ne B as
 equal to 47rHVl, and call B the magnetic induction, leaving the justi
<U+FB01>cation till we examine the detailed consequences of the theory. It
is well to insist on this result here, as it does not appear obvious in
the work below, but only comes out when a general review of a great
part of the paper is made. To put the matter in the form of a.
proposition      :
    If  the two fundamental assumptions are made (1) that 41rC = VVH
and (2) that l, the Lagrangian function per unit volume, can be expressed
in terms involving H, but independent of magnetic induction and of
magnetic moment per unit volume, then the magnetic induction must be
= 41r<U+FB02>Vl.
   * Strictly   speaking, the last clause should be modi<U+FB01>ed by the condition   “if  the
present position be taken as the standard position.” This, however, is only an
accident of the particular form of enunciation, which at the present stage is
                                                                             '

402                        Mr. Alex. McAulay.            On the                [Apr.  28,
     The other most important features of the fundamental assumptions
are <U+FB01>rst those already described           with reference to the electric co-ordi
nates,     and the  expression    for  the  current in terms of the displacement,
and, secondly, the          manner    in   which   are treated the two currents,
conduction and dielectric (the latter being inappropriately                       on the
                                             “
present theory denominated the displacement current”).                           If there
are (and physicists seem agreed on the point) two independent
currents whose sum appears in the equation 47rC = VVH, and whose
sum obeys the laws of incompressibility, it seems to me of the nature
of a truism that there must be also two independent electric displace
ments, whose sum obeys the laws of incompressibility.                       I, therefore,
from the very beginning recognise two displacements, d and k, which
I    call, for want of better names, the dielectric and conduction dis
placements.*           This naturally leads to the contemplation of two
independent kinds of electro-motive force.                    This last, however, is
 subsequently satisfactorily disposed of.
      Before leaving the fundamental assumptions let me remark that,
 though in some important respects the present theory may seem to
 differ from Maxwell’s, it will be found, I think, that just where the
 difference seems to be most marked, is Maxwell’s theory most vague.
 All the di<U+FB01>erences, if they really be such, have been forced on me
 unwillingly in the attempt to put into de<U+FB01>nite form what take to be         I
 the essence of MaXWell’s theory. At any rate the results, though
 not in every respect identical with Maxwell’s, are yet so nearly
 identical that the true matter for surprise is that they dj<U+FB01>er so
 little and in such unimportant ways from his.
      It must he added, to prevent misconception of my own views, that
  I  by no means consider proven, what I regard as the key to Maxwell’s
~theory, and what        I  have strictly adhered to in this paper, the assump
  tion that under all circumstances 47rC = VVH. My position rather
  is that, while the assumption may or may not be true, it is desirable
  to investigate as generally as possible what must be true, and what
  cannot be true if the assumption is made.                In other words,      I  do not
  think that Maxwell’s theory           has  yet had  a  fair trial, even at the hands
  of mathematicians, and the present paper is an attempt to provide
  more ways and means than hitherto have been available, for such a
  trial.     The methods adopted are equally applicable to other sets of
  fundamental assumptions.
      "‘ Perhaps it would be better to call them the elastic and
                                                                 frictional displacements,
  or the reversible and irreversible displacements.    I  wish to leave this point open for
  those better quali<U+FB01>ed to decide. Of the three sets of terms suggested above, the last
   seems to me the best. The only reason for adopting in the present paper the names
   given in the text is to imply the origin of the assumption that there are two such
   displacements.    Of course, if we call the two displacements reversible and irre
  versible, we must also call the corresponding currents reversible and irreversible.

    Turning to the       second    part of the groundwork, the preliminary
 dynamical    and thermodynamical         considerations,  it is necessary to
 remark that these considerations, though not limited to an electric
  <U+FB01>eld, seemed absolutely necessary in order thoroughly to investigate
 the consequences of the assumptions.            With regard to the <U+FB01>rst two
  sections of this  part   of the  paper on the modi<U+FB01>ed kinetic energy and the
 free energy, and on the entropy, there is nothing which is likely to be
 questioned.     In the third section on frictional forces, conduction of
 heat and dissipatibn of energy,      I enunciate a principle which opens the
 way    for much   criticism.     I would  beg any readers, to whom the form
 of enunciation is repugnant, to suspend their judgment as to the
 validity of the principle not only until the <U+FB01>rst justi<U+FB01>cation of it, but
 until they have seen it in action, as it were, later in the paper. What
 was wanted was to bring this group of phenomena, which are un
 doubtedly closely connected, under the same sort of treatment as is
 accorded to the reversible phenomena of a system by means of its
 Lagrangian function and the (dependent) entropy.
    The way being thus paved, in the_next principal division of the
 paper are deduced the general results of the theory, the most im
 portant of which are the equations of motion. These are considerably
 more general than the ordinary equations of the <U+FB01>eld, and thus we are
led to the last division of the paper, the detailed examination of these
 results.    The chief sub-divisions of this part are the comparison
 with Maxwell’s results, a. discussion from the point of view of the
 present theory of thermo-electric, thermo-magnetic, and the Hall
 e<U+FB01>'ects, and the transference of intrinsic energy through the <U+FB01>eld.
    In comparing with Maxwell’s results, wherever there is agreement
it is considered unnecessary to investigate further the detailed con
sequences. Where there is disagreement the physical consequences
 are traced with more detail, and in no case can it,            I think, be said
that the results of this part of the paper are condemnatory of the
present theory.        In this place, too, the bearing of the present theory
on the question of convection currents is discussed.
    Perhaps a. clearer insight into the true bearings of the present
theory is obtained by the attempt below to explain‘thermo-electric,
thermo-magnetic, and the Hall effects, than by any other part of the
paper.      Especially clearly do some of the restrictions imposed by the
condition 41rG = VvH come out.
    In the last sub-division it will be found that I disagree entirely
with Professor Poynting’s interpretation of his own results, and show
how quite a different, and I think simpler, <U+FB02>ux of energy may be
made to account for the changes of intrinsic energy in diiferent parts
of the <U+FB01>eld. In particular, this interpretation would restore credence
in what Professor Poynting considers he has shown to be a false view,
viz., that among the aspects of a current of electricity it may be

looked upon as something conveying energy along the conductor.
This part of the subject, although deduced from the present theory,is
shown to be true on Professor Poynting’s own premisses.
    It is well here to call attention to what might prove confusing
otherwise. In what follows E, e, F, (I), and some allied symbols stand
for certain external forces. But there are three different meanings
given in di<U+FB01>erent parts of the paper to these symbols.                      They are
originally    de<U+FB01>ned     as  the whole   external    forces of the  different   types.
But in treating of frictional forces, &c.               35 to 42), it is convenient
to regard them as meaning only those parts of the forces which are
due to friction and the like.          Again, from § 50 onwards, it is conve
nient to regard them as meaning only those parts of the forces which
are independent of friction and the like.                  This inconvenience is
incurred to avoid the greater evil of a large additional array of
symbols.
    With this exception<U+FB01>“ and one or two other tri<U+FB02>ing ones, which are
noticed in their places, nowhere has the meaning of a symbol been
changed throughout the paper.
IV. “ Stellar Photometry.” By W. J. DIBDIN, F.I.C., F.C.S., &c.
        Communicated by A. VERNON HARCOURT, F.R.S. Received
        February      23, 1892.
                                      (Abstract)
     Hitherto the determinations of stellar luminosity have been made
 solely with regard to the relative intensity of the stars apart from
 any' reference to a known terrestrial unit.                 The various methods
 which have been employed do not denote actual intensity, and the
 present inquiry was, therefore, undertaken with the view of elucidat
 ing this question, especially with regard to those stars whose colour
has presented a dif<U+FB01>culty.
     As a preliminary, the author prepared a standard series of arti<U+FB01>cial
 stars of various colours and known intensity, in terms of the English
 standard candle.         These range in value from one candle to 0000018
 candle, and when placed at a distance from the teles00pe form a
 standard series for comparison.
     The evaluation of the coloured lights was made by means of the
 author’s modi<U+FB01>ed “star ” disc, by the use of which comparisons of
 various coloured lights can be readily obtained.
    "‘ Since completing the paper  I have discovered a notable exception, which is not
 otherwise noticed than in this foot-note.    It does not seem likely to lead to confu
 sion; therefore  I  retain it. Most frequently in the present paper q stands for the
 typical scala/r coordinate of a dynamical system, but it is not infrequently used, as
  in the former paper, for the quaterm'on of the rotation-operator q( M“.

     The second portion of the inquiry was directed to the most suitable
  means of comparing a star    with the standard. Such a method must
  provide for the estimation of the total luminous energy, irrespective
  of the fact that in the case of a star the light practically emanates
  from a point, whilst that from the standard emanates from a surface.
  This fact precludes the use of the wedge photometer.
     The methods employed by the author were three in number. The
  <U+FB01>rst was by means of re<U+FB02>ection from a plane mirror mounted in front
  of the telescope object glass, in such a manner that the light of one
  of the radiants is seen by re<U+FB02>ection through one half of the lens,
  whilst that of the other is viewed through the other half, by direct
  vision, both radiants being thus simultaneously seen in the same
  <U+FB01>eld of view. When the two images are placed out of focus to an
  equal extent, so as to be equal in size, comparisons of intensity can
  be made.    By this system it matters not whether the light emanates
 from a point or a surface, as it is the degree of illumination of the
 respective portions of the object glass which is measured.        Errors
  due to the unequal transmitting power of the di<U+FB02>'erent portions of the
 lens, and also those due to the loss of light by re<U+FB02>ection, &c., are
 corrected by repeating the observations after the whole of the
 apparatus has been reversed; i.e., if the star is seen by re<U+FB02>ection in
 the <U+FB01>rst observation, it is to be viewed by direct vision in the second,
 when the standard light will be viewed by re<U+FB02>ection.
     The second method employed was a modi<U+FB01>cation of Ziillner’s lamp,
 the standard used being the author’s pentane Argand burner, in which
 air carburetted with pentane is employed as a combustible. This is
 mounted on the eye-end of the telescope.         Next to the burner is
 placed a plate of ground blue glass, carefully adjusted to reduce the
 colour of the gas <U+FB02>ame, so that it is, as nearly as possible, comparable
 with that of daylight. This glass is mounted permanently in front
 of an aperture, 0‘08 inch in diameter, in a brass plate.    At a distance
 of 2'4 inches from this is placed a second plate of brass, having an
 aperture of O'Ol3 inch diameter.       A lens, <U+FB01>xed at 2 inches from
 this second plate, projects the image of the illuminated surface of the
 blue glass by a re<U+FB02>ecting prism, to the eye-piece of the telescope,
in which it is viewed as a circular disc of light, side by side with
that caused by the illuminated image of the telescope object glass.
The ground surface of the blue glass aifords a slightly granulated
appearance, exactly imitating that of the object glass when a star
is viewed out of focus. By arranging the position of the eye-piece
until the two images are exactly of the same size, the imitation of
a star is so striking that it is all but impossible, when the colours
are alike, to discern the difference.
    For the modi<U+FB01>cation of the colour of the comparison light, two series
of coloured glasses are arranged in rotating diaphragms situated

between the two perforated   plates 2'4 inches apart.  These can          be
conveniently brought into position for modifying the colour and
intensity of the comparison light.   The coe<U+FB02>icient of absorption         of
 each of the coloured glasses was determined photometrically, and
.tables prepared by reference to which corrections for their use can
be made.
    As this method was found to present an objectionable feature          in
regard to the uncertainty attending the use of multiple glasses for
reducing intensity, the third method was employed.          The lamp was
 placed on  a  graduated  bar in  such a  manner   that its  distance from
 the ground blue glass could be conveniently altered, and the illumi
 nation of that glass reduced on strictly photometrical principles.
 This method was found to answer so well that the experimental
 apparatus <U+FB01>rst employed       being altered and improved.

 completed,   a  further and  extended   series of  observations    will

   Details of the observations are given in the tables presented with
the paper.    By plotting the average results on a diagram         mean

curve      drawn. From the value thus found, the relative intensity
          is
of stars of all other magnitudes can be calculated.
   It then only remains to convert the comparative into actual values
by the correction for the distance of these stars whose positions are
known, when their actual intensities will be ascertained.
   The following series  is given of the average results of the determi
nations of the intensity of a sequence of stars in descending order           of

       The atmospheric absorption of light is discussed, and instances
 given of the considerable diminution in the light of a star when no
 apparent cause was discernible to ordinary observation.
       Eight determinations of the light of Jupiter have been made, the
 average result being to ascribe to that planet a light equal to
 0020 candle placed at a distance of 109 feet.                            Determinations of the
light of the planet Venus and of the Moon are also given, and the
necessity for further observations referred to.
       The total quantity of light a<U+FB01>orded by the stars (apart from the
planets) is calculated from the above results combined with Arge
lander’s estimate of the number of stars down to the ninth mag
nitude. Assuming that the light aiforded by these is equalled by the
innumerable stars of lesser magnitude than the ninth, and by nebulae,
total starlight will equal that from 1446 candles when placed at a
distance of 109 feet.                    If it be further assumed that only one-sixth of
the stars are capable of illuminating a given surface at the same
moment, then such illumination will be equal to that afforded by one
standard candle placed at a distance of 210 feet.

V. “ On Some Phenomena connected with Cloudy Condensa~
       tion.” By JOHN AITKEN, F.R.S.                Received March 2,
        1892.
   In the <U+FB01>rst part of this communication     I intend giving the results
of an investigation into the phenomena connected with the cloudy
condensation produced when a jet of steam mixes with ordinary air,
with special reference to the marked change which takes place in the
appearance of the jet by electri<U+FB01>cation and other causes.           In the
second part will be given the results of an investigation into certain
colour phenomena which can be produced when the condensation is
made to take place under certain conditions, and it is thought that
these experimental colour phenomena,        if they do not give the ex
                 “
planation of a     green sun,” at least enable us to reproduce it arti
<U+FB01>cially with the materials existing in our atmosphere.
                          PART  I.—STEAM Jars.
   When a jet of steam escapes into the air, condensation          at once
ensues by the expansion and the mixing of the steam with          the cold
air.   The result is the jet becomes distinctly visible by the light
re<U+FB02>ected by the minute drops of water carried along in the mixed
gases and vapour.     At <U+FB01>rst sight there is little that is interesting in
the changes then taking place.     The subject has, therefore, attracted
but little attention, and has been but little studied.     This is evident
from the great interest that has been taken in the change produced
                                                              I
in the appearance of the jet when it is electri<U+FB01>ed; yet hope to be
able to show that this is only one of a number of causes which alter
the appearance of the condensing steam.
   R. Helmholtz was the <U+FB01>rst to show that when an ordinary jet of
steam is electri<U+FB01>ed, there is a marked increase in the density of
the condensation.      The eEect of the electricity is certainly very
remarkable.     The instant the jet is electri<U+FB01>ed, it at once changes
and becomes much denser, and. the condensed particles also become
visible much closer up to the nozzle from which the steam is escaping.
For the convenience of description we shall call this second form of
condensation dense condensation, while that usually observed we shall
call ordinary condensation.   Not that there is any hard and fast line
between these two forms, as the one may be made to change by
imperceptible degrees into the other.       All that is meant is that the
one is dense compared with the other.
   One result of this investigation is that, in addition to electri<U+FB01>cation
of the jet, there are four other ways in which the ordinary condensa

   1892.]            connected with Cloudy. Condensation.                   409
  tion may be changed into the dense form.                  These <U+FB01>ve ways of
  changing    the ordinary   into  the  dense   form  of condensation are :— _
      1. Electri<U+FB01>cation   of the jet.
      2. An increase in the number of dust nuclei.
      3. Cold or low temperature of the air.
      4. High pressure of the steam.
      5. Obstructions in front of the jet and rough or irregular nozzles.
      We shall now describe some experiments to illustrate each of these
  different ways of causing the ordinary condensation to change and
  take the dense form. In the experiments to be described, the steam
 was generally generated in a copper boiler, which could be pressed
 up to fully one atmosphere.             The nozzle from which the steam
 escaped was placed at some distance from the boiler to prevent the
 hot gases in<U+FB02>uencing the jet.         The steam was conveyed by means of
 a metal pipe to the nozzle, and a water trap was placed near the end
 of this pipe to prevent the irregularities which would be produced if
 the water condensed in the pipe were allowed to issue from the nozzle.
 The nozzle generally used was made of brass, carefully bored to a
 diameter of 1 mm., the diameter of the bore widening inwards, while
 the outside of the nozzle was turned to a <U+FB01>ne edge in front. With
 this apparatus mest of the experiments were made, but occasionally
 glass vessels and nozzles were used, as well as vessels and nozzles of
other materials, but with no marked difference in the results.
                                 1.  Electri<U+FB01>cation.
     In the experiments with electricity only steam of a low pressure
 should be used.        The reason of this will be understood from what
follows under division 4.         In these experiments slight electri<U+FB01>cation
was used, as only an old-fashioned cylinder electrical machine was
available for the purpose, and in the damp atmosphere produced by
the steam jet the electri<U+FB01>cation was only capable of giving a spark of
 about 1 cm. or generally less.
    The necessary condition for the electricity producing any e<U+FB01>ect on
the jet is that the particles in the jet be electri<U+FB01>ed either by direct
discharge or by an induction discharge.               The mere presence of an
electri<U+FB01>ed body near the jet has no in<U+FB02>uence whatever.                 In order
that it may have an effect, the electri<U+FB01>ed body must terminate in a
point placed near the jet, and the potential must be great enough to
cause a discharge of the electricity to the jet.              When this takes
place the jet     at  once  becomes    dense    and  remains  in that condition
while the discharge continues.           The electri<U+FB01>ed body may, however,
electrify the jet by induction.           If, for instance, the electri<U+FB01>ed body
he a sphere, and the nozzle from which the steam is issuing be
pointed, the electricity discharged by the nozzle will electrify the

410               Mr.  J.  Aitken.       On some Phenomena           [Apr-. 28,
particles, and the condensation becomes dense. But if the nozzle
be not pointed, then the presence of the electri<U+FB01>ed body produces no
change, as there is no discharge of electricity.          But if now we hold a
needle or other pointed conductor near the jet issuing from the
rounded nozzle it at once becomes dense, by the induction discharge
from the point. In place of a point in the last experiment, we may
use a <U+FB02>ame; in fact, we may use any in<U+FB02>uence which will enable the
electri<U+FB01>ed body to electrify the particles in the jet.
    Another way of making this experiment is to insulate the boiler,
and electrify it. If the nozzle be pointed, the jet becomes dense on
electri<U+FB01>cation;    but, if it be rounded, the electri<U+FB01>cation has no e<U+FB01>fect.
If, however, we bring a needle or a<U+FB02>ame near the rounded nozzle, the
 jet becomes dense. To get no e<U+FB01>ect from the electri<U+FB01>cation it is neces~
 sary that the nozzle be a ball of some size, the ori<U+FB01>ce through which
 the steam issues being, of course, the same diameter as that of the
pointed jet.
    The e<U+FB01>ect of the electri<U+FB01>cation has been studied by R. Helmholtz
and by Mr. Shelford Bidwell<U+FB01>‘< but neither of them seems to be satis
<U+FB01>ed with any explanation they o<U+FB02>'er.            Mr. Bidwell, from a spectro
scopic   examination  of  the  light   transmitted  through the jet under the
 two conditions, came to the conclusion that in the dense condition the
 particles were larger than in the ordinary form of condensation; and
he thinks that the increase in size is due to the electricity causing
the small drops of water to coalesce and form larger drops.                  In
support   of this  explanation,     he  quotes  Lord  Rayleigh’s   experiments
on the coalescence of drops in water jets while under the in<U+FB02>uence of
electricity.    As Mr. Bidwell does not put forth this opinion as <U+FB01>nal.
there is less reason for hesitation in stating that the conclusion            I
have come to is diametrically opposed to Mr. Bidwell’s.
    There seems to be no doubt that electricity will act on these very
small drops of water in the same way as it acts on the drops in a jet.
of water. That its action is similar is easily proved by the following
experiment with mist drops :—Take a small open vessel full of hot
water—it is better to colour the water nearly black for convenience
of observation—a cup of tea without cream does very well for the
purpose.     Place the cup on a table between the window and the
observer.     On now looking at the cup from such a position that no
bright light is re<U+FB02>ected from the surface of the liquid, there will be
seen what looks like scum on the surface of the tea.             That scum is,
however, only a multitude of small mist-drops which have condensed
out of the rising steam and have fallen on the surface of the liquid,
where they are seen <U+FB02>oating. If now we take a piece of brown paper,
or any convenient material, and rub it slightly and hold it over the cup,
the “scum” will disappear at once, and be replaced by other drops

    when the electri<U+FB01>ed body is removed.        As in Lord Rayleigh’s experi
    ments, a very feeble electri<U+FB01>cation is suf<U+FB01>cient to cause the absorption
    of the drops into the body of the liquid.        It  is therefore not because
    there is supposed to be any difference in the action of electricity
    on large and on very small drops that a different conclusion from
    Mr. Bidwell’s has been arrived at, but because all the experiments to
    be described point to the conclusion that the dense form of condensa
    tion is not due to an increase in the size of the drops, but to an
   increase in the number, accompanied of course by a diminution in
   the size.
       We may suppose the following to be something like the manner in
   which the electricity acts on the jet :—In a steam jet the rapid move
   ments of the drops give rise to frequent collisions, and these result in
   the coalescence of many of the drops, so that each drop in ordinary
  condensation is made up of a number; but, when the jet is electri<U+FB01>ed,
  the electri<U+FB01>cation prevents the particles coming into contact, as they
  repel each other, and the consequence is, we have a greater number
  of particles in a dense and electri<U+FB01>ed jet than in an ordinary one.
       Lord Rayleigh’s experiments on the action of electricity on water
  jets support this view.        He has shown that, in order to produce
  coalescence, the electri<U+FB01>cation must be very slight, and he also points
  out that the coalescence does not seem to be so much due to electri<U+FB01>
  cation as to a difference of electri<U+FB01>cation, which would appear to
  cause a discharge of electricity to take place between the drops,
 which ruptures the <U+FB01>lms, so causing contact.              Further, he has shown
 that when the electri<U+FB01>cation is strong, and the conditions are such
 that the drops become electri<U+FB01>ed, the effect is diametrically the
 opposite, and instead of coalescence, the particles now scatter far
 more than the unelectri<U+FB01>ed drops. Now from the conditions of the
 experiments with electri<U+FB01>ed steam jets it is evident that the drops are
 electri<U+FB01>ed, and are in the same condition as the electri<U+FB01>ed scattering
 water jet. We are, therefore, entitled to expect that the electricity
 will prevent and not aid the coalescence of the small drops in the
 steam jet.
      Other considerations also point to the increase in the density of the
jet being due to an increase and not to a diminution in the number of
drops.       We know that if we blow steam into air, that the fewer dust
nuclei there are in the air, the thinner is the condensation, and when
the dust is nearly all out of the air, only a <U+FB01>ne rain falls which can
scarcely be detected by the unaided eye. Further, the evidence from
condensation produced by expanding moist air points to the same
conclusion, namely, that the more dust particles there are in the air,
the denser is the condensation when cooled by expansion, and the
purer the air is, the thinner is the cloud.* These experiments all

412               Mr. J.  Aitken.    On some Phenomena           [Apr. 28,
point to the conclusion that the dense form of condensation is due to
a large number of water drops, and the thinner form to a smaller
number, though of greater individual size. The only condition under
which it seems probable that the increase in number will not give
rise to increase in density is when the particles are so small that
they are unable to re<U+FB02>ect waves of any colour of light.       So far as has
yet been observed this never happens.          However slight the amount
of expansion, the greater number of particles always gives the denser
form of condensation.
   The action of the electricity on the jet does notappear to be any
thing positive: it rather seems to prevent something which takes
place under ordinary conditions.         For instance, electricity has no
effect in thickening the cloud of so-called steam rising from a hot
and wet surface.     The electrically driven current of air from a point
when directed to the steaming surface has no effect whatever on the
density of the condensation. Nor has electricity any e<U+FB02>‘ect on the
steam rising from an open vessel.         The small drops of water under
these conditions move but slowly, and there is but little tendency
for them to come into collision with each other; there are, there
fore, few collisions for the electricity to prevent, and little or no
thickening is produced by electri<U+FB01>cation under those conditions.
Further on we shall have frequent opportunities of seeing that the
dense form of condensation is the result of an increase in the number
of particles, and that whatever gives rise to an increase in the number
causes an increase in the density.
   When the jet is electri<U+FB01>ed and becomes dense, it has been noticed
by others that it emits at the same time a peculiar sound, and <U+FB01>nd    I
that whenever the jet becomes dense, from whatever cause, it begins
“to speak.” But when the density is due to electri<U+FB01>cation, the sound
is, however, slightly different from the sound emitted when dense
from any of the other causes.         When dense from causes other than
electri<U+FB01>cation, the sound is similar to that produced by the jet
striking an obstruction; but when electri<U+FB01>ed, the sound is a com
bination of this sound with another due to the discharge of the
 electricity; and this second sound depends on the manner in which
the electric discharge takes place.        If the discharging point is not
 sharp,  and  the potential is just suf<U+FB01>cient  to cause discharge, then the
 discharge is not continuous, but takes place at short intervals; it
 becomes, in fact, a series of disruptive discharges, and gives rise to a
 <U+FB02>uttering noise.     This <U+FB02>uttering sound is greatly increased if the
 point terminates in a small ball of about 1 mm. diameter, and it is
 entirely abolished if we use a very sharp point, or better, a <U+FB02>ame.
 The discharge with either the very sharp point or the <U+FB02>ame is per
 fectly continuous, and nothing but the slight hissing that accompanies
 all dense forms of condensation is heard when the jet is electri<U+FB01>ed.

   1892.]             connected with Cloudy      Condensation.               413
      It has generally been stated that the effect of the electri<U+FB01>cation is      .
   sudden and marked, that whenever the jet is electri<U+FB01>ed it at once
   becomes very dense.        This, however, is   due to the manner     in which
  the jet has generally been electri<U+FB01>ed.          Some degree of potential is
  necessary to produce a discharge from the point, and whenever the
  potential is high enough to cause this, it is su<U+FB02>icient to charge the
  drops high enough to give rise to a very dense condensation. But if
  we make the discharginglpoint extremely <U+FB01>ne, or assist the discharge
  by means of a <U+FB02>ame, then, we may begin with electricity of a very low
  potential, and the increase in the density may be made to begin by
  almost imperceptible degrees and to increase slowly to the dense
  form by gradually increasing the potential.
     We shall for the present leave the question of the e<U+FB02>ect of the.
 ordinary and the dense forms of'condensation on the light trans
 mitted through them, as it will be better discussed after we have
 considered all the ways in which the jet may be made dense, and we
 shall now pass on to consider the second of those given in our list.
                  2. An  Increase  in the Number of Dust Nuclei.
     It   has been noticed by previous observers that a <U+FB02>ame brought
 near    the jet tended to make the condensation dense; but, in describ
 ing the experiments, a confusion has generally been made between
 the <U+FB02>ame and the products of the combustion taking place in the
 <U+FB02>ame.       So far as I  have been able to observe, <U+FB02>ame has no effect on
the density of the condensation.           Neither a luminous <U+FB02>ame nor the
 <U+FB02>ame of a Bunsen burner has any effect so long as the products of
combustion are kept away from the jet.                But if the products are
drawn into the jet, they have a very marked effect either in increas
ing or decreasing the density. If the <U+FB02>ame is near and the gases are
hot, they make the jet nearly invisible, but if the gases are cooled or
are not in great quantity, then they make the jet as dense as if it
were electri<U+FB01>ed.       The simplest way of studying this latter e<U+FB01>ect is to
bring the products of combustion to the jet by means of a metal tube
2 or 3 cm. in diameter and about % a metre long.                 A small <U+FB02>ame
about é— cm. high, placed below          the  level  of the jet, is used.   One
end of the tube is kept over the <U+FB02>ame while the other can be brought
near the nozzle.         It will be found that when brought into that
position the jet will at once become dense, and when it is removed it
will return to its ordinary condition, and become dense again with
every return of the impure gases.
    The increase in density in this case is due to the greater number of
dust particles in the gases offering a greater number of nuclei for
condensation, and the result is a great increase in the number of
water particles, and consequent thickening of the condensation, a

    combustion are brought to        is exactly the same as that produced by
    electri<U+FB01>cation.   The whole jet becomes dense, the condensed particles
    are visible nearly up to the nozzle, and the jet makes the same sound
    as when electri<U+FB01>ed by silent discharge, and further, electricity of the
    potential used does not make it any denser.
       It seems probable that the very great number of dust particles in
    the products of combustion act in two ways: <U+FB01>rst, by supplying                       a
    great number of nuclei; and, second, as the number is greater the
I   drops will be smaller, and, on account of their small size, they will
    have less independent motion, as they will be more guided by the
    gases than larger drops; there will, therefore, be fewer collisions, and
    not the same tendency to the diminution of numbers by the coales
    cence of a number of drops into one. It may be because of the small
    number of the collisions when the particles are small that electricity
    has little or no effect on the jet when    it   dense from
                                                    is           large supply
                                                                           a
    of nuclei.   It
                  is   possible that some of the increased density produced
    by the products of combustion may be due to the slight electri<U+FB01>cation
    of gases from <U+FB02>ames.       But as the electri<U+FB01>cation from this source               is
    very slight, its effects will be extremely feeble indeed when the dust
    particles are developed to the size of drops, so that the electricity
    from this source   is not likely to have much eifect.
                    3.   Cold or Low Temperature         of   the   Air.
      We now     come to the third cause of the dense form of condensation,
    namely,   low temperature of the air. At <U+FB01>rst sight      may appear that
                                                                    it
    the above statement contains an already well-known fact.        But while
    in a certain sense this    isso, yet there   one point of great import
                                                is
    ance which, so far as   I am aware, has not previously been observed.
    If we were asked to state what the e<U+FB01>ect of the temperature of the
                                          is
    air on condensation of the jet, we, probably, would say that when the
    temperature of the air       high the condensation
                                is                          very transparent,
                                                                    is
    owing to there being less vapour condensed and to its rapid re-evapo
    ration; and that when the temperature became lower and lower the
    jet gradually thickens as the temperature falls, owing to the greater
     amount of condensation caused by the colder air. Such a description
     is far from a full statement of the facts regarding the changes in
     appearance with the fall in temperature, and the explanation is corre
     spondingly faulty.    There      an in<U+FB02>uence at work in the condensing
                                     is
     jet, which, though due to temperature,      of far more importance than
                                                is
     the effect of the temperature on the amount of steam condensed.
        WhenI    <U+FB01>rst encountered this new in<U+FB02>uence       greatly puzzled me.
                                                               it

  1892.]           connected with Cloudy Condensation.                  415
  I  had opened the window of the room Where the experiments were
  being made, and when the fresh air came in, the jet began to behave
  itself in a most uncertain way. At one moment it was quite steady
  ordinary condensation, and the next it would conduct itself as if
 electrically excited.   Even after the window was closed it continued
  to change from the ordinary to the dense form of condensation in a
  puzzling way. It was <U+FB01>rst thought that the outer air might be
  electri<U+FB01>ed, and tests were accordingly made to see if this were the case.
  These tests showed that if it were electri<U+FB01>ed it could be so but slightly,
  as it did not a<U+FB01>ect a gold leaf electroscope, which it would require to
 have done to have produced the increased density observed in the steam
 jet. Electricity as the solution of the dif<U+FB01>culty had, therefore, to be
 abandoned. The only other in<U+FB02>uence          I could think of as likely to
 cause the eifect was some unknown effect of cold; I, therefore, took
 the metal tube which had been used in a previous experiment for
 conveying the products of combustion from the <U+FB02>ame to the jet and
 cooled it. On now presenting one end of thisjcold tube to the jet it
 at once responded, and the condensation became as dense as if a <U+FB02>ame
 had been at the other end of the tube, or as if the jet had been
 electri<U+FB01>ed.
     This effect was all the more surprising since there was no great
 di<U+FB01>'erence between the temperature of the air in the tube and that of
 the room, not more than 10° F. Some experiments were,theref0re, made
 to <U+FB01>nd out the temperature at which this change takes place, and to see
 if it was as sudden as it appeared to be. The jet was supplied with
 air cooled in a pipe, which was surrounded with water for regulating
 the temperature of the air. The steam nozzle was placed just inside
 one end of the pipe and pointing outwards, so that the jet drew its
supply of air out of the tube. No very satisfactory results were got
with this apparatus. It may, however, be mentioned that when the
air was cooled the jet somewhat suddenly became dense, and again
became ordinary when the temperature was slightly raised ; but with
the apparatus it was dif<U+FB01>cult to say what the temperature of the air
really was when the change took place.
     Another method of studying the e<U+FB01>'ect of temperature on the
density was tried with fair success; the nozzle was <U+FB01>tted to the end
of a horizontal pipe, the nozzle also being pointed horizontally. For
this experiment a morning was selected when the temperature of the
room was low. When the experiments began the temperature was
40° F.      At this temperature the jet was always dense, and. neither
electri<U+FB01>cation nor the products of combustion increased its density.
The room was now slowly heated, and the jet watched while the tem
perature rose. Up to a temperature of 46° no change took place, and
the jet was not made denser by electricity nor by the products of
combustion. But when the temperature rose to 47° the jet began to
                                                               2 F 2

416              Mr.  J. Aitken.   On some Phenomena           [Apr.  28,
show signs of clearing.      The clearing did not, however, take place
regularly; one moment the jet was dense and the next it was ordi
nary.     These <U+FB02>uctuations would be due to the unequal temperature
of the air coming to the jet. At one moment the air would be the
air of the temperature of the room; the next it would be this air
slightly heated by the metal pipe and nozzle. So that when the jet
drew its supply of air horizontally its condensation was ordinary, and
when the air currents in the room prevented this heated air from
coming to the jet its condensation was dense.
   A slight alteration was then made in the arrangement; the jet
was now directed downward at the end of the horizontal pipe.          By
this means the air heated on the pipe and nozzle was prevented from
mixing with the jet. The jet was directed at a small angle from the
vertical to prevent the hot air and vapour of the jet rising to the
nozzle.     With this arrangement the following was the result: up to
a temperature of 46° the condensation was dense, and neither elec
tricity nor the products of combustion had any effect on the density;
but when the temperature rose to about 47° electri<U+FB01>cation began to
have just a perceptible effect in increasing the density.    At about 1&8”
the electricity had an easily observed effect, and the products of com
bustion also had a slight e<U+FB01>ect.      At a temperature of 50° the jet
had become decidedly thinner, and both electricity and the products
 of combustion had a decided effect in increasing its density.     When
 the temperature rose to 55° the jet lost its dense appearance, and both
 electricity and the products of combustion had a very marked effect.
    It might be thought that by observing a steam jet in the open air
 we could tell if the temperature of the air was above or below a
 certain point.   This, however, can only be done in a very rough way,
 as the conditions are variable and not within our knowledge.         We
 would require to know the pressure of the steam, and the degree to
 which the
             air'was
                      heated by the pipe.    In a general way it may be
 stated that in the open air a steam jet looks dense if the temperature
 be below 50°, and ordinary if above 55°. But it is often di<U+FB01>icult to say
 what is ordinary and what is dense condensation, unless the observa
 tions are made carefully and by examining how close to the nozzle
 the particles are visible.    Of course if we could electrify the jet,
 or supply it with the products of combustion, we could tell when
 ever the temperature was over or under 47°.
    The sudden alteration in the appearance of the jet when supplied
 with air at a temperature of 46° points to some change in the in
 <U+FB02>uences in action in the condensing jet. The great increase in density
 cannot be due to an increase in the amount of vapour condensed, as the
 fall in the temperature is slight. Further, it will be observed that
 the jet has ceased to be in<U+FB02>uenced by electricity, and by the products
 of combustion. The only explanation       I  could think of was, that at

  1892.]           connected with Cloudy   Condensation.             417
 the temperature of the mixed cold    air and steam some alteration had
 taken place  in the surface <U+FB01>lms of the water drops. The jet looked as
 if something came into action at that temperature which prevented
 the drops coalescing when they came into collision, or, what would
 amount to the same thing, that at high temperatures there was no
 tendency for the drops to recoil after impact, and that when the
 temperature fell this property made its appearance, and prevented
 contact in the same way as we have supposed the electri<U+FB01>cation does.
    The simplest way of testing this explanation was to repeat Lord
 Rayleigh’s experiment with water jets, but in place of cold water
 using hot. The result is, the experiment entirely con<U+FB01>rms this ex
 planation.    So long as the water in the jet is above a certain tem
 perature   there  is no scattering whatever, but perfect coalescence of
 the drops on contact. As a consequence the jet is not in<U+FB02>uenced in
 the slightest degree by the presence of an electri<U+FB01>ed body. It is only
 after the temperature falls below a certain point that the scattering
 commences, and electricity begins to have an in<U+FB02>uence.               .
    This experiment shows that it is only when the drops are below
 certain temperature that their surface <U+FB01>lms act in the way we are
 accustomed to observe at ordinary temperatures, that is, repel each
 other; and that when the temperature is high there is an entire -
 change, and the surface <U+FB01>lms no longer repel, but coalescence of the
 drops takes place at each collision.   It will be noticed that the point
 here is, not the appearance of any new in<U+FB02>uence with the low tem
 perature, as the <U+FB01>lms are then in the condition with which we are
 acquainted; it is at the high temperature that the new condition
 comes into action, and the <U+FB01>lms lose the resisting action with which
 we are acquainted.
    Now it seems extremely probable that the change in the appearance
 of the steam jet when the temperature of the air is lowered is due to
the temperature of the jet falling to the temperature at which this
repulsive action makes its appearance.
    There is, however, an experimental link wanting to bind these two
phenomena together, which        I have desired to complete, but unfor
tunately experimental di<U+FB02>iculties stop the way. The link wanting is
some experimental proof that the jet gets dense at the same tem
perature that the water jet begins to scatter. On attempting to take
the temperature of the jet di<U+FB02>iculties presented themselves. If it is
to be taken with a thermometer, where is it to be placed P A very
slight change in the position of the bulb of a thermometer placed
in the jet gives a di<U+FB02>erent reading. It does not matter whether the
change be made nearer or further from the centre of the jet, or
nearer or further from the nozzle: in all cases a very slight change
gives a considerable di<U+FB01>'erence of temperature. It may, however, be
stated that when the bulb was placed in the centre of the jet, and

 418                 Mr.   J.   Aitken.         On some Phenomena        [Apr.   28,
  near the nozzle,    it    showed a temperature of about 130°, but that
 <U+FB01>gure can only be looked upon as very rough approximation to the
                                                a
 true temperature.
     One or two attempts'jwere, however, made to <U+FB01>nd the temperature
  at which water <U+FB01>lms cease to have any repulsive action. This was
 done by means of a small water jet; and                 was found that above
                                                          it
  155° there was no scattering.          It was not till the temperature fell
 below that point that electri<U+FB01>cation had any effect. This was the
 temperature of the drops themselves, not of the supply for the jet;
 and   it  may not be quite accurate, as the drops tend to cool very
 quickly.     Another method of <U+FB01>nding this temperature was to observe
 the highest temperature at which the mist drops <U+FB02>oated on water,                in
 the experiment previously described.           This method      not very satis
                                                                    is
 factory, on account of the dif<U+FB01>culty of seeing the drops when the
 temperature    is     high, owing to the amount of condensed steam
 hanging over the water. It               also di<U+FB02>icult to keep the surface
                                           is                                    of
 the water clean.        The tests by this method gave a temperature con
 siderably higher than that given by the water jet. Neither of these
 methods, however, promises to give satisfactory information on this
 point but,
       ;      if it    were desired, the effect of temperature on the contact
-of <U+FB01>lms could be studied in more accurate way.
                                       a
     It dif<U+FB01>cult to imagine any sudden change in the action of the
       is
 <U+FB01>lms at or about the temperatures indicated.               There is no corre
 sponding change, so far as       I   am aware, in the surface tension. We
 might picture to ourselves the change to be brought about by the
 alteration which takes place in the intervening gases.              When the
 drops    are  cold,  the  bounding    surfaces  are  water and  air with very
 little vapour in it. And perhaps we may be permitted to assume
 that the surface-<U+FB01>lm has a layer of air condensed on it, and               it
                                                                            may
 be this condensed layer of air which prevents contact when the drops
 come into collision.        But when the temperature          high, the condi
                                                               is
 tions are changed.          The bounding surfaces are now water and air
 with a large amount of vapour in                   it,
                                                and this vapour may play an
 important part in bringing about the contact, by the violent inter
 change of water molecules taking place at the surfaces of the <U+FB01>lms,
 and weakening the condensed <U+FB01>lms of air.               If this explanation       be
 correct,   then  there    is really no sudden change in the action of the
 <U+FB01>lms, and the repulsion          is a gradually increasing one with fall         of
 temperature.        Though the somewhat sudden change in the appear
 ance of this jet might seem to indicate a sudden change in the action
 of the <U+FB01>lms, yet the change may be really a slowly increasing one, and
 the sudden change in the appearance of the jet may be due to the
 repulsion rising to such an amount that the very small particles are
 prevented from coalescing.           If the relative temperatures given for
  the coalescence of water drops and mist drops be correct; then the

 1892.]            connected with Cloudy    Condensation.              419
 gradual rise in the repulsion with fall in temperature may be the
 explanation of why the drops in a water jet coalesce at a lower
 temperature    than the mist drops on the surface of water.           The
                                                                            '
 water may require to be cooled to a lower temperature before the
 repulsion is suf<U+FB01>cient to prevent the heavier drops from coalescing,
 while the less repulsion at the higher temperature may be su<U+FB02>icient
 to prevent the lighter mist drops from coming into contact.           The
 same explanation helps to account for the increased density produced
 by increasing the dust particles, a less repulsion being suf<U+FB01>cient to
 protect the excessively small drops.
    The explanatious we have here offered of the action of electricity
 and low temperature are in complete agreement.           In ordinary con
 densation when the temperature of the air is high there is no surface
repulsion, owing to the high temperature in the jet, and many of the
 particles coalesce on collision with each other; but, when the drops
are electri<U+FB01>ed, their mutual repulsions prevent contact, and the
result is a large increase in the number of drops and a dense form of
condensation. On the other hand, when the temperature is lowered.
surface <U+FB01>lm repulsion comes into action, contact is prevented, 'and
the drops do not coalesce on collision, and the result is exactly the
same as if they were electri<U+FB01>ed.
   In these remarks no reference has been made to the effect of the
dryness of the air on the density of the condensation. It seems
probable that the relative humidity of the air will have a less
in<U+FB02>uence on the density than on the duration of the jet, that is, the
length of time the drops take to evaporate.
                      4. High Pressure of   the Steam.
   The fourth    cause of the dense form of condensation is high pressure
of  the  steam.    If the temperature be below 46° the condensation is
dense at all pressures, but as the temperature rises, the condensation
ceases to be dense if the pressure of the steam be low.          But if we
now raise the pressure, the jet again becomes dense, and the higher
the temperature of the air the higher the pressure must be raised to
produce the dense form of condensation. The action of the high
pressure in producing the dense condensation is more complex than
any of the previous causes.       It acts, <U+FB01>rst, by the more rapid move
ments of the jet mixing a larger amount of air with the steam, by
which means a greater number of dust nuclei are taken into the jet ;
and, second, a lower temperature is also produced, which probably
brings the temperature of the drops low enough for the repulsive
action of the <U+FB01>lms to come into play.        But in addition to the effects
of a greater amount of air being mixed with the steam, a third action
here comes into play.      Owing to the violent rush of steam, the con

 420               Mr. J. Aitken.   On some Phenomena            [Apr. 28,
 densation   takes place  more rapidly; and it has been found that, the
 more rapidly the condensation is effected, the greater is the number
 of particles formed. If the condensation take place slowly, a much
 less number of nuclei are suf<U+FB01>cient to relieve the supersaturation, as
 there is time for the movements of the water molecules to take place;
 but if the rate of condensation be forced, then the tension of super
 saturation compels a great many more dust particles to become
 centres of condensation.    The result of this is, that with two samples
 of the same mixture of air and steam, if one of them be condensed
 slowly, the clouding is thin, while if the other he condensed quickly,
it is thick. This action will come into play in the steam issuing at
 high pressure, when the steam is rapidly expanded, cooled, and then
 mixed with cold air.                                a
    The increased density produced by increase of pressure also takes
place somewhat suddenly, though not quite so suddenly as when the
density is produced by the other causes.          The jet <U+FB01>rst gradually
thickens as the pressure rises, then a stage is arrived at when it
somewhat suddenly becomes dense. When this last stage is arrived
at, neither electri<U+FB01>cation nor the products of combustion cause any
increase in the density.     The <U+FB01>rst thickening is probably the result
of the quickening of the condensation and increase in the number of
 dust nuclei; and the sudden increase in density is probably due to
 the temperature falling low enough for the <U+FB01>lms of the drops to
 have a repulsive action, su<U+FB01>icient to prevent them coalescing.
             5. Rough Nozzles and Obstructions in front of Jets.
    If we use a nozzle of irregular form, or having roughened edges, it
is found that it gives a dense condensation at a lower pressure than a
nozzle of circular section with smooth bore and thin even edges.
This is owing to the irregularities in the nozzle producing eddies in
the jet, and mixing a greater amount of air with the steam, so cool
ing it more and supplying it with a greater number of nuclei.        It, in
fact, acts in the same direction as increase of pressure, and aids
pressure in producing its results with a less velocity of steam.
    An obstruction in front of the jet acts in a similar manner, if we
have a jet of steam of such a pressure that at the temperature of the
air it gives only the ordinary form of condensation. . If now we place
an obstruction in front of the jet so as to produce eddies, the con
densatidn at once becomes dense. Wind has also a somewhat similar
effect.    The reason of the increased density in these cases is the
same as for the jets issuing from irregular nozzles.       They all assist
the pressure in intensifying the density of the condensation, by lower
ing the temperature of the jet, increasing the number of nuclei, and

                   The Seat of the Sensitiveness of the Jet.
    The seat of maximum sensitiveness to all in<U+FB02>uences tending to
 change the condensation from ordinary to dense is near the origin of
 the jet close to the nozzle. The different in<U+FB02>uences, however, affect
 the jet to different distances from its origin.       The most limited in
 the range of its action is cold, which only produces the dense con
 densation when it acts near the nozzle, whereas some of the other
 in<U+FB02>uences have some e<U+FB01>ect, though a gradually decreasing one, to a
 distance of 2 or 3 cm. from the nozzle.
    The following experiment illustrates the limited ra<U+FB02>ge of the
 action of cold :—A piece of ice about 2 cm. thick was selected, and a
small hole bored through it. The ice was then held so that the steam
jet passed through the opening. While the ice was held at a distance
of 1 cm. from the nozzle, almost no elfect was produced, though much
cold air from the ice was mixing with the jet.        But when the ice was
 brought nearer the origin of the jet, so that the nozzle almost
 entered the plane of the ice, the dense condensation immediately
appeared.
    The range of sensitiveness of the jet to change of condensation by
obstructions is also very limited.       It is only when the obstruction
acts near the nozzle that its e<U+FB02>ect is great.       For instance, the blade
of a knife resting on the nozzle, with its back or edge pointing in the
direction of the jet, and depressed so as to de<U+FB02>ect the jet slightly,
causes the jet to become very dense.       But if the knife acts on the jet
at a distance of'only 1 cm. from the nozzle, very little increase in
 density is produced.
    The range of action of electricity is much greater than that of cold
or obstructions. If we screen the nozzle and the part of the jet near
it from electri<U+FB01>cation, it will be found that at a distance of 3 or 4! cm.
a slight increase in density can be produced with the electri<U+FB01>cation
used in these experiments.
    The action of the products of combustion has a range similar to
that of electricity.     If the products are supplied to the jet at a
distance of 3 or 4 cm. from the nozzle, a slight increase in thickness
can be detected where the impure gases meet the jet; but the effect
is very slight compared with that produced when the gases are taken
in at the origin of the jet.
    The limited range of the action of cold is quite what might be
expected. Near the nozzle the temperature of the jet is high, and
there the drops have no repulsive action; but at a short distance from
the nozzle the temperature is low enough to allow this repulsion to
come into action, and the consequence is that any further cooling
after the temperature is below a certain point produces little or
no e<U+FB01>ect. It is only when the temperature is above this point that

422              Mr.   J. Aitken.    On some Phenomena         [APL  28,
the cooling has any in<U+FB02>uence. The same explanation holds good for
the limited range of the action of obstructions in front of the jet.
   At a distance of a few centimetres from the nozzle new drops seem
still to be forming, as the density of the condensation is slightly
increased by increasing the supply of nuclei at that distance. The
drops seem also occasionally to coalesce at a distance of 3 or 4 cm.
from the nozzle, as electricity slightly increases the density of the
condensation even at that distance.

       COLOUR PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH'CLOUDY        CONDENSATION.
   In the following remarks it is not‘intended     to discuss the many
colour phenomena which are known to be connected with cloudy con
densation.     Attention will be confined principally to some new
phenomena,    the experimental illustration of which has been developed
in the present investigation.
   Before describing these experiments, it may be as well to
refer to some changes which take place in the constitution of
cloudy condensation, both while it is forming and after it has been
developed, as it will be necessary for us to keep certain points in view
while discussing the colour phenomena.         There are two points to
which special reference is required. These are, <U+FB01>rst, the manner in
which the appearance of the condensation is a<U+FB01>ected by the greater
or less degree of supersaturation, that is, by the rate at which the
 condensation is made to 'take place; and, second, the changes which
 take place in the appearance of this cloudy condensation after the
tendency for the vapour to deposit has stopped.
    These two points may be best discussed by taking the second
<U+FB01>rst. Suppose we blow some steam into the air inside a glass vessel,
and leave it undisturbed;      if we examine the cloudy condensation
after a time, we shall <U+FB01>nd that a considerable change has taken place
in its appearance.     The change is due to two causes: part is due to
 the gradual descent of the particles by which a clear space is formed
in the upper part of the vessel. But it will also be observed that the
clouding in the lower part is much thinner than it was at <U+FB01>rst.
 Probably part of this thinning is due to some of the particles having
fallen to the bottom of the vessel, but this is not the principal cause
of the change.      The thinning is due mainly to a reduction in the
number of particlesiin the air, by the smaller particles gradually
becoming absorbed by the larger ones. This is caused by the vapour
pressure at the surface of small particles being greater than at the
surface of larger ones, with the result that the smaller particles
evaporate in air of the same humidity in which the larger ones are
 condensing vapour.

  1892.]           connected with Cloudy    Condensation.             423
    We are now in a position to understand our <U+FB01>rst point, namely,
 why the degree of supersaturation by which the condensation is pro
  duced should have an e<U+FB01>ect on the appearance of the condensed vapour.
 For the study of-this point the condensation produced by expansion
 is the most convenient, as it is more under our control than the con
 densation in steam jets. Suppose we take a glass <U+FB01>ask connected with
 an air-pump.     If we wet the inside of the <U+FB02>ask and then <U+FB01>ll it with
 un<U+FB01>ltered air, the slightest expansion of the moist air by the pump
 will cause condensation to take place. But the density of the con-‘
 densation which can be produced by any degree of expansion will
 depend on the rate at which the expansion is made.      If the expansion
 be made very slowly, the clouding is very thin; but, if it be made
 rapidly, it is very thick. If the expansion be done slowly, the amount
 of supersaturation is only slight, and only the largest dust particles
 come into action as active centres of condensation ; and after a particle
 of dust has once become a nucleus, it has then, in virtue of its size, an
 advantage over the particles which have not begun to. have vapour
 condensed on them. The result of this is that, so long as the degree
 of supersaturation is very slight, these large particles relieve the
 tension, and if by any chance other dust particles become active, any
 reduction in the rate of condensation allows the large particles, after
 they have relieved the tension, to rob the small ones of their burden
 of water, so that a slow rate of condensation always produces a small
 number of drops and a thin form of clouding.
    But now suppose you cause the expansion to be made rapidly; the
 supersaturation then becomes much greater, as there is not time for
 the water molecules to select a resting place, and the small number
 of large dust particles cannot relieve the tension, and the result is
 a much greater number of nuclei are forced into action. And all
 these nuclei continue to grow so long as the supersaturation is kept
 up, but the larger ones grow most. After the tendency to condense
 has begun to diminish, those particles which have accumulated least
 are the <U+FB01>rst to feel the change, and cease to grow, while the larger
 ones are still accumulating.     But after the tendency to condensation
 has ceased altogether,   the changes in the clouded air are not at an
 end. The smaller drops begin to lose their accumulated moisture,
 While the larger ones are still growing—growing at the expense of the
 gradually diminishing smaller ones.      This process goes on till most
of the small ones have lost all their burden of water, which has
been absorbed by the overgrown larger ones ; and in the end a com
paratively small number of drops have absorbed the moisture which
was previously distributed over a vast number of particles.           The
larger particles have, so to speak, eaten up the smaller ones. How
like the above looks to a. page in the “struggle for existence” in
the animal or vegetable world!

from a safety valve.       Mr. Lockyer‘l‘ states that, when on Winder

paddle-boat.  I     believe a few others have seen this phenomenon
under similar conditions, but so far as am aware no one has followed
                                               I
out the suggestion, and investigated the manner in which the colour
is  produced.
    Mr. Bidwell, in his experiments on the electri<U+FB01>cation of steam jets,
studied the action of the jet on light, by casting the shadow of the
jet on a white screen, using for illumination the lime light.          He
found that the shadow of the ordinary jet—that is, the light trans
mitted by the jet—was nearly colourless, but that when it was elec
tri<U+FB01>ed the shadow became of a dark orange-brown colour.

    The colour of the “ green sun                through steam has been
attributed to the absorption of both ends of the spectrum by the
aqueous vapour.      This explanation      obviously not the correct one,
                                            is
as   it will be  found  that   a moderate   length of steam has no per
ceptible selective absorption. Through          length of even one metre
                                                    a
of steam, white objects are not coloured, and we shall presently see
that the colouring depends not on the vapour, but on some action of
the small drops of water in the condensing steam.
    For the purpose of studying the colour phenomena of steam jets          I
 have found it  to be a great advantage to surround the jet by solid walls.
 When a jet condenses under ordinary conditions, the constitution of
 the jet rapidly changes in its passage away from the nozzle, owing to
 the air mixing with it; and       has been found that by enclosing the
                                   it
jet in a tube, after   a certain amount of air has been mixed with the
 steam, that the conditions can be kept fairly constant for some
length of time, and the colour phenomena taking place can, there
 fore, be more easily studied under these conditions. The tube used
 for this purpose need not be of any special size. For a jet from                a
 nozzle of1   mm. bore a tube of      or cm. diameter, and about half a
                                        7      8
 metre long, does very well, but a smaller and shorter tube may be
 used.   With the larger size of tube       may be necessary to check the
                                               it
 current through it. This is best      done   by placing a piece of glass
 near the exit end of the tube, the opening between the glass and
 the end of the tube being regulated to the required amount by ob
 servation. When a small jet of steam            used with the large tube
                                                    is

open at both ends too much air is drawn in, and the effect is much
the same as if no tube were used. The end of the tube has, therefore,
to be closed    to a certain extent, to produce the colour phenomena.
But when high pressed steam is used, no check on the circulation
through the tube is necessary.      The steam nozzle should be placed
outside the tube and a little to one side, so that the eye can be
brought into a line with the axis of the tube and a clear <U+FB01>eld of view
obtained while the jet plays into the open end of the tube.     This is an
experiment which well repays the trouble of making it. When the
amount of steam, dust, and other conditions are properly propor
tioned, the colours seen are very beautiful.    With ordinary condensa
tion the colour varies from a <U+FB01>ne green to lovely blues of di<U+FB01>erent
depths.     The pale blues equal any sky blue, while the deeper blues
are <U+FB01>ner than the dark blues seen in the sky, as they have none of the
cold hardness of the dark sky blues, but have a peculiar softness and
fulness of colour.
    Suppose now the tube is <U+FB01>tted up pointing to a clouded sky, or
 other source of light, and that the steam jet, under slight pressure, is
blowing through it. If the exit end of the tube be open, we shall see
 very little colour, and what is seen is only near the origin of the jet.
 It now we partially close the end of the tube with the glass plate, to
prevent the jet drawing in so much air, we shall <U+FB01>nd that colour
 begins to appear, and that when the plate is properly adjusted the
 tube looks as it <U+FB01>lled with a transparent coloured gas.         The <U+FB01>rst
 decided colour to appear is generally green, though     I  think   I  have
 frequently   seen  a pale crimson  before the green was  visible.    If the
 circulation be checked still further, the colour will change to blue of
 a greater or less depth according to the conditions.
    The above are the effects which may be looked for when the con
 densation of the jet is ordinary; but suppose it be now caused to
 change to the dense form, then the colour seen through the tube also
 changes. If, when the jet is condensing in the ordinary way, and
 the transmitted light is green, we cause the condensation to change
 to dense, then the colour also changes and becomes deep blue, or, if
 the ordinary condensation gave blue, the colour changes, when the
 jet is dense, to a dark yellowish-brown.      But between the blue and
 the yellow there is always an intermediate stage when all colour dis
 appears and the light is simply very much darkened. The most
 common e<U+FB01>ect of the change of the comicnsation from ordinary to
 dense is for the transmitted light to change from blue to a yellowish
colour, and it does not matter how the change in the condensation is
 e<U+FB02>'ected; the colour always changes in the same way.              We can,
 therefore, cause the colour in the tube to change by electrifying the
 jet, by a supply of cold air, by a supply of the products of combus
 tion, by increasing the pressure of the steam, and by placing an ob

   It may be as well to note here    that  the yellows produced by most
dense forms of condensation      are far from <U+FB01>ne, and cannot be com
pared with the blues.      The yellows are not at all unlike the colours
occasionally  seen   through  smoke, or in a thunder cloud.        Though
this    the case with
       is               the dense condensation   produced   by  most of the
causes, yet a very <U+FB01>ne yellow       obtained
                                          is   when  high-pressed steam                          is
used.
  It    has been suggested  that, because an electri<U+FB01>ed jet causes the
light transmitted   through    to be coloured of a dark yellow-brown,
                                   it
and as the colour seen   in  thunder  clouds     similar, that, therefore,

what     stated above,
        is                will be seen that electricity is only one of

colour. Further,    there      no evidence
                                  is         to  show that   electricity has
any in<U+FB02>uence of this nature on    the form   of condensation  taking place
in clouds, and we are hardly entitled to expect          to have any such
                                                                        it
in<U+FB02>uence, as the conditions under which the steam condenses in a jet
are very di<U+FB01>erent from those under which condensation takes place
in clouds; and we have seen that electricity has no e<U+FB01>ect on the
nature of the condensation when it takes place in a mixture of hot
moist air and cold air. There is still another fact which points to the
 same conclusion.    If, in the steam jet, the proportions of dust, pres
 sure, &c., are such  as to give an earlier stage than the blue, suppose
 the transmitted light be green, then the electri<U+FB01>cation may not change
it to yellow, but may only make        blue.    At present, it is therefore
                                               it
 very doubtful whether the electricity in a thunder cloud has anything
to do    with its colour.
       Colours observed   in Cloudy       Condensation produced              by   Expansion.
    Though previous experiments had made me well acquainted with
 certain colour phenomena, seen when cloudy condensation is produced
 by the expansion of moist air in          receiver, yet
                                                     a        had never ob
                                                                         I
 served any colours   in  the light   transmitted    directly   through the
 clouded air, such as are seen  in the  jet  of steam  when    enclosed in                           a
 tube.   It seemed extremely probable that the reason for this would
 be, that when the condensation      produced by expansion, the process
                                               is
 is slow, and the particles will, therefore, be too few to produce any
 colour effects.  In a steam jet, the expansion, cooling, and condensa
 tion take place very rapidly, and for that reason the number of water
 particles formed         is
                        very great.      An experiment was therefore

                                                                                _
  arranged, in which the air could be very rapidly expanded, so as to
  produce a high degree of supersaturation, which it was hoped would
  cause a great number of dust nuclei to become active.           To test this
  idea, all that was necessary Was that the receiver used for holding the
  moist air should be much smaller than usual in comparison with the
  capacity of the pump, and that the light be transmitted through some
  length of air. The plan adopted was to use an air-pump of ordinary
   dimensions, and for a receiver, a metal tube closed with glass ends.
   The <U+FB01>rst apparatus prepared for this experiment was found to give
  satisfactory results, and the alterations since made have not been of
  any great advantage.
      The apparatus consists of a brass tube 2'3 cm. diameter and about
  half a metre long. It is provided with glass ends, <U+FB01>tted on air-tight,
  and is provided with a branch pipe at each end. One of these branch
   pipes is connected with an air-pump, and the other has a stopcock
   <U+FB01>xed to it. This stopcock is connected with a pipe for bringing to
   the tube the air to be experimented with.       If the tube be mounted
   horizontally, the particles rapidly fall and the phenomenon is visible
   for only a short time. The tube is, therefore, best mounted vertically,
   and with a mirror placed at the lower end of the tube to re<U+FB02>ect the
   sky or other source of light up through the tube to the eye of the
   observer.
      The air-pump used is a single cylinder instrument of 3'17 cm.
   diameter and 193 cm. stroke, so that its capacity is about three
   quarters that of the tube receiver. If we take the instrument outside the
   house and make one or two strokes of the pump to <U+FB01>ll the receiver with
   air of the place, then close the stopcock, and make a rapid stroke with
   the pump, little eiiect is produced on the light transmitted through
   the tube. But if we take the instrument into a room where gas has
   been burning, so that the air is full of dust particles, and repeat the
   experiment, very beautiful colours are seen on looking through the
   tube when the air is expanded.     Or, better still, if we collect the gases
   rising from a small <U+FB02>ame and      draw  them into the tube, the result is
   a display of an exceedingly lovely series of colours, full, deep, and
   soft, in some respects reminding one of polarisation colours. As in
   the steam jet, the blues are the <U+FB01>nest, and the tube looks, at times, as
   if <U+FB01>lled with a solutionof Prussian blue. The colours produced in
   this way are more uniform and equal in all parts than those seen in
   the steam jet, unless when the jet is very carefully adjusted; the
   yellows are also much <U+FB01>ner, and the colours more varied than those
   seen in the steam jet.
      There is, however, one most disappointing thing connected with
   these colours produced by expansion: they are very <U+FB02>eeting. Their
   full beauty lasts but a second or two, and they soon fade away, the           _
-  colour growing dimmer and feebler every moment. This is owing to

428               Mr. J.  Aitken.    On some Phenomena         [APR   28
the di<U+FB01>'erentiation which takes place in the particles forming the
cloudy condensation. As has been already explained, the small drops
 rapidly diminish in size while the large ones increase, and as in these
experiments the drops are very close to each other, these changes take
place the more rapidly.      These changes are also taking place in the
steam jet, but, owing to the constant supply of new drops, the older
 ones are swept away before the change is observed.        The following
 experiment will, however, show that these changes are taking place
in the steam jet also. If, while the jet is condensing dense and the
 transmitted light is yellow, we imprison some of the jet by closing
both ends of the tube, we shall <U+FB01>nd in an extremely short time that
 the colour will change to blue, after which it will fade as the drops
increase still further in size, and fall. In this experiment we have a
proof of the statement that when the jet is electri<U+FB01>ed the drops are
smaller than when not electri<U+FB01>ed, and not larger, as has been supposed;
as this experiment shows, if we begin with drops transmitting yellow
light, that as the drops diminish in numbers and increase in size, the
transmitted light changes to blue.
    The conditions of the experiments for producing colour by cloudy
condensation, produced by expansion, have been varied in a number of
ways. After the air has been cooled by the expansion, the layer of
cloudy air in contact with the walls of the tube rapidly acquires heat
from the metal, and the rise in temperature quickly evaporates the
cloudy particles and causes a clear space all round next the walls, so
limiting the colour to the centre of the tube. The receiver was
therefore increased in diameter to get rid of the disturbing e<U+FB01>ects
of the heating of the air on the walls of the tube, so as to have a
larger mass of air beyond this in<U+FB02>uence; but no decided advantage
has been obtained.      It was afterwards found that the dif<U+FB01>culty of
studying    these colour  e<U+FB02>ects in small tubes can be easily overcome
by wetting the inside of the tube.        With this precaution the air
next the walls is kept saturated and the temperature of the walls is
lowered by the heat given 0E to evaporate the water, with the result
that the colour is the same all over the <U+FB01>eld and close up to the
walls.
   Large tubes might be used for showing these colour phenomena to
an audience, a parallel beam of light being sent through them, which
would become coloured when the dusty air in them was expanded.
One large tube tried has a diameter of 7 cm., and is 50 cm. long. With
a receiver of that capacity it would be hopeless to attempt to produce
any colour effects with an ordinary air-pump alone ; a vacuum receiver
has, therefore, been added to the apparatus.    This receiver is made of
metal; it is 15 cm. diameter and 60 cm. long, with round ends.      There
are two tubes attached to it, one for connecting it with the air-pump,
and the other is provided with a stopcock, to which a tube is attached,

 by which it is connected with the experimental receiver. The stopcock
 is closed, and the pump worked till most of the air is taken out of
 the receiver; and when it is desired to expand the air in the experi
 mental tube the stopcock is opened, when a violent rush of air takes
 place,and the pressure is rapidly lowered in the experimental receiver,
 and a dense colour-producin g form of clouding is produced.
                    The Conditions        causing   the   Diferent Colours.
   For studying the conditions which give rise to the different colours
seen in these tubes, the air-pump and the small tube will be found to
be the most suitable.   Supposing these to be <U+FB01>tted up, the following
will show how the colours change with the conditions :—
  First, the effect of the degree of saturation of the air. If the air                 be
dry the colours are not good, and some degree of expansion requires to
be made before any e<U+FB01>ect whatever is produced on the air; and when
the colours do appear, it is only in the centre of the tube that they
are seen, the space all round next the walls being'free from condensed
particles.  As the humidity is increased, this unclouded space near
the sides of the tube gradually diminishes.    The colours are, there
fore, best studied when the air is saturated and the inside of the tube
wet. When this is done the colours extend to the walls, and com
pletely <U+FB01>ll the tube.
   Second, the effect of the number of dust particles in the air.     If
we use ordinary outside air, the colours are very faint or invisible.
Suppose some slight colour is visible, then it will be found that a
very slight expansion, say one-<U+FB01>fth of a stroke of the pump, will
give a pale blue, and if the expansion be increased the colour will
change. If, now, we use air from a room where gas is burning, and
<U+FB01>ll the tube with      we shall now, on expansion, get a much deeper
                          it,
blue, and    will be observed that
               it                      greater expansion must now be
                                                a
made to get the best blue, and before the colour begins to change. If
we alter the conditions still further, and <U+FB01>ll the tube with air in
which     mixed a good deal of the products of combustion, we shall <U+FB01>nd
          is
that the condensation now so dense that we can scarcely see through
                                is
the tube; but      will be noticed that the colour
                     it                              a very deep blue,
                                                                   is
and that a full stroke of the pump was necessary to produce this deep
blue, but in this case no change of colour was produced with that large
degree of expansion.
   These experiments show that, with few dust particles, a slight ex
pansion will produce the best blue, and that, as the number of particles
increases, the amount of expansion necessary to produce the best
blue also requires to be increased, the depth of colour increasing
with the increase in the number of dust particles. The explanation
of the differences here     very simple. With few particles a very

  v01.. LI.                                                                   2   G

430              Mr.  J.  Aitken.     On some Phenomena         [Apr. 28,
slight expansion will deposit enough moisture to make the small
number of drops of the size suf<U+FB01>cient to give the best blue colour;
but, as the number of particles is increased, more moisture must be
deposited before the increased number of drops are made large enough
to give a full blue; hence with a larger number of particles a greater
expansion is necessary to produce this effect.
    Third, the e<U+FB01>ect of the size of the condensed particles. As has
been stated, a slight expansion produces a blue colour if the number
of particles be small, and if the expansion be increased after the blue
is .produced, the colour changes; and we shall now describe the
successive colours which appear as the degree of expansion is in
creased, that is, as the size of the water particles is increased. When
the expansion begins, blue is the <U+FB01>rst distinct colour to appear, but
very pale yellow and slightly reddish colours have been noticed
before the expansion was suf<U+FB01>cient to produce the blue.             These
reddish colours can be seen very distinctly when we use .an ex
cessively great number of particles, and they are best seen with
gas light.    These reddish colours imperceptibly change into blue as
the expansion is increased, and the blue in turn changes by minute
degrees into green with further expansion, and the green in turn
changes to yellow; then a brownish colour appears, which changes
to a somewhat mixed purple; then the blue returns again, to be fol
lowed by green and yellow, as the expansion is still further increased.
It is not easy to get this sequence of colours carried so far. Some
times one stroke of the pump only carries the colour on to yellow;
sometimes it may go to the second blue or green, but less frequently
to the second yellow.      The <U+FB01>nal colour depends on the number of
 particles present.   It is necessary to have a good many drops, so that
the colour may be distinct, and yet not too many, or the expansion
 may not be suf<U+FB01>cient to grow the particles large enough to give the
 second series of colours.    It is found that a high expansion, produced
 by two or more strokes of- the pump, does not give satisfactory
 results.
    We have seen that by increasing the number of dust particles the
 depth of colour was increased; it therefore seemed possible that these
 colour phenomena might be made visible in even a short column of
 air, and that they might be shown by means of ordinary glass <U+FB02>asks.
 The following experiment was, therefore, arranged :—-A <U+FB02>ask, about
 18 cm. diameter, was <U+FB01>tted with an india-rubber stopper, through
 which passed two tubes.         One tube was connected with the metal
 vacuum receiver already described, the other had a stopcock attached
 to it.   The stopcock was connected with a long metal pipe, which
 led to a wide tube placed over a small <U+FB02>ame. Air charged with the
  products of combustion was drawn into the <U+FB02>ask through this pipe;
  when suf<U+FB01>cient impure air was drawn into the <U+FB02>ask, the stopcock
                                                                          l

    1892.]            connected with Cloudy      Condensation.              431
   was closed;    when the air in the <U+FB02>ask was n0w suddenly expanded, it
   looked as if it had been <U+FB01>lled with a transparent blue gas. The colour,
   when held against a white cloud, was almost exactly the same as that
   of the blue sky.      The colour in the <U+FB02>ask faded rapidly, as in the
   experiments with the tube.        The particles being very closely packed
   in most  of  these  experiments, the subsequent change is all the more
  rapid.
                               Efect of  Temperature.
      To observe the e<U+FB01>ect of temperature on those colour phenomena,
  another tube was prepared, with glass ends, and jacketed, so that the
  air in it might be heated or cooled to any desired temperature. The
  result was very much what might have been expected : at the di<U+FB02>erent
  temperatures all the colours made their appearance in the usual order,
  but there was a considerable di<U+FB01>erence in the amount of expansion
  required to produce a given colour with change of temperature.
 At a high temperature each of the colours appeared with a less ex
 pansion than when the temperature was low. In making these tests
 the number of dust particles in the air must be kept as constant as
 possible.     For this purpose windows and doors should be kept closed
                             ’
 for some time before beginning, and the experiments should be
 repeated without change of conditions. When the air was cooled to
 about 35°, it took two strokes of the pump to develop a full blue, and
 three strokes made it only green.          At a temperature a little over 50°,
 two strokes made it green, while if the air was heated to about 80°,
 two strokes sent it past blue and green and on to yellow, and less than
 one stroke made it full blue.           These di<U+FB01>erences are due to more
 vapour being present and being condensed, with the same amount of
 expansion, when the air is hot than when it is cold.             It should be
 stated that in all cases the air was saturated, the inside of the tube
 being wet.
     The tube was also cooled down to 6° F., but no di<U+FB01>erence was
observed in the nature of the phenomena.             The particles at that tem
perature seemed to be still in the liquid form.
                                 Light  Transmitted.
     The light transmitted directly through        the cloudy condensation has
been     examined     by means   of a  small spectroscope.    One of the tubes
was mounted vertically, and a mirror placed at the lower end; the
spectroscope was temporarily mounted over the upper end of the tube ;
a small mirror was placed between the spectroscope and the glass end
of the tube. This small mirror covered half the <U+FB01>eld of the spectro
scope, and re<U+FB02>ected light from the same source as that re<U+FB02>ected by
the mirror at the lower end of the tube, so that one-halfrof the <U+FB01>eld
                                                                   2 G 2

gave'the spectrum of the light, and the other half the light after
passing through the cloudy condensation.         The conditions in the ex
periment are too <U+FB02>eeting for satisfactory observation.        The only thing
noticed was a darkening of the whole spectrum, with a greater ab
sorption at certain points than at others.       When the light was blue,
in addition to the general reduction       in  brightness, the red end was
more reduced than any other part, and there was also a very marked
shortening of the spectrum at this end. When the colour was yellow,
the reverse was the case. The blue was almost entirely cut out,
while the yellow was far the brightest part of the spectrum.
    An examination has also been made of the diffraction colours as
seen in the halos surrounding bright lights.            The most convenient
way tried of observing these colours was to use an ordinary glass
<U+FB02>ask of 18 cm. diameter, connected with the metal vacuum receiver,
as already described.      For the source of light gas may be used, but a
better    result is  obtained  with the light of the sky. In order to
observe these colours easily, the window should be closed, all but a
narrow vertical strip; and it improves matters to have all surfaces
on each side of the opening painted black.        When the air in the <U+FB02>ask
is expanded, the vertical bands of diffraction colours are distinctly
seen on each side of the bright light.     If now we keep the amount of
dust in the air constant during the experiments, we shall <U+FB01>nd, that on
opening the stopcock to the vacuum receiver very slowly, we will get
the usual cloudy condensation, and that the diifraction colours will
be quite distinct.       But if we repeat the experiment, and this time
 open   the  stopcock very suddenly, so as to cause a rapid expansion, the
 colours will be found to be very much improved, being far more
brilliant.     This is due partly to the greater number of particles en
 gaged in producing the e<U+FB02>’ect, but chie<U+FB02>y to the much more equal
 size of the particles when they are suddenly developed than when
 slowly grown.
    It is found that we must not have too many particles present, or
 the di<U+FB02>fraction colours will not be good; their size does not seem to be
 great enough to produce the phenomena.            If, for instance, in place
 of using the air of the room, we take into the <U+FB02>ask air coming from a.
 small <U+FB02>ame, the colour phenomena in the <U+FB02>ask all change : when there
 were few particles the light transmitted directly through them has
 so little colour it is not noticed, while the diffraction colours are
 <U+FB01>ne; but with many particles the direct light becomes coloured, while
 the diffraction colours are softened and have lost much of their bril
 liancy. When the particles are su<U+FB02>iciently numerous to cause the
 directly transmitted light to be of a thin blue, the diifraetion 9010111
 next the blue light is nearly the complementary yellow, and this yellow
 light extends to near the limits of the <U+FB02>ask. If more particles he
  added, the colour of the transmitted light becomes deeper blue, but it

   1892.]            connected with Cloudy Condensation.                433
  is dif<U+FB01>cult now to say what the diffraction colours are.      The convec
  tion currents in the <U+FB02>ask now make themselves visible; the air on
  each side of the blue direct light is suffused with a variety of colours,
  not now   in regular vertical bands, but  irregularly distributed  and in
  movement through the <U+FB02>ask.
                              Cause of the Colour.
     These   experiments show that the colour produced by the small
  drops of water depends      on the size of the drops, and the depth of
  colour on their number. But it is not so easy to follow the manner in
  which the drops produce the colour. If we take the simplest case, we
  can easily see how part at least of the colour is produced.        In the
 steam jet condensing dense, and colouring the transmitted light
 yellow, part of the effect is no doubt due to some of the particles in
 that form of condensation being so small that they re<U+FB02>ect and scatter
  the shorter waves of light, while they allow the longer ones to pass
 through.      The colour in this case is partly caused in the same way
 as the yellow produced by small particles suspended in liquids, as in
 Briicke’s experiment with mastic, or as when silver chloride is
 formed from a solution of the nitrate.         The light re<U+FB02>ected by the
 liquids in these experiments is of a bluish tint, complementary to the
 yellow light transmitted by them, and this blue light is polarised. It
 has been found that when the steam jet is of a good yellow by trans
 mitted light, it re<U+FB02>ects a good deal of a bluish light; and further,
 this blue light is polarised in the same way as the light from the
 small particles in the experiments with liquids.
    While this explanation helps us so far to understand the manner in
 which the yellow light is produced in steam jets, yet it fails to explain
the succession of colours seen in the expansion experiments, where
blue <U+FB01>rst appears, then green and yellow; and when the expansion is
 still further increased, the blue again returns to give place to a second
green and yellow.        The most probable explanation of these colour
phenomena       is that they are produced in the same way as the colours
in plates, somewhat after the manner Newton thought the colour of
the sky was produced.        The order of succession of the colours in thin
plates is the same as in these condensation phenomena.          As no white
follows the <U+FB01>rst blue, it seems probable that the <U+FB01>rst spectrum, or
order of colours, is not observed; that the two generally seen are
                                   ‘
the second and third.
    Some experiments were made with a glass tube receiver, in place of
the metal one, to see if there were any coloured light re<U+FB02>ected in these
expansion experiments of the same kind as is seen under certain con
ditions in the steam jet; but no such colours have been observed.         It
is possible they may be present; but, owing to the great amount of

  that may be present is masked.
                                    Green Sun.
     On a few occasions the sun has been observed to be of a decidedly
  greenish colour, while on other occasions it has appeared blue. The
  experiments which have been described in this paper seem to o<U+FB01>er an
  explanation of this phenomenon. For a number-0f days in the begin
  ning of September, 1883, the sun was seen of a decidedly blue or
  green colour in India, Trinidad, and other places.                   Most of the
  observers who have    written  on  the   subject   have   linked this phenomenon
  with the eruption of Krakatao, which took place just before the days
  on which the green or blue sun was seen.              From the light thrown on
‘
  the subject by these experiments, we see that an eruption, such as
  that of Krakatao, would throw into the atmosphere a supply of the
  very materials necessary for producing a green sun by means of small
   drops of water, as it would send into the atmosphere                 an immense
   quantity of aqueous vapour and an enormous amount of <U+FB01>ne dust—a
   combination the most favourable possible for producing a great
   number of minute drops of water.
      Professor C. Michie Smith observed the green sun in India, and he
           “ The main features of the
   says:                                      spectrum taken on the sun when
   green were—
      “ 1. A
              very strong general absorption in the red end.
      “2. A great development of the rain-bands and of all other lines
   that are ascribed to the presence of water-vapour in the atmo
                                                                    ‘
   sphere.”*
      It is evident, therefore, that one of the materials necessary for
   producing this peculiar absorption by means of water-drops was
   present in an unusual amount in the atmosphere at the time; and it
   also appears that a <U+FB01>ne form of condensation had taken place, as Mr.
   W. R. Manley states? that there was at the time a sort of haze all
   over the sky, and from the letters of di<U+FB01>erent observers this haze
   seems always to haVe accompanied the green sun.
      One almost wonders that a blue or green sun is not oftener seen,
   as there are often present all the materials necessary for producing
   these colours in the atmosphere.         On a few occasions      I have observed
   the sun to be of a silvery whiteness, when the vapour in the upper air
   was beginning to condense, and the sky was covered with a thin, <U+FB01>lmy
   cloud.    It is, however, possible that this slightly bluish tint may
   have been due to the sun being seen more in its natural colour than
    usual, that is, made much less yellow by our atmosphere than it gene

 rally is. There seems to be something preventing the dust and the}
 vapour in our atmosphere acting under ordinary conditions in such a
 way as to colour the sun blue or green. Perhaps it may be the tendency
 the particles have to diiferentiation.   This tendency, we have seen
 from the experiments, rapidly destroys all colour effects, and from
 this we might suppose it would be impossible that the colours, it
 produced by water drops, could remain in nature visible for so long a
 time as they did.    But it must be remembered that the particles in
 the experimental vessels are extremely close together, and the vapour
 exchanges can therefore take place quickly.     If, however, the drops
 were widely separated, the exchanges would take place slowly.        For
 instance, if the drops in 1 cm. were separated so as to form a column
 1 mile long, with a section of 1 sq. cm., we should have the same
 amount of colour in 17 miles that we had in the 17 cm. of air in the
<U+FB02>ask, and the particles would be so far apart that di<U+FB01>erentiation
would then take place extremely slowly.       But further, if the supply
 of dust and vapour were constantly kept up by the volcano, the
 colour phenomena would continue for the same reason that they
continue in a steam jet, namely, by the drops being constantly re
 newed.
       A  New Instrument for Testing the Amount of Dust in the  Air.  '
    As this investigation progressed it became evident that these colour
phenomena placed in our hands an easy and simple way of estimating,
in a. rough way, the number of dust particles in the atmosphere of
our rooms, which might be useful for sanitary purposes. An instru
ment was therefore constructed to see how far the idea could be
practically carried out. This new instrument we intend to call a
Koniseope.     In its present form this instrument consists of an air
pump and a metal tube with glass ends, which we shall call the test
tube.     The capacity of the pump should be from half to three-quarters
the capacity of the test-tube. Near one end of the test-tube is a
passage by which it communicates with the air-pump, and near the
other end is attached a stopcock for admitting the air to be tested.
The test-tube and air-pump may be attached parallel to each other,
and held vertically when observing. If this arrangement be adopted,
a mirror must be attached to the lower end of the tube.       In practice
it is found to be more convenient to omit the mirror, and observe
with the tube in any position, simply directing it to any suitable
light. When this arrangement is used, the pump, for convenience of
working, should be attached at right angles to the test-tube. It is
found that any want of uniformity in the colour of the <U+FB01>eld produced
by the air heated on the sides of the tube can be greatly obviated by
lining the inside of the tube with a non-conducting substance, and

keeping it wet. Blotting-paper is found to do very well, as it holds
plenty of water for saturating the air, and is a fair non-conductor.
When the inside of the tube is lined with it, the <U+FB01>eld of colour is
fairly uniform, owing to the cooling of the sides by the evaporation
when the air enters and when expansion is made.
    For illumination, no doubt day light is the best when it can be
obtained, as gas light is so de<U+FB01>cient in blue rays that colour is not
well observed.     For convenience of observation, it is found to be best
to close the far end of the tube with ground glass, and when working
with arti<U+FB01>cial light ground glass must be used.
  I  have made a few tests with an instrument of this kind, and <U+FB01>nd
it very easily worked; and for many practical purposes it is suf<U+FB01>
 ciently accurate.     It cannot, of course, compare with the dust
counter for accuracy; but, on the other hand, it is a much less expen
sive instrument, and tests can be made far more easily with it, and
little special knowledge is required. If we wish to get actual <U+FB01>gures
for the amounts of dust indicated by this instrument, then it must be
 graduated by a dust counter. The indications at best, however, will
 only be very rough approximations to the numbers.
    There are three ways in which we might graduate this instrument.
We might, for instance, make one full stroke of the pump, and note
 the colour which appeared.      This colour would indicate the number
 of particles.   For instance, if there are few particles, one stroke will
 make the light <U+FB01>rst blue, then green, then yellow, and then a second
 blue and green, and <U+FB01>nishing with yellow.       But if there are a good
 many particles present,     the  same  amount   of expansion will only
 make the <U+FB01>rst series of colours to appear, and if a great many
 particles are present, the one stroke will not give the whole of the
 <U+FB01>rst series of colours, but may stop at the blue.      If the temperature
 of the air were always the same, this method might be adopted, but,
  as we have seen, an allowance would be required to be made for tem
 perature, as with a high temperature the same degree of expansion
  carries the colour further up the series.
    Another method of graduating might be to note the amount of
  expansion necessary to give any particular colour, say to give the
  best blue.   With few particles a slight expansion gives the blue,
  while with many particles a much greater expansion is necessary.
  But here again the effect of temperature comes in. Temperature
  observations would therefore require to be taken, and a correction
  made which it might be dif<U+FB01>cult to carry out in practice.
     At present the best plan of graduating seems to be to note the
  depth of the blue produced, regardless of the amount of expansion
  required to give    it,and use only this quantity as an index.      With
  few particles the colour     pale, and as the particles increase in num
                              is
  ber the colour increases in depth.    Perhaps some addition might be

  1892.]            connected with Cloudy       Condensation.               437
  made to the instrument         for estimating more accurately the depth of
  colour  than can be done mentally.           This might be done either by
 means    of coloured glasses of different depths for comparison, or in
 some other way.
     A few comparative observations have been made with the koniscope
 and the dust counter in the impure air of a room.               While the num
 ber of particles was counted by means of the dust counter, the depth
 of blue given by the koniscope was noted.             A metal tube was <U+FB01>tted
 up vertically in the room in such a way that it could be raised to
 any desired height into the impure air near the ceiling so that sup
 plies of air of different degrees of impurity might be obtained.
 To produce the impurity, the gas was lit and kept burning during
 the experiments.        The air was drawn down through the pipe by
 means of the air-pump of the koniscope, and it passed through
 the measuring apparatus of the dust counter on its way to the koni
 scope.    The indications of the two instruments were taken, and are
 entered in the following table :—
               Dust Counter.                        Koniscope.
              Particles per 0.0.                 Depth of colour.
                     50,000                     Colour just visible.
                     80,000                     Very pale blue.
                   500,000       _              Pale blue.
                 1,500,000                      Fine blue.
                 2,500,000                      Deep blue.
                 4,000,000                      Very   deep blue.
    It is probable that the higher numbers         are too low, as the measure
of the dust counter has a capacity of only 10 c.mm.               With so small
a measure it is probable that a good many of the particles are lost.
    When making a sanitary inspection, the air outside, or wherever the
supply was drawn from, would be tested <U+FB01>rst, and the depth of colour
which it gave would be noted. Any increase from that depth would
indicate that the air was being polluted, and the amount of increase in
the depth of colour would indicate the amount of increase of pollution.
Slight colour can be traced though the number of particles be less than
80,000 per 0.0., but the colour is not very decided, the condensation
producing principally a darkening effect. It should be noted that
the above table refers to a koniscope with a test-tube 50 cm. long.
An instrument with a tube 1 metre long would be doubly sensitive,
and would show colour with fewer particles.
    It is thought that the koniscope will be useful for sanitary inspec
tors, for investigating questions of ventilation in rooms lighted with
gas, and for other purposes.          As an illustration of what this instru
ment can tell us, the following experiment may be given. It shows
us how we can trace by means of it the pollution taking place in our

438       Phenomena connected with Cloudy Condensation.          [Apr. 28,
rooms by open <U+FB02>ames.        The room in which the tests were made is
241 X 17 X 13 feet.      The object of the tests was to see if the koni
scope could tell us anything de<U+FB01>nite about the degree of pollution at
the different parts of the room, and also about the rate at which it
was increasing.     For this purpose a small tube was arranged so that
one end of it could be raised to the ceiling, or into the air of any part
of the room from which it was desired to take the air ; the other end
of the tube was connected with the koniscope.
    The <U+FB01>rst thing to be done was to examine the air of the room
before lighting the gas and beginning the tests.       On doing this the
air at the level of the observer gave a very faint colour, scarcely per
ceptible; air drawn from within 3 inches of the ceiling gave equally
little colour, and the air inside the room gave the same colour as the
air outside. The upper end of the tube connected with the koniscope
was then raised to within 3 inches of the ceiling, near one end of the
room, and the koniscope left attached to the lower end; three jets of
gas were now lit in the centre of the room, and observations at once
begun with the koniscope. Within thirty-<U+FB01>ve seconds of striking the
match to light the gas the products of combustion had extended to the
end of the room; this was indicated by the colour in the koniscope
suddenly becoming of a deep blue.        In four minutes the deep blue
producing    air was got at  a distance of 2 feet from the ceiling. In ten
 minutes there was strong evidence of the pollution all through the
 room. It was strongly indicated near the windows, owing to the down
 current of cold air on the glass.    This impure down current could be
 traced to the <U+FB02>oor, and onwards to the <U+FB01>replace; while a pure current
 could be traced from the door to the <U+FB01>replace.      In thirty minutes the
 impurity at 9 feet from the <U+FB02>oor was very great, the colour being a
 deep blue.
    The wide range of the indications of the koniscope, from pure
 white to nearly black-blue, makes the estimates of the impurity very
 easily taken with it ; and, as there are few parts to get out of order,
 it is hoped it may come into general use for sanitary work.
    The few experiments      I  have made with this instrument have
 clearly pointed out that a window is not an unalloyed blessing as
 regards the purity of the air in our rooms, however much we may
 have been in the habit of thinking otherwise. In all cases it has been
 found that in rooms where gas is burning the air near the window is
  very impure. This impure down current of air near the window has
 been traced by the koniscope in all rooms tested.         The impurity is
 caused by the cold air on the window sinking, and drawing down the
 impure air near the ceiling, and this impure air is mixed with the lower
  air which we are breathing. This e<U+FB01>ect is, of course, greatest when
  the windows are unprotected by blinds, shutters, or curtains.        It is
  evident that though a window may supply pure air when it is open,

it yet does much harm when closed, by bringing down the impure air,
which, if undisturbed, would have a less injurious e<U+FB02>'ect.
    It is to be regretted that this investigation does not promise to
yield much of practical value ; nevertheless, as we cultivate not only
fruits but <U+FB02>owers, so, for the same reason that we cultivate the latter,
it is thought that these experiments will /repay the attention of
physicists. The colours produced by such simple materials as a little
dust and a little vapour are as beautiful as anything seen in nature,
and well repay the trouble of reproducing them.

    In this paper    the results of observations made by exposing platino
 type    paper  are recorded,     and it is shown that the total intensity
of light as thus registered is the same as if observations had been
made on a ray of X4240 alone.                  The observations were made
at altitudes varying from sea-level              to 12,000 feet, in di<U+FB01>erent
countries, at different times of the year, and during four to <U+FB01>ve years.
The instrument in which the exposures were made is described, as
also the method of deriving the intensity of light from the developed
prints. The results of these observations agree closely with those
obtained by the measures of the spectrum which was described in
Part I of this subject. The value of k in the formula (1) I' = e'kk‘l
(from which can be calculated the loss of intensity of a ray of any
particular wave-length) was found to be 000146 at sea-level.                 It
was also found that It apparently varied as h’, h being the baro
metric pressure.       A table is attached, showing the value of the trans
mitted light in the formula (2) l' = Ia’, where a is a constant and
a: the air thickness in terms of the vertical thickness, In being the
formula 1' = 16"“, from which (1) and (2) are both shown to be
derived.

          By WILLIAM ELLIS, F.R.A.S., Superintendent of the Mag
          netical and Meteorological Department, Royal Observatory,
          Greenwich. Communicated by W. H. M. CHRISTIE, F.R.S.,
          Astronomer Royal. Received April 7, 1892.
                                  (Abstract.)
       In this paper the author refers to the ordinary variations of the
   magnetic elements as observed at Greenwich; the annual progressive
   change; the diurnal variation—large in summer, small in winter,
   and also larger when sun spots are numerous and smaller when sun
   spots are few; the irregular magnetic disturbances and magnetic
   storms, and the accompanying earth currents; phenomena which are
   generally similar at other places.
       He then invites attention more particularly to magnetic disturb
   ances. Those at Greenwich may, after a calm period, arise gradu
  ally, or commence with great suddenuess.      When sudden, the move
  ment is simultaneous in all elements. The <U+FB01>rst indication may be
  a sharp, premonitory, simultaneous movement, followed after a time
  by general disturbance, or the movement may at once usher in the
  disturbance.     These initial movements are not always great in magni
  tude, sometimes, indeed, small, but they have a very de<U+FB01>nite charac
  ter, and frequently occur nearly instantaneously, as is shown by the
 character of the photographic traces.
      It has been long known that magnetic disturbances occur at the
 same time over wide areas of the earth’s surface, but the accidental
 comparison in past years of the times of commencement of one or
 two disturbances at Greenwich with the times at other places has led
 the author to suppose that the coincidence in time is much closer
than had been before supposed, and the de<U+FB01>nite, and on occasions
 isolated, character of the initial movement induced him to undertake
 the collection and comparison of the times of such movements for a
 number of days at observatories geographically widely separated.
     The times of such movements cannot be caught by eye observation
without continuous watching of the magnets, so that the photo
graphic registers have to be relied upon, which is better, excepting
that the scale of time is necessarily contracted ; but, though in indi
vidual measures there might be variations, it was conceived that
(supposing no systematic error to exist) the mean of a number of com
parisons should give a good result. Seventeen days occurring in the
years 1882 to 1889 were selected for comparison, the observatories
                                                             2 H 2

446        Mizgnetie lhriatiom, illagnetic Disturbances,  @‘0.  [May  5,
being those of Toronto, Greenwich, Pawlowsk, Mauritius, Bombay,
Batavia, Zi-ka-wei, and Melbourne, and, for a less number of days,
Cape Horn (as obtained from the Mission Scienti<U+FB01>que du Cap Horn,
1882—83).     It was desired to have times for Pola, but it was found
that photographic registers during great part of the period did not
exist. The variation in time at each place from the mean of times
for all places is given for each day.      The mean deviation at the
different places varies from +24 minutes to —2'9 minutes, the
agreement between four of the places, Greenwich, Pawlowsk, Mauri
tius, and Bombay, being very much closer, the mean values of devia
 tion for Greenwich, Pawlowsk, and Bombay di<U+FB01>ering, indeed, by only
 0'1 minute, equivalent to 6 seconds.
     The question arises, Are the differences real, or due (considering
 the contracted time scale) to accidental error ?   If the magnetic im
pulse is really simultaneous over the whole earth, it is a striking
physical fact, and if not entirely so, the circumstance is no less
interesting ; but greater attention to accuracy of time scale, or a more
 extended scale, may be necessary before the point in question can be
 de<U+FB01>nitely settled.
    A table is added, showing the character of the magnetic movement
 at the several observatories, from which it appears that at any one
 place the movements on diiferent days were in most cases similar,
 though different at di<U+FB01>erent places, indicating on these occasions the
 occurrence usually of one general type of disturbance.
     Reference is made to the question of earth currents. A comparison
 for thirty-one days, between 1880 and 1891, of cases of sudden mag
 netic movement and earth current, shows the earth current to pre
 cede the magnetic movement by 0'14 minute, equivalent to 8 seconds.
 The question of the relation between magnetic movements and earth
 currents is discussed.
     The desirability of being able temporarily to obtain, when occasion
 requires, a more extended time scale for all magnetical and meteoro
 logical phenomena is pointed out.
     The general result is that in the de<U+FB01>nite magnetic movements pre
 ceding disturbance the magnets at any one place are simultaneously
 a<U+FB01>ected; also that in places widely diiferent in geographical position
 the times are simultaneous, or nearly so, a small constant di<U+FB02>'erence
 existing at some places which may be real or may be accidental, but
 the character of which it seems desirable to determine. It is shown
  also that at Greenwich de<U+FB01>nite magnetic movements are accompanied
 by earth current movements which are simultaneous, but that neither
  magnetic irregularities nor ordinary magnetic variations seem to
  admit of explanation on the supposition of being produced by the
  direct action of earth currents

   which   was  published in the       Proceedings of the Royal Society
   (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ 1890, vol. 47, pp. 180—186).
      In the present paper he discusses, in much detail, the effects of the
  cooling of large masses of the alloys gold-platinum, gold-palladium,
  platinum-palladium, platinum-rhodium, and gold-aluminium.
      The details of manipulation, which were of considerable di<U+FB02>iculty,
  are set forth in detail, as they involved melting masses of metal with
  high melting points.
      The author regrets that time has not enabled him to examine more
  members of each particular series of alloys, so as to present results
  in fuller detail : in fact, the silver-copper series is the only one upon
  which anything like exhaustive work has been done.
      No doubt, in every series of alloys there is one de<U+FB01>nite alloy which
  would yield a uniform mass on cooling, and it is known that in the
  silver-copper series this alloy (Levol’s) contains 718 parts of silver
  per thousand.      It is not certain, however, that this is the eutectic
  alloy of the series—that is, the one with the lowest melting point—
  but it is well known that when silver-copper alloys which contain
  more silver than 718 parts per thousand are cooled, the centre of the
 solidi<U+FB01>ed mass is richer than the exterior. This is the case with
 standard silver, for instance, which contains 925 parts of silver per
 thousand, and it is safe to conclude that an alloy rich in copper is the
 <U+FB01>rst to fall out from the mass, and that this alloy sets round the
 inner surface of the mould, driving a still <U+FB02>uid alloy, rich in silver,
 to the centre.     The general rule in the present results seems to be
 that, in the cooling of a <U+FB02>uid mass of two united metals an alloy rich-in
 the more fusible constituents of the mass falls out <U+FB01>rst, driving the less
fusible constituent to the centre. The gold-platinum alloys (A, B, C, D,
 and E) seem to be always rich in gold externally.
     It is remarkable that the metals of the platinum group do not
show much liquation among themselves, but, on the other hand, when
gold is united to members of the platinum group, there is evidence
of liquation.                                   I
     The gold-palladium one          follows the above rule.
     There is evidence that the alloy E, containing 750 parts of platinum
and 250 of gold, is near the composition of a true compound, as it
 shows but little sign of liquation, and is, moreover, hard and brittle,

differing materially from the rest of the series. The purple alloy of
gold and aluminium M, AuAlg, is almost certainly a true chemical
compound, the solidi<U+FB01>ed mass being as nearly uniform in composition
as may be. The uniformity of the alloy (J) of platinum with 10 per
cent. of rhodium is of much interest, in view of the important part
which the alloy is playing in pyrometric work.
   Conducting the experiments, the results of which are embodied in
the present paper, has been very laborious, and although, as already
stated, no complete series of the alloys of any two metals has been
examined, quite suf<U+FB01>cient data have been collected to afford valuable
guidance to the metallurgist, who will now know what behaviour
may be expected from the other members of the groups of the alloys
in question. The gold-platinum series of alloys are of industrial im
portance, as native gold is so often associated with platinum, and it
is somewhat surprising to <U+FB01>nd 'that assays made on pieces of metal
cut from the exterior of an ingot cannot be trusted to represent the
composition of the mass.    The aim of the investigation has been to
show, that notwithstanding the great dif<U+FB01>culty which attends the
preparation of alloys of metals with very high melting points, it is
possible to elicit from them the same kind of information which has
proved to be so useful in the case of the more ordinary and tractable
alloys.

   modulus: that is, that there are numbers whose successive powers
   have for  their rests the complete set of numbers less than, and prime
   to, the modulus.     A primitive root may be said to generate by its
   successive powers   the  complete set of rests.     It is also known that in
   general, when the modulus is any composite number, though primitive
  roots do not exist, there may be laid down a set of numbers, which
  will here be called generators, the products of powers of which give
  the complete set of rests prime to the modulus.
                                       I
      The principal object of Part is to investigate the' relations which
  must subsist among any such set of generators; to determine the
  most general form that they can take; to show how to form any such
  set of generators, and, conversely, to furnish tests for the ef<U+FB01>ciency,
  as generators, of any given set of numbers.              Other results which
  are obtained as instrumental in effecting these objects, such as the
  determination of the number of numbers that belong to any exponent,
  may also possess independent interest.
     The object of Part     II is to make, for complex numbers, an investi
  gation   which  shall  be  as  nearly as possible parallel to that of Part 1
 for real numbers. Much of the work of Part            I may be applied imme
 diately to complex numbers; of the rest some will need slight modi<U+FB01>
 cation, and some will need replacing by propositions leading to corre
 sponding results. Of those cases which thus call for independent
 treatment, the most noticeable is that of the modulus (1+i))~, which
 is the complex analogue of the real modulus 2*.
     The work is put in the form of a series of propositions, and is
 started almost from <U+FB01>rst principles.        The early part is consequently
 elementary, but the advantages of completeness and ease of reference
 may be more than su<U+FB02>icient to compensate for this. A large number
of illustrative examples are given. These will sometimes, perhaps,
assist in elucidating the symbolical proofs which they follow: in all
cases they will help to maintain clearly the actual arithmetical mean
ing of the results arrived at, a meaning which may easily seem obscure
if it be noticed only in its symbolical and generalised form.
    The Appendix contains tables of indices for complex numbers for
all moduli whose norms do not exceed 100.

     If the law connecting A and I is known, it is possible to calculate I
                                           I
  from (1), and then substituting for in each of the circuit equations,
 each of the currents is known.
     Instead of e,- being the electromotive force in a complete circuit, it
  may be the potential difference maintained at the terminals of a
  circuit and the letter V,- will then be used, the resistance between the
 terminals being R;. If e,- or V; has any value, the circuit is called a
 primary circuit.       When no independent electromotive force is main
 tained in a. circuit, it is called a secondary circuit.
     II. Substitution of one coil for two or more :—-It is evident from
 the way in which (1) is derived, that instead of a primary coil
  (V1, N1, R,) and a secondary (N2, 13,), if we substitute a primary
  (V,, n,, r1) and if nl/rl = NJR, and also if nl’l'rl = N1’/R,+N¢2/R2,
 then the currents in all the other coils will be the same as before.
 We can therefore replace a primary and any group of secondaries
 by one primary coil.
     It is also evident that if any group of secondaries (Np, R,),
 (Nt, Rt), &c., be replaced by one secondary (n), r.) such that nJ/r, =
 Np'/Rp+Nf/R¢+&c., all the other currents will remain as before. It
 is, in fact, evident that if for groups of primaries and secondaries we
substitute one primary coil of suitable potential difference at its
terminals and resistance and number of turns, all the currents in the
remaining coils will remain the same.
    If two secondaries of numbers of turns Np and Ni and internal
 resistances r], and r, have the same terminals, and together supply a
current to an outside circuit, for them we may substitute one second
ary of n turns and internal resistance r ohms with a permanent short
circuit of resistance p between its terminals, if
                     1" = (NP2/T1+Nt2/TP)/ (Np'rt‘l'Ntrp):
                      r = r,,n(N,,’r¢+Nfrp)/ (an+Np-,,)2,
and                  l’ = (ern‘l'NtszN (Np—N1?
    Hence no good results can be expected from compound winding.
If, instead of requiring a perfect similarity in all respects, we desire
a substitution which is almost absolutely perfect in practical cases,
we can obtain it by the use of a single coil with no short circuit
outside, and therefore without the excessive waste of power which
occurs when two coils of di<U+FB01>erent numbers of turns are compounded.
This last result is obtained by regarding A as a negligible term
in
    Two coils in parallel to one another, used as a primary or second
ary, will evidently waste energy in idle currents inside the trans
former unless they are exactly equal in their numbers of turns.
    III. If condensers are connected with any of the circuits the

  most general case is this :——Take the internal resistance of the sth
  coil to be rs; let it have a condenser outside of capacity K, in series
 with a resistance p,” and let there be a resistance    in parallel with                   p,’
 p," and the condenser.   Then, in the general expression, instead of R,
 we must use
                              7';   +   (PJIPSUKJQ     + /)s’)/{ (Pa,       +Pa”)K:0 +     1
     Having found C,” we must remember that the part passing through

 be magnetic leakage), we must use instead of r the expression r+10.
 Our formulae, in case there      magnetic leakage, in case there

with which engineers deal are periodic functions, and the evanescent
parts of the answers may be left out of consideration.       As any

   Hence the most complicated cases are readily worked out when
numerical examples are taken. Engineers are in the habit of speak
ing of the epoch m as a lead when    positive, and as a lag when it     is                                        it
is negative.   The reciprocal of the periodic time        called the                                 is

    2. If the curve is not a straight line, that is, if there is some in
dication of saturation, and there generally is some saturation where
,8 the induction      per square centimetre exceeds 2 X 10"“ (or 2000
C.G.S. units), it will be found that a good approximation to
actual facts is obtained by assuming that when            = L, sin m, A =       I
Ao(sin m—b sin 3w+m sin 500+ &c.) where Io/Ao = 0', a constant, and n
is any quantity which increases continuously.        Thus it will be found
that taking only one harmonic, b = 0'2 gives a close approximation to
what may be the actual case in transformer problems.          Taking two
harmonics, b = 0'2 and 'm = 0'05, gives a better result.      There is no
hysteresis in such cases.
    3. If the curve is a simple hysteresis loop such as may be obtained
in slowly-performed cyclic magnetisation, on the assumption that
I  = L, sin :10, one of my students, Mr. Fowler, has found A in terms of
sin (a:+ e1), sin (2.2+e2), &c., a rather complicated expression which I
need not give. But another student, Mr. Field, <U+FB01>nds that the ap

 given above, it is obvious that for all practical purposes, certainly in
 the case where it is the e<U+FB01>ective value of V1, which is important, the
 above expression for V1 is the same as if f, b, and m were zero. No
 doubt V1 does possess small traces of the higher                               harmonics, but

   most complex law of magnetisation which                         I
                                                    could formulate which

  same result :—Given the voltage V, at the terminals of a primary
  coil of a transformer with many secondary coils, the induction and
  the secondary currents may be calculated from 2 and 3, which were
  worked out on the assumption of constant permeability, and in all
 cases the error in the effective values is exceedingly small.
    V. Magnetic Leakage.——If all the induction due to the current in
  any coil does not thread through all the other coils, the effect of
 leakage is obtained by assuming that each N is really less than the
  number of turns, and that there is some self-induction in each circuit
 in addition to N20. If the additional inductances are           &c., then,     1.,   l2,

    VI. Eddy Currentsi—There is eddy current loss of power in all
the conducting masses near a transformer.                  If we assume that the
induction per square centimetre B is the same everywhere, and if it
follows the law B (in C.G.S. units) = 2a; sin (ikH-ei), the average
power in watts wasted in eddy currents in the iron per cubic centi
metre is 6'25X10"‘3r’k22i’a2;, if the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the iron is
taken to be 10‘. The iron is supposed to be of wire of radius r
centimetres.
    The average power wasted in the iron is less at high temperatures,
being inversely proportional to the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the iron. It is
evidently proportional to the square of the effective primary voltage
in the unloaded transformer, but, of course, magnetic leakage causes
a diminution when the transformer is loaded.                       In fact, the eddy
current loss is always proportional to the square of the effective
electromotive force in the secondary circuit.                In applying the rule,
it is to be remembered that the induction is not uniform in the
section of a wire, nor is the average induction in each wire the same
for all the wires, and therefore the real loss of power in the iron by
 eddy currents is always greater than the result of applying the above
 formula<U+FB01>" If we assume that one secondary circuit closed upon itself
 represents all the eddy current circuits, assuming the truth of the
 above formula is the same as assuming no magnetic leakage between
 the primary and this eddy current circuit.                     Assuming magnetic
 leakage gives the more correct result, which is practically that the
 magnetisation is greater in wires near the surface of the mass of iron
 than it is internally, and also that the induction is greater near the
  skin of each wire. _
    * [Added April 29, 1892.—-I have often urged the importance of the consideration
_of the want of uniformity of induction in the iron ; but even in February last, when
  I brought it before a meeting of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, it was
 looked upon as unimpcitant, and     I had made no calculations which would enable
 me to prove its importance.    The calculations of Prof. J. J. Thomson concerning the
                                                ‘                ’
  eddy currents in thin plates, published in The Electrician of April 8, 1892, place
  the matter beyond doubt.]

      Such experiments as have hitherto been made do not enable us to
   say to what extent the eddy current loss is increased by this cause.
   In the above-mentioned 1500-watt transformer there is 10 per cent.
   less eddy current waste at full load than at no load, because of the
   change in 92 and also because of magnetic leakage, and there may be
   50 per cent. less eddy current waste due to the higher temperature of
   the iron.
      VII. Unloaded Transformer.—When there is a fair load on the
   transformer, the primary current may be calculated on the assump
   tion that the permeability is constant, without much error. But when
   there is no load, or small load, on the transformer it is necessary to
   know the law connecting A and I.            Everybody who has studied this
   subject takes A in an unloaded transformer as being N101.                     Now, in
   reality, this is an assumption that there are absolutely no eddy currents;
   but as there are always eddy currents, however <U+FB01>nely the iron may be
   divided, and even small eddy currents produce great effects upon 01,
   the magnetic law which has been deduced from experiments on this
   assumption must be quite untrue. Taking eddy currents effect as
   represented by a circuit (n, r) with no magnetic leakage; taking as
   our magnetic law that, when         I  = ga sin x,
                         A =   g(sinx——b sin     32: +111. sin <U+FB01>re),
   if V is   a simple sine function of the time,         I is  so also  with very great
   accuracy, but not perfect accuracy.                                I
                                                 Assuming that is a simple sine
   function, the neglected terms in V may be calculated ; this serves no
   useful purpose, so far as    I  can see at present, as they are so insigni<U+FB01>
   cant.    The only problem of importance is really the calculation of 0,,
   assuming that with great, but not perfect, accuracy V has the value
   V0 sin kt.    Our equations are V = R101+N10I and O = rc+n01, and
   hence N1Vl/R1 = A+g01, where A = N101+no and q = le/R,+n2/r.
   Now nz/r is negligible in comparison with Nla/Rl in transformers, and
   we may take q = NR/Rq.           Hence ——I = (Va/N170) cos kt- very nearly,
   and if e = n’ak/r, being called the eddy current effect,                  f being the
   hysteresis   term,

      We    see  that the effect of eddy currents without hysteresis is to
   increase the amplitude of the fundamental term in 0,, and to produce

    Probably, in transformers there are always traces of the term in
 3M and the higher harmonics in both V and I, but they certainly
 must exist in either V or I, whether the transformer is loaded or
 unloaded.       In the loaded transformer, magnetic leakage causes con
 siderable diminution in the higher harmonics of I, and this may
 increase     them   in V.
     It  seems that in a choking coil     with a <U+FB01>nely-divided iron core, we
 have     found  what    has  been  long  looked   for, a method of increasing
 frequency by mere magnetic means.               A condenser shunting a non
 inductive part of the circuit would receive currents in which the
 higher harmonics would be greatly magni<U+FB01>ed in importance. To
 show the magnitude of the terms in (4)             I will take the above-men
 tioned     lSOO-watt   transformer,   in which   go  =  7783.           f

 no hysteresis, the power         wasted  in eddy currents being nzVoz/Z er’,
 let this be 40 watts; then nzlr = 2'1168 when V = 2828. The eddy
  current coil therefore which would replace all the eddy current
  circuits is a coil of two turns whose resistance is about 1'9 ohms,
  short circuited on itself.

  I  have taken I) = 0'2 and m = 0'05.
      The primary potential difference V is never a simple sine function of
  the time.       Besides the important term in sin kt there are small terms
  of higher frequency, and at least one term of lower frequency equal
  to the number of turns of the armature per second.            The tendency of
  the forces acting on coils in series on an armature is to produce
  greater dissonance at greater loads, but it may be assumed that in
  good machines the fastenings are sufficiently rigid, and the coils
  and pole pieces so nearly alike, that there is always very little dis
   sonance.
       The primary potential difference,       instead of being   2828  sin 600i in
   the above case, may be

importance of the most important term in practically estimating the
volts,    now greater than what
         is                             usually taken to be the greatest

leakage will not much a<U+FB01>cct this condition of things, but              will         it
greatly  diminish the importance    of the higher   harmonics.
   When experimenters say that they keep the primary volts constant,
they mean that they keep the e<U+FB01>ective primary volts constant.         It                  is
obvious from the above considerations that different methods of
keeping effective volts constant will produce very di<U+FB01>erent kinds of
induction.   The e<U+FB01>ects produced by an exciting current in a choking
coil or unloaded transformer are evidently very complicated. Let the
dynamo have a perfectly pure simple harmonic law of electromotive

      of Ordinary Fellows elected into the Royal Society to
      Fifteen in each Year on the eventual total Number of
      Fellows.”   By Lieut.-General R. STRAOHEY, R.E., F.R.S.
      Received April         13, 1892.
   The discussions that arose in connection with the revision of the
 Statutes of the Royal Society during the years 1890 and 1891, led
 me to endeavour to obtain de<U+FB01>nite data on which to found a trust

    The Anniversary of the Society being <U+FB01>xed for the 30th November
in each year, the customary record of the number of Fellows for any
year refers to the number on that date.      I  have throughout regarded
the date to which this number applies as being the let January of the
following year.
    The annual election of Ordinary Fellows usually takes place in the
<U+FB01>rst or second week of June in each year.           I have considered the
date to be the 1st January of the same year.
    The lapses, whether from death or other causes, have been treated
as having occurred at the end of the calendar year in which they take
                  '
place.
    These assumptions have been made to simplify the various com_
putations that the investigation required (which have been suf<U+FB01>ciently
troublesome as it is), and owing to the considerable period dealt with,
                                           I
forty-three years, the results will not, believe, be sensibly affected
thereby.
   Unless it is otherwise speci<U+FB01>cally stated, the numbers refer ex
clusively to the Ordinary Fellows, elected at the regular Annual
Meetings <U+FB01>xed for the purpose.
    So far as  I have been able to ascertain (for the earlier records in
many particulars are defective), the number of Ordinary Fellows
elected since 1848 has been 15 in each year, except on four occasions;
in two years the number having been 14, and in two years 16; the
average, therefore, is 15 yearly.
    During the period since 1848, the number of Royal and Honorary
 Fellows has been about 5, and the Foreign Members about 50; these
 are included in the total number of Fellows shown in the Annual
 Reports of the Council, but will not be further considered in what
follows.                               I
    The rules under which certain privileged classes have been ad
 mitted as Fellows, in addition to the Ordinary Fellows, have varied
 somewhat since 1848, but at present, apart from the persons eligible
 for the classes of Fellows above excluded, the only persons so privi
 leged are Privy Councillors.    The total number of Privileged Fellows
 elected since 1848 seems to have been 75, which for 43 years gives an
average of 1'75 per annum.
    Table  I  contains a summary of the available data relating to the
total number of Fellows since 184.8.
    The total number, excluding Royal, Honorary, and Foreign Fellows,
 at the commencement of 1848 was 768.          I  am not able to say how
 many   of  these   were Fellows elected in the ordinary way, and how

1892.]        of Number of Fellows     elected into the Society.       465
many were privileged, but this has no importance for my present
object. From 1860 onwards the distinction between the three classes,
those elected before 1848, Privileged Fellows, and Ordinary Fellows,
                                                              '
is exhibited.
    At the end of 1890, the total number of Fellows, excluding the
Royal, Honorary, and Foreign Classes, was 463; of whom 26 were
Fellows elected before 1848; 36 were Privileged Fellows elected since
1848; and 401 Ordinary Fellows elected since 1848.
    Hence it appears that the reduction of number of Fellows, of the
three classes last referred to, has been 305, and as the number of
admissions of the Privileged class has not been very materially
affected by the changes in the rules relating to them, it follows that
virtually the whole of this large reduction is a consequence of the
restriction, to 15, of the number of Ordinary Fellows elected
yearly.
    As the ages of the 768 Fellows who constituted the bulk of the
Society in 1848 are not known, and as the conditions of election
before that year differed materially from what they have been since,
no very useful conclusions can be drawn from the rate of their dimi
nution since 1848.
    Assuming, however, that the number of Privileged Fellows in 1848
was, as is probable, about 50, there would remain 718 Ordinary
Fellows, of whom in 43 years 692 lapsed, or at an average yearly
rate of 2'24 per cent., that is rather more than 16 a year.      This rate,
as  I shall show subsequently, does not differ greatly from that which
has prevailed among the Ordinary Fellows elected since 1848, and it
may therefore be presumed that the average age of the Fellows in that
year did not differ greatly from the average age since.
    Table  II gives, as far as available data admit, the ages at the time
 of election of all Fellows elected since 1848; and shows the number
of years they severally survived, the average age at election, the
number and average age of those who were alive in 1891, and the
greatest and least ages of Fellows elected in each year.
    From this table it will be seen that there has been a gradual small
 increase in .the age at election; the average for the <U+FB01>rst 10 years
 having been 422; for the second 10 years, 430; for the third 10
years, 448; and for the last 13 years, 452.
    The accuracy of these conclusions may be somewhat affected by
 the greater number of unknown ages in the earlier years, the age
 when unknown, having been taken at the average of the group of
 years in which the election took place.
    The least age at which any Fellow has been elected is 24, one such
 case being recorded.       The average minimum at any election is
 slightly under 30, and the average maximum is rather over 63, one
 election at an age of 87 is recorded, and several above 70.

 466     Lieut.-Gen.   Strachey.      E<U+FB01>ect of  the Limitation   [May   12,.
   The oldest survivor of the Fellows elected since 1848, who alone
are dealt with in this table, was 86 years of age in 1891.
   The average age at election was 439, and the average age of all.
the Fellows in 1891 was 58'4.
   Table   III records the numbers of Ordinary Fellows elected in each
year,  and  remaining alive in each year after election, until 1891.
   From this it will be seen that during the last ten years the
numbers have increased by 46; in the previous ten years the increase
was 68, or 22 more ; and in the ten years still earlier the increase was
 111, or 43 more than the last.     If the decrease of growth for the ten
years   after  1890, takes  place  in  a similar ratio to that which took
place between 1870—80 and 1880—90, we might anticipate an in
crease of only 11 up to 1,900, or probably a smaller number.
   In order to obtain a satisfactory comparison between the lives of
the Fellows, and those of the general population as shown in the
accepted life tables,  I  have calculated, from the known ages of the
Fellows at election, and the known dates of the deaths that have
occurred among them, the average age of the Fellows remaining alive
in each year. From these ages         I  have computed, from Dr. Farr’s
tables, the probable number of Fellows that would survive from year
to year, assuming the initial number to be 15.
   From Table III, above referred to, have been ascertained, the
number of Fellows surviving in each successive year after election,
and thence has been obtained the average number surviving from an
initial number 15.
   The results of these computations will be found in Table IV.
   The second column in this table shows the number of lives dealt
 with for each year after election. The <U+FB01>rst entry 645, is the total
number of Fellows elected in the whole 4.3 years. The next column
to the right gives their aggregate ages, and the next their average
 age 449, in their <U+FB01>rst year.     Following the same line to the right, we
<U+FB01>nd the average number of Fellows elected, and in their <U+FB01>rst year.
   Passing to the second line of the table, 619, immediately below
645, is the total number of Fellows remaining in their second year
from the elections of 42 years; this is succeeded, in the columns to
the right, by their aggregate ages in their second year, and their
average age, and the average number in their second year, out of 15,
the average number elected.
   The third line gives the same data for the third year of Fellow
ship, and so on throughout, the last line but one showing that in
their 42nd year there remained 6 Fellows from the elections of 2 years,
with an aggregate age of 4144 years, and an average age of 74‘0; the
average number surviving in their 42nd year, out of the 15 elected,
being 3.
   The sixth column of the table gives the successive sums of the

  1892.]      of N'umber of Fellows   elected into the Society.        467
 numbers in the <U+FB01>fth column, and therefore indicates the aggregate
 number of Fellows that will, on the average, be surviving in each
 successive year of Fellowship,      the number elected in each year
                                                                    '
 being always supposed to be 15.
    It will be seen that the total for the 43rd year is 3970, whereas
 the actual number surviving, shown in column XI, is 401.             This
 difference  is of  course due  to the  number    397, representing   what
 the result would be if the average rates of election and decrease
 prevailed, instead of the actual rates for the separate years ; and it is
 probably suf<U+FB01>ciently accounted for by the fact already pointed out, of'
 the gradually increasing age at election in the later years, which will
 lead to the lives in the earlier years of the series being somewhat
 better than the average.     Column XI shows the actual results for
 successive years corresponding to the average          results given in
 column VI. The diiferences will be seen to be somewhat irregular,
 but nowhere to be of importance.
    Column VII gives the aggregate ages of the numbers surviving in
 successive years, as shown in column V, and from it is deduced the
average age of the whole number of Fellows shown in column VI,
397, which is seen to be 577 years, a result di<U+FB02>r'ering slightly from
that obtained from the actual ages of the Fellows surviving in 1891,
which was shown to be 584. The cause of this difference has already
been indicated.
    Columns VIII and IX supply the results that would be obtained
 by applying to an initial number of 15, the rates of mortality in Dr.
Farr’s tables, for the ages in successive years given in column IV.
 Column X contains the ratio of column VI to column IX, and indi
cates that throughout the whole period of 43 years the actual results
are somewhat better than the tabular results, or that the lives of the
Fellows are better than the ordinary lives, and that this advantage
leads in the 43rd year to the actual number of survivors being rather
more than 5 per cent. in excess of that which would be given ,by the
life tables, or of about 20 on a total of 400.
   An examination of this table will show that with the exception of
the last six or eight years, in which the number of lives dealt with at
last becomes very small, the <U+FB01>gures indicate a very regular and con
sistent progression, and it will practically be quite safe to assume
that the series in column VI may be extended on the basis of the
ordinary life tables, subject to the addition of 5 per cent. on the total
amounts obtained from these last.
   Hence it will be found that in 10 years after 1891 the aggregate
number of Fellows is not at all likely to be increased by more than
15, that the <U+FB01>nal result may be as little as 410, but is not likely to be
more than 420, or at the outside 425.

    In an earlier part of this paper mentioned that the rate of decrease
of the Ordinary Fellows elected before 1848 did not appear to differ
materially from that which has prevailed subsequently.
    Taking the number of Ordinary Fellows elected before 1848, and
then alive, at 718, it will be found that in 12 years (1860) the num
ber was reduced to 422, which is about 60 per cent. of the original
number; after 24 years (1872) the number fell to 206, which is
about 30 per cent. of the original; and in 36 years (1884) there
remained only 65, which is about 9 per cent. of the <U+FB01>rst number.
    Assuming that the average age of the 718 Fellows elected before
1848, and then alive, was not materially di<U+FB02>erent from the average
age (58) of the Fellows elected after 1848 and alive in 1891, when
it has probably become nearly stationary, it may be inferred that the
lapses among a body of Fellows of that age will correspond to the
lapses among the Fellows alive in 1848.          Now, from Table IV it will
 be seen that of the Fellows elected after 1848, the average age in
their 17th year was 583 years, which is almost exactly the average
age of the whole body.         Further, it is shown that of the supposed
original 15 there remained 109 in the 17th year, of the age above
 mentioned, 583.      This number was reduced in 12 years to 6'7, which
 is nearly 60 per cent. of the number in the 17th year, and again falls
 after 12 years more to 3'7, which is not very different from 30 per
 cent. of the starting number, and after 12 years more the number will
be seen to be likely to be less than 1'0, which again will not differ
 materially from 9 per cent. of the original 10'9. These proportions,
 it will have been observed, are those above shown to hold in the case
 of the Fellows elected before 1848.
     On the whole it seems to be established that the present restriction
 to 15 of the number of Ordinary Fellows elected in any year will lead
 to an eventual maximum number not exceeding 420; and that the
 ultimate increase of the total strength of the Society, for each addi
 tional Fellow elected in excess of 15 may be taken ,at 28, so that an
  increase of the annual number of Ordinary Fellows elected to 18
 would lead to an ultimate total of 500 such Fellows.

   The author discusses the structure of the shoulder girdle and the
homologies of its several parts in these families.             He shows that the
alleged existence of a precoracoid in the Ichthyosauria rests on an
insuf<U+FB01>cient foundation; o<U+FB01>ers proofs that in Plesiosauria the anterior
ventral ray is not only theoretically but actually precoracoid; and
also that the dorsal ray in the girdle is homologous with the shoulder
blade in Testudinata and other Reptilia.

         Received March 28, 1892.
    During a recent visit to Ceylon         I  took the opportunity of collect
ing young plants and prothallia of Angiopteris evecta, with the view
of working out' the embryology of this type of the ensporangiate
F ilicineae,   since the development of the embryo is not as yet known
in any member of this group.
   Most     of my specimens were           obtained from clay banks in the
vicinity of Peradeniya, where the plants                are not uncommon.       The
prothallia are easily distinguished from those of other Ferns by their
somewhat        orbicular shape, with crenate edges, as well by their
strikingly deep-green colour. They resemble the thalli of Anthoceros
rather than a common Polypodiaceous prothallium, and indeed are
not easily distinguished from the former when the two plants are
associated on the same bank, as is frequently the case.
    The germination of the spore and the development of the prothal
lium have been described by Jonkmanf who also observed the
formation of the sexual organs. The antheridium is formed from a.
super<U+FB01>cial cell of the prothallium, which divides by a wall, parallel
to the surface, into an outer shallow cell and an inner cubical cell.
The former, by walls at right angles to the free surface, gives rise to
the cover cells; while the inner one, by successive bipartitions,
originates the antherozoid mother-cells.              This Fern is a very favour
able type for exhibiting the development of the antherozoids from the
nucleus of the spermatocyte, on account of the relatively large size
of the structures in question.

   The antheridia are distributed both on the upper and lower surfaces
of the prothallium, and apparently without any approach to regu
larity, though they are somewhat more frequent on the lower surface.
I may observe, however, that an antheridium may often occur on the
upper surface immediately above an archegonium which has been
fertilised.
   The archegonia occur exclusively on the lower surface.            Their
development has been described by Jonkman, who also noticed the
division of the neck canal cell, by a transverse wall, into two cells.
The division is not, however, invariable, and in one preparation in
which the protoplasm had shrunk slightly from the wall,        I  observed
that the cell plate had not extended so as to completely partition the
neck passage into two cells.
   The neck canal, and ventral canal, cells become converted into
mucilage, which bursts open the archegonium, and thus admits of the
passage of the antherozoid to the oosphere.
   The oospore, after fertilisation, speedily forms an ovoid cellular
body, and although     I  was not so fortunate, owing to scarcity of
material, as to see the formation of the earliest cell walls, their suc
cession could be determined with tolerable certainty in the youngest
embryo that   I met with, consisting as it did of about ten cells.
   The basal wall is formed, as in Isoé'tes, at right angles to the axis
of the archegonium.      The next one in order of occurrence      I believe
to be the median wall, which can easily be distinguished, even in
advanced embryos, as a well-de<U+FB01>ned vertical line.
   The transverse wall is much more inde<U+FB01>nite, and early loses its
individuality owing to the unequal growth of the various parts of the
young embryo.      The further cell-division is irregular, and to a far
greater extent than is the case with the leptosporangiate Ferns as
described by Hofmeister and Leitgeb.         I was unable to determine
the constant occurrence of segment walls, though indications of them
could occasionally be seen in a few preparations.
   The anterior epibasal octants together give rise to the cotyledon;
the stem-apex is formed, not as in the leptosporangiate Ferns, from
one octant only, but from both of the posterior epibasal octants,
though one of them contributes the greater portion. The truth of
this statement is seen on examining vertical sections through the
embryo cut at right angles to the median wall, when a few cells on
each side are seen to be clearly marked out by their dense proto
 plasmic contents and large nuclei, as meristem cells.        There is no
single apical cell in An gioptem's from which all the later stem tissue is
derived, and this fact is, without doubt, to be connected with the
character of the apical meristem just described.     The root is formed
from one of the octants beneath the cotyledon, 'II.e., from an anterior
hypobasal one, and is at <U+FB01>rst indicated by a triangular apical cell,

which, in one fortunate preparation, showed the <U+FB01>rst cap cell. The
other octant, together with the two posterior hypobasal octants
(which together form the rudimentary foot), round off the base of the
embryo. The root presents considerable dif<U+FB01>culty in tracing the
course of its development, as the apical cell, at no time very clear, is
                                 I
early replaced by two cells, as convinced myself by an examination of
sections specially out obliquely in order to determine this point. More
over, the root grows in a somewhat sinuous manner in the embryo, and
the cells of its apex may easilybe confounded with other triangular cells
which occur irregularly scattered in the lower portion of the embryo.
It <U+FB01>nally emerges, not immediately beneath, nor yet exactly opposite,
the cotyledon, but at a distance from it of between one-third and
one-half of the circumference of the embryo. The dif<U+FB01>culties attend
ing the exact following of its growth, added to the scarcity of
the material, have prevented my elucidating completely the details of
development, but the important point, that, even before its emerg
ence from the embryo, its apex contains a group of initial cells occu
pying the place of the single one characteristic of other orders of
Ferns, can be regarded as established with certainty.
    The vascular strand, which is differentiated early in the cotyledon,
joins on to that of the root, and the <U+FB01>rst tracheid appears in that part
of the bundle which is opposite to the junction of the cotyledon with
the stem, in fact, just at the point where the leaf-trace curves round
into the latter.     Thence the further differentiation of the xylem
takes place in an upward and downward direction.
    When the embryo has reached a certain size it bursts through the
prothallium, the root boring through below, whilst the cotyledon
and stem grow through the upper surface. This manner of issuing
from the prothallium at once serves to distinguish Angiopte'rz's from
those other Ferns whose embryogeny is known, and probably the
peculiarity of its growth may be reasonably connected with the
 direction and position of the basal wall which separates the root and
 short portions of the embryo. It will be remembered that in this
plant the basal wall is parallel to the plane of the prothallium,
instead of nearly at right angles to it, as in the leptosporangiate
Ferns.
    Fresh leaves and roots speedily arise on the young plantlet, the
second leaf appearing just above the place of exit of the <U+FB01>rst root,
that is, not quite opposite the <U+FB01>rst leaf.          The third leaf rises
between the <U+FB01>rst 'and second ones, and nearer the <U+FB01>rst than the
second. Their roots observe the same rule of divergence as that
which obtains in the case of‘ the <U+FB01>rst root. The stipular structures,

 described (p. 628) the “<U+FB02>ask-shaped” or “glandular” epithelium,

 propose to call ‘Metschniko<U+FB02>f cells,’ are metamorphosed collar cells;
that by their reaching to the exterior and becoming perforated,
 pores are formed; and that the granules of these and of the ecto—
derm, and of the glandular ectoderm in general (and possibly the
granular cells so frequently described beneath it in Silicea), are ex

    This latter proposition, so far as concerns Ascetta, may now ,be

Leaving a sponge in a solution of indigo-carmine in sea-water (at

that the granules normally present in the Metschnikoif and ectoderm
cells become replaced in part by dark-blue granules, no other part of
the sponge being in any way coloured blue. Fig. 1 shows a Metsch

present the granules which were blue, the colourless circles those which
were of the usual yellow; a few of intermediate shading represent
granules which appeared pale-blue or green. Focussing showed that,

blue indigo granules, the nuclei stained red, and, though somewhat
changed, the original pigment granules.
     In a Homocoel sponge found at Naples, corresponding with the
ordinary diagnosis of Ascetta primordial'is,            I  found, after twenty
eight hours in indigo-carmine,          that   while neither  the endoderm nor
       “                ”

in them strongly blue. The nuclei were colourless, thus excluding
the hypothesis of postmortem staining, under which they colour
darkly.

cells are larger, being about 1'7,u in average diameter, as opposed to

    A completely different set of granules, which must not be confused

   Their most important reaction, in which they di<U+FB01>er alike from the

spherules of the same character as the basal spherules both in the
wandering cells and in their pseudopodia; there can be little doubt
that they were feeding on the reserve stores of the collar cells. The
division into column and plinth takes place as a rule at the same time
in all or most of the cells of a chamber. The “columns” or distal
parts appear as small, columnar, nucleated cells, provided with a
 small amount of clear protoplasm, rudimentary collars not united,
and <U+FB02>agella (<U+FB01>g. 4A).

 the neighbouring collars to prevent the water that is already <U+FB01>ltered
 and already foul from returning past the inactive area to pollute
 the afferent water supply. When the food has been digested, the cells
elongate and become closely pressed together; the separation of their
basal parts takes place in the manner already described, and the
distal parts start on a new cycle with hungry protoplasm, active
<U+FB02>agella, and separated collars.
    In the Homocoela            I  have been unable to make sure of these
 changes      other    than    as   regards the habitual association of Sollas’s
 membrane with the absence of <U+FB02>agella, and of the presence of <U+FB02>agella
 with separated collars. (This was noticed by Sollas, 1888, in the
 Tetractinellida of the ‘ Challenger.’)
    The nucleus in the collar cells of the Homocoela is generally basal,
 whereas in the Heterocaala, contrary to the current statements, it is
 almost always distal, the basal spherules having been commonly
 mistaken for it. The idea rather suggests itself that in sponges with
 basal nuclei in the collar cells the <U+FB01>ssion into column and plinth does
 not take place.
     Of the Metschnikoif cells in A. olathrus the following is the his
 tory. Under certain circumstances the Sollas’s membrane and the
 gastral surface of the collar cells become replaced by a continuous
 hyaline <U+FB01>lm charged with the yellow granules characteristic of the
 sponge (1)th <U+FB01>g. 2).            Certain collar cells—or, rather, quondam collar
 cells——become       charged throughout their whole substance with these
 granules; they are now Metschniko<U+FB02> cells, and are the cells described
 (p. 360) and <U+FB01>gured by that author as mesoderm cells in his well-'
 known paper (“Spong Studieu;” ‘Zeits. wiss. Zool.,’ vol. 32).
 They are almost always excavated by a cavity or ductf‘e frequently
taking the form of a capillary and sometimes branching tube; they
push through towards the ectodermal surface, with which they
become connected; the granular <U+FB01>lm covering the general gastral
surface disappears. It is now to be noted that the afferent pores of
all the Homocoela          I  have examined consist each of a single, nucleate, _

with the size of the lumen, is charged with granules similar to those

 a pore  in Ascetta clath'ms is shown     in <U+FB01>g. 3.   My conclusion on <U+FB01>rst
 detecting the form of the normal ectoderm was that the pores were
 ectoderm cells which had placed themselves in communication with
 the gastral cavity.      I  have found, however, where the conditions
 are most abnormal the ectoderm cells in their usual <U+FB02>ask-shaped form
 apparently inactive ; while, on the other hand, Metschnikoff cells are
 very frequent in all stages up to the condition in which they are
 exposed on both gastral and external surfaces and perforated nearly
 from end to end.      I believe that when they have reached this stage
 they discharge    their granules from the external as well as from the
 gastral surface. The lumen is thus completed, and a perforation
 through the wall is formed, which, on regeneration of the gastral
 epithelium, persists as an a<U+FB01>erent pore.
     The prosopyle cells of the Heterocosla consist also each of a single
 perforated, nucleate cell, frequently containing granules              also

             ‘
                                                    I suggest the hypothesis
 that primitively the afferent pores of sponges are perforated excretory
 cells derived from the endoderm, while the ectoderm is a layer of
 cells excreting constantly from the intercellular jelly, their <U+FB02>ask
 shaped form having been developed to expose the greatest possible
 surface to the medium from which the excreted substance is derived.
  They have been differentiated on the exterior as a covering to the
 nutritory and reproductory cells of the sponge, in order, by reason of
 their noxious contents, to form some protection to the naked proto
 plasm.
      [May 16, 1892.-—-I wish to suggest, as a proper subject for expert
  chemical analysis, the question, how far the substance excreted by
  Calcarea in the granules of the ectoderm and Metschnikoif cells is
  allied to the so-called spongin.
     At <U+FB01>rst sight, such a proposition may appear idle. But Kelliker,
  O. Schmidt, and many others have recorded in horny sponges cuticle
  of various degrees of insolubility, up to a point at which it cannot be
( distinguished
                  in constitution from the horny skeleton with which it
  stands in connexion. Both from my own observations on an Aplysz'lla ( ?)
  at Naples (bearing a cuticle insoluble in caustic ammonia), and from
  a study of Schulze’s detailed description of the super<U+FB01>cial structure,
  particularly in Euspongia,    I am persuaded that the ectoderm cells of
 the horny sponges are of the same form and character as those in the
 Homoccela.      Again, the slimy covering of Halisarca. (Merejkovsky) is
 precisely homologous with the granules excreted by the ectoderm of
 calcareous sponges.       If the cuticle of horny sponges be granular—as
 Schmidt found it in Esper'ia. tunicata—these three products are
 morphologically identical, and it is not unreasonable to inquire if
                                               '
 they are chemically related.

the cuticle and the ectoderm;           I
                                      can see no evidence advanced for
the mesodermal nature of the “cap-like investment belonging to
the dermal layer of the connective tissue” which Schulze <U+FB01>nds
(‘Spongidae,’ 1879, p. 637*) to be the organ productive of the
principal growth of the <U+FB01>bre;           I
                                      think that Lendenfeld is probably
right   in  his homology   of the   spongoblasts with gland cells (1883,
‘Zeitschr. wiss. Z001.,’ vol. 38, p. 256), and in his statement that
the two tissues are continuous one with another (‘ Horny Sponges,’
1889, p. 790).     Having found with certainty that the <U+FB02>at epithelium,
which he draws and describes in detail (‘Monograph of Australian
Sponges,’ 18841, 1885, passim; ‘Monograph of Horny Sponges,’
                 ‘
1889, p. 775;      Kalkschwamme,’ 1891, p. 162), over the gland cells
of calcareous sponges has no existence,               I
                                                   reject entirely his evi
dence that a similar epithelium covers the gland cells of Ceratosa;
the more so as Schulze, Poléjaeff, and other conscientious workers
have failed to demonstrate it.          I
                                      hold that these gland cells are the
ordinary'<U+FB02>ask-shaped epithelium which forms the external covering
of most sponges, and is presumably the ectoderm.                      I
                                                              hold it on the
present evidence probable that the spongoblasts are homologous with
them, the horny <U+FB01>bre with the horny cuticle, and the hexagonal
                                                          “ silver lines ” of

   It is impossible for any unskilled person to attempt the chemical

number of different nitrogenous substances, not easily soluble, found
as suppOrting structure in a large group of more or less allied sponges ;
while the skeletons of some genera are easily soluble in caustic
potash (Kolliker), and even very dilute caustic potash (Dybowski),
in others they withstand it at boiling temperature, and in any
strength-l“ We have assumed these substances to be related because
of their homologous occurrence in allied animals;                 I
                                                             wish to extend
this assumption,     for what  it is  worth,  to the  excretory granules of
 Calcarea. It is noticeable that, like “spongin,” the matter compos
ing these granules is characterised by a tendency to great variation.
   ‘1‘ It is just to our leader to say that in the same paper he expressly states that
                  “ connective tissue,” because its
he speaks of                                        homology with “mesoderm” is only
probable, and not proved (p. 625).          I
                                          But suggest that, from his description, it is
                                                             “ outer
open to the reader to believe that the cap belongs to the            cell-layer, and not
to the connective tissue layer.” Compare especially p. 626.
  'l-Vosmaer points out that analyses have hitherto only been made on Euspongi'a.
The observations of Ridley, to which Vosmacr gives his support, show that the
horny skeletons of some Ceratosa are not doubly refractive.

This variation takes place, not only among closely allied species, but
in the granules of one and the same cell; suggesting most strongly
that the substance itself is mutable, and that the different aspects it
presents are phases through all of which individual granules may pass,
Adding distilled water under the microscope to a fragment of white
Ascetta primordialis, all the granules turn orange-yellow (their colour
in the red variety), and the greater part of them can be seen instan
taneously to dissolve. But in many of the cells there are a certain
number of granules which remain after a week’s maceration, and then
exhibit considerable resistance to caustic potash; in Ascandm reti
culum the same phenomena occur with but slight variation)“                   In the
light of this history we may perhaps reconcile, on the one hand,
Ascetta clath'ms, in which all the granules appear to be ultimately
dissolved in distilled water, and, on the other hand, Leucosolenia
cavata, in which Dendy <U+FB01>nds them insoluble in boiling caustic
potash.
     I suggest as a working hypothesis that the yellow granules of Ascetta
clathms are a soluble nitrogenous excretion which is highly mutable,
and readily gives rise to the less soluble substances occurring with it
in the granules of other Homoctela.             I suggest that this substance is
probably      the  common    nitrogenous     secretion of the protoplasm in all
sponges, and that the horny sponges are those which have learned to
retain it within their bodies until it has formed one or other of those
more or less insoluble products which we usually recognise under the
hospitable name of spongin.            I hope soon to discuss this hypothesis
more at length, and to give the full grounds for my conviction as to
the general presence in sponges of a glandular or <U+FB02>ask-shaped external
ectoderm.
     The homology between cuticle and horn <U+FB01>bres has been insisted on
by K<U+FB01>lliker, O. Schmidt, Hyatt, and others; the resemblance between
dermal cells and spongoblasts has been noted by Mare'nzeller, and
emphasised by Lendenfeld; their complete homology, and the proba
bility of the slime of the skin being “ spongin and much water,”
    i“ If either of these tWo
                              sponges be shaken violently for three minutes in dis
tilled water, and the liquid thoroughly <U+FB01>ltered, a clear yellow (golden-yellow
A. primordialis) slightly alkaline solution results. Acidifying with 1 part in 10,000
of acetic acid, there is no immediate effect; but in the course of some hours a
<U+FB02>occulent brown precipitate is thrown down, insoluble except on boiling, in either
concentrated caustic potash or nitric acid ; the solution made with boiling nitric
acid leaves a straw-coloured residue on evaporation which turns rich yellow on the
 addition of ammonia, and becomes black on over-heating.      I may note that  I have
now (May 14) succeeded in obtaining crystals from a solution made by placing an
Ascetta clathrus in absolute alcohol ; after remaining some months in a bottle and
decreasing in volume, the alcohol contains a number of long, thin, glittering blade
like crystals, as much as 3 mm. long, doubly refracting, very soluble in water; the
nitrate appears to be soluble in nitric acid.

        F.R.S., and Mrs. HUGGINS. Received May 16, 1892.

    We had the honour in February last of communicating to the
Royal Society a short preliminary note on the remarkable spectrum
of this temporary star. We beg now to present a fuller account of
our observations, together with two maps of the spectrum of this star,
and some theoretical suggestions as to its nature. One map represents
the result of our work by eye in the visible region; the other map
has been drawn from a photograph of its spectrum, taken without
its light having passed through glass, and which extends into the
 ultra-violet nearly as far as the absorption of our atmosphere permits
 even the solar rays to pass.
                On the Visible Region of the Star’s Spectrum.
    The kindness of Professor Copeland in sending us a special
 telegram on February 1 enabled us to commence our observations of
 the star on February 2, when it was of about the 45th magnitude.
 These observations were continued on the following evening, and on
 the 5th, 6th, 22nd, and 24th February, and on the 15th, 18th, 19th,
 20th, and 24th March, when the sky was more or less suf<U+FB01>ciently clear
 for further observations to be made by eye. On the two ends of the
 spectrum the observations were usually made with a spectroscope
 containing one dense prism of 60°, but the comparisons in the
 brighter parts of the spectrum were observed with a more powerful
 spectroscope containing two compound prisms.
     Comparisons with Hydrogen—Three bright lines of great brilliancy,
 about the positions Ha, He, and Hy, left little doubt that they were
 due to hydrogen.      The corresponding lines of a hydrogen vacuum
 tube were found to fall upon these lines, showing that they had
 their origin in this gas; but the line in the star at F, which
 could be best observed, showed a large shift of position towards the
 red.    The line from the vacuum tube fell not upon the middle of the
 line, but near its more refrangible edge.     The star line was brighter
 on the more refrangible side, so much so, indeed, that our <U+FB01>rst im
  pression was that this side of the line only might be truly He, and
 the less bright part towards the red, a line of some other substance
 falling near it. Subsequent observations of the hydrogen lines in
  the star left no doubt that though they presented           the unusual
 character of being double, and sometimes triple, they were due wholly
 to hydrogen.     These lines were rather broad, but de<U+FB01>ned, especially
 so at the more refrangible edge.       Similarly to what is observed in

                              On Nova Aurigaa.                                487
1892.]
the spectrum of terrestrial hydrogen, C was narrower than F, which
again was less broad than Hy near G.
     The remarkable phenomenon presented itself that all the bright
hydrogen lines and some other of the bright lines were doubled by
a dark line of absorption of the same gas on the blue side.                   The
shift of   the  dark  hydrogen   lines   towards    the  blue  showed   a velocity
of approach of this cooler gas somewhat greater than the recession
of the gas emitting the bright lines. Our estimates of the relative
Velocity would place it at about 550 miles a second, which is in good
 accordance with the result obtained by Professor Vogel from the
 measurement of his photographs.
      So far as our instruments enabled us to determine the point under
 the unfavourable condition of the rapidly waning light of the star,
 no great change in the relative motion of the gases producing the
 bright and dark lines took place from February 2 to about March 7,
 when the star’s light became too faint for such observations—a
 result which we believe to be in accordance with successive photo
 graphs taken at Potsdam, Cambridge (U.S.), Stonyhurst, and some
 other observatories.
      Comparison with Sodium.—A bright line, which on
                                                                  one occasion we
  glimpsed as double, appeared      about   the  position   of  D.
      Direct comparisons with a sodium <U+FB02>ame, while leaving no doubt
  that the line was due to this substance, showed that it was shifted,
  similarly to the bright hydrogen lines, towards the red. Perhaps we
  should state that at the time we had the impression that this line
  was not shifted to so large an amount relatively to sodium as was the
  F line relatively to hydrogen. As the comparison was more dif<U+FB01>cult
  at this part of the spectrum, and one prism only was used, we do not
  attach importance to this observation.
       Comparisons with Nitrogen and Lead—There
                                                              can be little doubt
  that one of the four brilliant lines        in   the green is the same line
  which appeared in the Nova of 1876, and was at that time suspected
   to be the chief nebular line. Very great pains were taken to ascer
   tain its exact position and character.
       For this purpose, on February 2, and again on February 3, direct
                                                                             of the
   comparisons were made with the more powerful spectroscope
   star’s line  with  the brightest   double   line   of  the  nitrogen   spectrum,
   and also with a line of lead, to which line the near relative posi
   tion of the nebular line is accurately known.                  Comparisons on
   both nights, and with both lines, showed              that   the  star line was
                                                                    and by a much
    certainly less refrangible than the chief nebular line,
    larger amount   than  the shift  of   F relatively   to hydrogen.      A similar
    conclusion has been arrived     at  by  Professor    Young,   Professor  Vogel,
    Dr. Campbell at the Lick Observatory, Father Sidgreaves, Dr. Becker,
     and M. Bélopolsky at Pulkova.         The position of the line in the star

488                       Dr. and Mrs. Huggins.                  [May 19,
is about 7t 5014, and the line may well be one about this position
which is frequently seen bright at the Sun’s limb.
    It may be added that though three faint bright lines are to be seen
in the star’s spectrum, not far from the place of the second nebular
line, no one of them can be regarded as that line. Indeed no certain
evidence exists that the chief nebular line occurs without the second
line. In some cases of my early observations on the nebula: in
which    I recorded the spectrum as consisting of one line only,    I have
since with better instruments been able to see the second and the
third lines as well. The origin of the second, as well as that of the
chief nebular line, is not known. Professor Keeler has shown that the
second nebular line is not coincident with the double line of iron,
 which is very near it.
    The conclusion that the spectrum of the Nova has no relationship
 with that of the bright-line nebulae would be strengthened, if further
 con<U+FB01>rmation were needed, by the absence in a photograph we took of
 the spectrum of the New Star of a very strong ultra-violet line which
is usually found in the spectrum of the nebula of Orion.
     Comparison with the Hydrocarbon Flame and Carbon Oxide—The
 brightest line in spectrum of the Nova, with the exception of F,
 falls near the brightest edge of the green <U+FB02>uting of the hydro
carbon <U+FB02>ame.       Direct comparisons showed the star line to fall a little
 to the red side of the edge of the <U+FB02>uting ; but, allowing for a shift of
 the star’s spectrum, the place of the line would be near, though not
coincident with, the brightest edge of the <U+FB01>uting.
    The character of the star line leaves, however, no doubt on this point,
 for it is multiple with the brightest and most de<U+FB01>ned line on the blue
 side, contrary to the <U+FB02>uting which is de<U+FB01>ned on the red side, and gradu
 ally falls 01f, towards the blue. If any uncertainty could be supposed
 still to remain, it was wholly removed when we found no brightenings
 in the star’s spectrum corresponding to the other <U+FB02>utings of the hydro
 carbon <U+FB02>ame.       A bright band in the blue falls just beyond the <U+FB02>uting
 in this region. This band may have the same origin as a similar
 band in certain of the Wolf-Rayet stars.
    We conclude that the spectrum of the Nova has no relationship with
 the usual spectrum of comets.
    We found from direct comparison that the dilferent set of <U+FB02>utings
characteristic of the carbon oxide spectrum was not represented by
 any corresponding brightenings in the spectrum of the Nova.
     Comparison with Magnesium.—It was not unreasonable to suppose
 that the star line might have its origin in magnesium, the triple line
 of which at 1) falls almost at the same place. The comparison showed
 the stellar line to fall upon the more refrangible pair of the mag
 nesium triplet, and to overlap it slightly on both sides, but rather
 more on the blue side.      Considering that with the resolving power

used the three lines of the triplet were well separated, and that we
sought in vain for a similar triplet in the star ; and, further, that if the
probable shift of the star’s spectrum towards the red be taken into
account, the star line would fall rather more to the blue side of the
more refrangible pair of the triplet, we consider it probable that the
star line has some other origin. The stellar line is multiple, but it was
found di<U+FB02>icult to observe it with a su<U+FB02>iciently narrow slit. A thin
and de<U+FB01>ned bright line was clearly seen at the blue side of the
rather broad stellar line, but the remaining and less bright part of
the line was not certainly made out, but on one occasion it was more
than suspected of consisting of several lines.
    We consider the evidence to be against the star line having its
origin in magnesium, especially as no correspondingly bright lines
were observed in the Nova at the positions of the other strong lines
of the spark spectrum of magnesium, nor in our photograph at the
position of the strong magnesium triplet a little more refraugible
than H.
    The third bright line in the green of the Nova which is nearest
to F, and the least brilliant of the group of lines in this region, was
 found to have a wave-length of about l» 4921. A large number of
 bright lines were seen in the spectrum besides those which have been
 entered on the map (Plate 4).
    The lines only of which we were able to <U+FB01>x the position with
 approximate accuracy are drawn across the spectrum.                   The places
 of the lines drawn partly across the map are from estimations only.
    We observed a line a little more refrangible than D, of which the
 position when corrected for the shift of the spectrum, is at or very
 near that of D3. Also a bright line below C, and others between
 C and D.
     On February 2 and February 3 groups of numerous bright lines
 crowded the spectrum between 12 and D, which were less easily seen
 as the star waned.
     The continuous spectrum extended, when the star was brightest,
  below 0, and as far into the blue as the eye could follow it, at this
  time to a little distance beyond G.
     The visible spectrum of the Nova, and especially the reversal of
  H and K, and of the complete series of the hydrogen lines in the
  ultra-violet, together with the probable presence of D3, suggest
  strongly a state of things not unlike what we <U+FB01>nd in the erupted
  matter at the solar surface.         In a photograph of a prominence
  taken on March 4, 1892, which       I   have received from M. Deslandres,

    Photograph of the Ultra-Violet part of the Spectrum—On February
22 and March         9 we took photographs of the star with a mirror of
speculum      metal   and a spectroscope of which the optical part is made
of Iceland spar      and   quartz.
    The photograph taken on February 22 with an exposure of 12 hour
surprised us in showing an extension of the star spectrum into the
ultra-violet, almost as far as the limit imposed upon the light of
celestial bodies by the absorption of our atmosphere.
    Not only the hydrogen lines near G and at h, but also H and K,
together with the complete hydrogen series which appears dark in
the white stars, came out bright, each with its corresponding absorp
tion line on the blue side. There are some inequalities of brightness
in these lines, especially in the line B, which is brighter than q or B,
which probably arise from lines of other substances falling upon
them.      On this night K was followed by an absorption, which was
less intense than the absorption at H.
    Beyond the hydrogen series the spectrum is rich in bright lines,
which, in most cases, are accompanied by lines of absorption.          N eces
sarily, from the long range of spectrum included on the plate, the
scale is small, and for this reason, and from the faintness of the
more refrangible portion of the spectrum when observed under the
measuring microscope, the positions given to the stronger groups,
which alone have been inserted in the map, must be regarded as
approximate only.
    Below the spectrum of the Nova, the spectrum of Sirius has been
placed for comparison. The group near the more refrangible limit of
the spectrum‘" has been drawn in. Numerous other lines between
this group and the end of the hydrogen series have been detected in
our photographs of Sirius, but have not yet been measured with
su<U+FB02>icient accuracy to justify us in putting them into the map.
    In this map no attempt has been made to show the shift of the
spectrum of the Nova. The bright lines in the star have been put
at the places of the hydrogen lines.
    To the extreme limit of the spectrum a faint continuous spectrum
shows itself.
    The photograph of March 9, exposed for 1% hour, was rather faint,

as the state of the sky was unfavourable.
    The apparently .Mult'iple Character of the Linea—On February 2 we
noticed that the F line was not uniform throughout its breadth, and
soon came to the conclusion that it was divided, not quite symmetric
ally, by a very narrow dark line. The more refrangible component
was brighter, and rather broader than the other.            Later on in Feb
fall into Balmer’s formula for the hydrogen series. We must regard them, doubt
less, as members of that series and due to hydrogen.—June 10.]

   rnary, we were sure that small alterations were taking place in this
   line, and that the component on the blue side no longer maintained
   its superiority.        We suspected, indeed, at times that the line was
   triple, and towards the end of February and in the beginning of
   March we had no longer any doubt that it was occasionally divided
   into three bright lines by the incoming of two very narrow dark lines.
       Similar alterations, giving a more or less apparent multiple char
   acter to the lines, are to be seen not only in the bright lines, but also
   in those of absorption in contemporary photographs taken of the spec
  trum of the star.          I  may mention those taken at Potsdam, Stony
  hurst, and the Lick Observatory.                They were specially watched and
  measured by M. Bélopolsky at Pulkova.
       Professor Pickering informs me that on a photograph taken at
  Cambridge, U.S., on February 27, H, K, and a are triple, and that
  Miss Maury recorded, “ the dark hydrogen lines rendered double, and
  sometimes triple, by the appearance of <U+FB01>ne bright threads superposed
  upon the dark bands.”
       To explain these appearances on the assumption that each com
  ponent of the bright and dark lines is produced by the emission or
  absorption of hydrogen moving with a di<U+FB01>erent velocity would
  require a complex system of six bodies all moving differently.
      A much more reasonable explanation presents itself in the phe
  nomena of reversal, which are very common on the erupted solar sur
 face and in the laboratory?“
      Professor Liveing informs me that he and Professor Dewar, in their
 researches with the arc-crucible, met with cases in which, through the
 unequal expansion of the bright line on the two sides, the narrow re
 versed dark line did not fall upon the middle of the broader bright
 line, but divided it unsymmetrically.               This effect was notably shown
 in photographs which they took of the spectrum of zinc. Unsym
 metrical division of the lines by reversal would also come in, if the
 cooler and hotter portions of the gas were possessed of relative
 motion in the line of sight.

this point :—“ Lorsque l’on dirige sur la. fente d’uu spectroscope de grande disper

  These observers met also        with double   reversals, which gave a
triple character to   the    expanded  single line. In one experiment,
when sodium carbonate was introduced into the arc the reversed
D lines were seen as a broad dark band with a bright diEuse band
in the middle. As the sodium evaporated the band narrowed, and
the bright line in the middle showed a second reversal within it.
This was a case of threefold reversal.
    There would seem to be little doubt but that the more or less divided
character—sometimes unsymmetrically—of the bright and dark lines
of the Nova, which appeared to be undergoing continual alterations,
 was due to the incoming upon the broader lines of narrow reversed
lines,_bright or dark, as the case might be. Provision must therefore
be made for conditions favourable for such reversals in any hypothesis
which is suggested to account for the phenomena of the new star.
     lVam'ng of the Stan—The <U+FB01>rst record of this star was its appear
ance as a star of the 5th magnitude on a plate taken at Cambridge,
 U.S., on December 10, 1891. No star so bright as the 9th magnitude
 was found at its place on a plate taken by Dr. Max Wolf on De
 cember 8.      Combining the photographic magnitudes obtained at
 Greenwich with the visual ones made at the University Observatory,
 Oxford, and by Mr. Stone and Mr. Knott, we <U+FB01>nd that throughout
 February and the <U+FB01>rst few days of March the light of the star de
 clined very slowly, but with continual and considerable <U+FB02>uctuations,
 from about the 4'5th magnitude down to the 6th magnitude. After
 March 7, the remarkable swayings to and fro of the intensity of the
 light, set up probably by commotions attendant on the cause of its
 outburst, calmed down, and the star fell rapidly and with regularity
 to about the 11th magnitude by March 24, and then down to about
  14‘4th magnitude by April 1.       On April 26, however, it was still
 visible at Harvard Observatory, magnitude 145, on the scale of the
  meridian photometer.
     We observed its spectrum for the last time on March 24. when it
 had fallen to nearly the 11th magnitude.          We were still able to
  glimpse the chief features of its spectrum.       The four bright lines
 in the green were distinctly seen, and appeared to retain their rela

      Traces of the continuous spectrum were still to be seen. Consider
  ing the much greater faintness of the continuous spectrum when the
 star was bright on February     2 than the brilliant lines falling upon it,
  we are not prepared to say that the falling off of the continuous spec

      becoming much the brightest when the star was faint.” The calcium
      lines K and H showed signs of variation during the whole time of the
      star’s visibility, and I may remark that the order of the other lines
      agrees with the relative sensitiveness   of the gelatine plate for these
      parts  of  the  spectrum. Professor Pickering’s photographic results
      appear to us to be in accordance with those we arrived at by eye, in
      not showing any material alteration in the nature of the star’s light,
      notwithstanding its very large fall of intensity.
                                General Conclusions.
         Among the principal conditions which must be met by any theory
      put forward to account for the remarkable phenomena of the new
     star stands the persistence     without any great alteration—though
      probably with small changes—of the large relative velocity of about
      550 miles a second in the line of sight between the hydrogen which
      emitted the bright lines and the cooler hydrogen producing the dark
      lines of absorption.
         If we assume two gaseous bodies, or bodies with gaseous atmo
     spheres, moving away from each other after a near approach, in
     parabolic or hyperbolic orbits, with our Sun nearly in the axis of the
     orbits, the components of the motions of the two bodies in the line of
     sight, after they had swung round, might well be as rapid as those
     observed in the new star, and might continue for as long a time
      without any great change of relative velocity. Unfortunately infor
      mation as to the motions of the bodies at the critical time is wanting,
     for the event through which the star became suddenly bright had
      been over for some forty days before any observations were made with
     the spectroscope.
         Analogy from the variable stars of long period would suggest the
     view that the near approach of the two bodies may have been of the
     nature of a periodical disturbance, arising at long intervals in a
     complex system of bodies.     Chandler has recently shown in the case
     of Algol that the minor irregularities in the variation of its light are
     probably caused by the presence of one or more bodies in the system,
      besides the bright star and the dusky one which partially eclipses it.
     To a similar cause are probably due the minor irregularities which
     form so prominent a feature in the waxing and waning of the variable
     stars as a class.   We know, too, that the stellar orbits are usually very
     eccentric.    In the case of q Virginis the eccentricity is as great as
Q;   0'9, and Auwers has recently found the very co nsiderable eccentricity
 \   of 0‘63 for Sirius.
         The great relative velocity of the component stars of the Nova,
   “however, seems to point rather to the casual near approach of bodies
      possessing previously considerable   motion; unless we are willing to
                                                                   2 L 2

concede to them a mass very great as compared      with that of the Sun.
 Such   a near approach of two bodies of great aim is very greatly less
 improbable than would be their actual collision.       The phenomena
 of the new star, indeed, scarcely permit us _to suppose even a
partial collision; though if the bodies were very diffuse, or the
approach close enough, there may have been possibly some mutual
interpenetration and mingling of the rarer gases near their boundaries.
    A more reasonable explanation of the phenomena, however, may be
found in a view put forward many years ago by Klinkerfues, and
 recently developed by Wilsing, that under such circumstances of near
 approach enormous disturbances of a tidal nature would be set up,
amounting it may well be to partial deformation in the case of gaseous
 bodies, and producing suf<U+FB01>ciently great changes of pressure in the
 interior of the bodies to give rise to enormous eruptions of the hotter
matter from within, immensely greater, but similar in kind, to solar
eruptions; and accompanied        probably by large electrical disturb
ances.
    In such a state of things we should have conditions so favourable
for the production of reversals undergoing continual change, similar
to those exhibited by the bright and dark lines of the Nova, that we
could not suppose them to be absent; while the integration of the
light from all parts of the disturbed surfaces of the bodies would give
breadth to the lines, and might account for the varying inequalities
of brightness at the two sides of the lines.
   The source of the light of the continuOus spectrum, upon which
were seen the dark lines of absorption shifted towards the blue, must
have remained behind the cooler absorbing gas; indeed, must have
formed with it the body which was approaching us, unless we assume
that both bodies were moving exactly in the line of sight, or that the
absorbing gases were of enormous extent.
    The circumstance that the receding body emitted bright lines,
while the one approaching us gave a continuous spectrum with
broad absorption lines similar to a white star, may, perhaps, be
accounted for by the two bodies being in di<U+FB01>erent evolutionary stages,
and consequently differing in di<U+FB02>iuseness and in temperature. Indeed
in the variable star <U+FB02> Lyrae, we have probably a binary system,
Of which one component gives bright lines, and the other dark lines
of absorption. We must, however, assume a similar chemical nature
for both bodies, and that they existed under conditions su<U+FB02>iciently
similar for equivalent dark and bright lines to appear in'their re
spective spectra.
   We have no knowledge of the distance of the Nova, but the
assumption is not an improbable one that its distance was of the
same order of greatness as that of the Nova of 1876, for Which Sir
Robert Ball failed to detect any parallax.       In this case. the light

 emission suddenly set up, certainly within two days and possibly
 within a few hours, was probably much greater than that of our Sun;
 yet within some <U+FB01>fty days after it had been discovered, at the end of
 January, its light fell to about 1/300th part, and in some three
 months to nearly the 1/10,000th part. As long as its spectrum
 could be observed the chief lines remained without material alter
 ation of relative brightness. Under what conditions could we suppose
 the Sun to cool down suf<U+FB01>ciently for its light to decrease to a similar
 extent in so short a time, and without the incoming of material
 changes in its spectrum?                     It is scarcely conceivable that we
can have to do with the conversion of gravitational energy into
 light and heat.             On the theory we have ventured to suggest, the
 rapid calming down, after some swayings to and fro of the tidal
 disturbances, and the closing in again of the outer and cooler gases,
 together with the want of transparency which might come in under
such circumstances, as the bodies separated, might account reasonably
 for the very rapid and at <U+FB01>rst curiously <U+FB02>uctuating waning of the
 Nova; and also for the observed absence of change in its spectrum.
     I    may, perhaps, be permitted to remark that the view suggested
 by Dr. William Allen Miller and myself, in the case of the Nova of
 1866,* was essentially similar, in so far as we ascribed it to erupted
gases.         The great suddenness of the outburst of that star, within a
few hours probably, and the rapid waning from the 3'6 magnitude to
the 8'1 magnitude in nine days, induced us to throw out the addi
tional suggestion that possibly chemical actions between the erupted
gases and the outer atmosphere of the star may have contributed to
its sudden and transient splendour; a view which, though not im
possible, I should not now, with our present knowledge of the light
changes of stars, be disposed to suggest.

that they suf<U+FB01>ciently account for the twist which is produced in an
iron wire when magnetised circularly and longitudinally at the same
time.     The resultant lines of magnetisation, as he points out, take a
spiral form; the iron expands in the direction of the lines of mag
netisation, and thus the wire becomes twisted. Professor G. Wiede
 rnanu, however, to whom the discovery of the magnetic twist is due,
appears not to be satis<U+FB01>ed with this explanation,* believing the effect
to be caused by unequal molecular friction.
     The subject of magnetic twists has been very fully and carefully
investigated by Professor C. G. Knott, and in a paper published last
year in the ‘Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh’ (vol.
'36, Part II, p. 485) he indicates many details in which the phenomena
of twist closely correspond with th0se of elongation and retraction.
                                                              “ an increased
Assuming their essential identity, and noting that
current along the wire a<U+FB01>ects the points of vanishing twist in a
manner opposite to that in which an increased tension a<U+FB01>ects it,”
Professor Knott is “inclined to conclude that the pure strain effects
of these in<U+FB02>uences are of an opposite character.” Now, since the
magnetic elongation of an iron wire is known to be diminished by
tension, the remark above quoted amounts to a prediction that in an
iron wire carrying a current the magnetic elongation would be
              “ We know
 increased.                  nothing so far,” Professor Knott observes,
“
    regarding the changes of length when an iron wire carrying a current
is subjected to longitudinal magnetising forces,” and it was with the
object of acquiring some information on this point and testing Pro
fessor Knott’s prediction that the experiments described in the present
paper were undertaken.        The results show that it was amply veri<U+FB01>ed,
 and thus Maxwell’s explanation of the twist receives still further cor
roboration.
     The apparatus used and the methods of observation were the same
 as those described in my former papers.          Each specimen of wire ex
amined was 10 cm. long between the supporting clamps, and the
 magnetising coil, weighing nearly 3 lbs., was as usual supported by
the wire itself, an arrangement which, for reasons before given, was
essential.   The indications of the instrument were read to one ten
 millionth part of the length of the wire, and the wire was demag
 netised by reversals before each single observation.
     Exp. 1.—The wire <U+FB01>rst used was of soft commercial annealed iron,
0'75 mm. in diameter.         The changes of length which it exhibited
 under the in<U+FB02>uence of magnetising forces gradually increased from
 13 to 315 C.G.S. units, are indicated in the second column of Table I,
in which the unit is one-millionth of a centimetre or one ten-millionth
 of the e<U+FB01>ective length of the wire.         The magnetising forces given in
  the <U+FB01>rst column are those due to the coil only, no account being taken

     Exp. ‘2.—A current of 1 ampere was then passed through the wire.
 The current, which was derived from a Grove’s cell, was measured
 by a tangent galvanometer and regulated by a rheostat, which had
 been approximately adjusted on the previous day.                      As soon as the
 circuit was closed, the index of the measuring instrument began to
 move, rapidly at <U+FB01>rst and afterwards more sldwly, in the direction
 indicating elongation of the iron wire. In about two minutes the
 index had come to rest again, the number of scale divisions over
 which it had passed showing that the original length of the wire
 had increased by 310 ten-millionths.               Assuming the coe<U+FB01>icient of ex

 column of Table         I  and in the middle curve of <U+FB01>g. 1. The latter
 shows clearly that the maximum                elongation had risen from 11'5 to
  14'5 ten-millionths,      while the decrement in a <U+FB01>eld of 315 had fallen
 from 22'5 to about 17'5.
     Exp. 3.——The current through the iron wire was then increased,
 by an alteration of the rheostat, to 2 amperes.                 The further elonga
 tion of the wire due to the heating eifect of the increased current
 was very nearly 1000 ten-millionths, corresponding to a rise of tem
 perature of 8°‘2 C. This added to 2'5, the rise due to the current of
 1 ampere, which was passing before, gives 10°‘7 as the excess of the
 temperature of the wire carrying 2 ampéres above that of the room.
 When the index had become steady, which happened in the course
 of about 2% minutes, another series of observations was made; but
 instead of applying all the previously employed magnetising forces
 in succession, alternate ones were omitted. This was done for the
 purpose of shortening the experiment, it being thought doubtful
 whether the Grove’s cell which supplied current to the iron wire
 would remain su<U+FB02>iciently constant when giving so strong a current
 as 2 ampéres.       The results of the experiment are contained in the
 last column of Table I, and in the highest of the curves in <U+FB01>g. 1.
 There is again a marked increase of the maximum elongation, and
 decrease of the retraction in a <U+FB01>eld of 315.                         .
    For the sake of easy comparison, the principal results obtained

    Exp. 4.—The previous observations were repeated with another
specimen of soft iron wire of greater diameter, viz.: 1'05 mm., no
current being at <U+FB01>rst passed through it. ,The results appear in the
second column of Table            III   and in <U+FB01>g. 2.
within a quarter of a scale division, with the exception of the two last, which showed
that the E.M.F. of the battery—seven Grove’s cells~was slightly increasing, or
rather perhaps that its internal resistance was diminishing. When two successive
readings with the same resistance in circuit differed by no more than a quarter of
a. scale division (equivalent to 3125 units of magnetising force), the mean
                                                                              of the two
readings was taken as giving the true current.

    Exp. 5.—A current of 2 amperes was passed through the same
 wire, resulting in an elongation due to heating of 460 ten-millionths,
 the temperature of the wire being therefore raised about 3°‘3.                  The
former observations were again made with the results given in the
 last column of Table        III  and in <U+FB01>g. 2.
     1t will be seen that with both specimens of iron wire, the effect of
 a current is of just the same general character.               It acts oppositely to
 tension, heightening the curve of elongation instead of lowering it.
 This action is certainly not due either directly or indirectly to mere
 current heating. It has been shown that the thinner wire even
 when carrying 2 amperes was only about 10°‘7 warmer than when
 no current was passing through it.                  Such a small rise of tempera
 ture would be quite incompetent by itself to account for the effect in
 question, for the elongation curves of a given specimen of iron have
 been found to be not sensibly altered when taken under widely
  diiferent conditions of temperature.                  Nor would it exert any
  material in<U+FB02>uence upon         the  susceptibility of the iron; and, even if it
  did, the curves would not be alfected in the manner observed.
     It is hardly worth while attempting to frame an explanation until
  many more phenomena of the same order have been investigated.
     Similar experiments were afterwards made with nickel and
  cobalt.
     Exp. _6.—A nickel wire was used, the diameter of which was

   Exp. 7.—A current of 1 ampere was passed through the nickel
wire, producing a heat elongation of 340 ten-millionths.                        Taking
the coe<U+FB02>icient of expansion as 0'0000129, this implies a rise of tem
perature of 2°‘6.         The retractions of the wire when carrying a
current are given in the third column of the table. Remembering
that the <U+FB01>gures in the second and third columns denote millionths
of a centimetre, the close agreement between the two is very remark
able.   1 have elsewhere‘l‘ fully described the method of observation
adopted, but      I  may perhaps mention that each number as set down
in the table was obtainedby the subtraction of two readings, the
one taken when there was no current in the magnetising coil, the
other when the current was turned on. The former or zero reading
was continually changing, owing to small alterations of temperature,
the index rarely being absolutely at rest.                    All the <U+FB01>gures were
dictated, and when the second experiment was made,                    I  had not seen
the results    of   the  <U+FB01>rst.    I  may    add   that    the table contains all the
observations which were taken in the two experiments.
   Though at <U+FB01>rst inclined to attribute such small discrepancies as
exist entirely to observational or instrumental errors and to infer that
the current had no in<U+FB02>uence whatever upon the contraction, think it           I
appears pretty clearly from a careful inspection of the di<U+FB02>erences
tabulated in the fourth column that this is not actually the case. Four
pairs of observations agree exactly; once only the retraction with the

current seems to be greater than without it, while in the ten remaining
pairs the retraction is slightly greater without the current than with
it. It may, perhaps, be fairly concluded that the current has a real but
very small e<U+FB01>ect in diminishing the retraction. Now have before        I
remarked that the degree of retraction which nickel undergoes when
magnetised is materially affected by comparatively small changes of
temperature : the retraction of the same specimen has been found to
be greater in a cold room than in a warm one, at least in <U+FB01>elds up to
400 or 500.         Probably this is to be explained by the in<U+FB02>uence of
heat in diminishing the magnetic susceptibility of nickel, the retrac
tions being really the same for the same intensity of magnetisation.
Such small effect as appears to be produced by the action of the
current may, therefore, be accounted for simply by the rise of tem
perature (2°‘6) which it causes.
   Tension has a large effect upon the magnetic retraction of nickel :*
it is, therefore, the more remarkable that the action of a current,
which operates so markedly upon iron, should in nickel be practically
insensible.

 tabulated in the fourth column, it appears that the e<U+FB01>ect of the
 current is to increase the retraction very slightly.
    According to Rowland the susceptibility of cobalt is increased by
 heating. The small additional retraction indicated when the current
 was passing was, therefore, no doubt due to the increased suscepti
 bility consequent upon current heating.           It may be noted that
 tension seems to have no material e<U+FB01>ect upon the magnetic retraction
 of cobalt.*
                                   Summary.
    In an iron wire carrying a current, the maximum magnetic elonga
 tion is greater, and the retraction in strong <U+FB01>elds is less, than when
 no current is passing.     The effect of the current is opposite to that
 of tension.
    The magnetic retractions of nickel and of cobalt are not sensibly
 a<U+FB01>ected by the passage of a current through the metals. (Tension
 considerably modi<U+FB01>es the magnetic retraction of nickel, but not that
 of cobalt.)

                                 (Abstract)
    This paper gives    the method of experiment and results obtained in
some      investigations on the time-rate of rise of current in a circuit
having large electromagnetic inertia.          The experiments were made
on a circuit containing the coils of a large electromagnet having
laminated cores and pole pieces.          The, mean length of the iron
circuit was about 250 cm. and its cross section 320 sq. cm.          The
magnetising coil had 3840 turns, when all joined in series, and a
resistance of 1011! ohms.     The coils were so arranged that they could
be joined in a variety of ways so as to vary the resistance, inductive
coe<U+FB02>icient, &c., and also to allow the magnet to be used either as an
open or a closed circuit transformer.
    The electromotive force used in the experiments was obtained from
a storage battery, and the method of experiment was to trace the
curve, giving the relation of current to time, on a chronograph
sheet.
    One set of experiments shows the effect of varying the impressed
            on the time required for the current to attain any given per
centage of its maximum strength.           The results show that for any
particular percentage there is always a particular            which takes

 maximum time.       Thus for the circuit under consideration, and with
 successive  repetitions of the current in the same direction, it takes
 longer time for the current produced by an impressed E.M.F. of
 4 volts to reach 95 per cent. of its maximum than it takes for the
 current produced by either 3 or 5 volts to reach 95 per cent. of their
 maximum.      The results show also that, within considerable limits,
 the time required for the current to become uniform is on the whole
 nearly inversely proportional to the impressed E.M.F., and that for
 moderate values of the           the time may be very great; when the
 E.M.F. was 2 volts, and the current sent in such a direction as to
 reverse the magnetism left in the magnet by a previous current of
 the same strength, the time required for the current to establish
 itself was over three minutes. The di<U+FB01>erence of time required for
 repetition and for reversal of previous magnetisation was also very
 marked when the iron circuit was closed.        The results show that
 great errors may arise by the use of ballistic methods of experiment,
 especially when weak currents are used, and that for testing re
sistances of circuits containing electromagnets, a saving of time may
be obtained by using a battery of considerable E.M.F.
    Another set of experiments gives the e<U+FB01>ect of successive reversals
of the impressed E.M.F. at suf<U+FB01>cient intervals apart to allow the
magnetisation to be established in each direction before reversal
began.     In this set also the e<U+FB01>’ect of cutting out the battery and
leaving the magnet circuit closed is illustrated, showing that several
minutes may be required for the magnet to lose its magnetism by
dissipation of energy in the magnetising coil. The e<U+FB01>ect on these
cycles of leaving an air space in the iron circuit is also illustrated.
It is shown that a comparatively small air space nearly eliminates
the residual magnetism and diminishes considerably the rate of
variation of the coef<U+FB01>cient of induction and the dissipation of energy
in the magnet.
    Several cycles are shown for the magnet used as a transformer
with diiferent loads on the secondary. The results give evidence
that there is less energy dissipated in the iron the greater the load
on the secondary of the transformer.
    Some experiments are also quoted which go to show that the
dissipation of energy due to magnetic retentiveness (magnetic
hysteresis) is simply proportional to the total induction produced
when the measurements are made by kinetic methods.         Reference is
made to the recent experiments of Alexander Siemens and others
which seem to con<U+FB01>rm this view.

   The respiratory organ or pharynx of the Tunicata exhibits a great
amount of variability in form, size, and complexity of structure in the
di<U+FB02>erent members of the group—a variability which is obviously cor
related with the physiological value of the organ. In the simplest
forms, the Perennichordata or Appendicularians, the pharynx is a
mere hollow cylinder, provided with a single pair of tubular gill
clefts, one on each side.    In the higher forms (the Caducichordata)
the cavities of the two gill-clefts become enormously dilated, so as to
constitute a pair of peribranchial chambers interposed on either side
between the pharynx and the body-walls.           The dilatation of the gill
clef'ts to form peribranchial chambers can be aptly compared with the
formation of branchial pouches in the tubular gill-clefts of Marsipo
branch Fishes. But whereas the respiratory surface of the branchial
pouches of Marsipobranchs is increased by folds of the walls of the
pouches, the same purpose in the higher Tunicata is e<U+FB01>ected by a
di<U+FB01>erent means.       The inner (visceral) walls of the peribranchial
chambers apply themselves closely to the wall of the pharynx, and
perforations then appear at numerous points, where the pharyngeal
and peribranchial membranes have actually united.             The remnants
of the pseudo-coelomic cavity, enclosed between the pharynx and the
visceral walls of the peribranchial chambers, become extensive
channels for a vigorous circulation of the haemal <U+FB02>uid.          The organ
formed by the union of the pharyngeal and peribranchial walls is
                           “                  ”
usually referred to as the branchial sac ; and the perforations, which
put the cavity of the pharynx into extensive communication with the
                                                      “
peribranchial chambers, constitute the so-called stigmata.”
   The stigmata vary much in form and arrangement. In the <U+FB01>xed
Ascidians, whether simple or compound, they are usually simple slits,
of a narrow elongated form, arranged in a series of rows placed
transversely to the longitudinal axis of the body (Ascidia, Olavelina,
Botryllus, Styela). In some genera, however (Corella, Molgula), the
stigmata are curved and somewhat spirally arranged; but this con
dition is undoubtedly derived from the former by modi<U+FB01>cations of a
secondary nature. In the pelagic Tunicata (Salpa, Doliolum, Anchinia,
Pyrosoma), the condition met with in the <U+FB01>xed Ascidians is never
found ; there is never more than one row of stigmata on each side,
and this row, though occasionally oblique or even transverse, is

 usually longitudinal in direction.           In Pyrosoma and some species of
 Doliolum the stigmata are narrow, elongated slits, extending trans
 versely across the whole lateral face of the pharynx—each                       stigma
 occupying an area which            in the   <U+FB01>xed  Ascidians     is taken up by an
 entire transverse row of stigmata.
     To ascertain what is the fundamental order underlying all these
 variations, and to determine what degree of correspondence and
 homology there is between the stigmata of the pelagic Tunicata and
 these of the <U+FB01>xed Ascidians, is not an easy matter; indeed, the possi
 bility of any detailed comparison hardly seems to have occurred to
 the majority of investigators.            Two views, due to Herdman and
 Lahille respectively, are, however, worthy of mention here.
    Professor Herdman“ derives Pyrosoma from a group of the com
pound Ascidians, through the curious colonial form Gwlocm-mus
Huxleyi; and, in harmony with this view, he regards each of the
transverse stigmata of Pyrosoma as corresponding to an entire trans
verse row of stigmata in the Ascidians, the several stigmata of the
row having apparently coalesced to form the single stigma of Pyrosoma
—a process which has almost certainly occurred in certain deep-sea
types (Fungulus,         Culeolus, &c.).
    Lahille'l'  characterises    the latter portion of Herdman’s view as a
“                error,”  and   attempts, instead, to establish the remarkable
   profound
proposition that the longitudinal              row of transverse stigmata in
Pyrosoma is strictly homologous with one of the transverse rows of
longitudinal stigmata in an Ascidian, through a phylogenetic rotation
of position. The oblique position of the row of stigmata in some
species of Dol'iolum. (e.g., D. Ehrenberg'i) is regarded as an intermediate
condition between the two extremes.              Lahille bases this proposition
upon the changes of position which the organs of a Pyrosoma~bud
undergo during development.               These changes, it is true, are very
remarkable, but they furnish absolutely no evidence for Lahille’s
contention; for it is a well-established factI that immediately after
their <U+FB01>rst appearance the stigmata of Pyrosoma, begin to elongate in
a direction at right angles to the long axis of the endostyle, and this
relation is maintained through all the curious changes of form which
the bud undergoes in its further development.                Lahille’s homologies
are consequently without foundation ; and, although Herdman’s com
parison is far more justi<U+FB01>able, yet the development of the transverse

 1892.]            Development      of  the Stigmata     in Ascidians.            507
stigmata in Pyrosoma clearly tends to show that these are simple
structures, and that they have not arisen by the modi<U+FB01>cation of so
many transverse rows of stigmata, as his theory demands.
    The question is thus seen to be still unsolved, and if in this commu
nication I venture to offer some observations upon the matter, it is
in the belief that they tend considerably to elucidate the problem.
    The view that the pelagic Caducichordate Tunicata have been pro
foundly modi<U+FB01>ed in structure through their mode of life, and that they
are to be derived phylogenetically from the so-called Compound Asci
dians, is at present held, with varying reservations, by almost every
recent investigator of the Tunicata, except Seeliger. It is held by
Grobben and Uljanin for Pyrosoma, Salpa, and Doliolum, by Herdman
for Pyrosoma, by Lahille for Pyrosoma and Doliolum, and by Salensky
for Pyrosu'ma and Salpa. The evidence for this view has always seemed
to me to be very slender and unimportant; and                    I believe it is this
widely-spread conception which is answerable, among other things,
for   the absence of any satisfactory comparison between                the stigmata
of the <U+FB01>xed Ascidians and of their pelagic allies.
    I  have accordingly approached the question from the reverse point of
 view, believing that, by a study of the development of the stigmata in
the <U+FB01>xed Ascidians, recapitulative stages would be met with which
would furnish the desired answer.                   A grant awarded me by the
 Government Grant Committee last year enabled me, during the
summer, to collect suitable material at the Plymouth station, and my
observations have been completed in Professor Milnes Marshall's
laboratories at the Owens College.
    The development of the stigmata in the larva and oozooid of
Ascidians has hitherto been very little investigated. The earliest
complete account is that of Krohn<U+FB01>‘ an abstract of whose observa
tions upon Phallusia mammillata is given by Balfour (‘ Comp. Emb.,'
vol. 2, p. 20). Krohn’s interpretations were subsequently criticised
                                                                              “
by E. van Beneden and Julio in their valuable paperj' on the Post
embryonic Development of Phallusia (Asc'idiella ?) soabro'ides.”                These
investigators showed that in the latter species two stigmata at <U+FB01>rst
appear, one behind the other, on each side of the pharynx, and that
subsequently new stigmata arise between and behind the two <U+FB01>rst,
until a longitudinal row of six stigmata is formed on each side.
These stigmata enlarge transversely to the long axis of the body, and
subsequently subdivide, in the order of their formation, so as to con
stitute a corresponding number of transverse rows of smaller stigmata.
Van Beneden and Julin thus drew a distinction between primary'
stigmata and secondary (de<U+FB01>nitive) stigmata, and called attention to
the irregular order of formation of the primary stigmata as a point

worthy of notice. They did not, however, draw any general conclu
sions from the phenomena which they observed, beyond pointing out
that the irregular order in which the primary stigmata appeared
was in opposition to any theory as to their metameric arrange
ment.
      The only other observations of importance are those of Seeliger“
on the development of the stigmata in Clacelina.   In this form, as in
Phallusia and Mnlgulaj two pairs of stigmata at <U+FB01>rst arise, one behind
the other, near the dorsal border of the sides of the           pharynx. But
    instead of elongating in a transverse direction, as is the case in
    Phallusin, these stigmata elongate in a longitudinal direction, and
    become directly converted into the stigmata of the adult.        With the
    downward extension of the peribranchial chambers, new stigmata
    arise independently, below the two <U+FB01>rst formed, so that eventually
    two transverse rows of perforations are formed on each side of the
    pharynx; and all these. by growth in a longitudinal direction, become
    directly converted into the slit-like stigmata of the adult.          Sub
    seq uently, after the attachment of the larva, new transverse rows of
     stigmata arise in front of and behind the two <U+FB01>rst rows in an iden
    tical manner.
       I  have myself followed out the development of the stigmata in
     Clavelina, and have nothing to add to, or alter in, Seeliger’s descrip
     tion; the stigmata invariably arise quite independently, and         have       I
     seen no indication of such a process of subdivision as has been
     described above for Phallusia (Ascidiella ?) scab'roi'des.
        A similar independent mode of origin of the stigmata has also been
    observed by GiardI in Perophora, and by Lahille§ in Distaplz'a magni
    larva.
        Thus, up to the present time, we are acquainted with three distinct
     genera in which the stigmata arise independently of one another;
     while the process of subdivision, described for Phallusia (Ascidiella                     .7)
     scabro'ides, remains uncon<U+FB01>rmed and entirely without parallel. It
     would even be excusable to regard this latter method, from its excep
     tional character, as developmental modi<U+FB01>cation of the former.

     Phallusia ” scabroi'des, but presents distinctive features of consider
  able importance.
      In the earliest stage which has come under my observation, the
  young zooid (B. auroli'neatus, Giard) is already <U+FB01>xed and is provided
  with the rudiments of two buds, one on each side. The endodermic
  vesicles of the buds as yet show no signs of differentiation. The zooid
  itself possesses the rudiments of two lateral tentacles only, and is pro
   vided with the eight club-shaped ectodermic processes, with long
   stalks, which are so characteristic of the larva.
       The pharynx is provided with four pairs of transversely elongated
   stigmata, whose transverse diameters are nine times as great as their
   antero-posterior diameters.        These huge transverse slits. whose width
   almost equals the length of the endostyle, extend right across the
   sides of the pharynx, from the dorsal region to the endostyle.              They
   are not exactly of equal size, but decrease slightly in width in regular
   order from before backwards. The second slit is 02 mm. wide. The
   endostyle at this stage is 0'25 mm. long.
       In the next stage examined (B. enrol-'neatus) the endodermic
   vesicle of each bud is already differentiated into a median pharyngeal
   portion and a pair of lateral peribranchial portions. The oozooid has
   now the rudiments of four tentacles, and the number of ectodermic
   processes has increased to eleven, the separate stalks being now very
   short.
       The pharynx possesses, in place of the four pairs of transversely
   elongated stigmata, four transverse rows of small stigmata on each
'
   side.   The anterior row is 0'42 mm. wide, the second row is 0'35 mm.
   wide, and the two posterior rows are still narrower. The endostyle
   at this stage is 0'425 mm. long. The <U+FB01>rst row consists of 10 stigmata,
   the second of 8 stigmata, the third of 6 or 7, the fourth of still fewer.
   None of the stigmata are elongated transversely; they are, for the
   most part, of an oval form, slightly elongated longitudinally, but
   towards the dorsal side they are more or less circular.
       At a still more advanced stage (sp. incert.) the oozooid has attained

  very large dimensions, the number of ectodermic processes has in
  creased to 36, and each of the lateral buds has given origin to a pair
  of buds of the second generation. At this stage there are <U+FB01>ve rows
  of stigmata on each side; but whether the <U+FB01>fth row is formed by the
                                                          I
  subdivision of a transverse primary stigma, or not, have been unable
 to determine.
      This is the most advanced stage in the progressive development of
 the oozooid of Botryllus that      I  have seen, and there is reason to
 believe that the number of rows of stigmata does not increase after
 this point. In a young colony, very little older than the one just
 described, the oozooid has undergone great reduction in size, and is
 evidently dying away, while the two buds of the <U+FB01>rst generation, to
 which it gave rise, have grown considerably in size, and are almost
 fully   organised.
     It is perfectly clear from the above account that in Botryllus the
 stigmata of the full-grown oozooid are secondary formations, due to
 the subdivision of a series of transversely elongated primary stigmata
 with which the larva is provided. It is also noteworthy that the
 primary stigmata—if an inference may be drawn from their relative
 sizes—arise one after another in regular order from before backwards,
 and that they are subsequently subdivided in the same order.
     It will be convenient to distinguish the transversely elongated
 primary stigmata by some distinctive name, and on this account
 I  p1 opose for them the term
                                  “
                                    protostigmata.”     It cannot be denied
 that these structures present striking analogies with the true gill
 clefts of Amphioaeus and the lower Vertebrata.
     Turning now to the buds of Botryllus, a remarkable difference is to
 be observed in the mode of origin of the stigmata, a difference which
 has important bearings upon the question of their phylogenetic
 history.    Transverse protostigmata are never formed in the buds,
 whatever be the, number of the generation to which the buds belong.
 The stigmata of the four <U+FB01>rst rows arise almost simultaneously as
 small rounded perforations which are entirely independent of one
another; they soon begin to elongate in an antero-posterior direction
 and rapidly assume their de<U+FB01>nitive form.
    Botryllus, therefore, exhibits both the modes of development which
are known to occur in Ascidians ; the stigmata in the oozooid
arise by the subdivision of protostigmata, and the stigma-ta of the
buds appear quite independently of one another. This fact renders it
possible to determine which method is the more primitive.           In any
contrast of this sort between larval and bud development, there can
be no doubt that it is the larva which exhibits the primitive mode,
while the development in the bud is secondary and modi<U+FB01>ed.
   Now the development of the stigmata in the oozooids of Clavelina
and Distaplia proceeds in essentially the same manner as       in the buds

 1892.]               Development       of   the   Stigmata in Ase-idiom.       511
  of Botryllus ,- and there can be, accordingly, just as little doubt that
   the development presented by the oozooids of these forms is also
  secondarily abbreviated.       This conclusion is corroborated by the
  facts that in these genera and their allies the ova contain more food
  yolk than is usual in Ascidiaus, and that the duration of the free
, swimming larval stage is greatly reduced.
      It is therefore obvious that the primitive (phylogenetic) mode of
   development of the stigmata in Ascidians is by the subdivision of
   transverse protostigmata arranged in a single longitudinal series on
  each side of the pharynx.
      I have observed this process in two other species of Ascidians,
  Thylacium sylvani (Carus)* and Styela (Styelopst's) grossularia (van
  Beneden).       These two species are very closely allied, and exhibit no
  appreciable differences in their mode of development.
      In Titylacium, sylvam' eight protostigmata arise on each side of the
  pharynx, and become subdivided, in regular order from before back
  wards, to form a corresponding number of rows of secondary stigmata.
  The protostigmata extend right across the sides of the pharynx, as in
  Botryllus, before they are subdivided;          and, although    have not I
  actually observed their earliest stages, they give every appearance of
  having been formed in regular order from before backwards.             The
  subdivision of the protostigmata begins towards their dorsal extremi
  ties and then extends ventrally—a process which compares very well
  with the formation of the stigmata in Ulrwel'ina.       In the pharynx, at
  an early post~larval stage, and after the subdivision of the protostig
  mata has commenced, the actual nature of the process can easily be
  observed.      Small projections arise from the anterior margins of the
  protostigmata, and are met by corresponding outgrowths from their
  posterior margins; the tips of these projections then coalesce with
 one another, and by their union give rise to the so-called inter-stig
 matic bars of the fully constituted branchial sac. The shape of the
 secondary stigmala during the process of subdivision is often very
 irregular, but an admirable symmetry and regularity of form and
 arrangement is presented as soon as the subdivision is completed.
     The following numbers illustrate the regular order in which the
  protostigmata are subdivided.            They represent the numbers of
  secondary stigmata     into  which   the  protostigmata of one side have
  become converted in a pharynx 1'125 mm. long and 2'5 mm. in cir
 cumference,      at a period when the sligmata of the <U+FB01>rst row have
 already assumed the form of narrow, longitudinally elongated slits :—

specimen of this species, which is in the collection of the Oxford University
Museum.   It was very erroneously described by its discoverer, and a redescription
of    it,   which
               I    have prepared,   will   be published   shortly.

    The regular development of the protostigmata in Botryllus and
Thylacium contrasts markedly with the phenomena observed in
“Phallusia,” scabrot'des by van Beneden and Julin, but it is very
probable that the irregularity of formation in that species is the
result of secondary changes.            It may,     I  think, be safely concluded
that the protostigmata      of  Ascidians     arose   primitively   in regular order
from before backwards.
   It is very signi<U+FB01>cant that in the pelagic Tunicate Py'rosoma the
phylogenetic inferences which have here been drawn from the de.
 velopment of the stigmata in Ascidians are exactly ful<U+FB01>lled.                  In this
form—as     I  have stated   in the  introduction—the         Stigmata  are  arranged
in a single longitudinal series along each side of the pharynx, and
they are transversely elongated, from the dorsal surface to the endo
style.   They therefore resemble precisely, both in form and in
arrangement, the protostigmata of larval Ascidians.                     Moreover, it
appears from the recent researches           of  Salensky‘l"   that  the stigmata. in
the ascidiozooids of Pyrosoma arise in regular order from before
backwards, just as do the protostigmata in Butryllus and Thylacz'u'm,
These resemblances are of too important a character to be mere
coincidences.     I would therefore submit that in Pyrosoma we have a.
primitive type of Caducichordate Tunicata, which is antecedent to the
whole of the phylum Ascidiacea, and which exhibits very closely the
ancestral form of pharynx from which the complicated respiratory
organ of the <U+FB01>xed Ascidians has been derived.
   it would further follow that Claveli'na and its allies can no longer

     intestinalz's and Clauelina lepadiformis.” By ARTHUR VVILLEY,

     M.A., F.R.S.             Received May 4, 1892.
   The following is an account of some of the observations which
were made by the author during an occupation of the British Asso
ciation Table at the Zoological Station at Naples from October, 1891,
to May, 1892.
   In their admirable “ Recherches sur la Morphologie des Tuniciers,"
(‘Archives de Biologie,’ vol. 6, 1887), Edouard van Beneden and
Charles Julin came to a number of conclusions which, while they
appeared to follow naturally from the facts observed, yet only added,
if possible, to the perplexity surrounding any attempt to regard the
Ascidians and Amphicmus from a common standpoint.        Led away by
the remarkable behaviour of the endostyle which         observed andI
described in the larva of Amphioxus, I easily induced myself to accept
the views of the Belgian savwnts. _
   The observations on the post-embryonic development of Giana
described below oblige me, however, to reconsider .the position
which    I took in my paper on “The Later Larval Development of
Amphiowus” (‘ Quart. Journ. Micro. Sci.,’ vol. 32, 1891), with regard
to the mutual relations of the Ascidians and Amphiowus, and may, I
hope, tend to the establishment of reasonable homologies between
them.
  It is necessary to recapitulate very brie<U+FB02>y the views of van
Beneden and Julin, in order to bring those which I am about to
oppose to them in the most striking contrast.

    Of   the above propositions, the last may be true       ; but I shall proceed
 to show that the others are untenable.
                         Fixation of the Larva of Ciona.
    Just   before the larva <U+FB01>xes itself. a narrow space can be discerned
between the anterior end of the endoderm             and the tract of ectoderm
which bears the adhering papillae; and in it lies a compact group               of
mesoderm       cells.
    Shortly after <U+FB01>xation this space swells up prodigiously, and then
contains loose scattered mesoderm cells.              I shall call this the pro.
bowie-cavity.       At its base   i.e., where  it joins on to the body) lies the
endostyle dorso-ventrally.          The primary position of the endostyle is
extremely important.          It behaves exactly as it does in the larva of
Amphiomus, in that it occupies at <U+FB01>rst the most anterior region of the
alimentary canal, and lies at right angles to the position which it
assumes later.
   In fact, the trunk of the young <U+FB01>xed Ascidian undergoes an
actual rotation through an angle of 90° as the result of which the
month, which was at <U+FB01>rst dorsal, becomes terminal, and the endostyle
takes up its de<U+FB01>nite longitudinal position at the base of the branchial
sac.
   In comparing the accompanying <U+FB01>gures (1 and 2) the attention
should, <U+FB01>rst of all, be concentrated on the endostyle, and then the
structures which precede and follow it in both cases should be taken
into consideration. When that is done,            I think the inadmissibility of
van Beneden’s and Julin's view of the homology of the <U+FB01>rst, pair of
gill-slits (primary branchial canals) of Ascidiars with the proboscis
cavity and prseoral pit of Amphiozus (anterior intestinal diverticula)
will at once become evident.
   In Olavelina. the behaviour of the proboscis-cavity is essentially
the same as in Giana.
                Origin of   the Gill-slits in Ciona and Clavelina.
   The post-larval appearance of the gill-slits of the simple          Ascidi ans
has been studied to a certain extent only by P. J. van                 Beneden,

separated   itfrom the rest.   Such a gill-slit, however, exists, and                        I
will now describe it.
  Starting with the stage in which two oval apertures are present on
each side (in Giana), we <U+FB01>nd that, as time goes on, these elongate very
considerably in the transverse direction, and eventually         become
twisted round in a curious way at their distal ends (that is, the ends
towards the endostyle), and <U+FB01>nally a small portion becomes con
stricted off from the distal end of each of the original slits (<U+FB01>g.
   In this way, therefore, we arrive at the stage with four brancbial

6th, &c.) arise by independent perforation.
   The point is now to determine the origin of the <U+FB01>rst two slits,
and this' is by no means easy. By the study of great numbers of
living specimens, and more especially of horizontal sections,                 I have
convinced myself that the following is what takes place.                 It has been
known for many years that the slits of Amphiowus become each di
vided into two halves by the formation of a tongue-bar.                       In the
larva, however, the unpaired slits are simple, and remain simple
till near the endiof the period of metamorphosis.                       During this
period the slits of the second row make their appearance, and very
soon afterwards, the primary slits being still simple, tongue-bars
begin to form in the secondary slits.            Thus in this case the tongue-
bars are considerably hastened in their development. If, now, they
were hastened a little more, what we should see would be that the
two halves of the slit would become independently perforated. This
is actually what occurs in Ciona.         I have very convincing evidence for
this point   of  view,  which   I  hope to produce in detail, accompanied by
<U+FB01>gures, later. The <U+FB01>rst four stigmata, therefore, are derived from,
and represent, one gill-slit.
   The primary branchial canals of van Beneden and ulin are simply J
the <U+FB01>rst pair of gill-slits. The atrial involutions are at <U+FB01>rst nothing
but the ectodermic portions of a pair of gill-slits. They remain per
manently in this condition in Appendicularia; but in the <U+FB01>xed
Ascidians they become secondarily expanded to form a distinct
chamber. The view of van Beneden and Julin, that the visceral
wall of the atrium is endodermic, while the parietal wall is ecto
dermic,    I consider to be unfounded.

518             Mr. A. \Villey.      On  the  Post-Embryonic        [May  19,
   The walls of the atrial chamber are apparently derived essentially
from the ectoderm.
   The <U+FB01>rst pair of gill-slits which becomes sub-divided           in the re
markable way above described (totally di<U+FB02>’erent from the transverse
sub-division which they subsequently undergo), is present in a simple
undivided form in Appendicularia, and           I consider it, both from its
position and from its specialised character, to be undoubtedly homo
logous with the <U+FB01>rst pair of gill-slits in Amphiomus, which disap
pear at the close of the larval period.              Both in Ciona and in
Amphioasus   this <U+FB01>rst   pair of slits alone   serves  for the respiration of
the larva (or, in the case of Giana, young individual) for several
weeks, during which the size of the animal is increased, but no new
organs are added.       In other words, there is a resting stage in the
development of Amphiozns and Giana, which is characterised in both
cases by the presence of a single pair of gill-slits, namely, the <U+FB01>rst
pair.
    By the <U+FB01>rst pair of gill-slits of Amphiowus,      I refer to the <U+FB01>rst gill
slit proper, and to the club-shaped gland. I have on a former occa
sion given cogent reasons for regarding these two structures as a pair
of gill-slits.
    In Giana, at a later stage, the primary stigmata, whose origin has
just been described, become divided in the usual way and give rise to
 the transverse rows of stigmata. In Clavelina these transverse rows
 of stigmata form in the <U+FB01>rst instance, each aperture being an independent
perforation.    Here, then, we have unequivocal evidence of consider
able modi<U+FB01>cation in the direction of a shortening of the develop
 ment in the case of Clavelina; and we meet with similar evidence at
 every turn.
         Origin of Pericardium and Heart in Ciona and Clavelina.
    With regard to the origin of the pericardium, my observations
 appear to con<U+FB01>rm, in the main, the account given by van Benedeu
       J
 and ulin as to its being eudodermic; but, as I have never succeeded
 in <U+FB01>nding karyokinetic <U+FB01>gures in connexion with its development, a
 precise statement as to its mode of appearance             is not at present
 possible.
    In Olavelina, where it is comparatively easy to be persuaded of its
 endodermic origin, it arises at a much earlier stage in the development
 of the larva than it does in Ciona.       In the former it arises before the
 formation of the body-cavity, while in the latter there is a wide body
 cavity present at the time of its <U+FB01>rst appearance, containing loose
 mesoderm cells; and the failure to <U+FB01>nd nuclear spindles, combined
 with the extraordinarily small size of the object in transverse section,
 renders it extremely dif<U+FB01>cult to assign its origin to the endoderm

  with certainty, although, from the appearances presented, and also
 from the analogy of Clavelina, it is probable that it arises in the same
  way in both cases.
     The formation of the heart presents interesting differences in the
  two forms. In Olavel'ina, as already shown by van Beneden and
  Julin, the septum which, at <U+FB01>rst, divides the pericardium into two
  halves breaks down, and the heart forms as an involution of the
  dorsal wall of the pericardium.     In Giana the septum does not break
  down, and the heart forms by a splitting apart of the two layers
  which compose the septum.
                                 Conclusions.
     What    has been said above is enough to show that the development
 of   Giana, presents much more primitive features than that of Clavelina.
 It   now remains to compare the conditions in Giana with those that
 obtain in Amphiozeus, and to seek to establish the true homologies
 between the various parts.
                           I
     In Amphiowus, what propose to call the proboscis-cavity is lined
 by a <U+FB02>at epithelium, and so is the rest of the body-cavity. In (Mona,
 the proboscis-cavity contains loose mesoderm cells in place of an
 epithelium, and so does the rest of the body-cavity.       The distinction
 between mesoderm and mesenchym is no longer generally recognised
                                                               ‘
 as fundamental.
     The presence of the prie-oral pit as a pair to the proboscis-cavity
 of Amphiozus seems, at <U+FB01>rst sight, to present a dif<U+FB01>culty in the way
 of the comparison which I am making; but it is not so serious as
 might be supposed, and, for the rest, I need only refer here to what
occurs in di<U+FB01>erent species of Balunoglossus.
     In instituting any comparison between the Ascidians and Amphi
orus, the endostyle should be taken as the starting point, and the
fact should be remembered that its primary axis is perpendicular to
its de<U+FB01>nitive axis in both cases.
    Making allowance for the secondary change of position which the
month has undergone in the larva of Amphiowus, in correlation with
the forward extension of the notochord, we <U+FB01>nd, therefore, that the
relative position of the various organs from before backwards is pre
cisely the same in Oiona and in Amphiomus, namely, (1) proboscis
cavity, (2) endostyle, (3) month, (4) <U+FB01>rst pair of gill-slits.     _
    It should be remarked that the mesoderm which lies in the pro
boscis-cavity     of Uiona has a bilateral origin, corresponding more
or less closely to the pair of anterior intestinal diverticula of
Amphiowus.
    It is most important to establish the homology of the cavities of
Giana and Amphiomus on a sound basis. The endostyle admittedly
occupies the same position primarily in both animals.

   IF, then, the question be asked,    “What lies in front of the         endo
 style?”   the immediate response      is,   “In   both cases the proboscis
 cavity.”                                         _
 I    accordingly submit the following table of homologies        :—

                                             pit of Amphioxus.

    The homology of the club-shaped gland of Amphiozus with the
 intestine of Ascidians, as suggested by van Beneden and ulin, would

.seem, therefore, to be quite out of the question.
    It need hardly be pointed out that, the homologies which have
                                             if                         I
 advanced are really correct, then the relations between Amphiozus
 and the Ascidians become much less strained than they were on the
 views previously entertained.
 I    intend shortly to discuss the whole subject more elaborately in
 the pages of the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science.’

 VI. “The Human Sacrum.” By A. M. PATERSON, M.D., Pro
     fessor of Anatomy in University College, Dundee, St.
        Andrews  University.  Communicated by Professor D,                    J.
        CUNNINGHAM, D.Sc., F.R.S. Received April 18, 1892.
                                 (Abstract)
     Owing to the now classical investigations of Gegenbaur               and
   Frenkel, and the more recent researches of other observers, the several
   homologies of the vertebral column are distinctly understood.         The
iispeci<U+FB01>c or individual differences in the correlation of one region of
  the column to another can be adequately explained on the assumption
  of a suppression or excessive development of the potential costal
  element of the vertebral segment.       This costal element may be meta.
  moi-phosed    in different ways to suit the needs of the animal economy,
  and the variations in individual cases a<U+FB01>ect the segments at the ends
  ofa    series where the vertebrae of one region possess characters re
  sembling those of a neighbouring region. This hypothesis renders
  intelligible, not only the existence of cervical ribs, but also correlated
  variations of the thoracico-lumbar region, and abnormalities of the
  sacrum, di<U+FB02>erences in the number of bones, as well as asymmetry.
     During recent years this aspect of the subject and numerous

examples of abnormalities in the arrangement of the vertebral column
have been carefully       scrutinised in four important monographs.
Rosenberg’s    memoir has excited the most attention, as he has formu
lated the theory of a phylogenetic shortening of the human vertebral
column from behind forwards.         He relies for his conclusions upon
the examination of abnormalities of the vertebral column of man and
the higher apes, and the statement of Kdlliker, that the ilium in the
process of development at <U+FB01>rst articulates with hinder segments, and
gradually shifts forwards along the vertebrae to be connected with
segments placed more anteriorly.       Thus Rosenberg regards a human
vertebral column with an increased number of praesacral vertebrae as
                ”
an “ ancestral     form : a column with a diminution in the number of
                                     ”
praesacral segments as a “future        form, representing a more recent
phylogenetic process.      Topinard has recorded a number of observa
tions on vertebral abnormalities. He considers that anomalies in the
 thoracic and lumbar regions may be due to excess, default, or com
 pensatory variations; that the anomalies of the sacrum are always
 compensatory, depending partly upon the relation of the ilium to the
 vertebral column, and partly upon the atrophy and fusion of the
 caudal vertebrae.    He thus gives a quali<U+FB01>ed support to the notion of
intercalation and excalation of vertebrze, as far as the thoracic and
lumbar vertebra: are concerned.           Regalia and Holl both reject
                “ atavistic ”
 Rosenberg’s                   hypothesis as inadequate.       Regalia re
 gards thoracico-lumbar variations as caused by correlated variations
 in the position and proportions of the thoracic and abdominal viscera;
 and agrees with previous authors that lumbo-sacral and sacro-caudal
 abnormalities are due to alterations in the position of the iliiim in
 relation to the vertebral column. Holl, from embryological investi
 gations, considers that the sacrum, once formed, undergoes no altera
tions, and that the 25th vertebral segment is, as arule, the <U+FB01>rst
 sacral vertebra from the earliest time. He also asserts that the same
 segment (12. fulcralis) has in the great majority of cases in the adult
 the main attachment of the ilium.       He looks upon variations at the
 cephalic end of the sacrum as caused by changes in the position of
 the ilium ; variations at the caudal end, as associated with fusion of
the coccyx.
    The present memoir deals with the characteristics of the human
sacrum, its form and anomalies, its correlation to other regions of the
vertebral column in man and other mammals, its relation to the
spinal nervous system, and its ossi<U+FB01>cation, especially in relation to
that aspect of the question brought into prominence by Rosenberg’s
hypothesis.     The sacral index and the sacral curve are also dealt
with.
    The investigations have been made in        a series of 265 adult sacra
 and numerous foetal vertebral columns.           Of the adult    sacra, 36

 except     for   a de<U+FB01>ciency of the coccyx.    The material has been obtained
 from many sources: and I am specially indebted to Professor D. J.
 Cunningham, of Dublin, for the use of a large number of specimens,
 and notes and drawings of observations made by him on the subject.
     The conclusions arrived at are as under :—
     1. The examination of a large series of vertebral columns compels
 one to discard as inadequate the theory of “ intercalation
                                                                          ”
                                                                             and
 “ excalation ” to account for the variations in the number of verte
 braa in the several regions.         The hypothesis of inherent variability,
 of shifting of one region at the expense of another, fully explains the
 cases of individual variation.          The changes met with may be re
 garded as produced, not by the sudden (and anomalous) interposition
 or loss of a vertebral segment, but by a conversion of the segments
 of one region into those of another and contiguous region.
     2. (a.) There is a marked tendency on the part of the <U+FB01>rst sacral
 vertebra to be liberated from the rest of the sacrum. It retains its
 individuality more clearly than the other vertebrae, and frequently
 approximates in type to the lumbar series.
     (12.) The surface for articulation        with the ilium, while usually
 placed     on   the <U+FB01>rst two, and  a part of the third, sacral vertebra), varies
 considerably in position. The surface may be shifted backwards or
 forwards ; and the tendency is more marked towards a shifting in the
 caudal than the cephalic direction.
     (0.) The surface for attachment of the sacro-iliac ligaments is
 generally subdivided into two or three depressions, of which that on
the <U+FB01>rst sacral vertebra is, in the great majority of cases, the largest
and deepest.          The inference from this fact is that the <U+FB01>rst sacral
vertebra has usually the greatest responsibility in supporting the
ilium.
      ((1.) In the vast majority of cases there are <U+FB01>ve constituent bones
in the sacrum.          Increase to six is much more common than diminu
tion to four ; and increase by addition at the caudal end is apparently
much more common than by addition at the cephalic end.
    (e.) Asymmetry of the sacrum occurs frequently (8'3 per cent.). It
occurs in two forms: as either a sacro-coccygeal or a lumbo-sacral
vertebra ; and in two ways, by diminution or addition at either end
in the number of component bones. A sacro-coccygeal vertebra. is
more frequent than a lumbo-sacral; and asymmetry with addition is
more common than asymmetry with diminution in the number of
bones forming the sacrum.                                *
   (       The examples of correlated variationsof the several regions of'
the vertebral column indicate a greater tendency towards increase than
diminution in the total number of bones.            Increase is more common
than diminution in the number of bones in the praesacral, sacral, and

 caudal    regions respectively.     Increase in the sacral region is more
 common      by  abstraction from  the  caudal than from the lumbar series.
 Liberation of the <U+FB01>rst sacral vertebra is more common than assimila
 tion of the <U+FB01>fth lumbar vertebra; and assimilation of the <U+FB01>rst caudal
 vertebra is more common than liberation of the <U+FB01>fth sacral.            With
 regard to the sacrum particularly, there is found to be a certain limited
 and inherent variability in the position of the ilium, causing it to be
 shifted backwards or forwards in relation to the vertebral axis, and
 more frequently backwards than forwards.          There appear to be three
 separate in<U+FB02>uences acting upon the sacrum, and producing the di<U+FB02>er
 ences in number of bones, correlated variations, and asymmetry :—
 (1) fusion of the <U+FB01>rst caudal vertebra; (2) liberation of the <U+FB01>rst
 sacral vertebra, by a backward shifting of the ilium, along the
 vertebral axis; and (3) fusion of the last lumbar vertebra with the
 sacrum, by a forward shifting of the iliac attachment.          The <U+FB01>rst in
 fluence is most commonly seen, and may be exerted alone or along
 with the second. The second and third in<U+FB02>uences are opposed to one
 another. The former is more frequent than the latter, producing an
 additional lumbar, or a lumbo-sacral vertebra; the latter gives rise
 to a diminution in the number of free lumbar‘vertebrae, and may be
 accompanied      by the conversion of the last sacral into a sacro-caudal
 or caudal vertebra.
     (g.) A study of the ossi<U+FB01>cation of the vertebral mlumn leads to
 similar conclusions, and indicates the existence of inherent variability
 in the several regions, and a greater tendency to elongation than con
 traction of the vertebral column as a whole. The process of ossi<U+FB01>ca
 tion also shows that the ala of the <U+FB01>rst sacral vertebra (25th
spinal segment) is usually the <U+FB01>rst to ossify; which vertebra may
therefore be regarded as the one primarily responsible for the attach
ment of the ilium.         The exceptional cases occur in sacra showing
correlated variations or asymmetry, and indicate a greater tendency
on the part of the ilium to be shifted backwards than forwards.
    (h.) The evidence derived from a consideration of the vertebral
column in other vertebrates is unsatisfactory. The human spine holds,
with regard to correlated variations, a position intermediate between
anthropoid apes (in which they are very frequent) and quadrupeds
generally (in which they are rarely present) ; while asymmetry,
especially of the sacrum, may be looked upon as an essentially human
characteristic.
    (L) The examination of the correlation of the spinal nerves and
limb-plexuses with the vertebral segments shows both speci<U+FB01>c and
individual differences in this respect.          The individual differences
may     be classi<U+FB01>ed  under  three  types :—(1) a variation in the arrange
ment of     the nerves  without any   concomitant  variation in the vertebral
column ; (2) a variation in the vertebral column without any con
    von LI.                                                        2 N

524                       The Human Sacrum.                     [May  19,
comitant variation in the nerves; and (3) a coincident variation in
both nervous system and vertebral column. These varying relations
of the nervous system to the vertebral column diminish the value of
the spinal nerves in the determination of the serial homologies of the
vertebral segments.     Further information as to the relative frequency
of abnormalities in the disposition of the spinal nerves in the limb
plexuses and the relative frequency of the various modes of corre
lation of the spinal nerves and vertebral column is required before
adeq late conclusions can be formulated on this point.      One can only
indi ate the striking fact that all the examples of variation in the
arrangement of the spinal nerves in man and anthropoids are examples
pointing to an extension backwards of the limb-plexuses, by the
entrance into them of post-axially placed nerves.       The evidence of
the nervous system favours, therefore, the view rather of extension
backwards than forwards of the limbs in relation to the vertebral
column, as far as present knowledge enables us to judge.
   When all these points are considered together—the cases of libera
tion of the <U+FB01>rst sacral vertebra, the mode of articulation of the
ilium; the form of the ligamentous surface and the number of bones
forming the sacrum; the correlated variations; the examples of
asymmetry; and the evidence derived from a consideration of the
vertebral column in other vertebrates,        of the correlation of the
nervous system and the vertebral      column,   and of the development
and ossi<U+FB01>cation of the vertebral column in man—the array of facts
presented does not a<U+FB02>’ord much support to the theory of a phylo
genetic shortening of the vertebral column advocated by Rosenberg.
The conclusion to which these facts lead is rather that there is in
the human vertebral column a certain limited variability in the cor
relation of the several parts. The actual variations met with may
be in the direction of elongation or abbreviation of a particular
region, and more often produce elongation than contraction of the
preesacral region.    There is no evidence to show that any de<U+FB01>nite
 process of either shortening or lengthening of the vertebral column
 is going on phylogenetically.     The variations found are apparently
 individual peculiarities; which, however, taken together, indicate a
 tendency to elongation rather than contraction of the praesacral
 region.
    At the same time, these investigations give support to the view
 put forward by Rosenberg and Topinard, that a process of fusion
 of the rudimentary caudal vertebrae with the sacrum is going on,

Egyptians, 5 Hindoos, 8 Australians, and a small number of examples
of several other races.       The results obtained were compared with
those given by Professor Sir \Villiam Turner in his monograph on
the Human Crania and Bones of the Skeleton, collected during the

   The mean index calculated from the two series of observations,
disregarding sex, is 106'7; of the males alone, 103'5.          The human
sacrum is thus generally broader than long, as already known ; and
the female sacrum is relatively broader than the male.
   The races dealt with may be divided into three classes :—(a..) Those
distinctly dolichohierie, with a- sacral index below 100, including the
Kai<U+FB01>r, Hottentot, and Bushman.                 Those which may be called
sub-platyhieric, with an index between 100 and 106, including the
Andamanese, Australian,         Chinese, Tasmanian, and Negro races.
(0.) Those which     are  clearly platyhieric, with an index over 106, in
cluding American, ancient Egyptian, Melanesian and Polynesian,
Hindoo, European, and other races examined.
   4. The sacral curvature was examined in 236 cases, of which 82
were males, 38 females, and the rest of unknown sex.           The curve is
generally deepest opposite        the  third  sacral vertebra, and is more
deeply curved below than above that point. , It is not an equal and
uniform curve, but is <U+FB02>attened above, and possesses a more pro
nounced curvature below the third sacral vertebra. This occurs in
both sexes and in all races.         A promontory between the <U+FB01>rst and
second sacral vertebrae occurs frequently, in the majority of cases in
association with an additional sacral vertebra, and more often in the
male than in the female.
   The female sacrum is more frequently curved more deeply in the
upper part of the bone than the male sacrum.
   The actual depth of the curve, that is, the amount of curvature,
is greater in the male than in the female, irrespective of the absolute
size of the sacrum.       The amount of curvature is greatest in the
European    races, and,  apparently,   greater in the European and Mon
golian  races  than in  the  Negro   and Polynesian.

        OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
     SIR GEORGE AIRY was born on July 27, 1801, and died on January
  2, 1892.   It is not a possible task to compress into a few pages the
 ninety   years’ work of a great man; all that can be done is to indicate
 a few of his many achievements.       When his life is written it will be
 a book and not a pamphlet, and only then shall we understand how
 much of our scienti<U+FB01>c knowledge we owe to him.           The number of
 articles and memoirs which he' has communicated to the various
  Societies and journals in which he was interested are over <U+FB01>ve hundred
 in number. The <U+FB01>rst of these is a paper read to the Cambridge
 Philosophical Society, on November 25, 1822, on the use of silvered
 glass for the mirrors of re<U+FB02>ecting telescopes,      and the last is his
 Numerical Lunar Theory.        The date of the <U+FB01>rst paper is particularly
 interesting, for it is the year before he took his degree.     The last
 paper is also remarkable, for, remembering that the theory of the
 Moon is one to which some mathematicians have devoted nearly their
 whole lives, it shows the old man attacking a laborious problem with
 the energy of youth.
     Sir George was educated at private schools at Hereford and
 Colchester. His vacations from school were spent at the Hill Farm,
 near Playford. with the uncle by whose assistance he was enabled to
 go to Cambridge.      He never appears to have played cricket, or foot
 ball, or rowed, but be delighted in pedestrianism. We are told that,
 with a companion, he once attempted to walk from Playford to Bury
 St. Edmunds and back in the same day.          They reached Rushmere
 Church on their way home, but could not do the last mile and a half,
 and the journey had to be <U+FB01>nished in a cart sent to meet them.
    In 1819 he entered Trinity College, as a sizar, but it does not
appear that he was elected a scholar until he was in his third year.
 In 1823 he became Senior Wrangler and First Smith’s Prizeman. The
writer can remember that when, thirty years after that date, he
entered Cambridge, the story was still told amongst the under
graduates of how wonderfully Airy had answered in the examination.
Possibly nothing had been lost in the telling, but there must have
been some extraordinary excellence to have attracted such long con
tinued attention.
    As soon as he had taken his degree he began a life of ceaseless
scienti<U+FB01>c activity. Memoirs followed each other with ever increasing
rapidity, each bearing evidence of much thought and of considerable
                                                                 b

                                        ii
  work.    The subjects also were of the most varied kinds and on all
  parts of mathematical philosophy. At <U+FB01>rst he wrote chie<U+FB02>y for the
  Cambridge Philosophical Society; thus in March, 1824, he calculates
  the effect which the ring of Saturn produces on his <U+FB01>gure.        He tries
  to verify the curious observations of Herschel that this planet is pro
  tuberant between the poles and the equator, but he <U+FB01>nds that theory
  leads to an exactly opposite result.         The observations of Herschel
  were, however, considerably modi<U+FB01>ed by those of Bessel some years
  after. In another paper in the same year he discusses achromatic
  eye-pieces ; for this and his other papers on optical subjects, the Copley
  Medal of the Royal Society was adjudged to him in 1831. Soon after,
  he writes on the proper forms of the teeth of wheels, though, owing
  to the extensive use of iron where wood was formerly used, this
  subject has no longer the interest it“ once had.
     One of the most interesting papers written by him, about the year
  1825, is on a peculiar defect of his own eye and the mode of correcting
  it. He discovered that in reading he did not use his left eye.        Sup
  posing this to be due to habit, he endeavoured to read with the right
  eye shaded, but found he could not distinguish a letter at whatever dis
  tance' from the eye the characters were placed.        Some time after he
  made a further discovery, viz., that the image of a point formed by that
  eye was not circular but elliptical.      From this and other appearances
  be inferred that the refraction of the eye was greater in the vertical
  plane than in that at right angles.           To correct this it would be
  necessary to use a lens which would refract more powerfully the rays
  in one plane than those in the perpendicular plane. His idea was
  that the lens should have one surface cylindrical and the other
  spherical, and he describes at length his experiments to determine
  the proper radii. The result was so successful that he was able to
  read the smallest print at a considerable distance with the left eye
  as well as with the right.      In his subsequent papers be frequently
  returns to   this subject and   makes    several reports to the Society on
'
  the changes produced in his eye by lapse of time.
     In 1826, when Ivory criticised Laplace, Mr. Airy, in a paper contri.
  buted to the Cambridge Philosophical Society, was not afraid to in
  tervene between two such distinguished analysts when he thought that
   both had gone wrong. Mr. Airy was not indisposed to controversy;
   possibly it added a touch of life to his science.      We <U+FB01>nd him after
   wards engaged in many disputes, in all of which he was able to prove
   that he was a tough adversary. In this year, three years after his
   degree and ten years before he became F.R.S., he read his <U+FB01>rst paper
   before the Royal Society.     The subject was the much debated question
   of the <U+FB01>gure of    the Earth.    Alluding in it to the peculiar views of
   Ivory of <U+FB02>uid equilibrium, he was attacked by that mathematician
   in a somewhat arrogant manner.        This called forth from Mr. Airy a

                                      iii
                                                ‘
crushing reply, which he published in the         Philosophical Magazine
                                                                          ’
in  1827.
   It is, however,  impossible even to mention the names of the many
papers   of which  he  was the author.    The few which have been men
tioned above prove how soon after his degree he took a leading part
in the scienti<U+FB01>c work of the day. They show also how, from the vm y
beginning, his mind was turned to practical applications, leaving
aside any pure theorems of which ‘he did not see the immediate use.
   In 1826 Mr. Airy published his mathematical tracts, which almost
immediately became the standard text-book for students in the
University.    In the <U+FB01>rst edition we <U+FB01>nd only the lunar theory, the
<U+FB01>gure of the Earth, precession and the calculus of variations, the tract
on the planetary theory and that on the undulatory theory being
added in the second edition, 1831. As his object was to give a clear
statement of <U+FB01>rst principles, he put into the book just what was
wanted at the time he wrote, making his judgment with admirable
skill. The student world has now outgrown the book, but this is in
part due to the excellence of the teaching of the book itself. The
<U+FB01>rst tract, that on lunar theory, is interesting to Cambridge students
for another reason. The attention of the University had been so long
con<U+FB01>ned to the works of Newton that the analytical mode of treat
ment had been almost entirely neglected.          The methods of Newton
are, Mr. Airy remarks, beautiful, but they have all the imperfections
which necessarily accompany <U+FB01>rst attempts; for the explanation of
some of the lunar inequalities they are hardly sufficient, and for the
calculation of most they are quite inadequate. For other branches of
physical astronomy, such as the planetary theory, their inadequacy
has never been questioned.      In this tract he endeavours to lay before
the student an analytical view of the lunar theory, giving references
to the ‘ Principia ’ to show the connexion between the different systems.
The tract on the calculus of variations is the only one whichis purely
mathematical.       Though it does not go very far into the subjrct,
yet the author must have had a deep sense of the power of this
calculus, for he has used it in his physical papers, even in places
where simpler methods might more naturally have suggested them
selves to his mind.     In the preface he speaks of this calculus as the
most beautiful of all the branches of the differential calculus. 'l he
excellence of the tract on the undulatory theory is evident when we
remember the length of time in which it was regarded as the standard
text-book of the University.      When the other tracts, after a long life,
became antiquated, this one retained its popularity, and has been
reprinted several times by itself, and is even yet in use.
   Mr. Airy was elected a Fellow of Trinity College the year after his
degree. and later on in life he was chosen one of the three <U+FB01>rst
Honorary Fellows of the College, the others being Thirlwall and
                                                                 b 2

Tennyson. In 1826 he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathe
matics, but this professorship he soon exchanged for the Plumian, to
which he was appointed in 1828. According to the Calendar of that
date, his predecessor in of<U+FB01>ce merely gave lectures in the <U+FB01>rst half of
the midsummer term, while those of the former anasian Professor
are only vaguely referred to.     But these were greatly enlarged by
Mr. Airy, whose syllabus extends over forty-eight pages of print.
They comprise statics, dynamics, hydrostatics, and geometrical optics,
but their chief character seems to have been the theory of undula
tions.    Many of the experiments on polarised light whose mathe
matical theory is given in his tract on the undulatory theory were
exhibited here.    He appears to have been the <U+FB01>rst to introduce into
 Cambridge studies the beautiful theories of Fresnel. With these as
subjects, treated in his own skilful manner, we need not wonder at
the popularity of his lectures. Even after he had become Astronomer
 Royal, we learn from his <U+FB01>rst report to the Board of Visitors, that
application to the Admiralty had been made by several members of the
 University and by the Plumian Professorto allow him to give another
course of lectures at Cambridge.
     Along with the Plumian Professorship Mr. Airy undertook the
 duties of the Director of the Observatory.     He at once entered on
these arduous duties with his usual energy.      His efforts were well
seconded by the University, who at once raised the slender income
 of the professorship to an amount nearly double its former value.
 In the <U+FB01>rst volume of the ‘Astronomical Observations’ he tells us
 that he was induced to <U+FB01>x on a plan of publication very di<U+FB01>erent
from that of the ‘ Greenwich Observations.’ He remarks that the value
of unreduced observations is so small that to most persons they are
 absolutely useless. _ Few, who have not made observations, under
 stand how much time and calculation must be employed before they
 can be applied to any useful purpose.       On the average, the pre
 paratory steps and the observation of a transit occupy from <U+FB01>ve to
 ten minutes, while the complete reduction and discussion of the
 observations employ full half an hour.    The professor even said that
 if an offer was made of a mass of regular meridional observations un
 rednced, he would not think it worth acceptance.     In giving, there
 fore, the results, he was giving the produce of four or <U+FB01>ve times as
 much labour, necessarily irksome, as if he gave merely the un
 reduced observations.      The report for the year 1828 covered the
  interval of <U+FB01>ve months’ residence at the Observatory; he had no
  assistant, and every step from making the observations to revising the
  proof-sheets had to be done by himself alone.    Yet in April of the
  following year the report was published with all the necessary reduc
  tions.   This promptness is maintained in the succeeding years, and
  excited the admiration of M. Quetelet, the Director of the Obser

                                       V
 vatory at Brussels, who says, “Nous sommes a peine au milieu de
 1832, et déja nous possédons les observations de M. Airy, pour toute
 l’année 1831: et ce qui peut paraitre plus étonnant encore, toutes
 ces observations sont calculées et discutées avec soin.”
    It is interesting to observe the care with which he chose the objects
 to which he should turn his attention as an astronomer, and the
 constancy with which he stuck to his choice when once made.           The
 chief object, he says, must be such that it could be accomplished by
 a single unassisted observer, and yet be so important as to be of
 public use. After consideration he decided that the observations of
 planets had at that time been so neglected, that one who wished to
 revise the planetary tables would <U+FB01>nd himself destitute of the neces
 sary data on which to found his investigation.        As soon, therefore,
 as the Cambridge Observatory was placed under his direction, he
 made the observation of planets the leading object of his labours. He
                                   “
 says in one of his reports that     hardlya single observation of aplanet
has been lost when the transit was at such an hour that in the
 regular routine of observations it was practicable to observe it.” The
 wisdom of his choice is shown by the fact that his successor followed
 closely the same objects.      Other pressing wants in astronomy were
also present in his mind, and others again rose unexpectedly in the
 course of his work.     In reading his yearly volumes of observations,
one notices among other things the care which is taken to secure
accuracy.      N o labour is spared, no calculation is allowed to pass
 without repeated examination.       “ To
                                           observe all night and to calcu
               ”
 late all day    is the description of an astronomer’s duties given by an
 astronomer.      In the arrangement of his results, we notice, also, how
everything is subordinated to increasing their immediate utility as
 well as securing accuracy in their details.
    When Professor Airy <U+FB01>rst went to the Observatory the only large
instrument was a transit, though this was one of the best of its
kind.     So energetic an astronomer was not likely to be satis<U+FB01>ed with
this; accordingly in 1834 he obtained a large mural circle. In the
report for that year he describes the unexpected and annoying di<U+FB02>i
culties which arose in connexion with that instrument.        In the next
report we <U+FB01>nd that these di<U+FB02>iculties have been overcome by considering
that the effects of the discordance of zenith points on direct and
re<U+FB02>exiou observations are equal.       Later on the great Northumberland
equatoreal was added.        The establishment to work these was also
necessarily increased, and two assistants were given to him.
    Perhaps one of the most remarkable examples of Mr. Airy’s insight
into astronomical questions is his discovery of a new inequality in the
motions of Venus and of the Earth.          The attention of the Board of
Longitude having been directed to the state of the solar tables used
in the construction of the ‘ Nautical Almanac,’ he was desired to

                                    V1
 examine the discrepancies between the computed right ascensions oi
 the Sun and those observed at Greenwich. On making a comparison
between the discrepancies in the position of the Sun’s perigee as
 given by late observations with those given by the observations of
the last century, he concludes there must be some yet undiscovered
inequality which has been omitted from the calculations.         He soon
 discovered that this originated in the fact that thirteen times the
periodic time of Venus is so nearly equal to eight years that the term
depending on this phase received a multiplier of more than two
millions in integrating the diiferential equations.        On the other
hand, the coef<U+FB01>cient is of the <U+FB01>fth order with regard to the eccen
tricities and inclinations of the orbits. In the report on this paper
drawn up by Whewell and Lubbock for the Royal Society, it is
pointed out that no numerical calculation of a perturbation of the
<U+FB01>fth order had been executed, except in the case of Jupiter and
Saturn, where, as Laplace states, this labour, “ pénible par son exces
sive longueur,” had been performed by Burckhardt; and no calcula
tions of a new inequality of a high order, requiring to be placed in
the planetary tables, with a new argument, had been published since
that of the great inequality by Laplace in 1784. They conclude by
remarking that this is the <U+FB01>rst speci<U+FB01>c improvement in the solar
tables made by an Englishman since the time of Halley.           For this
brilliant investigation the Astronomical Society in 1833 awarded to
 its author their gold medal.    The whole of Professor Airy’s process
was afterwards veri<U+FB01>ed, <U+FB01>rst by Pontécoulant, and secondly by
Leverrier, and found to be correct.
    In the years 1831—32, Professor Airy, though so fully employed at
the Observatory, was yet able to make some important investigations
in the theory of light. Thus he communicates to the Cambridge
Philosophical Society a paper to show that the two rays produced by
the double refraction of quartz are elliptically polarised. This is s00n
followed by two or three papers on some phenomena connected with
Newton’s rings.      Just as Sir W. Hamilton afterwards predicted
internal and external conical refraction after studying the analytical
properties of the wave surface, so Professor Airy discovered these
phenomena by using Fresnel’s general formula for the intensity of
re<U+FB02>ected light.    When Newton’s rings are formed by light polarised
in a plane perpendicular to that of incidence between two substances
of diiferent refractive indices, and the angle of incidence lies between
the polarising angles, the rings should appear white centred, instead
of having a central dark spot.      Here was a recondite phenomenon
which could only be seen when several special conditions were satis<U+FB01>ed.
Would it be con<U+FB01>rmed by experiment? He describes the di<U+FB02>iculties
 of the experiment and its <U+FB01>nal success. As we read the paper, we
perceive how he is led on by slight unexpected discrepancies to

                                      vii
 improve the theory.      He remarks that there must be a gradual,
 though rapid, change of phase, instead of the sudden one given by
 Fresnel’s formula, thus seeing faintly a result clearly explained <U+FB01>ve
 years after by the theoretical investigations of Green.
    At this period of his life Professor Airy’s labours are evidently
 divided between astronomy and the theory of light.          The <U+FB01>rst was
 connected with his work at the Observatory, the second with his
 lectures as Professor.    Thus, in 1833, he writes in the ‘Cambridge
 Transactions’ on Newton’s experiments in diffraction; in 1835, on
 the diffraction of an object glass with a circular aperture; in 1838, on
 the intensity of light in the neighbourhood of a caustic. In 1840
 he chose as the subject of the Bakerian Lecture the theoretical
 explanation of an apparent new polarity in light.
    There is an equally important list of papers on astronomy. In
 1832 he communicates to the British Association a report on the
 progress of astronomy during the present century.        This was trans
 lated into German, three years after, by C. L. Littrow, of the Royal
 Observatory, Vienna.      The Viennese astronomer thinks that Pro
 fessor Airy has treated German astronomy like a step-mother,         but,
 nevertheless, he says there is no other work in which the progress of
 astronomy is so brie<U+FB02>y and so accurately given. In 1834 he writes
 for the ‘Nautical Almanac,’ 0n the perturbations of small planets
 and comets of short period. There is more than one paper on the mass
 of Jupiter. In 1834 he writes a paper, for the Astronomical Society,
 on the solar eclipse of July 16, 1833, which was seen extremely well
 at Cambridge. On this occasion he adopted a new plan of observa
 tion; instead of noting the times of the beginning or the end, he so
 chose the quantities to be measured that any errors in the elements
would be observed after they had been largely multiplied.             For
example,   at  the beginning  of  the  eclipse, when the discs of the Sun
and Moon only slightly overlap, it is obvious that the length of the
straight line joining the cusps is much more affected than the versine
by any small error in the angular distance of the centres of the discs.
To detect such errors, the attention of the observer should be directed
to the length of this line. In like manner, the whole duration of the
eclipse was divided into periods,        for each of which he arranged
appropriate measures.
    These papers, too numerous to catalogue in this place, did not
exhaust the energy of the Professor, for he found time to publish
treatises on Trigonometry, the Figure of the Earth, and one on
Gravitation.     The latter was written for the ‘Penny Cyclopaedia,’
but previously published, in 1834, for the use of students in the
University of Cambridge. It was an attempt to explain the per
turbations of the solar system without introducing an algebraic
symbol. Having thus denied himself the use of the most powerful

                                    viii
engine    of mathematics, he expresses his surprise at <U+FB01>nding that a
satisfactory explanation could be offered for almost every inequality
recognised as sensible in works on physical astronomy.        The book,
though well received, was, for many reasons, not so popular as his
tracts. In 1884, however, it received the honour of a second edition.
   In 1836—37 he was President of the Astronomical Society.       In the
<U+FB01>rst of these years, when presenting the medal of the Society to
Herschel for his catalogue of nebula) and clusters of stars, he gave an
interesting account of the history and of the then state of our know
ledge of these curious bodies.    The next year the address was on the
perturbations of comets.
   The year 1835 was a great epoch in Mr. Airy’s life, for he was
then appointed Astronomer Royal.         How thoroughly he intended to
work the National Observatory is evident from his very <U+FB01>rst report,
for here we <U+FB01>nd traces of the reforms he intended to introduce ; the
arrangement of the volumes of observation was to be remodelled ; the
library improved; a new equatoreal was suggested; a magnetic
apparatus had already been acquired, and. the site of a magnetic
observatory chosen.
   Remembering the views he had expressed on unreduced observa
tions when he began work at the Cambridge Observatory,                we
naturally inquire   what he did  with  the vast mass of ancient observa
tions which he found unreduced when he arrived at Greenwich.
This we learn gradually as we read his reports to the Board of
Visitors.    In l84l the observations of planets from 1750 to 1830 had
already been reduced to longitude and latitude, and every one had
been compared with the place computed from the best modern tables.
Suf<U+FB01>cient time had not yet elapsed to allow of the reduction of the
lunar observations, for here 8000 places of the Moon had to be
deduced from observation, and 8000 places had to be computed in
duplicate from tables exhibiting the complicated results of the most
advanced modern theory.        In extent and in importance this work
may be considered comparable to any that has yet been undertaken in
astronomy. In 1846 these lunar reductions were entirely completed,
 One immediate result was that Hansen discovered two inequalities
of long period in the Moon’s motion, produced by the attraction 0f
 Venus, though some doubts were afterwards thrown on one Of these
 by Delaunay and Newcomb.          For these reductions he received in
 1846 a gold medal, and in 1848 a testimonial, from the Astronomical
 Society. Sir John Herschel, in the latter of these years, after noting
that this work will remain to the latest posterity a monument of
national glory, remarked that we owe to other nations, and especially
 to the French, the <U+FB01>lling up of the great outline struck by Newt-ml
 with the analytical expressions of the laws of lunar and planetary
motion. This glory, he says, they have fairly won, and it is theirs_

                                     ix
 “But   the broad basis   of observations upon which this magni<U+FB01>cent
superstructure has been reared is British; in the National Observa
tory it was created.     Such has been the mission of that establish
ment, and such Mr. Airy has wisely judged it must continue to be, to
furnish now, and in all future time, in an unbroken series, the best
and most perfect data by which the laws of the lunar and planetary
movements, as developed by theory, can be compared with observa
tion.”
   In the report for 1841 he also describes how the Magnetic and
Meteorological Department had grown into an important branch of
the Observatory.      He tells us that the regular work of the establish
ment   is to observe  the meridional, bi<U+FB01>lar, and horizontal needles, the
barometer and thermometers, besides several other instruments, every
two hours night and day, except on Sundays ; to pursue incessantly the
magnetic observations whenever anything unusual occurs; to observe
 some of the instruments every <U+FB01>ve minutes during twenty-four hours
on a <U+FB01>xed day every month.        As the observations, when made, had
all to be reduced and tabulated in proper shape, it is clear that the
amount of work done must have been very great. Some of these
troublesome observations were afterwards abbreviated by a system of
self-registration    by photography.       The description of this new
                                     ‘
system is given in the    volume  of   Greenwich    Observations’ for 1847.
   In April, 1839, Mr. Airy read to the Royal Society his <U+FB01>rst paper
on the correction of compasses.         Captain Flinders, in his famous
voyage to Australia, had observed that the north end of his compass
appeared to be drawn towards the bows of his ship; and he, and
others after him, had suggested methods of compensating the cause of
the disturbance. The Astronomer Royal was, however, the <U+FB01>rst to
make a thorough investigation of the laws of magnetic disturbance.
The iron ship “ Rainbow ” was placed at his disposal with a view of
discovering by experiment some method of controlling the strange
de<U+FB02>ections of the compass.       The use that he made of this vessel will
make its name as famous in the history of the mariner’s compass as
                “ Rocket ” is in the
Stephensou’s                           history of locomotives.   Assuming
that every particle of iron in the ship is, by the action of terrestrial
magnetism, converted into a magnet, he calculated the resolved
forces on one end of a compass needle whose centre holds a <U+FB01>xed
position in the ship. He found that these forces contained two sets
of terms, which he called the semi-circular and quadrantal variations,
their phases being respectively the azimuth and twice the azimuth of
the ship.    The latter of these he found to be due to the induced
magnetism; while in the former the permanent, the sub-permanent,
and the induced magnetism had shares.            Having determined the
coef<U+FB01>cients of these variations by observing the times of vibration of
a delicate needle placed <U+FB01>rst on shore and then on the ship, he was

                                    x
able to compare the actual and calculated deviations    of the compass
from the north for all azimuths of the ship. He soon found that
almost the whole deviation of the compass was accounted for by the
permanent magnetism, and that the residual part followed nearly the
quadrantal law. He thence deduced a simple rule by which the
compasses could be practically corrected to a <U+FB01>rst approximation.
 Putting the ship’s length (1) north and south, and (2) east and west,
he showed how to place two permanent magnets near the compass so
that it indicated true magnetic north in each position.    Placing next
the ship’s length north-east and south-west, the e<U+FB01>ect of the quad
rantal deviation became prominent, and this he corrected by a mass
of soft iron, whose own induced magnetism, when properly placed.
 counterbalanced that of the ship. These corrections being disturbed
when the ship heeled over, another magnet was added.        On applying
this method to the “ Rainbow,” and trying the compass with the
ship’s head in different positions through the circumference, it was
sensibly perfect; the deviation, which at <U+FB01>rst had exceeded 50°,
sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, was at once re
duced to half a degree.     The great development of iron-built ships
 soon rendered some modi<U+FB01>cation in these corrections necessary; im
provements were made by their author, and other mathematicians
 also made a special study of the deviations of the compass.         Mr.
 Airy wrote several other papers in connexion with this subJect, such
as those in 1840, 1856, 1860, and 1862, and in 1865 he delivered a
course of three lectures at the School of Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering at South Kensington.         The principle that the
compass ought be corrected by magnets or otherwise has not been
universally received; it was contended that it was better to use a
table of errors. The Astronomer Royal maintained that the former
 course was the proper one, while Mr. Archibald Smith has been the
 champion of the latter. The question has been much discussed, but
 cannot be entered into here.
    Mr. Airy formed one of an important Commission for the restora
tion of the standards of weights and measures which had been injured
 by the <U+FB01>re at the House of Commons. Contrary to the opinion preva
 lent in France,the Commission recommended that the standard measure
 should be de<U+FB01>ned by the length of a certain rod preserved in some place
of safety, and not by any natural standard, such as the length of the
seconds pendulum.      Contrary, also, to the method adopted by Bessel
for the Prussian standard, the yard is de<U+FB01>ned by the distance between
two points marked on the bar and not by the length of the bar. The
history of standards is given by Mr. Airy in a long paper in the
‘
  Phil. Trans.’ for 1857.
    About 1841 Mr. Airy turned his attention to the theory of tides.
 He wrote several papers on this subject, discussing separately the

                                     xi
  tides in the Thames, at Ipswich, Southampton, the coast of Ireland,
  and, later on, the tides at Malta.   A Royal Medal was adjudged to
  him by the Royal Society in 1845 for his inquiry into the laws of
  the tides on the coast of Ireland.   His chief work on this subject is
 his essay on “ Tides and Waves,” printed in the ‘Encyclopaedia
 Metropolitana.’     Taking the usual division of the theory into three
 parts, viz., the equilibrium theory, that of ocean tides, and that of
 river tides, we may ascribe the initial steps in the <U+FB01>rst to Newton and
 Bernoulli, those in the second to Laplace, while the last may be said
 to have begun with Airy. This important paper, perhaps because it
 had not been published by any learned society, did not attract the
 attention it deserved on the Continent, but its merits could not remain
 unnoticed, and in 1875 the section on river tides was translated and
 printed in Liouville’s Journal.’ In this section he discusses the broken
             ‘
 water seen on the edge of a shoal, why the rise of tide occupies less time
 than the fall, the solitary wave, the breaking of waves, the e<U+FB01>ect of
 the wind, tidal waves, the effect of friction, the form of the wave in
 broad channels with shallow sides, and other interesting questions.
 When M. Delaunay, in 1866, suggested that a portion of the apparent
 acceleration of the Moon was due to a real retardation of the rotation
 of the Earth caused by tidal friction, Mr. Airy gave a general ex
 planation, founded on the theory of river tides.      He discovered two
 terms of the second order in his equations whose general effect was
 to produce a constant acceleration of the waters in the direction of
the Moon’s apparent diurnal course.        He therefore gave his entire
assent to the views of Delaunay on the existence of one real cause for
the retardation of the Earth’s rotation.     Other causes of retardation
have been discovered by mathematicians since then, but these, of
course, lie outside the scope of the present sketch.
    In the summer of 184.4 the arc of longitude between Greenwich and
the island of Valentia was measured.         As an intermediate station,
the longitude of Kingstown was also determined. The difference of
longitude was found by making thirty pocket chronometers travel
from Greenwich to Kingstown and back again several times; the
diiference between Kingstown and Valentia being found in a similar
manner.      The differences in longitude having been found, the next
step was to compare the results with the data of the trigonometrical
survey, and to see how far they agreed with the best existing deter
mination of the <U+FB01>gure of the Earth. The triangulation was then only
partially completed, but enough had been done to enable Mr. Airy to
arrive at the result that in the latitude of 51° 40' the length of 1"
in an are perpendicular to the meridian is 101'64399 feet in terms of
the standard bar of the Ordnance Survey. In the same year Struve
 determined the difference of the longitudes of Altona and Greenwich
 by the transmission of forty-two chronometers across the German Sea

                                         xii
  sixteen times.     In the summer of 1862 the longitude of Valentia was
 ,again  determined,    this time by the use of the electric telegraph. The
  electric telegraph   was   also used in 1853 to determine the differences
  between the longitudes of Greenwich, Cambridge, and Edinburgh,
  and, when the submarine telegraph was laid to Ostend, the di<U+FB01>erence
  of longitude between Greenwich and Brussels.           These diiferences of
  longitude have been combined with other Continental determinations,
  and, by the use of the whole series, the longitudes of places in the
  extreme east of Europe may be compared with places in America.
      In the year 184-4 Mr. Airy also assisted in tracing the Canadian
  boundary under the Treaty of Washington.               The corps of Royal
  Engineers who were to mark the boundary were placed at the Obser
  vatory for instruction and practice in the use of instruments under
  his eye. The most dif<U+FB01>cult part of the boundary was a straight line
  of nearly seventy miles in length, passing through a country of
  impervious      forests,    steep   ravines, and dismal      swamps.     He
  arranged a plan of operations founded on a determination of the
  absolute latitudes and the differences         of longitudes of the two
  extremities. The azimuths of the line for the two ends were then
  computed, and marks laid off for starting from each end.          One party
  of engineers, after cutting more than forty-two miles through the
   woods were surprised, on the brow of a hill, at seeing a gap in the
   woods, on the next line of hill; this turned out to be the line of the
   opp0site party.     On continuing the lines until they passed abreast of
   each other, their distance was found to be 341 feet.      This corresponds
   to an error of only a quarter of a second of time in the difference of
   longitudes, and is about one-third of the error which would have
   been committed if the spheroidal form of the earth had been
   neglected.    This is a striking testimony both to the accuracy of Mr.
   Airy’s method and to the skill of the engineers.
      At a special meeting of the Board of Visitors in 1843, Mr. Airy
   proposed to construct the <U+FB01>rst of the important instruments he has
   added to the Observatory.        He points out that the Royal Observatory
   was instituted chie<U+FB02>y to observe the Moon, and that this object had
   been so continuously kept in view ever since its foundation, that the
_ existing
              theories and tables of the Moon are founded entirely on
    Greenwich observations.         The unavoidable interruptions       to the
   regularity of the series were, however, so numerous, that the number
    of complete observations then made was under a hundred a year. He
    proposed to supply this de<U+FB01>ciency by erecting an altitude and
_
    azimuth instrument, by which the Moon could be observed in any
    part of the sky. He assures the Visitors that its cost ought not to be
    an objection when it is remembered that each complete lunar obser
    vation was then worth ten pounds.         In the report of 184.? we read
    that the new instrument had been completed, and was in working

                                      xiii
  order.    In  1848 he proposed to erect a transit circle.   Other great
  instruments followed, and in 185-5, when the want of an equatoreal
  was pointed out, the Board of Visitors warmly supported his views.
  In the summer of 1860 the instrument was in a state <U+FB01>t for use
  Enough has now been said to show that by his energy and per
  severance the Royal Observatory has been equipped with the most
  admirable instruments which could be obtained. As early as De
  cember, 1849, the Astronomer Royal made an oral statement to the
   Astronomical Society on the method of observing and recording trans
  its lately introduced in America.      He explains how a measure of its
  accuracy, as compared with Greenwich observations, had been made,
  and, after pointing out some defects, he thought the possible advan
  tages so great that he contemplated adopting it at the Royal Obser
  vatory.     In this report for 1854: he tells us that the new barrel
   apparatus had been practically brought into use, not, however,
   without a succession of dif<U+FB01>culties, whose causes it was sometimes
   very hard to discover. He concludes by remarking that the method
   is troublesome in use, and consumes much time in preparation, but
   that, amongst the observers who use it, there is only one opinion on
   its astronomical merits, viz., that, in freedom from personal equation
   and in general accuracy, it is very far superior to the observations by
                         ‘
   eye and ear.                                      y
       In 1846 Mr. Airy was one of three Commissioners appointed by the
   Queen to report on the proper gauge for railways.         The Commis
   sioners considered that the chief advantage of the broad gauge lay in
   the speed of the trains, while in the conveyance of goods and the
   cost of outlay the narrow gauge was the superior. For these and
   other reasons they recommended that the present narrow gauge
   should by statute be that of all railways to be constructed in future.
   After examining and rejecting several ingenious inventions by which
   the same carriage could be made to run on both gauges, they also
   recommended that some equitable means should be found by which
~
   the railways then on the broad gauge could be reduced to the narrow:
   This second recommendation was not, however, adopted by the legis-         _
    lature. In 1858 Professor Airy was one of the Commission on the
    Ordnance Survey appointed to consider, amongst other questions,
                                                                            '
   the scales on which the maps were to be constructed.
       In the ‘Monthly Notices’ for November, 1846, there is a memoir
   by the Astronomer Royal, giving his own, Professor Challis’, and Mr.
   Adams’ separate accounts of the discovery of Neptune. Mr.'Airy
   remarks that in the whole history of astronomy there is nothing com
    parable to this discovery; Uranus, Ceres, Pallas, and other planets‘
    were discovered by observation, but, in the case of Neptune, mathe
    maticians stated beforehand that a planet would be found exactly in
    a certain place and presenting exactly a certain appearance.    In that

                                    xiv
place   and with   that appearance the planet was found.         The predic
tions of Adams and Leverrier differed by only one degree of longi
tude.    The controversy which has arisen on this discovery cannot be
brie<U+FB02>y discussed, and must be omitted in a sketch as short as the
 present one.
   In the years 1850, 1851, Mr. Airy turned his attention to anti
                                                                        ’
 quarian researches.    There are several papers in the ‘ Athenseum on
the Exodus of the Israelites, and some more on the place of the land
ing of Caesar. The <U+FB01>rst of these lines of enquiry led gradually to the
“ Notes on the earlier Hebrew
                                 Scriptures” (1876), and the latter to the
“ Treatise on the Roman Invasion of Britain ”
                                                  (186-5). Halley, reason
ing on the phenomena of the tides as described by Caesar, and com
paring these with the Channel tides as then known, had concluded
that Deal was the landing place.        Mr. Airy, however, showed that,
with fuller knowledge of the local tides, this line of reasoning would
prove that Pevensey was the actual landing place.            He also con
tended that this result was con<U+FB01>rmed by a study of Caesar’s move
ments in Gaul before the crossing, and his transactions in the interior
of Britain after the passage of the straits.     Mr. Airy was also inter
ested   in several  other antiquarian questions.      Thus in the ‘Phil.
 Trans.’ for 1853 there is a paper on the eclipses of Agathocles,
 Thales, and Xerxes, in which he arrived at some new dates for these
events.    After the publication of Professor Adams’ theory of a
diminished value of the acceleration of the Moon’s mean motion, Mr.
Airy repeated his calculations, and somewhat modi<U+FB01>ed his results.
He also compared the dates of thirty-six eclipses given in a Chinese
                                       ’
historical work called ‘ Chun Tsew with those calculated by theory
by a French writer, and points out how generally accurate the
 Chinese records are on these points.
   Mr. Airy had the pleasure of viewing three total eclipses of the Sun,the
<U+FB01>rst from the Superga, near Turin, in 1842, the second at Gothenburg,
in Sweden, in 1851, and the third at Here<U+FB01>a, in Spain, in 1860.
In the many accounts which he has given of these eclipses, he con
tinually dwells on the impressiveness and awfulness of the scene,
pointing out that no degree of partial eclipse gave the least idea of a
total eclipse.   He mentions, on the authority of Arago, that the
of<U+FB01>cers of a French corvette who had been trained to observe the
eclipse of 1842 lost their discipline when the darkness came on, and
the observations were not made.          The most remarkable of all the
appearances at the <U+FB01>rst eclipse were the red mountains or <U+FB02>ames seen
round the Moon. It was afterwards discovered that these had been
seen in 1733 by a Swedish astronomer, but all the observers at Turin
were taken by surprise. It was dif<U+FB01>cult then to decide what they
were, or even whether they belonged to the Sun or to the Moon.            In
the eclipse of 1851 special attention was given to these <U+FB02>ames, and,

                                        XV
in his report to the Astronomical Society, Mr. Airy said it was im
possible    to see the changes in their aspect without feeling the con
viction that they belonged to the Sun and not to the Moon.               Still
many     doubted,  but  in  1860  the  observed   angular displacements and
velocities of displacements      of these red  appearances as the Moon’s disc
passed over the Sun pr0ved decisively that they belonged to the
latter body. On the expedition to Spain, the Astronomer Royal was
accompanied by a large body of observers; some were trained astro
nomers, the others amateurs.          All did good service, there was much
work to be done and it was well done. The Government placed the
                  “             ”
large steamer Himalaya            at the disposal of the party to carry them
to and from their destination, and in conferences on the deck of that
ship the di<U+FB01>erent classes of observation were divided amongst those
present. All the details of the organisation of the expedition rested
in great measure on the Astronomer Royal, and in his report to the
Board of Visitors in 1861 he pronounced the enterprise to have been
very successful.       In his lecture to the Astronomical Society he
remarked that it would be advantageous to collect from the various
accounts, <U+FB01>rst, all the facts which relate to one part of the pheno
 mena, secondly, those which relate to another, and so on; and,
<U+FB01>nally, to arrange these in separate chapters in order that a systematic
 comparison might be made. In the forty-<U+FB01>rst volume of the Memoirs
 of the Astronomical Society, edited by Mr. Ranyard, these compari
 sons are published, and occupy 792 pages.            The mere titles of the
 chapters are suf<U+FB01>cient to show the importance and interest of the
 work.
     At  the meeting of the British Association at Manchester in 1860,
 Mr. Airy delivered      a lecture on the solar eclipse of that year to an
 assembly of perhaps 3000 persons.             The writer of this sketch re
 members the great Free Trade Hall crowded to excess with an
 immense audience whose attention and interest, notwithstanding a
 weak voice, he was able to retain to the very end of the lecture.
  This lecture he repeated at Cambridge, as the Rede Lecture, in 1864,
 where it was again well received.          It was afterwards translated into
 Dutch by D. Bierens de Haan about 1877. The charm of Professor
  Airy’s lectures lay in the clearness of his explanations. The subjects
  also of his lectures were generally those to which his attention had
  been turned by other causes, so that he had much that was new to
 tell. His manner was slightly hesitating, and he used frequent re
  petitions, which, perhaps, were necessary from the newness of the
  ideas.    As the lecturer proceeded, his hearers forgot these imper
  fections and found their whole attention rivetted to the subject
  matter. On many occasions Mr. Airy has given successful lectures.
   In March, 1848, he delivered six lectures at Ipswich on Astronomy,
   which were <U+FB01>rst taken down by shorthand writers and, after correc

                                     xvi
 tion by their author, published in a collected form. This treatise has
been very popular and has gone through several editions. He also
 lectured in the Town Hall at Neath; in 1851 at the Royal Institution,
 on the total solar eclipse of that year; and in 1853 on the eclipse of
 Thales.    In 1878 he lectured at Cockcrmouth on the probable con
 dition of the interior of the earth. Besides these there were many
 other lectures, some of which will be mentioned further on.
     At his Rede Lecture at Cambridge in 1864 Mr. Airy took occasion
 to point out what appeared to be defects in the system of education
 as connected with mathematical physics, and he followed up these
  remarks by a letter to the Vice-Chancellor.     To assist in remedying
 these de<U+FB01>ciencies     he had already written, in 1861, his now well
 known treatise on the theory of Errors of Observation.             With
 the same object he published, in 1866, his “Partial Diiferential
  Equations,” in which he introduced the novelty of giving stereoscopic
 views to illustrate the surfaces under consideration.        These were
  followed by a treatise on Sound in 1868. In order to direct the
  attention of the University to the subject of magnetism, he gave a
  course of lectures in the Easter term of 1869, at Cambridge.     These
 being attended by crowded audiences, were developed into the treatise
 on Magnetism which appeared in the following year.
     One of the most remarkable of Mr. Airy’s investigations is that
  in which he determined the mean density of the Earth. He had
  always been much interested in this subject, and in the fourteenth
  volume of the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society we <U+FB01>nd that
  he assisted Mr. Baily in his important repetition of the Cavendish
  experiment by contributing the theory and the formulae.        In 1826
  another method had occurred to him which promised to give a. more
  accurate result than either Maskelyne’s method of measuring the
  attraction of a mountain or the Cavendish experiment.        His imme
  diate object was to compare the force of gravity at the surface and
  at the bottom of a deep mine, using the pendulum as the means of
  observation. In the ‘ Phil. Trans.’ of 1856 he describes the attempts
  he had made at Dolcoath in 1826 and in 1828, and their failure on
 both occasions in consequence of accidents, once by <U+FB01>re and once by
  water. Twenty-six years passed before he was in aposition to repeat
  the experiment for the third time. In 1854', however, a new power
  was, he tells us, placed in his hands.  The galvanic system had been
  established at the Royal Observatory, and, in the familiarity which
  he now possessed with telegraphic applications, be perceived that the
  dif<U+FB01>culty of comparing the upper and lower clocks would be entirely
 removed.     The experiment was conducted at the Harton Pit, a mine
  about 1260 feet deep. The result was that gravity below was greater
  than that above by l/l9286th part, so that the mean density of the
  earth was 2'7 times the surface density and 6'6 times that of water.

                                       xvii
    The value thus obtained is larger than that given by the Schehallien
    method,   and considerably larger than that deduced by Baily from
    the torsion rod experiments. After the experiments at Harton Pit
    were concluded, he gave a lecture at the Central Hall, South Shields,
   0n the pendulum experiments, and, in the next year, a Friday Evening
   Lecture at the Royal Institution, in London, on the same subject.
   These experiments were also noticed by “ Mr. Punch ” in a copy of
   verses on “ Airy and the Coal Hole,” written by Shirley Brooks.
      In 1867 Professor Airy read a paper at the Institution of Civil
   Engineers on the use of the suspension bridge with stiffened roadway
   for railway and other bridges of large span. This paper was the result
   of a discussion with Mr. R. Stephenson on the method to be adopted
  for the Britannia bridge, and the author thought there were better
  methods available for wide crossings than simple tubular bridges.
  Besides writing this paper, for which he received the medal of the
   Society, he often attended the meetings and joined in the discussions.
      As the management of the expeditions to observe the transits of
  Venus in 1874 and 1882 would necessarily fall on the Astronomer
  Royal, Mr. Airy began his preparations as early as 1857. In that
  year, he called the attention of the Astronomical Society to the
  means available for correcting the measure of the Sun’s distance in
  the next twenty-<U+FB01>ve years.        On this occasion he pointed out the
  peculiar advantages of observing Mars for that purpose, showing
  that at the opposition of 1860 that planet would make a near
  approach to the Earth. The preparations for the transit were con
 tinued during the following years; the proper places to which the
 expeditions should be sent were discussed at great length and <U+FB01>nally
 chosen.     The northern stations having been occupied by Continental
 observers, the southern ones were, by the advice of the Board of
 Visitors, divided amongst the English parties. It was also decided
 that photographic should be combined with eye observations, and an
 extra grant was obtained from the Treasury for that purpose.            By
 1873 preparations had so far advanced that an ef<U+FB01>cient body of
 observers from all classes, naval, military, and civilian, were collected
 at the Royal Observatory, and were being instructed and practised in
 all the practical details of observation with the transit, the altazimuth,
the equatoreal, and especially with the working model of the transit.
At this time the received measure of the Sun’s distance depended on
the transits of 1761 and 1769, but mainly on the latter.            Though
there was a close accordance in the results obtained from the different
transits, yet all investigators expressed doubts on their correctness.
In the transit of 1761 the results depended almost entirely on an
accurate knowledge of the di<U+FB01>erences of the longitudes of very dis
tant stations. In that of 1769 the result rested in great measure
on the observations of a single person, viz., those of Father Hell at
                                                                    e

                                   xviii
Wardhoe.      Another di<U+FB02>icnlty had also presented itself ; it was found
that after the planet appeared to have fairly entered upon the Sun’s
disk it was for some time connected with the Sun’s limb by a black
ligament.     Even after the planet had separated itself from the edge,
it did not immediately assume a circular appearance.     It is clear that
the determination of the precise moment of contact is more di<U+FB02>icult
than it was expected to be at the time of the invention of this
 method by Halley.      For these reasons the results of the transit of
 1874 were looked forward to with the greatest interest.    The observa
 tions were on the whole successful, though some perplexing di<U+FB01>
 culties arose. At several places the black ligament was not seen, but
 a faint thread of light of sensible width, due to the atmosphere of
 Venus, presented itself. This unexpected appearance introduced an
 element of uncertainty as to the exact moment of contact.           Two
 hundred and sixteen photographs were taken, but their examination
 did not realise all that had been hoped for from them.           On the
 return of the several expeditions, the reduction of the observa
 tions was proceeded with under the scrutiny of Captain Tupman.
 The immense labour of these calculations delayed the publication of
 the complete results until June, 1881, nearly seven years after the
 event, though a preliminary        report was made to the House of
  Commons in 1877.
     In the ‘Phil. Traus.’ for 1872 there is a curious determination of
  the magnetic state of the iron in the Britannia and Conway tubular
  bridges. This investigation was suggested by the peculiar tremor
  of the iron felt by the hand when a train was passing. Both Sir
  George Airy and Mr. Stephenson expressed this by saying that the
  metal seemed to be in a state of “ molecular shiver.” As all experi
  ments show that iron in this state of tremor is peculiarly subject to
  the inductive action of external magnetic force, Sir George thought
  that observations made along the axis of the tube might lead to some
  important conclusions.     One general result was tha “in the axis of
  a rectangular tube, at all points except very near the ends, the action
   of external magnetic forces in planes normal to the axis is absolutely
   destroyed.” Some strange anomalies were observed in one tube which
   could not be explained until it was remembered that that tube had
   had a fall while being raised into its place. Thus the effects of an
   accident were discovered a quarter of a century after it had occurred
   by a magnetic experiment.
      The system of time signals by which Greenwich time is spread over
   the country by means of the electric telegraph is in great part due
   to Sir G. Airy.   It should be noticed that the whole system is auto
   matic; the Greenwich clock being once set each morning to the exact
   time, the signals are distributed without any person having to touch
   the apparatus.

                                         xix
     It is impossible to consider in detail the numerous additions which
  Mr. Airy has made to our knowledge at various times. It is necessary
  to pass over with merely a mention such an important memoir as that
  in which he discusses theoretically the stresses in the interior of a
  rectangular beam.          In another paper he mentions a method of
  correcting the chromatic dispersion of the atmosphere in observing
  transits of Venus. He has also written several papers on the com
  parison of Earth currents and magnetic disturbances, on the diurnal
  and annual inequalities of terrestrial magnetism, and on some lunar
  magnetic inequalities. We must hasten on to his last work.
     In 1874! the Astronomer Royal brought before the notice of the
  Astronomical Society a new mode of treating the lunar theory. After
  giving a rapid survey of the methods hitherto employed, he remarks
  that the nature of the steps has compelled the investigators to decide
  the succession of their terms, not by numerical magnitude, but by
  algebraical order, and that this has produced great inequality of con
 vergence.       The mental labour cannot be alleviated by an amanuensis,
  and he quotes a remark of M. Plana, “ Quelquefois ces calculs me font
 presque perdre la téte.” He proposes, as a new method, to begin
 with Delaunay’s <U+FB01>nal numerical expressions for the longitude, latitude,
 and parallax with a symbolical term attached to every number for
 contingent correction.         These corrections are so small that it is
 suf<U+FB01>cient to retain only their <U+FB01>rst power.         The expressions are then
 substituted in the equations of motion with the time for independent
 variable, and the result of the substitution is a great number of equa
 tions for determining the numerical values of a great many small
 quantities.      In this theory the orders of the terms are numerical and
 equally accurate throughout; the details are so easy, that a great part
 can be intrusted to a mere computer. Though he was then seventy~
 three years of age, he had aleady begun the work.             He says that,
 though    it is  suf<U+FB01>ciently possible that he may not be   able to complete
it, he desires to have it in such a state that a successor may be able
to take it up. For this reason in each of the following years he gives
further details as to the theory, and describes how far he had ad
vanced in the approximations.          Finally, in 1886 the numerical lunar
theory    was   given  to the world  in the form in which it was left by the
author; a wonderful monument of what a man can do at the age of
eighty-<U+FB01>ve.       He explains in the preface how the work was delayed
by the heavy pressure of business, not only in the ordinary conduct
of the Observatory, but also in completing the calculations for the
transit of Venus in 1874, and in preparing for that in 1882. He
then remarks on some serious discordances which remain to be ac
counted for; “I cannot conjecture,” he adds, “whether             I may be
able to examine suf<U+FB01>ciently into this matter.”         He never was able.

received from the universities and other scienti<U+FB01>c bodies is given after
his name in the List of Fellows of this Society. He was D.C.L. of
Oxford, LL.D. of Cambridge and Edinburgh, one of the <U+FB01>rst members
of the Senate in the University of London.         He was one of the eight
foreign  Associates of the Institute  of France,  and received the Lalande
Medal. He     was   made K.C.B.     in  1872.   In  1875  he received the
freedom of the City of London, enclosed in a gold casket.        He was a
Fellow of the Royal Society for <U+FB01>fty-<U+FB01>ve years, received both the
Copley and Royal Medals, and was made President in 1871.            He was
on the Council of the Astronomical Society for more than <U+FB01>fty years,
was <U+FB01>ve times President, and received two gold medals.             He was
President of the British Association at the meeting at Ipswich in
1851.   He was an honorary member of the Institution of Civil Engi
neers, and received the Telford Medal.         He was elected a foreign
Associate of the Dutch Academy of Sciences in 1878, and held
honorary titles from many Continental and American Societies. He
also received the Albert Medal of the Society of Arts, which was
presented to him by the Prince of Wales.         He was a member of the
Royal society of Edinburgh and of the Royal Irish Academy.               He
received a diamond snuff-box from the Emperor Nicholas of Russia,
and decorations from the Emperor of Brazil.           He was Chevalier of
                             ”
the order “Pour le mérite of Prussia; he belonged to the Legion of
Honour of France, and had decorations from Sweden. A gold snuff
box was given to him by the Steam Navigation Company, a silver-gilt
inkstand by the River Dee Company, and he held a French Sévres
vase as a Commissioner on Standards.
   When Sir George Airy retired from the Observatory at the age of
eighty, the Board of Visitors recorded in their Proceedings 3. resolu
tion expressing, in an emphatic manner, their sense of his eminent
services throughout the long period of forty-<U+FB01>ve years during which
he had presided -over the Observatory.       Among his many services to
science they especially mentioned the following :—(a) The reorganisa
tion of the Observatory; (1)) the designing of instruments of excep
tional stability and delicacy; (c) the extension of the means of
making observations on the .Moon in such parts of her orbit as are
not accessible to the transit circle '; (d) the investigation of the effects
of iron ships on compasses; 1(a) the establishment of time signals.
Turning next to his labours in departments of science not directly
connected with the Royal Observatory, they called attention to the
high estimation in which his contributions to the theory of the tides,
to the undulatory theory of light, and to various abstract branches of
mathematics are held by men of science throughout the world.
   During his residence at Cambridge Sir George married Richarda,
the eldest daughter of the Rev. Richard Smith, of Edensor, in Derby
shire.   Lady Airy died in 1875, after a long illness. After his

                                    xxi
retirement Sir George received a pension from the Government, and
resided close to Greenwich Park, and not far from the scene of his
former labours. Here, on his ninetieth birthday, he held his last
reception. It was attended by a numerous and distinguished com
pany, among whom was one old friend even older than himself
     Sir George owned a cottage at Playford, near Ipswich, to which he
often retired for rest and recreation. Here he had spent his boyhood,
and here at last he was laid in the grave by the side of his wife.
Visiting the village every year, he could remember <U+FB01>ve generations
of more than one family, and could give the early history of most of
the others.    The last scene of his life may be said to have begun and
ended here.     On his last visit he had a fall, which in his enfeebled
state proved more serious than might have been expected.        He never
properly rallied, but gradually sank and passed away at his residence
in Greenwich. His funeral at Playford Churchwasquiet and simple,
<U+FB01>tting the noble simplicity of his life.

     EDMOND   BECQUEREL.—In the long and brilliant roll of physicists
 of whom France may justly boast, few names deserve a more promi
nent position than that of Becquerel. The Becquerel family con
stitutes a true dynasty of savants, and a<U+FB01>ords a twice repeated
instance of father and son engaged in the self-same studies, and
 seated side by side in the same identical section of the Academy of
 Sciences of Paris.
     The second of the family, Edmond Becquerel was born in 1820, and
 grew up, as remarked in the o<U+FB01>icial éloge delivered by M. Duchatre
 on the occasion of his death, in a scienti<U+FB01>c atmosphere.        From his
 illustrious father, Antoine César Becquerel, he evidently inherited his
acute power of observation, and that “in<U+FB01>nite capacity for taking
pains,” which seems to be the essential characteristic of the Newtons,
 the Faradays, the Darwins, and, in short, of all the great leaders
 of science.
     While thus born a savant, the cause which determined Edmond
 Becqnerel to become a physicist must be sought in the example and
 the society of his father Antoine, <U+FB01>rst as a pupil, then as assistant.
 Under di<U+FB01>erent circumstances he might have become equally eminent
 as a chemist or as a student of the organic sciences.
     As he approached manhood, the discovery of photography burst
 upon the world, and naturally drew general attention to the chemical
 action of light.     Edmond Becquerel found here his opportunity,
 and studied with zeal and success the conditions and laws of the
 novel phenomena.       His papers on the chemical radiations accom
 panying solar and electric light, and on their elfects, were of distin
  guished value.   He  even succeeded   in obtaining a photographic repro

                                      xxii
   duction of the spectrum in its natural colours, with the serious
   drawback that the coloured. image could be preserved only in com
  plete darkness.    Our advances upon Becquerel in this direction have
  not been so rapid or decisive as might have been hoped.
      Becquerel came to the conclusion that all the effects produced
  under the in<U+FB02>uence of light are due to one and the same radiation
  acting upon different bodies.       He considered it probable that in
  different beings the retina is not always sensitive between the same
  limits of refrangibility.   His principal researches in this direction are
 to be found in the ‘ Annales de Chimie ’ for November, 1848.
     It must not be forgotten that Becqnerel’s view was strongly
  opposed by Professor Forbes, of King’s College, also by R. Crouch, of
  Polperro, who both maintained that no marine animal has the power
 of vision under the in<U+FB02>uence of such rays of light as would not excite
 the optic nerve of man, and that those depths of the ocean at which
 an everlasting darkness prevails, are the regions of silence and death.
     It need scarcely be said that recent research has fully proved that
 existing animal species can recognise rays of light which make no
 impression on the human retina, thus con<U+FB01>rming the correctness of
 Becquerel and refuting his critics.
     It is not surprising that with the researches just mentioned he
 combined a prolonged and exhaustive study of phosphorescence              as
 produced by insolation.
     For the better study of these phenomena, he invented his well
 known phosphoroscope.         By means of this instrument, substances
 can be viewed immediately after having been exposed to the light of
 the sun ; the interval between insolation and observation being
 capable of reduction at pleasure and of very accurate measurement.
 Edmond Becquerel investigated also the light emitted by the phosphor.
 escent compounds of uranium, and turned his attention to the infra
red portion of the spectrum, and to the ultra-violet portion, to Which
the chemical action involved in the new art of photography was due.
He formed a pure spectrum on a sensitive plate of silver prepared by
the process of Daguerre, and found that the <U+FB01>xed dark lines of the
solar spectrum       as recognised      by Wollaston, Fraunhofer,        and
Brewster were traceable in the chemical impression, and that similar
lines therefore existed in the parts of the solar spectrum lying beyond
the limits of visibility.      Becquerel published in the ‘ Bibliothéque
                            ’
Universelle de Genéve for 1842 a diagram of the <U+FB01>xed lines of the
spectrum as enlarged by these researches.       These photo-chemical and
optical studies, taken conjointly, have been pronounced by Fizeau to
be a model of research in experimental physics.
    Another research of the highest order was his investigation of the
action of magnetism on all substances, especially upon oxygen, the
magnetic function of which he carefully scrutinised.          Here he and

                                    xxiii
 Faraday were working simultaneously almost on the same lines.          In
 a letter to the elder Becquerel, Faraday (1851) speaks in terms of
 high admiration of Edmond Becquerel’s achievements.               He was
 exceedingly struck, he writes, with the beauty of the experiments,
 with the accuracy of the determinations, and with the results, which
 con<U+FB01>rmed and extended his own.
     Edmond Becquerel was profoundly interested in the laws of
 electro-chemical decomposition, his views agreeing for the most part
 closely with those of Faraday. What is now known as “ Becquerel’s
        ”
‘Law is a special application of the general law of Faraday govern
 ing electro-chemical decomposition.
     Among what may be called Becquerel’s minor papers are included
 researches on the thermic radiation of electric sparks, on the produc-     ‘
 tion of phosphorescence by electric sparks, on the determination of
 high temperatures, on the radiation of solar heat and the production
 of electric currents, on the electro-chemical decomposition of water,
 on constant current batteries, on the chemical rays accompanying
 those of light, on the constitution of the spectrum, on the laws of
 the evolution of heat during the passage of electric currents through
 solids and liquids, on coloured rings produced by the deposition of
 metallic oxides on metals, on the electric conductivity of solids and
 liquids, on phosphorescence     produced by insolation. Altogether, E.
 Becquerel produced seventy-one memoirs which are mentioned in the
 Royal Society’s index, in addition to a number written in conjunction
 with his father, Antoine César, and afterwards with his son, Henri.
      Having thus brie<U+FB02>y summarised his scienti<U+FB01>c work, we may glance
 at what must be called the outer events of his life.          It is to be
 remarked that though he had early distinguished himself by scienti<U+FB01>c
 works of high value, and as the son of an eminent and much re
 spected Academician he was not without in<U+FB02>uence, yet none of the
 great scienti<U+FB01>c establishments of his country o<U+FB01>ered him an appoint
 ment.
      In 1849, under the Second French Republic, the Government of
  the day created a National Agronomic Institute, and adopted the
  “ eminently liberal principle ” of appointing the professors
                                                                 by compe
  tition.   On this occasion, strange to say, the result was favourable.
                                                “ submitted himself to this
  Becquerel, we are told in his of<U+FB01>cial 6’loge,
  redoubtable test,” and, for a wonder, though weighed in a balance so
  little capable of appreciating his merits, he was fully successful.   He
  thus obtained a chair at this important institution, which had been
  established at Versailles.    Here his lectures were fully appreciated
  by an audience who followed his teachings with lively interest.
  His career at the Agronomic Institute was, however, of short dura
  tion.    In two years political events, which need not concern us,
   brought on the suppression of the Institute.       But as one door was

                                      xxiv
 closed,   another and a wider opened.         Becquerel was called to a
 chair at the Conservatoire       des Arts  at Métiers.    Here his eminent
 talents found ample scope.
    The Academy of Sciences meanwhile was eagerly looking forward           I
 to receive him to its membership.          However, on account of strict
 limitation of its numbers, this inclusion did not become possible
 until 1863, when the death of Despretz opened the way.
    In 1878 he succeeded his father as Professor of Physics at the
 Museum, where he was duly admired for profound mastery of his
subject, as well as for the admirable clearness of his teachings. This
important position he continued to occupy down to his death.
    Here he was in a position to contribute powerfully to the advance
 and the diffusion of his favourite science, by his personal researches
which he still carried on with unremitting zeal and interest, and by
 his teachings at the Conservatoire and the Museum.
    Becquerel’s health was unbroken, notwithstanding intense applica
tion to his duties and his studies.        Not merely his personal friends,
but the learned world, hoped that, like his father, he might reach
 an advanced age.        Such, however, was not to be his lot.       In the
beginning of May, 1891, he was seized with an indisposition, which,
without apparent cause, rapidly intensi<U+FB01>ed, so that a few days saw
the end of his brilliant career.
    Edmond Becqnerel’s scienti<U+FB01>c services can best be judged from a
survey of his researches.        It will be seen that he took up physics,
especially electricity, from what may be called the chemical side.
 Some of the present developments          of the science would probably
 appeal   to him  less strongly.
    The personal qualities of M. Edmond Becquerel aided in no com
 mon degree the attainment of his high position as a savant.             He
 was patient, persevering, and truthful, and he is known to have been
 what the French expressiver call an homme de caeur.
    It is interesting to note that M. Henri Becquerel has been recom
mended by the Academy of Sciences as the most suitable candidate
to succeed his distinguished father in the chair of Physics applied
to Natural History, at the Museum.
                                                                    W. C.
    THOMAS STERRY HUNT was born          in Norwich, Conn., on September
5, 1826,   of an old New England family.       His ancestor, William Hunt,
was one of the founders of Concord,Mass., in 1635. His maternal grand
father, Consider Sterry, of Norwich, was a civil engineer and mathema
tician, and was the author of text-books of arithmetic and algebra,
published 100 years ago. Mr. Hunt was destined for the profession
of medicine, but, after preliminary studies, his love for chemistry and
mineralogy led him, early in 1845, to become a special student, and

                                    XXV
 afterwards assistant under Professor Benjamin Silliman, sen., in Yale
 College. Two years later, after working for a short time in the
Geological Survey of Vermont, he was selected, on Silliman’s re
commendation, by Mr., afterwards Sir William, Logan to be the
chemist and mineralogist to the then recently-organised Geological
Survey of Canada.      In this position he remained as the colleague and
assistant of Sir William for more than 25 years, till his resignation
in 1872. His work in this capacity is well known. He was employed
in the earliest scienti<U+FB01>c investigations of the petroleum, the rock salt,
the phosphates, and the iron and copper ores of Canada, and also in
researches   on the composition of a great number of rocks and
minerals, of mineral waters, and of soils; while he devoted a large
amount of attention to the structure and composition—at that time so
little known—of the ancient crystalline rocks of the Ottawa Valley
and the Great Lakes, in unravelling the stratigraphical intricacies of
which Logan and his assistant Murray were at the same time actively
and most successfully occupied.       He thus had an important share in
 the great work of instituting   the   Laurentian and Huronian systems
of Geology, and in systematisiug our knowledge of the oldest rocks
of Canada and of the world. This work he afterwards followed up
independently, in the development of the N orian, Montalban,
Taconian, and Kewenian systems, in which he included various
groups of ancient rocks between the Laurentian and the Cambrian;
and, though some of these groups may be regarded as still in dispute,
there can be no question of the great scienti<U+FB01>c value of Hunt’s
studies of them, and of the new facts which he contributed to their
discussion.
    While connected with the Geological Survey, Hunt willingly aided
in the drudgery of literary work and administration, for many parts
of which his early culture and extensive range of reading and know
ledge well <U+FB01>tted him.
   At this time also he conceived and published, in a succession of
papers, those wide views on chemical and general geology which were
 embodied in his greater works, and more especially in his ‘ Mineral
Physiology and Physiography’ (1886), in which he discussed, with
a power and range of knowledge rarely equalled, the original condi
tion of our planet, and the genesis of its more ancient rocks, as well
as the processes of decomposition, recomposition, and metamorphosis
to which they have been subjected.       This great and eminently sug
gestive work deserves the careful study of all concerned in petro
graphy or physical geography, who, whether or not they may agree          -
with all its conclusions, will <U+FB01>nd very much to instruct, and to stimu
late and guide thought and investigation. This work alone, with the
earlier essays on chemical geology, would be suf<U+FB01>cient to form the
basis of a great reputation, and must retain its place as a leading

                                     XXVI
authority on the subjects of which it treats. As the author himself
states, this work, and more especially the
                                                “ Crenitic ”
                                                              hypothesis deve~
                       “
loped   in it, are the   result of nearly 30 years’  studies, having for their
object to reconstruct the theory      of  the   earth  on the  basis of a solid
nucleus, to reconcile the existence of a solid interior with the <U+FB02>exi
bility of the crust, to <U+FB01>nd an adequate explanation of the universally
contorted attitude of the older crystalline strata, and at the same time
to discover the laws which have governed the formation and the
 changing chemical composition of the stratiform crystalline rocks
 through successive geologic ages.”
     To Dr. Hunt we thus owe some of the earliest attempts to sub
 divide and classify in a scienti<U+FB01>c manner the stratiform crystalline
 rocks; a work to which he brought not only his studies throughout
 Canada and the United States, but also the result of inquiries con
 ducted during repeated visits to the British Islands and to Contin
 ental Europe.       In pursuing these studies, and while reviewing and
 controverting various hypotheses, including the igneous or plutonic,
 the metamorphic and the metasomatic, all of which he rejected as
 irreconcilable with observed facts, and as violating chemical theory,
 Dr. Hunt vindicated what he deemed the essential soundness of the
 still imperfect Wernerian aqueous view, and advanced, as its proper
  development and completion, his own crenitic hypothesis. According
  to this theory, the source of the various groups of crystalline rocks
  was “ the super<U+FB01>cial portion of a globe, once in a state of igneous
  fusion, but previously solidi<U+FB01>ed from the centre.             This portion,
  rendered porous by cooling, was permeated by circulating waters,
  which dissolved and brought to the surface during successive ages,
  after the manner of modern mineral springs, the elements of the
  various systems of crystalline rocks. These rocks thus mark pro
  gressive and necessary changes in the mineralogical         evolution of the
                                              '
  earth.”
     Dr. Hunt never abandoned the scienti<U+FB01>c pursuit of chemistry and.
  mineralogy. In the former science he summed up the general con
  clusions of his researches in 1887, in his work entitled ‘A New
  Basis of Chemistry,’ which has gone into a third edition, and has
  been translated into French.        His latest work, published in 1891,
  ‘Systematic Mineralogy,’ gives a new classi<U+FB01>cation of the mineral
  kingdom, based on an improvement of what used to be called the
  Natural History System followed long ago by Mohs and Jameson.
  It would be premature to express any Opinion as to the acceptance by
  chemists and mineralogists in general of the new views propounded
  in these works; but they are unquestionably able, and full of im
  portant generalisations and suggestions which must make their mark
   in the science of the future.
      Dr. Hunt found time to do some work as an educator. He was

                                   xxvii
 Professor of Chemistry in the Laval University,      Quebec, from 1856
to 1862, during which time he delivered annual courses of lectures in
French.      He continued to be Honorary Professor until his death.
He was    also for several years Lecturer in M’Gill University, Montreal,
and was Professor of        Geology at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, 1872—78.         Among his academic titles were those of
M.A., Harvard; Sc.D., Laval; LL.D., M’Gill; and <U+FB01>nally LL.D.,
Cambridge, England.        He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
of London in 1859. He was a member of a large number of other
societies, both Canadian and foreign.       A member of the National
Academy of Science of the United States, in 1873, he was President
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of
the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and twice President of
the American Chemical Society. He was one of the original mem
bers and the third President of the Royal Society of Canada, which,
uniting some of the features of the British Association with those of
a Royal Society, elects a new President annually.             One of the
organisers of the International Geological Congress, he was its <U+FB01>rst
Secretary, and was a Vice-President at the Congresses of Paris, 1878,
Boulogne, 1881, and London, 1888. In connexion with the great
industrial exhibitions, Dr. Hunt represented Canada as a member of
the International Juries at Paris in 1855 and 1867, and at the Phil
adelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876. He was an o<U+FB01>icer of the
French order of the Legion of Honour and of the Italian order of St.
Maurice and St. Lazarus.
   In 1878 Dr. Hunt retired from public professional life, and devoted
himself mainly to the perfecting of his more important works in new
editions, and to the preparation of his ‘ Systematic Mineralogy."
His health and strength, however, gradually declined, and, continuing
to work almost to the last, he passed away peacefully on Friday,
February 12, 1892.       His death must be deplored as a great loss to
science; but he had the good fortune, not granted to all scienti<U+FB01>c
workers, to have means and leisure in his closing years to bring
together in a complete and elaborated form all the principal scienti<U+FB01>c
results of the work of his life.
   In 1878 Dr. Hunt married the eldest daughter of the late Mr.
Justice Gale, a lady of culture and literary taste, who survives him.
                                                              J. W. D.
   CARL WILHELM VON NZGELI, the son of a country doctor, was born
on March 27, 1817, at Kilchberg, a village overlooking the Lake of
Zurich.     His school days were for the most part spent at the Zurich
Gymnasium, and at their close he entered the University of Zurich
with the intention of preparing for his father’s profession. His in
clinations soon led him, however, to pursue scienti<U+FB01>c and philosophical

                                    xxviii
studies, rather than medical, and to devote himself      more  particularly
to botany. With this special object in view, he studied for some time
under Aug. Pyrame de Candolle at Geneva.           He graduated at Zurich
in 1840 with a botanical dissertation, the subject of which was the
Swiss species of the genus Cirs'ium. Within a short time of his gradu
ation he visited Schleiden, then Professor at Jena, and, coming under
the in<U+FB02>uence of his powerful personality, Nageli threw himself heart
and soul into the microscopic researches which, in the hands of von
Mohl and Schleiden, were quickening and developing botanical
science.      The <U+FB01>rst fruits of his labours in this direction were his
“
    Beitritge zur Botanik,” short papers on various subjects, published
in ‘ Linneea,’ 1842; his important paper “ Zur Entwickelungsgeschichte
                ”
 des Pollens      (1842) ; and his remarkable contributions to the short
lived ‘ Zeitschrift fiir wissenschaftliche Botanik ’ (1844—46).
     In 1845 Niigeli married. On his wedding tour he spent some time
 on the south-west coast of England, where he continued the algo
 logical studies begun on a visit to Naples in 1842, the outcome of
 which was his important work ‘ Die neuern Algensysteme,’ pub
 lished in 1847. Shortly after this Niigeli, who had for some years
           “
 been a Privat-Docent,” was promoted to be
                                                    “ Professor extraordi
 narius” at Zurich. During the next few years he did not publish
 much beyond a valuable work on fresh-water Algae (‘ Gattungen
 einzelliger Algen’) in 1849.        He was not by any means idle, how
 ever, for he was engaged on various researches, in the prosecution of
 which he associated with himself, in the year 1854, his pupil Carl
  Cramer, and which were published in 1855—58, forming the monu
 mental ‘ P<U+FB01>anzenphysiologische Untersuchungen.’          In the meantime
 Nageli had become Professor of Botany at Freiburg-im-Breisgau
  (1852), and had passed on from there to Munich (1857).              Of the
 work of the ten succeeding years, his fundamental anatomical studies
 were published in his “Beitrage zur wissenschaftlichen          Botanik”
                                                 ‘                  ’
  (1858—68); the rest he contributed to the Sitzungsberichte           of the
 Bavarian Academy of Sciences, of which he continued to be an active
 contributing member until late in life. The very numerous papers
 which he read before the Academy, dealing with a variety of subjects
 belonging to all departments of botanical science, form three volume:
                                   ’
  of ‘Botanische Mittheilungen        (1861—81).   Special mention should
                                       “ Theorie der
  be made of his important paper,                     Gahrung,” published
  (1879)    in  the ‘Abhandlungen’    of the Bavarian   Academy.     During
  this period he also wrote ‘ Das Mikroskop,’ in conjunction with
  Schwendener (1867, 2nd ed., 1877); and works on the lower Fungi
  (“ Die niederen Pilze in ihren Beziehungen zu den Infectionskrank
  heiten und der Gesundheitsp<U+FB02>ege,” 1877; also in ‘Untersuchungen
  iiber niedere Pilze; aus dem P<U+FB02>anzenphysiologischen Institut in
  Miinchen,’ 1882).      With the publication of his great work, ‘ Die

                                       xxix
  mechanisch-physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre,’ in 1884,
  his scienti<U+FB01>c career may be said to have closed.
     Nageli was ennobled by King Ludwig           II  in 1878, and was elected
  a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1881.              He continued to
  hold the Botanical Chair at Munich until his death, at the age of
  seventy-four, on May 11, 1891. His health, already impaired by ad
  vancing years and excessive work, had been further weakened by an
  attack of in<U+FB02>uenza in 1890, from the eifects of which he had never
  completely recovered.
     Most of the foregoing details as to Nageli’s life have been taken
  from the appreciative notice in ‘Nature’ of October 16, 1891, by
  Dr. D. H. Scott, who obtained them from the funeral oration (in
  ‘Neue Ziircher Zeitung,’ May 16, 1891) delivered by Professor
  Cramer, Nigeli’s whilom colleague.
     With Carl von Nigeli disappears the last member, and not the least
  distinguished, of that triumvirate of workers who, half a century ago,
   were so largely instrumental in laying the foundation of the scienti<U+FB01>c
   botany of to-day. Of his two coadjutors, Hugo Von Mohl, the creator
  of an intelligible vegetable histology, died in 1872 at the age of sixty_
  seven; and Matthias Jacob Schleiden—who, though so much of his
  own work has become obsolete, rendered invaluable service in his
  relatively short botanical career (1837—1850) by insisting on the
  study of development as the only basis of a sound morphology, and
  by inspiring enthusiasm for research in this direction—survived until
  1881, having attained the age of seventy-seven.
     It is impossible, in the case of a prolific worker like Nigeli, to touch,
  however brie<U+FB02>y, on all or nearly all the important contributions to
  knowledge which he made. It must su<U+FB02>ice to dwell on such of them
  as may be regarded as epoch-making; but of these there are many,
  for it has fallen to the lot of but few scienti<U+FB01>c workers to discover
  so many fundamental facts as Niigeli did.
     If, as appears probable, the “Beitrage zur Botanik ” constitute
  Nageli’s <U+FB01>rst attempts at research in the <U+FB01>eld of the new botany, it
  cannot be maintained that his début was altogether brilliant.            The
  reason of  this   comparative   failure   seems  to  be that, inspired prob
  ably by personal enthusiasm for his master, he undertook these in
  vestigations with the object of supporting the Schleidenian theory of
  cell-formation, and of defending it against the well-grounded criti
  cisms of von Mohl and of Unger.            The actual work is good, even
  remarkable   for  the time, but  most   of the conclusions, and many even
  of the observations, are vitiated by the only too obvious parti pris.
  It is not until he has regained something of his independence of
  thought that Nageli’s genius begins to manifest and assert itself.
  This is clearly observable in the almost contemporaneous paper on
. the development of the pollen, where he asserts (p. 17) that the

                                        XXX
  cell-wall is formed not immediately round the nucleus (cytoblast), as
  Schleiden taught, but round a granular mass in the midst of which
  the nucleus lies.     In this paper also he incidentally corrected the
  erroneous view that the granules in the contents of the pollen-grain
  represent spermatozoids, and he observed in certain cases the presence
  of two nuclei in the grain, though he failed to appreciate the full
  meaning of the fact. But his comprehension of the nature of the cell
  was still far below the high level which is marked in his memorable
           “ Zellenkerne,
  paper                    Zellenbildung und Zellenwachsthum,” which
                     ‘
  appeared in the Zeitschr. fiir wiss. Botanik.’       In that paper his chief
  objects  are the  extension of  Robert   Brown’s   discovery of the nucleus
  (1831) to the principal families of Cryptogams, and the investigation
  of the processes of cell-multiplication.      With regard to the former
  point, he arrives at the wide generalisation that the nucleus is present
  in all classes and orders of plants, and that its absence from any
  plant-cell has not been, and probably cannot be, proved ; and he also
  recognises that the nucleus is not a solid mass, but a vesicle, with a
  proper membrane enclosing <U+FB02>uid granular contents with one or more
  nucleoli (‘Zeitschn fiirwiss. Botanik,’ Heft 1, 1844, pp. 68 et seq.). With
  regard to the latter point, he gives up the universality of the Schlei
  denian theory for which he had so stoutly contended, and admits (Zoo.
  cit, Heft 3 and 4, 1846, p, 49) that, in vegetative organs at least,
  cell-multiplication is effected by division, “ free cell-formation
                                                                       ”
                                                                          being
  restricted to the reproductive organs.
     The chief cause of Nageli’s change of view on the subject of cell
  formation was an interesting discovery which, he tells us, he made
  whilst investigating Algae at Naples in the summer of 1842. He
                         “        ”
  recognised that the mucus in the cell forms a continuous lining to
  the wall of healthy cells, to which he gave the name “ Schleimschicht”
  (loo. cit, Heft 1, p. 91).   It is true that Kiitzing had, in the previous
  year (‘ Linnsea,’ 1841), made a similar observation, also in the Algie,
  but he had failed to interpret it correctly: he termed it “ Amylidzelle,”
  thinking that it was, or could be changed into, starch. Nageli, on
 the contrary, ascertained that this layer consists of granular “mucus,”
 which at an earlier stage more or less <U+FB01>lls the cell-cavity, and ate
 later stage forms a parietal layer; and further. that its reactions show
 it to be nitrogenous. Having discovered this, he felt that the results
 of his two earlier papers were no longer convincing, since the
 phenomena which he had regarded as the expression of processes of
 free cell-formation could be ascribed, with greater probability, to the
 contraction of the “ Schleimschicht” away from the cell-wall.             Sub
 sequently (loo. cit, Heft 3 and 4, 1846, p. 52) he carried this discovery

   It is well worthy of note that this subject was at the very same
time engaging the attention of von Mohl.     The year in which N iigeli
announced his discovery of the “ Schleimschicht ” was also the

in which von Mohl described the “ primordial utricle ” (‘ Bot. Zeitg,’
1844!).  Similarly, the year in which Nageli published his more com
plete account of the physiological importance of the “ Schleimschicht ”
was the year in which von Mohl arrived at the comprehensive con
ception of this living substance under the name of “protoplasm ”

tively on this point, since he had failed to discover the female organ,
and had therefore been unable to observe the process of fertilisation.
 Consequently this discovery remained incomplete until Leszczyc.
Suminski detected the female organs on the prothallia of Ferns
 (1848), and Hofmeister established the homology of these female
organs with those of the Mosses, and called them by the same name,
“ archegonia”      Bot. Zeitg.,’ 1849: ‘Vergl. Unters.,’

to this group the discovery previously made in the Ferns.      He points
out that the microspores (at that time known as “ pollen-grains      ”) of
Pilularia, and by analogy those of its allies, do not, as asserted by
Schleiden, grow out into pollen-tubes which effect fertilisation as in
Phanerogams, but that they give rise to free-swimming sperma
tozoids. Here also he failed to discover the female organ, borne on
the prothallium   (“ Keimwulst ”), developed by the macrospore
                                                                    (then

  of cells constituting the neck of the organ which Hofmeister after
  wards proved to be an archegonium.
     The stage of Nageli’s work has now been reached at which he more
  especially devoted his energies to the study of the Algae; and a brief
  sketch of the results attained in this direction will not be out of place
  in view of the general biological importance of some of his observa
  tions, and of the basis which they a<U+FB01>orded for his investigation of
  other families of plants.          The ‘Zeitschrift fiir Wiss. Botanik,’ in
  addition to incidental observations on Algaa in some of the other
  papers, contains four which are exclusively algological: these are
  “ Caulerpa proltfera”
                             (Heft 1); “Wachsthumsgeschichte von Deleg
  se'ria hypoglossum” (Heft 2) ; “Polysiphon'ia”          and “Herposiphonia”
  (Hefte   3 and  4).   The   <U+FB01>rst   of these  is of  importance   in that it gave
  an insight into the structure, not only of this remarkable plant, but
  also of the whole family, the Siphoneae, of which it is a highly
  developed     representative; it proved that here the whole plant,
 though attaining a considerable size, and exhibiting unmistakable
 morphological differentiation into stem, leaf, and root, consists of a
 continuous mass of protoplasm, unsegmented by cell-walls, and may
 be termed “unicellular,” as Nageli termed             it,  though subsequent
 investigation has shown       it     to be multinucleate.       The paper on
 Delessem'a,    though of but slight algological interest, is, however,
 really epoch-making, in that    it     gives the <U+FB01>rst account of growth by
 means of a single apical cell,   a     discovery which was con<U+FB01>rmed by his
 subsequent observations on Polysiphon'ia and Herposiphonia (see also

 these two Algae are of peculiar importance, in that they manifest             a
 clear recognition of the fact that (see especially p. 220, and Plate VII,
 <U+FB01>gs. 1,   2,3), in the Florideae at least, the cell-walls are porous, and
that the cytoplasms of adjacent cells are connected by protoplasmic

rediscovered     and  studied    during   the last ten years.    The algological
interest of these      two  papers  is    also great, for they contain some of
the earliest observations on the antheridia of these plants, on the
tetraspores,     and on the cystocarps (as they had been termed by
Kiitzing), which Nageli considered (see Heft              1,p. 47) to be recep
tacles    for   gemmae,    as  'in   Marohantia,     and  consequently termed
“ Keimbehalter."        At this period he does not express any opinion as
to the sexuality of the Floridese; the <U+FB01>rst de<U+FB01>nite statement on the

subject, unfortunately quite erroneous, occurs in                 neuern Algen
systeme”.(1847), where he separates the Florideae from the rest of
the Algae (including herein the Lichens) on the ground that the latter
are destitute of sexual organs, whereas the former possess them in

the form of male organs (antheridia) and female organs, “in which,
as a rule, four spores are developed.” For several years Nageli con
tinued to hold the view that the mother-cells of the tetraspores are
the female organs of the Floridese; thus, in his paper, “ Beitrage zur
Morphologie und Systematik der Ceramiaceee” (‘ Sitz.-ber. d. k. B.
Akad. d. Wiss.,’ 1861; also ‘ Bot. Mittheil.’), he says. with reference
to this view, that up to that time he had seen no suf<U+FB01>cient reason for
changing it. And yet, in this very paper, he gives an excellent
                                                                 “ Keim

   The discovery in the Algae of the growing-point with an apical cell
was probably the inducement which led Nageli to study the growing
point in other groups of plants. He <U+FB01>rst described the apical cell
and the mode of growth of the stem in various Mosses and Liver
worts (‘Zeitschr.   f.  wiss. Bot.,’ Heft 2), and subsequently (“Ueber
das Wachsthum des Gefiissstammes,” loc. cit, Heft                   3  and 4),
he discovered that in Lycopodium and in Monocotyledons and Di
cotyledons, the growing-point of the stem has no apical cell, but
consists of a small-celled merismatic tissue, in which he traced the
<U+FB01>rst indications of the differentiation of the permanent tissues.
From this he went on to the fundamental anatomical work which
constitutes the main portion of the Beitrage zur wiss. Botanik,’ in the
                                         ‘

 on the anatomy and growth of the root:         it   is true that Hofmeister

 many of the Vascular Cryptogams the growth of the root             is  eifectcd
 by single apical
     a                cell, but  this  detracts but little  from   the  value of
 Nageli’s work. This paper also contains the recognition of the

These contemporaneous      papers brought into notice those phenomena
which, under the comprehensive term “ plasmolysis,” have come to
be of such importance in the explanation of the mechanism of plant
movement. The “ Starkekorner ” is a paper which most strikingly
illustrates in how remarkable a degree Nigeli combined untiring in
dustry with scienti<U+FB01>c insight.        Taken simply as a descriptive ac
count of the starch-grains, of the variety of their form in di<U+FB02>’erent
plants, of their structure, and of their chemical composition, it is the
most exhaustive that has yet appeared.       The preparation of it, which
began in 1850, involved, as Nigeli tells us in the preface, the micro
scopic examination of the roots and rhizomes of about 800 species of
plants, and of the seeds of about 1700 species.     But the main interest
of this paper lies, not so much in the facts, as in the theories con
cerning the mode of growth and the molecular structure of organised
bodies, for which the facts afforded the necessary basis : and further,
in the recognition of the importance of the appearance and disappear
ance of starch-grains as an indication of the metabolic activity of the
plant.
    In 1846 (‘Zeitsch. f. wiss. Bot.,’ Hefte 3 and 4, p. 117) Nageli had
expressed the opinion that a starch-grain is a vesicle the wall of
which becomes thickened, like that of a cell, by the deposition of
successive internal layers.    This view, which he had formed, he says,
whilst “ in Irrthiimern der Schule befangen,” he now replaces by the
well-known theory of “growth by intussusception.”            This theory,
which Nigeli extended also to cell-walls, was generally accepted for
many years, until the publication of Strasburger’s researches (‘ Ban
und Bildung der Zellhaute,’ 1882) when a reaction took place in
favour of the theory of growth by apposition. At the present time,
 however, Strasburger admits (‘ Histologische Beitrage,’ Heft 2)
that the growth of cell-walls may be e<U+FB01>ected by the in<U+FB01>ltration of
material, a process which, as he says, may be termed “ intussuseeption,”
but is not altogether the same as that conceived and named by
Nigeli, which was inseparably associated with his theory of the in
                                                                “
timate structure of organised bodies, generally known as the micellar
theory.”     According to this theory, organised structures, such as
 cell-walls and starch-grains, consist of solid ultimate particles which
 Nageli at <U+FB01>rst regarded as being the chemical molecules, but subse
 quently (‘ Das Mikroskop,’ 1877, p. 354), as groups of molecules
 termed “micellae,” each of which is, under ordinary circumstances,
 surrounded by a layer of water. The particles with their watery
 envelopes are, he argued, held together by the mutual attraction of
 the solid particles, the attraction of each particle for its watery
 envelope, and the cohesion of the ultimate chemical molecules of
 which each particle consists.    By acute reasoning based on the study
 of the physical properties of organised structures, more especially

                                    XXXV
                      ”
their “ swelling-up      and their behaviour with polarised light, N ageli
arrived at the conclusion that the micelles are biaxial crystals, and
assigned to them as a probable form that of parallelopipedal prisms
with rectangular or rhomboid bases. On this theory of their struc
ture, the growth by intussusception of cell-.w'alls and starch-grains
would consist essentially in the stretching of the growing layer so as
to widely separate the existing micellte, and in the intercalation of
new micelles into the intervening watery areas.
   Brilliant as was this attempt to give a purely physical explanation
of certain biological phenomena, and helpful as it undoubtedly was
for a time, it must now he confessed that it was inadequate, and that
it is to no small extent responsible for the tendency to regard plants
more as inanimate objects than as living organisms, which for many
subsequent years impeded rather than assisted the advance of know
ledge as to the mechanism and physiology of the growth and other
movements     of plants.
   Incomplete as this notice is, and indeed must be, it would be alto
gether inadequate were it not to include some account of Nageli’s
attitude with regard to evolution, a subject upon which he was
 peculiarly quali<U+FB01>ed, both by his philosophical habit of mind and his
observations as a naturalist, to express a weighty opinion.     Through
out his life he was an enthusiastic <U+FB01>eld-botanist, and acquired a special
familiarity with the remarkable phenomena of distribution presented
by the <U+FB02>ora of his native Alps.      With the view of giving precision to
his <U+FB01>eld-observations, he devoted particular attention to the large and
highly variable genus Hieracium, the thoroughness of his study being
attested bya number of papers on the genus in the ‘Botanische
Mittheilungen,’ and by a monograph ‘Die Hieracien Mittel-Europas,’
prepared in conjunction with Peter, of which the <U+FB01>rst volume
(“ Piloselloiden ”) was published in 1885, whilst the second (“ Archier
acien ”) was not completed at the time of his death.
   The <U+FB01>rst de<U+FB01>nite statement of Nageli’s views on evolution appears
in an address delivered before the Bavarian Academy, on March 28,
1865, entitled “ Entstehung und Begriff der naturhistorischcn Art,”
which is to a large extent a criticism of the ‘Origin of Species.’
Beginning, with characteristic completeness, at the Origin of living
organisms, Nageli emphasises the importance of Lamarck’s assump
tion that the simplest organisms were, and are continually, formed
by spontaneous generation.       Going to the consideration of Darwin’s
theory of evolution by natural selection, Nageli regards it as being
based esscntially on the principle of utility,
                                                    “ die Niitzlichkeits
theorie ist der Darwinismus ”—a principle which he considers to be
quite inadequate to explain the facts of the phylogeny of either plants
or animals. Darwin’s theory, which involves the assumption that
variation takes place indeterminately in all directions, both higher
                                                                  e

                                xxxvi
and    lower, requires, so Niigeli thought, to be modi<U+FB01>ed and supple
mented by the “ Vervollkommnungstheorie,"       inherited from Lamarck,
according to which variation takes place determinately and in the
                                                                           mas-gh
higher direction only. From this point of view, N ageli emphatically
asserted that the degree of variability which gives rise to more 01
less constant varieties or races is the result, not of external, but of
internal, causes, an assertion which has since been strongly supported,
though on different grounds, by Weismann and others.
    The whole matter is fully discussed in his ‘Mechanisch-physio
logische Theorie der Abstammungslehre,’ published nearly twenty
years later, where, though there is greater elaboration, there is no
essential change of view. In this work Niigeli introduces the idea
of a material basis for heredity in the form of what he terms “ idio
plasm.” The characters which an organism inherits from its parent
or parents are transmitted by the idioplasm of the reproductive cell
or cells, in which all the properties of the adult form are inherent.
But the idioplasm of any one generation is not identical with that of
either its predecessor or its successor.      It is always increasing in
complexity    as  regards both the  arrangement and the constitution of
its micellae, with the result that each generation marks an advance,
 though not always an immediately appreciable one. But the varia
 tion which is primarily due to the inherent properties of the idio
 plasm is not altogether una<U+FB01>‘ected by external conditions;         when
 these act continuously in a given direction they may cause modi<U+FB01>ca
 tions which are, however, merely adaptive. In a word, whereas, on
 the Darwinian theory, all organisation is essentially adaptive, accord
 ing to Nageli the development of higher organisation and of more
 complete division of labour is the visible expression of the spon
 taneous evolution of the idioplasm.
    Although Nigeli’s theory of evolution, as laid down in the "Ab
 stammungslehre,’ has not met with general acceptance, more particu
  larly as regards the small importance which he attaches to natural
 selection, still the work as a whole cannot be judged as other than a
 worthy close to the labours of its author. Full as it is of the accu
 mulated knowledge and experience of a long and earnest scienti<U+FB01>c
 career, it constitutes one of the most valuable and suggestive recent
 contributions to the theory of reproduction and descent.

residence at Cambridge as a scholar of Trinity College. He graduated
B.A. in 1874, in the First Class of the Natural Sciences Tripos, and
proceeded to the further degrees of M.A. in 1878, and D.Sc. in 1884-.

Assistant Master at Eton College, in special charge of the teaching in
biology, a post which he held up to the time of his death, on October
22, 1891.
    Herbert Carpenter was a naturalist from the <U+FB01>rst, and took part
in some of the   most important biological movements of recent times.
He accompanied     the earlier dredging expeditions which preceded and
rendered possible the famous cruise of H.M.S. “Challenger,” he was
a prominent member, and one of the earliest, of the new school of
biology at Cambridge; and his appointment on the staff of one of
the greatest of public schools was hailed as a signi<U+FB01>cant recognition
of the educational value of biological science, and of the importance
of making adequate provision for it in schools.
    When only sixteen years of age he accompanied his father on the
 deep-sea exploring expedition of H.M.S. “Lightning.”         In the fol
lowing years he took part in the dredging cruises of the “ Porcupine,”
 and in 1875 he was one of the scienti<U+FB01>c sta<U+FB01> on board H.M.S.
 “Valorous,” which accompanied Sir George Nares’ Arctic Expedition
 as far as Disco Island, for the purpose of sounding and dredging in
 Davis Strait and in the North Atlantic.
    On these expeditions he was mainly occupied in chemical and
 physical observations, and it was not until he went to Wiirzburg, in
 1875, that he commenced the special study of the group of animals,
 the Echinodermata, to which the remainder of his life was so success
 fully devoted. The choicc of this group was almost an accidental
 one, and was determined in the ,<U+FB01>rst instance by the opportunity his
 residence at Wiirzburg gave him of examining Professor Semper’s
 specimens, and so of determining the real extent and cause of the dis
 crepancies between the results obtained by his father and by Professor
  Semper, with regard' to certain points in the anatomy of the recent
                                               -
 Crinoids.
    Professor Semper was much interested in Carpenter’s work, and
 on the completion of his <U+FB01>rst paper, placed, in his hands the import
 ant collection of Actinometrae     he had himself obtained from the
  Philippine Islands.    The examination of this material occupied
  Carpenter for nearly two years, and led to the publication of an
  elaborate and very important monograph on the genus, in the Trans
  actions of the Linnean Society, which established his reputation as
  an authority on the group.       On the return of the “Challenger”
  Expedition, and the distribution of the collections, the free-swimming
  Crinoids were at once entrusted to Carpenter, and on the death of
  Sir Wyville Thomson, in 1882, the stalked Crinoids were handed to
him as well. Carpenter’s reports on these two groups, published in
  1884: and 1888 respectively, are of a most elaborate       and complete
                                                                  f

                                '
                                  xxxvni
character, and rank among the most valuable contributions ever made
to our knowledge of the group.
    During the preparation of the ‘ “ Challenger ” Reports,’ and after
their completion, Carpenter was continuously engaged in the study
both of Crinoids and of other groups of Echinodermata, and the
long list of his published papers bears striking evidence to his industry
and enthusiasm.      He did not himself work much at the embryology
of the group, but he paid very special attention to the fossil members:
indeed he stands out prominently as one of a comparatively limited
number of zoologists who have given'practical and emphatic recognition
to the fact that zoology and palmontology must not be taught or thought
of as separate sciences, or be worked at by separate investigators,
but must be considered and treated as one great branch of science.
“ I have,” he
                 says, “the strongest conviction (and many mistakes
would be avoided were it auniversal one), that the only way to under
stand fossils properly is to gain a thorough knowledge of the morpho
logy of their living representatives.     These, on the other hand, seem
to me incompletely known if no account is taken of the life-forms which
have preceded them." It is to this thorough-going recognition that
fossils are not merely parts of animals, but parts of animals akin to
those now living on the earth, that the special value of Carpenter’s
palaeontological'work is due. Perhaps his most important contribu
tion from this point of view is the admirable catalogue of the
Blastoidea in the British Museum, of which he is joint author with
Mr. Robert Etheridge, jun.: many of his smaller papers on palaaonto
logical subjects are also of great value.
    As a zoologist, Carpenter was admittedly the leading authority on
 the group he had made so specially his own.     He was enthusiastically
 devoted to his subject, and always ready to show his specimens and
 discuss his results with any brother naturalist.       His own work is
characterised by extreme thoroughness and conscientiousness rather
 than by brilliancy, and is perhaps for this reason more certain to
 endure.    As a teacher he never had more than imperfect opportuni
 ties; but, working under circumstances in many ways discouraging,
 he achieved very considerable     success; and amongst his pupils are
 some who have gained marked distinction in the science they <U+FB01>rst
 learned to know and to respect through him.
    He was a kindly, generous, and unassuming man, whose untimely
 death will be mourned by friends in many nations.

    Sm WILLIAM Csvnnmsn, seventh DUKE or Dnvonsman, Knight of
 the Garter, was born on April 27, 1808. His father was Mr. William
 Cavendish, who married Louisa, daughter of the <U+FB01>rst Lord Lismore.
 His grandfather, Lord George'AugustusCavendish,         third son of  the

                                   xxxix
fourth Duke of Devonshire, was created       Earl of Burlington in 1831    .
The Cavendishes have been conspicuous       in English history for several
centuries, but here it is only necessary    to note the late Duke’s con
nexion with two of the most eminent         philosophers this country has
produced.      His great-grandmother, wife of the fourth Duke of
Devonshire, was the Lady Charlotte Boyle, daughter of the Earl of
Burlington and Cork, and the direct descendant of Richard, second
Earl of Cork, who was brother to the Hon. Robert Boyle, the cele
brated chemist and natural philosopher of the 17th century.           His
great-grandfather was <U+FB01>rst cousin to Henry Cavendish, the no less
celebrated chemist and natural philosopher of the 18th century.
The late Duke was educated at Eton, and at Trinity College,
Cambridge, and his career at the University was exceptionally
brilliant.   In the Mathematical Tripos of 1829 his name appeared as
 Second Wrangler, Philpott, lately Bishop of Worcester, who sur_
vived him only a few days, being the Senior Wrangler.              At the
ensuing examination for the Smith’s Prizes, the order of their names
 was reversed, and they both appeared in the First Class of the Classical
Tripos.    In the same year he married Lady Blanche Howard, daughter
.of the Earl of Carlisle;  and in the following year he was returned as
colleague   of  Lord  Palmerston, to represent the University in Par
liament. It might have been expected that the descendant of the
 staunch friend of Lord William Russell would side with the Whigs;
 he was not, however, a man to be guided merely by tradition,
 or to take his opinions at second hand, but was Liberal by conviction,
.and had the courage of his opinions.     In the debates on the Reform
 Bill, which ensued almost immediately after his return to Parliament,
 he spoke in favour of the measure, and in a few thoughtful and wise
 words pointed out the dependence of good government upon the
con<U+FB01>dence and support of the people.         This was too much for his
 academic constituency, and at the next election he and his col
 league lost their seats.    He continued, however, in the House of
 Commons for a year or two, representing <U+FB01>rst Malton, and then
 Derbyshire, until in 1834: he succeeded his grandfather as Earl of
Burlington.
    In the Upper House he very rarely spoke. It cannot be said that
 he took little interest in politics, for he was a keen observer of the
 course of events, and formed a shrewd judgment of their issues; but
 he never laid himself out for debating.       He was too conscientious,
 too cautious of using idle words, ever to be a ready speaker.         The
 00ndition of Ireland, where the just claims of his tenants were never
 forgotten by him, gave him great concern; and he was a consistent
 supporter of all measures for bettering the condition of the people,
 and removing the grievances which alienated them from England.
 Yet he dissented on principle from Mr. Gladstone’s method of dealing
                                                                f2

                                      x1
  with Home Rule in Ireland, and      became the chairman    of the  Loyal
  and Patriotic Union.
   '
     Although so little prominent in politics, he never shrank from
  coming forward whenever his in<U+FB02>uence, his counsel, or his wealth
  could be used to advance the interests of the community.          In the
  extension of education, among all classes, and in all aspects, he was,
  perhaps, best able, as well as most willing, to take the lead.  He was
  Chancellor of the University of London, from 1834 to 1856 ; and, on
  the death of the Prince Consort, in 1861, was elected without opposi
  tion Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. This of<U+FB01>ce he <U+FB01>lled
  until his death. That University, in 1861, was beginning to enlarge
  its bounds and widen the range of its teaching, and he not only
  watched its progress with never-failing sympathy, but contributed to
  it very materially by his noble foundation of the Cavendish Laboratory,
  over which Clerk-Maxwell presided.       As Chancellor he had some
 times di<U+FB02>icult questions to solve, sometimes personal matters requiring
  care and tact to decide; yet the interests of the University never
 suffered in his hands, and his decisions were invariably accepted by all
 parties. He looked, however, far beyond the limited class who can
 graduate at Cambridge. and when the movement was started for
 carrying University teaching into the large towns, he cordially sup
 ported it.
     He was President at one time of the Owens College, at Manchester,
 and a generous benefactor both of it and of the Yorkshire College, at
 Leeds. After the foundation of the Victoria University, he became
its <U+FB01>rst Chancellor. The importance of science in relation to the
 industrial progress of the nation be highly appreciated, and the
report of the Royal Commission on Technical and Scienti<U+FB01>c Instruc
tion, over which he ably presided, has contributed in no small degree
to the awakening of public attention to that subject. On the forma
 tion of the Iron and Steel Institute, he became its <U+FB01>rst President.
 To agriculture he was always devoted.       He was one of the founders
of the Royal Agricultural Society, and in 1869 its President; and
with his accustomed generosity he contributed to the foundation of
 the Agricultural College at Cirencester.         Quite recently, at the
instance of the Minister for Agriculture, he moved the University of
 Cambridge to take steps for promoting the study of scienti<U+FB01>c agri
culture.
     He managed his own estates, and they could hardly have been
better managed, for he always thought of his tenants’ interests.
When, some thirty years ago, agricultural rents were everywhere
rising, he made no changes in his agreements, and the result was
that when the depression came he lost neither tenants nor rents.
But he was never content merely to leave things as he found them.
For him it was a. duty to the country to develop its resources and

                                    xli
improve the condition of the people.      A large part of the valuable
hematite iron ore of the Furness district lay on his estate, and Barrow,
which in thirty years has grown from a small village to a town of
over 50,000 inhabitants, with its docks and its ironworks, owes its
existence and its prosperity in great measure to his sagacity in enter
prise, and to the liberality and earnestness with which he carried out
his plans. In a different way, but in the same spirit, he promoted the
building of Eastbourne.
   His own life was of the simplest. Most of it was spent at Holker,
near Grange, in Lancashire.       There he took part in the ordinary
business of the county and neighbourhood, and for <U+FB01>fty years was
chairman of the Board of Guardians for the Poor. He lost his wife
in 1840, but the education of his children was his personal concern.
To train his sons to take their place in the State, and to watch their
careers, was his especial delight.    It will be understood how acute
must have been to him the suffering when his second son, Lord
Frederick Cavendish, Chief Secretary for Ireland, was murdered in
 the thnix Park.       His third son, Lord Edward Cavendish, also pre
 deceased him,   but only by some months.    He passed away peacefully
and painlessly, in his eighty-fourth year, on December 21, 1891.
 Rank, wealth, intellectual gifts, had no power to affect the simplicity
of his character, or lessen the deep sense of duty which controlled all
his actions.   ,

   JAMES RISDON BENNETT was the son of a learned dissenting minister,
the Rev. James Bennett, who preached for many years at Falcon
 Square, in the City.       His mother was a descendant of Risdon
Daricott, the Evangelist of Somerset in the middle of the eighteenth
century.
   He was educated <U+FB01>rst at Sheffield and afterwards at the University
of Edinburgh, where he took his degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1833,
in his twenty-fourth year. After this he travelled for a time on the
Continent, and had some thoughts of settling for practice in Rome.
He returned, however, to London, and, after a short connexion with
Charing Cross Hospital, was appointed Assistant Physician to St.
Thomas’s Hospital, which was then still occupying the site of the
old monastery and sick refuge of St. Thomas in the street in South
wark which still retains that name.      Here, Dr. Bennett afterwards
became full Physician and Lecturer on Medicine.       He had previouslv
joined the hospital at Victoria Park for diseases
                                                '
                                                    of the chest, which
had been founded in 1848.
   He was much interested in the physical diagnosis of affections of
the heart and lungs, and was pro<U+FB01>cient in stethoscopy when this
branch of clinical medicine was still little known and even slighted
as a French innovation.

                                     xlii
     Meantime, Dr. Bennett had married and taken a house in Finsbnry
  Square, where he obtained considerable family and       consulting prac
  tice, and formed the friendship of Dr. Jea<U+FB01>'erson,        Dr. Gull, Dr.
  Peacock, and Dr. Herbert Davies, who were then his neighbours.
     In 1875 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1876,
  after serving several of<U+FB01>ces in the College of Physicians, he was
  chosen to <U+FB01>ll the highest of<U+FB01>cial position in his profession by being
  made its President.    In the presidental chair, Dr. Bennett was at his
  best.   Courteous and digni<U+FB01>ed, patient and intelligent, never pom
  pous and never weak, he showed on every occasion his good judg
  ment, good temper, and good sense.
     On his retirement, after <U+FB01>ve years    service, he received the well
 earned    honour of knighthood, and always retained the esteem and
 con<U+FB01>dence of the College.     He had no pretention to oratory, but his
 clear-headed and pithy remarks were always listened to with attention.
 At the Council of the College and on the Council of the Royal Society
 he was valued for his friendliness, his sagacity, and his power of
 silence as well as of speech.
     Sir Risdon Bennett took an active part in the preparations for re
 ceiving the International Congress of Medicine which met in London
 in 1881; and, as Chairman of the Reception Committee, welcomed
 the visitors in a French speech which was delivered with remarkable
 vigour, and was understood as well as applauded by all present, in
 cluding the Frenchmen.
   ,He had moved to Cavendish Square in the' year 1876, and died
there of gradual but rapid senile decay at the ripe age of eighty-two.
     He was a man of tall and digni<U+FB01>ed presence, and pleasant, un-‘
affected manner.     Strictly upright and honourable in his professional
and private life, he was fond of conversation and society, a good
 talker and a good listener, with no trace of envy in his composition,
and a cordial recognition of the merits of his compeers.       Otherwise
happy in his family, he sustained a heavy loss in the death of his
eldest son, who, after a promising career at Cambridge, had only
lately been called to the Bar.        With this exception, Sir Risdon
Bennett’s course was one of uninterrupted prosperity.          His piety
was deep and unobtrusive, and led him to devote much time and
labour to philanthropic work. He was well read in general as well
as medical literature, but published little—an essay on Hydrocephalus,
written when he was a young man, the Lumleian lectures on thoracic
tumours, and a few cases in the medical journals—one published only
a year before his death.     Perhaps his most characteristic appearance
in print was.  a paper advocating counter-irritation as a mode of treat
                                ‘
ment, which appeared in the Practitioner.’
    His high character, his sagacious judgment, and the unaifected
sincerity of his convictions secured for him general respect and esteem,

                                   xliii
 and he deserved the praise due to those who pursue a liberal profes
 sion in a liberal spirit and who form a link between practice and
 science.

    Sir EDWARD   SABINE was the <U+FB01>fth son and  ninth child of Mr. Joseph
 Sabine, of Tewin, Herts.     The Sabines were originally of Norman
 extraction, and were settled in Kent, at Patricksbourne, until the
 beginning of the eighteenth century, when Joseph Sabine migrated
 to Kilmolin, co. Wicklow; several of his descendants are buried at
 Powerscourt, in the same county. At one time there was a baronetcy
 in the family, for John Sabine, of Eyre, in the parish of Gravenhurst,
 in Bedfordshire, was created a baronet March 2, 1670. He left no
 male issue, hence the title became extinct.    At an earlier period, in
 1649, one of the name, an Alderman Sabine, left a sum of money for
 charitable purposes to the city of Canterbury.
    Sir Edward’s great grandfather, Joseph Sabine, had served with
great distinction in Marlborough’s campaigns, and was rewarded with
the Governorship of Gibraltar, where he died in 1739. He purchased
in 1715 the property of Tewin (sold in 1810). A great uncle was
killed at the battle of Fontenoy.
    Sir Edward was born in Great Britain Street, Dublin, October 14,
1788, and his mother, Sarah, daughter of Rowland Hunt, Esq., of
Boreatton Park, Salop, died within a month of his birth.      The child
was taken by his father and sisters to the care of a Mrs. Davies, of
Bath, a warm friend of his mother’s.
    Of his brothers, two made their mark in life. The second, John,
was a captain in the 25th Foot, and apparently a good accountant, for
he was complimented by the Horse Guards in 1800 for the way in
which he had managed the accounts of the regiment. The eldest
brother, Joseph, who died in 1837, was a distinguished Fellow of the
Society. He was the <U+FB01>rst secretary to the Horticultural Society, as
we learn from the notice of his works, ‘Abstracts of the Papers,’
vol. iv, p. 15.
   At the age of 14, Edward Sabine went to school at Marlow, and
being the quickest among all the boys he was called up by the mathe
matical masters to be examined in order to form the course of
instruction at the school.
   In January, 1803, he went to Woolwich, where he remained only
one month in each class, and obtained his <U+FB01>rst commission at the
early age of <U+FB01>fteen years and two months, in December, 1803, after a
little over ten months as a cadet. So urgent was the occasion that
the professors    and masters were called on to forego their usual
vacation to forward the public service.
   His subsequent commissions were dated as follows: —— Captain,

                                       xliv
  1813;     Major, 1837; Lieutenant-Colonel, 1841; Colonel, 1851 ; Major
  General, 1856; Lieutenant-General, 1865; and General, 1870.            He
  was gazetted K.C.B. in 1869.
7     After a year at Woolwich he proceeded to Gibraltar, and returning
  in 1807 was appointed to the Horse Artillery, in which he served at
  various home stations until the end of 1812. On his promotion in
  January, 1813, he fell to a company in Canada, and it was on his
  voyage to Halifax in the “Manchester,” Falmouth packet, that he
  had the <U+FB01>rst opportunity of showing how gallant a spirit was to be
  afterwards diverted from the pursuit of military distinction into
  other channels.        The “Manchester,” when eight days out, was
  attacked by one of those American privateers which swarmed at that
  period to such an extent that they captured one out of every four of
  the Falmouth packets in 1812. After a running <U+FB01>ght of twenty hours’
  and a close engagement of over an hour, she had to strike her colours
   to greatly superior force, on the 24th June, in latitude 47° 10’ N.,
                                                      “
   longitude 24° 10' W. The privateer was the Yorktown,” Captain
   Rider, a cut-down East Indiaman of 500 tons, carrying nine long
   12-prs. and a crew of 116 men, of whom thirty-six served as marines.
                          ”
   The “ Manchester         had only three 9-pr. carronades, two long and
   two light 6-prs.,     with  a crew of only thirty-six men, including pas
   sengers, and only two could be spared .to return the musketry <U+FB01>re
   of the enemy.        That an obstinate resistance was o<U+FB02>ered with such
   disparity of strength, that the British packet fought until she had
    only 10 lbs. of powder left, and the 9-prs. were reduced to <U+FB01>ring
    6-pr. case-shot, those guns being disabled, was pre-eminently due to
    the gallantry of Captain Sabine seconding her commander, Captain
    Elphinstone.      “Captain Sabine and his servant ” (a gunner of the
                   “
    old school) were of the greatest assistance to me,” wrote the com
    mander,
                “ and the enemy has confessed that my stern chasers, which
    were pointed by Sabine and a Mr. Bell, passenger, so completely
    annoyed them, and did them so much damage, that, although greatly
    our superiors in sailing, they were 10th to range alongside.”     Sabine
    himself wrote a detailed account of the action, in which he observed :
    “ We had the satisfaction to <U+FB01>nd, notwithstanding the difference of
     metal, the ‘Yorktown’         had received as much material injury
    as the     ‘Manchester,’  her  foremast and foretop-gallant-mast being
                                                                             '
     shot through, and her hull much damaged; the ‘Manchester’s
     mainmast and maintop-mast were struck in several places, and
     scarcely a rope left whole in the ship, the grape-shot and musketry
     having been very heavy, especially at the close of the action
     when we neared one another. The enemy <U+FB01>red high, and our bul
     warks were very good, which accounts for only three men being
     wounded—two with grape and one by a musket-shot. The ‘York
             ’
     towxi’s     bulwarks were 14 inches solid timber, which formed a

                                          le
  protection for' their men which it was scarcely possible for our shot
  to penetrate.     We knew, however, that one man was wounded, by the
  doctor’s acknowledgment, and had reason to suppose that there were
  more, from an observation of the lieutenant: ‘That three or four
  young hands had fancied themselves hurt.’ We were repeatedly told
  both by the of<U+FB01>cers and crew of the privateer that they wished we
  had never fallen in with them, both in consequence of the expendi
  ture of powder and shot, and of the injury done to their foremast.
  We <U+FB01>red above 400 rounds. They must have <U+FB01>red many more.” He
  mentions that every gun of the enemy was loaded with a double
   headed shot and a bag containing sixty grape-shot.
      The Americans behaved very well.               Sabine commended their
  discipline.     They respected       private property, and treated their
  prisoners with every respect.           The master, mate, and crew were
'
  transferred a couple     of days   later  to another prize.     The captain and
  passengers remained on board in charge of a prize-master, and with a
   crew of seven men set sail for New York. As good fortune would
                                      “ Maidstone”
  have, they fell in with the                         frigate on Sunday, 18th
  July, and were recaptured; the privateer herself having been taken
  by the “Maidstone” on the previous day.              Thus this little episode
  came to an end.        Instead of being landed prisoners at New York,
   Sabine and his companions were set on shore at Halifax, his port of
  destination, and after a week’s delay he was sent round to Quebec.‘
      It was during his service at Quebec in the winter of 1813—14, that
  an incident occurred)“ which Sabine was fond of quoting in later
  life, in illustration of the value of sometimes thinking for one’s self.
  Among the little frontier operations of 1814 was an advance of some
  American militia on Quebec; and he was sent with a small party to
  garrison an outpost. He was directed to take a Ila-pr. gun with him;
  but <U+FB01>nding in the arsenal a light 241-pr. howitzer, which had been
  left there by General Burgoyne when he went on the Saratoga
  Expedition, he thought he could manage to transport that ; and with
  or without permission he did so. He found some coehorn shells, and
  took those, and a supply of fuzes.              He reached his blockhouse
  before the Americans, under a Colonel Williamson, appeared: who,
  arriving in the evening, were settling in their camp and busy about
  cooking, when, to their great astonishment, one of these extemporised
  shrapnels was <U+FB01>red at them with considerable effect.                 They forth
  with retreated to, what they thought, ‘a safe distance; but another
  shell burst among them, and seemed to throw them into great
  confusion. They still further retreated, until fairly out of range.
  In the morning, when Colonel Williamson ordered them to advance
  to attack the post, a man stepped forward and declared he would
     * This incident the writer learned  from the late Rev.  '1‘. B. Robinson, D.D.,
  F.R.S.             I

do    no   such    thing,   but   intended      to  return   home    immediately.
He    was ready to <U+FB01>ght to the death in defence of his own               country;
but he did not see the sense of invading that of others when             they had
enough of their own.         The commander ordered him to be arrested;
but, to his dismay, no one obeyed the order, and when he threatened
them they said they had all agreed with the spokesman, and would go
home—and so they did.‘
    Captain Sabine’s next service was on the Niagara frontier, Where
he was favourably mentioned in despatches; and was long the last
survivor of the battery, and was privileged to wear the word
“             ”
   Niagara       on dress and appointments.
    He was in command of the batteries at the siege of Fort Erie in
1814,.
    In the year 1816 he returned to England, and then he <U+FB01>rst began
to direct his attention to terrestrial magnetism and pendulum obser
vations, at the house of his brother-in-law, Mr. Henry Browne,
F.R.S., 2, Portland Place, to whom            he was indebted    for <U+FB01>rst direct
ing his thoughts to these sciences.              This   house was more or less
his home for many years; there he met frequently Captain Henry
Kater, F.R.S., and became attracted forcibly to similar lines of
inquiry; and thence he started on his successive expeditions.                  He
had, however, doubtless studied practical astronomy previously, for in
1818 his reputation as a skilful observer was such that the President
and Council of the Royal Society recommended him for the appoint
ment of Astronomer to accompany the Expedition, sent in search of a
north-west passage, under Commander (subsequently Sir) John Ross
in that year.
    His attention, however, was not solely directed to physics, for his
report on the biological results of the expedition appeared in vol. 12
of the ‘ Transactions of the Linnean Society,’ and it embraced twenty
four species of birds of Greenland, of which four were new to the
list, and one, the Limits Sabini, described by his brother Joseph, entirely
new.
    On his return Sabine was not long allowed to be idle, for on the
equipment of a second expedition in 1819, under Lieutenant-Com
mander (subsequently Sir Edward) Parry, he was again selected to
accompany it.
    Parry, in the introduction to his Journal, published 1821, acknow
ledges Sabine’s labours in these terms :—
    “ The
            various observations made on board the ‘ Hecla’ during the
voyage, have been carefully collected into tables, on the model of those
of Wales and Bayly, by Captain Sabine, to whom I am indebted for
the arrangement of nearly the whole of the Appendix, and for the

of<U+FB01>cers present.

                                      leii
 superintendence of that part of the work during its progress through
 the press.    I feel it no less a duty than a pleasure to acknowledge that
 in the performance of this task, Captain Sabine has added another to
 the many obligations I owe him for his valuable advice and assistance
 during the whole course of his voyage, to the credit of which his
                                                                          ‘
 individual labours have so essentially contributed.”
    It might have been added that he contributed not a little to the
 cheerfulness and harmony of the expedition, by consenting to edit the
 ‘
   North Georgia Gazette and Winter Chronicle,’ a weekly publication
 established during its tedious stay at Winter Harbour, where the sun
 was ninety-six days below the horizon. It extended to twenty-one
 issues. The total strength of the expedition being but eighteen, the
 editor had to rely very much on his own pen. The result was so
 highly appreciated as to call for republication.
    Sabine did not accompany Parry on his second voyage, the post of
 astronomer being <U+FB01>lled by the chaplain, the Rev. George Fisher.
 He was himself elected to conduct a series of experiments for deters
mining the variation in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds,
 in different latitudes, a subject which had engaged his attention in the
<U+FB01>rst voyage.
    Sabine in the pursuit of this investigation visited St. Thomas (Gulf
 of Guinea), Maranham, Ascension, Sierra Leone, Trinidad, Bahia,
Jamaica, in 1821—22; New York, Trondhjem, Hammerfest, Greenland
and Spitzbergen in 1823. No less than <U+FB01>ve men of the Royal Marines,
who had been placed at his disposal by Captain Clavering, R.N., as
assistants at Sierra Leone, were carried off by fever during a stay of
about <U+FB01>ve weeks in that pestilential climate.
    Sabine’s observations of the “magnetic” inclination and force at
 St. Thomas in 1822 were probably the <U+FB01>rst ever made on that island.
Utilised as a base of comparison with the recent magnetic observations
of the Portuguese, they become important in showing the remarkable
secular change that has been in progress in those elements during the
interval.
    The remarkable account of his pendulum experiments, printed in a
lite. volume by the Board of Longitude in 1825, must always remain
an enduring monument to his scienti<U+FB01>c merit. It would be impossible
in this brief notice to give any adequate idea of the indefatigable
industry, the spirit of inquiry, or the range of observation evinced,
The work was honored by the Lalande Gold Medal of the Institute
of France, in 1826.
    The subject of pendulum experiments was one in which he long
took great interest; in the years 1827 to 1830 he made experiments
to determine the relative lengths of the seconds pendulum in Paris,
in London, in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and at Altona,
and he afterwards determined the absolute length at Greenwich.

                                  xlviii
Finally, in  1864, he moved the Government of India to undertake the
series  of pendulum observations at various stations of the Great
Trigonometrical Survey, from the sea level at Cape Comorin to the
lofty tablelands of the Himalayas, which have thrown so much light
on the constitution of the earth’s crust, and on local variations of
gravity.
   The year 1826 was marked by his happy union with Miss Elizabeth
Juliana Leeves, daughter of William Leeves, of Tortington, thence
forth his inseparable companion, his invaluable and devoted assistant,
and latterly his vigilant guardian, until their union was dissolved by
her death, in 1879, after <U+FB01>fty-three years of married life.             Her
mastery of the German language was something exceptional.               She
made herself competent to share in every investigation her husband
undertook, and habitually examined and checked his work; suf<U+FB01>ce it
to say that thenceforward his powers were doubled.
   Captain Sabine’s next service, after the publication of his pendulum
experiments, was as a Joint Commissioner, in 1825, with Sir John
Herschel, to take part with a Commission, nominated by the French
Government, to determine the precise diiference of longitude between
the observatories of Paris and Greenwich, by means of rocket signals.
Herschel and M. Largeteau were the observers on the French side of
the Channel at Lignieres, Captain Sabine and Colonel Bonne on the
British side, at Fairlight Downs, near Hastings. The di<U+FB01>'erence of
longitude thus found was 9m. 21'6 s., which was believed to be not
more than one-tenth of a second in error, and extremely unlikely to
prove erroneous. to twice that amount.       The accepted di<U+FB01>erence at
the present day of electrical signalling is 9 m. 21'0 s., a slightly larger
error, but the determination was very close. In 1827, he compared
the length of the seconds pendulum and the magnetic force of the
earth at the same two stations.
   Having obtained from the Duke of Wellington, then Master
General of the Ordnance, a general leave of absence from military
duties, as long as he could usefully be employed in scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits;
he became in 1827 one of the secretaries of this Society, to which he
had been elected a Fellow in 1818. This ol<U+FB01>ce he <U+FB01>lled down to
1829.
   The condition of Ireland in 1830 was, as it has been usually since,
one to occasion the gravest anxiety.       There was a failure of the
potato, from the effects of a cold wet summer; local famines; an
epidemic of in<U+FB02>uenza; constant collisions between the peasantry and
the police.    Under such circumstances Captain Sabine was ordered
to join his company: he served with it, or occasionally on the Sta<U+FB01>'
of his friend General Sir James Douglas, K.C.B., for the ensuing
seven years, and acquired the character of being a very “smart
 o<U+FB02>ioer:” but the time was by no means lost to science.      He published

                                   xlix
two Pendulum       papers in 1830 and one in 1831. In 1834: he com
menced, in conjunction with the Rev. Humphry Lloyd (afterwards
Provost of Trinity College), and Captain James Clarke Ross, R.N.
(afterwards Sir James Ross, of Antarctic fame), the <U+FB01>rst systematic
magnetic survey ever made of the British Islands. He extended it
single-handed, to Scotland, in 1836, and to England, in conjunction
with the same and some additional observers, in the following year.
With the exception of the mathematical section of the Irish Report,
which was Professor Lloyd's, the Reports—which were published by
the British Association—were mainly his; and also a very large
share of the observations,     more particularly the laborious task of
combining them, by equations of condition, to obtain the most pro
bable mean results. About twenty-three years later (1858—61), with
unabated interest, and still privileged to number Dr. Lloyd among
his coadjutors, he undertook, at the request of the General Com
 mittee of the British Association, to repeat this Survey; and, as
 before, reduced and reported the results, as far as concerned the
 elements of Dip and Force.        Captain (afterwards Sir F.) Evans,
 R.N., Hydrographer to the Admiralty, dealt with the Declination.
    The year 1836 will ever be memorable in the history of British
 Science, for a letter, dated 22nd April, addressed to H.R.T-I. the Duke
 of Sussex, President of the Royal Society, by Baron Alexander von
 Humboldt, in which he referred to conversations he had held with
 Sabine and Lloyd, on a recent visit which they had paid to Berlin,
 and he urged upon the British Government to establish regular mag
 netical stations in different parts of the British Empire, similar to
 those which, mainly through his in<U+FB02>uence and exertions, had already
 been some years in operation in Northern Asia.         This letter was
 referred to the Astronomer Royal, Mr. (afterwards Sir George) Airy,
 and Samuel Hunter Christie for a report.—‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 3.
    A Committee on Mathematics and Physics was appointed in May,
 1838, of which Major Sabine and Professor Lloyd were prominent          a
 members, and towards the end of the year the de<U+FB01>nitive and of<U+FB01>cial
 recommendation was made to H.M. Government, already prepared to
 receive it, to establish magnetic observatories at selected stations in
 both hemispheres, and despatch a Naval Expedition to the Southern
 Hemisphere, with the purpose of making a magnetic survey of the
 Antarctic   regions.
    It is needless to say that Major Sabine played an active and con
 spicuous part in all these negociations and preparatory arrangements.
    The observations were placed under the charge of Lieutenants of
 the Royal Artillery, all of whom went through a course of preliminary
 training at the Magnetic Observatory, Trinity College, Dublin, under
 the superintendence of Professor Lloyd; in fact, the scienti<U+FB01>c super
 vision of the scheme was left in great measure in Lloyd’s hands.

                                          I
   The <U+FB01>rst three o<U+FB01>icers invited to join the scheme were: the late
Lieutenant General Sir J. H. Lefroy, the late Lieutenant-General
F. M. Eardley \Vilmot and Major-General C. J. B. Riddell.     These
were soon followed by the late General W. J. Smythe, Lieutenant
General C. Younghusband, Major-General H. Clerk, and the late
Lieutenant-Colonel H. F. Strange. The naval expedition was placed
under the command of Captain (afterwards Sir James Clark) Ross.
   The observatories began their work in 1840. The <U+FB01>rst publication
was a 4to. volume of observations on days of unusual magnetic dis
turbance, published in 1843, which was followed by a second, on the
same subject, in 1851.                              -

     Sir E. Sabine
                 was enabled to complete this enormous amount of work
by the fact that for upwards of twenty years a clerical establishment
was maintained by the   War O<U+FB02>ice at Woolwich, under his own special
control.                                                                .
   From these of<U+FB01>cial publications, we pass to Magnetic Surveys.
Sir E. Sabine lived to complete in <U+FB01>fteen “ Contributions ” to the
‘Philosophical Transactions,’      gigantic work undertaken by him,
                                     a
namely,    survey of the general Distribution of Magnetism over the
            a
Globe at this epoch.   Several of these appeared after he had lost the
aid of his establishment of clerks, the last in 1876. In these are to be
found every observation of any authority, taken by sea or land, since
1818, or thereabouts, arranged in zones of 5° and 10° of latitude, and
taken in the order of longitude eastward from Greenwich round the
globe.   All the results of Arctic and Antarctic voyages, and special
expeditions were utilised.     Everything that he could glean from
Russian, German, American and other foreign sources, much of which
is not accessible in any other form; and these were accompanied by
maps prepared for him in the Hydrographical Department of the
Admiralty, under the supervision of Captain (subsequently Sir)                I
Frederick Evans, R.N.     It may be safely said that had Sir E. Sabine

                                    li
done    nothing but collect, compile, and discuss this vast mass of
material, he would have rendered a service to science, which would
make his name live as long as Halley’s, but it forms only a part of
his life labour. Communications to this Society and the Philosophical
Magazines, on some subject of the moment, were always <U+FB02>owing from
his pen. His addresses to this Society and to the British Association,
as President, must not be forgotten.       Our Catalogue down to 1874:
contains 101 titles of papers by him, and his activity did not cease
with that year.
   Sir Edward’s military honours have been already enumerated, as
well as the fact of his temporary service as Secretary of this Society,
1827—29.     His subsequent appointments were as follows :——In 1839
he was elected General Secretary of the British Association, a
laborious o<U+FB01>ice which he continued to hold for twenty years, with the
single exception of the year 1852, when he exchanged the Secretary
ship for the Presidential Chair, at the <U+FB01>rst meeting at Belfast.
   In 1846 he was elected Foreign Secretary of this Society, in 1857,
its Treasurer, and <U+FB01>nally, four years later, he was chosen President,
an of<U+FB01>ce which he held till 1871.
   In 1821 he received the Copley Medal ; in 1826 the Lalande Medal
of the Institute of France, and in 1849 one of our Royal Medals. Of
foreign orders he held that of pour le Me'rite from Prussia, SS. Maurice
and Lazarus from Italy, and the Rose from Brazil.
   Turning to another view of his character, it may be said that Sir
Edward’s scienti<U+FB01>c capabilities were heightened by his social qualities.
His grace of manner, his cheerful voice, and his brightness of aspect
impressed all who came within his in<U+FB02>uence.            A Fellow of the
 Society, who had travelled up from Manchester to be present at one
of the Conversaziones, once remarked, “ It is worth all the time and
trouble to see, on arrival, the President’s smile.”
    In the year 1876, his scienti<U+FB01>c activity came to an end. In 1879
he lost his wife, who for more than half a century had found her
chief happiness in placing at the service of his scienti<U+FB01>c investiga
tions the best efforts of a mind and a memory such as rarely have
been given to any woman.
    He himself <U+FB01>nally passed away, at Richmond, June 26th, 1883, at
 the patriarchal age of 94 years 8 months.      He was buried quietly at
 Tewin,   Herts, in the vault belonging   to  his family, and beside the
remains of his wife.
    Sir Edward left no issue, and the very name of Sabine in the
direct line of his family has become almost extinct, for his only
surviving nephew on the male side, the late Admiral Sir Thomas
 Sabine Pasley, K.C.B., had taken the additional name of Pasley.
