      A Paper        was read, entitled,                     “On
                                                              the nature of negative and ima
ginary quantities.” By                            Davies Gilbert, Esq. President of the Royal
Society.
   The object of this paper, the author observes, is one that has given
rise to much controversy, and has been involved in much unnecessary
mystery.     Paradoxes and apparent solecisms, when involved with
facts and indubitable truths, will always be found, upon accurate
examination, to be near the surface, and to owe their existence either
to ambiguities of expression, or to the unperceived adoption of some
extraneous additions or limitations into the compound terms em
ployed for definition, and which are subsequently taken as constituent
parts of their essence.
   The first misapprehension pointed out, is that of considering any
quantity whatever as negative per              and without reference   se,        an                                     to
other  opposed              to   it,
                         which has    previously   been established         positive.                              as
In  order     avoid previously formed associations

   The Voltaic arrangement      employed                             by
                                                  the author consisted

posed fluid suspected to contain the poisonous metal; in which case,
as was formerly shown by Sir H. Davy in his Bakerian lecture, the
metal held in solution is deposited in the form of crystals, on the
negative surface. The zinc was usually employed in the form of
foil; the platina was, in some cases, a small crucible, or a spatula;
but more frequently platina foil was used. It is generally necessary
to mix a few drops of acid with the metallic compounds that are
subjected to this test, and that are placed    contact with the pla       .in
tina:     applying the zinc foil, the platina will soon become coated
              on
with the reduced metal.

         I                                                          on

months ago.     Several individuals     great distinction, of   extensive                            of
acquirements and     splendid talents, are undoubtedly brought before

this metropolis tend in some instances to lessen the pain we should
otherwise feel on the recital of their names. While in the former
case, persons at the very head of different departments in science,
of our own ages, and daily conversant with our social habits, were
suddenly taken from us, leaving the higher paths of science (as we
feared at the time) without a foot that might in future trace their
windings; and our more familiar society without that sparkling of
intellect, which invigorates the understanding, and at once elevates
and refines the common intercourses of life.
       The individual, who unquestionably demands our first attention is
Major James Rennell, taken from us in his eighty-eighth                                                    year,   la
mented by               all
                 those who are capable       appreciating his science,      of
and      by

plicity and kindness               of
                        his manners.
  I   have endeavoured         collect some particulars respecting this
                                             to
distinguished person     his early years.

   Major Rennell was descended from              ancient and respectable    an
family     Devonshire, said
             in                          Norman origin. His father was
                                                  to    be   of

       The fatigues attached    this civil employment were sufficient
                                             to

 Academy       of
                Petersburg, &c.
    In the first part   this paper the author adduces proofs
                         of                                       the efficacy                of
of  telescopes constructed with fluid lenses,          the principles deve  on
loped    inhis two former papers, published        the Philosophical Trans
                                                                      in
 actions,     separating double stars, resolving nebulae, and exhibiting
              in

                                                14
different appearances in the discs of the planets. He institutes, with
this view, a comparison between the performance of his telescope
of 8 inches aperture and 12 feet in length, with Mr. Herschel's
telescope, made with his new 20 inches speculum, and with Sir
James South's new refractor, of 12 inches aperture and 20 feet                                          fo
cal length. In Mr. Barlow's telescope 7 Persei, which is marked as
double in South and Herschel's catalogue, is seen distinctly sextuple.
The stars composing a Orionis, marked in the catalogue as two dis
tinct sets of stars, each triple, are shown in Mr. Barlow's telescope
as being both quadruple, with two very fine stars between them.      A
very fine double star was discovered by Mr. Herschel between the
two which compose 3 Capricorni, and was considered by him as a
very severe test: this star is seen distinctly in Mr. Barlow's tele
scope, but not double.
   Messier's 22nd nebula is resolved by Sir James South's telescope
into an immense number of brilliant small stars.     In Mr. Barlow's
telescope     the same resolution is                    effected,       though       somewhat       less
completely.
   The two last-mentioned instances he considers as affording ex
cellent criteria of the exact limits of the power of the instrument.
   Mr. Barlow next examined Jupiter and Mars in order to com
pare the defining powers of the two instruments.           Both these planets
were more sharply defined in Sir James South's telescope than in
that of the author, but in this respect the superiority of the former
instrument was by no means as great as he expected: and in the
exhibition of the shadow of one of Jupiter's satellites passing over
his disc, there was no apparent difference between the two instru
ments.     When applied to Mars, the former with a power of 1200,
the latter with one of 260, the effects were nearly equal.
   An experience of three years has not shown the slightest per
ceptible change in either the quantity or quality of the fluid em
ployed as the lens of the author's three-inch telescope; neither has
the glass inclosing it suffered any diminution of                 transparency.  its

                                       15
   are    now necessary.    This construction will also be attended with
   the advantage of requiring a much smaller thickness in the plate
   glass, and will thus facilitate the selection of proper pieces of glass
   for being worked into an object lens.
       From all these considerations, the author entertains the confi
   dent expectation of being able, with proper assistance, to construct
   a telescope of two feet aperture and 24 feet in length, which
   would as much exceed the most powerful telescopes of the present
   day, as these exceed the refractors     which existed at the close of the
   last century.

     A Paper was read, entitled, “Researches in Physical Astronomy;”
by   John William Lubbock, Esq. V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal
 Society.
    The author has shown in a former paper, published in the last
 part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1830, that the stability
 of a system of bodies subject to the law of gravitation, is always
 preserved, provided they move in a space absolutely devoid of re
 sistance.   This conclusion results from the analytical expressions
 for the variations of the elliptic constants in the theory of the
 Planetary Motions.
    In the present paper he extends his researches to the problem of
the precession of the Equinoxes, which admits of a similar solution
to the former.    Of the six constants which determine the position
of the  revolving body,   and the axis of instantaneous rotation, at any
instant, three have only periodic inequalities; while the other three
have each a term which varies as the time; but from the manner in
which these constants enter into the resulting expressions, the equi
librium of the system may be inferred to be stable, as in the former
case.    By the stability of the system, the author wishes to be un
derstood to mean that the pole of the axis of rotation has always
nearly the same geographical latitude, and that the angular velocity
of rotation, and the obliquity of the ecliptic vary within small limits;
and that   itsvariation  is  periodical.
   The author also      gives  new methods       obtaining the inequalities
                                                 of
of  longitude, and the radius vector,       inthe planetary theory, retain
ing the square    of    the eccentricities.   When only the first powers
of   the eccentricities are retained, these expressions admit          sim

  A    Paper was read, “On the Hour Lines of the Ancients." By W.
A. Cadell, Esq. F.R.S.
   The hour lines on the sundials of the ancient Greeks and Romans
correspond to the division of the time between sun-rise and sun-set
into twelve equal parts, which was their mode of computing time.
An example of these hour lines occurs in an ancient Greek sundial,
forming part of the Elgin collection of marbles at the British                        Mu
seum, and which there is reason to believe had been constructed
during the reign of the Antonines.           This dial contains the twelve
hour lines drawn on two vertical planes, which are inclined to each
other at an angle of 106°; the line bisecting that angle having
been in the meridian.       The hour lines actually traced on the dial
consist of such portions only as were requisite for the purpose the
dial was intended to serve: and these portions are sensibly straight
lines. But the author has shown, in a paper published in the Trans
actions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, that if these lines are
continued through the whole zone of the rising and setting semi
diurnal arcs, they will be found to be curves of double curvature on
the sphere.      In the present paper the author enters into an inves
tigation of the course of these curves; first selecting as an example
the lines indicating the 3rd and the 9th hours of the ancients.
 These lines are formed by the points of bisection of                 the rising
                                                                           all
and   setting  semidiurnal   arcs;  commencing      from the southern point
where the meridian cuts the         horizon,   and proceeding till the line
reaches   to  the first      of
                           the  always  apparent parallels, which, being               a
 complete circle,       meets
                       it         the end
                                       at           first quadrant. At this

point the branch           of
                         another and similar curve        continuous with it:
                                                                    is
namely,   a   curve which          to inits
                                     course bisects another set            semi  of
 diurnal  arcs,  belonging        place

of this cone presents two opposite hyperbolas between asymptotes
which cross one another at right angles.         This cone varies in                                             its

 these forces tend to change the figure of the fluid, that theory is                        in
 adequate to give an exact determination of the equilibrium in those
 cases.
     In                 of the paper, the author applies his theory of
          the second part
the equilibrium of fluids to the determination of the figure of the pla
nets, under the supposition that they are composed wholly of fluid
materials. For this purpose he first considers the problem of deter
mining the equilibrium of a homogeneous mass of fluid entirely at
  liberty, when the accelerating forces are known functions of the co
  ordinates at their point of action. In the investigation of this pro
  blem, he supposes that the centre of gravity is at rest, and undis
  turbed by the action of any accelerating force. He then supposes the
  fluid to be in equilibrium, and that three planes are laid down, inter
  secting one another at right angles in the centre of gravity of the
  mass, to which planes the particles of the fluid are referred by rectan
  gular co-ordinates. The algebraical consequences of this supposition
  are then pursued, the conditions necessary to equilibrium pointed
  out, and the conclusion deduced, that the resultant of the accelera
 ting forces is perpendicular to the outer surface, and also to the                         in
  terior level surfaces of the fluid, at every point of which there is the
 same intensity of pressure. The figure of the fluid being determined,
 it remains to inquire, whether the equilibrium is secure; and the
  result of the inquiry furnishes an equation which proves that the par
 ticles have no tendency to move, from any inequality of pressure.
      A further discussion is entered into in order to prove that the pres
 sures propagated from the surfaces into the interior parts balance and
 destroy one another, which completely establishes the permanence of
 the figure of the fluid. It is also shown that the mass of fluid, under
 these circumstances, has no tendency to turn upon an axis.
     To illustrate the foregoing problem, the author applies it to the de
 termination of the figure of equilibrium of a homogeneous mass of
 fluid entirely at liberty, of which the particles attract one another with
 a force directly proportional to the distance, at the same time that
 they are urged by a centrifugal force caused by rotation about an
 axis.
     He then enters upon the investigation of the second problem, in
 which the law of attraction of the particles is that of the inverse du
plicate ratio of the distance; and finally arrives at the conclusion,
                                                            is,

 A much greater degree of accuracy was attained by La Place, who
 bestowed particular attention on the influence of minute quantities
 in every part of his theory. In the present paper the author has
 endeavoured to introduce further improvements in the lunar theory,
 by carrying the approximations considerably further than they have
 hitherto been made.
    In the solutions of the problem given by former mathematicians,
 the chief obstacle to the attainment of accuracy was the extreme
 length and labour of the necessary computations. Another object,
  therefore, which the author has had in view, is to facilitate these
 computations, and render them less laborious. This he endeavours
 to effect by the employment of certain artifices, by which the multi
 plicity of small terms will, with their co-efficients, be reduced within
  a practicable compass, and their numerical computation rendered
 less appalling.
    The co-efficient of the equation depending on the moon's distance
 from the sun, affords the means of calculating the sun's horizontal
 parallax. For this purpose La Place has computed this co-efficient
 with greater accuracy than the rest; and he makes the sun's parallax
 nearly 9". The author's theory gives it little more than 8"#, which
 is very near the mean of the various results obtained by the obser
 vation of transits. He thinks that there                      is,
                                                 therefore, great reason
 to  conclude that       its
                      true value     about this quantity.

two  of water, consisting of 16 oxygen and 2 hydrogen; thus form
ing 46 nitrous acid, and 74 muriatic acid. But an acid so consti
tuted should be incapable of acting on gold or platina; now the acid
resulting from the absorption of chloro-nitrous gas by water has
this power.
   The author concludes from his experiments, that the power of
nitro-muriatic acid in dissolving gold is not owing to the liberation
of chlorine, and that muriatic acid may be separated from nitric acid,
even when the latter is only half the volume of the former. He re
gards chlorine and chloro-nitrous gases as the gaseous products
arising from the mutual action of strong nitric and muriatic acids
on each other. The nitro-muriatic and chloro-nitrous acids strongly
resemble each other in their action on platina, though the solvent
power of the latter is decidedly greater than that of the former; and
the addition of water considerably increases this power in both, pro
bably by counteracting their disposition to assume the elastic state.
Both acids form, with different bases, salts which are mixtures of
nitrates and chlorides. The principal differences in these acids may
arise from their mode of preparation, and is probably due to the
want of uniformity in their composition.

    The reading of Mr. Lloyd's Paper was resumed and concluded.
    The author of this paper received directions from the Lords Com
missioners of the Admiralty, in February 1830, at the suggestion
of the Royal Society, to survey the river Thames, with a view of
ascertaining the difference of level between certain parts of it and
the mean level of the sea near Sheerness.        Having had experience,
while   employed    in a survey of the Isthmus of Darien, of the great

                                                            31
 imperfections in the levelling instruments hitherto used, he bestowed
 great pains in improving the construction of those employed in the
 present survey; endeavouring to combine the properties of great
 steadiness and accuracy of motions in azimuth, with increased deli
 cacy in the level, and permanence in the general position of the
 whole apparatus; and also to increase the power of the telescope.
 The author then enters into a full description of the improved                                                        in
 struments which he employed, accompanied by drawings.
    As soon as he was furnished with the proper means of observing,
he commenced his operations at Sheerness in the month of March.
 The principal object of his commission being to ascertain the heights
 of different places above the level of the sea, it became necessary,
in the first place, to estimate the heights of the tide; and accord
ingly, having obtained permission from the Admiralty to erect a tide
gauge at the Dock Yard at Sheerness, he selected a corner of the
boat basin as the most eligible spot for this purpose: having accom
plished this object, he next directed his attention to the establish
ment of a standard mark, from whence, as from a zero point, the
levellings might be reckoned. Considerable difficulty was met with
in fixing upon a spot in every respect adapted to this object; for
to allthe buildings       the immediate vicinity
                                 in                       the tide gauge appeared  of

 was rendered tedious by the abruptness of the ascent. Having com
 pleted these observations, it occurred to the Astronomer Royal that
 the instruments employed in the survey might be used as a means of
 verifying the correctness of the horizontal point of the mural circles.
 The coincidence of the horizontal wires of the two instruments was
 found to be so nearly perfect, as to agree within a few hundredths
 of a second. From Greenwich the levelling was continued on the
 opposite side of the river to different places where tide-registers had
 been kept.    By the kindness of Mr. Lubbock, the author was fur
 nished with the results of twenty-six years' observations on the tides
 at the London Docks; from which it appears, that the height of mean
 high-water mark there, above that at Sheerness, is 2-24 feet and the
 height of spring tide high-water mark 2:03, and of neap tides 2-35.
 The Trinity mark on the western side of Old London Bridge is
 2.16 feet below the north standard mark at Sheerness, and 1:9 foot
 above the mean spring tide high-water mark at Sheerness.
    The author concludes by giving a long catalogue of standard marks
 and other points of reference between Sheerness and London Bridge,
 the north standard at Sheerness being taken as the zero point.
    In the course of his observations he found reason to believe that
 the tremulous appearance of the air which has been termed mirage,
 is caused, not so much by evaporation as by the direct effect of the
 solar rays : for he remarked, that when there was a succession of
 clouds passing over the sun, the tremor was very great at those times
 when the sun shone; but the moment the sun was obscured over the
 whole space between the instrument and the object viewed, theair was
 perfectly tranquil.                                       -

  The author, after giving extracts from the Report        the Com     of
missioners appointed          by
                         His late Majesty    inquire into the supply

                                    37
of water to the metropolis, in support of the practicability of afford
ing a supply of filtered water from the Thames, adequate to the de
mand, and within reasonable limits in point of expense, proposes his
plan of forming a filter under the bed of the river for each Company.
He   states that the deposit   of mud   on each side   of   the Thames does
not reach below the low-water mark, and that the bed of the river
throughout is generally a clean and strong, though porous gravel.
The mud, therefore, will puddle in, and close the pores of the bed
of gravel on which it lies, above low-water mark, so that the filtra
tion into the neighbouring wells, the waters of which are remarkably
pure, must take place below low-water mark. He therefore pro
poses to construct a filtering chamber below the bed of the river,
from which chamber a main pipe or tunnel must be made for con
ducting the filtered water into a well on the river side, whence it is
to be drawn up by steam power, and distributed to the houses to be
supplied, by the mains and branches at present existing.
    The filtering chamber and apparatus are to be prepared by erect
ing a coffer-dam in the river, of sufficient size to inclose the whole
of the area required for that purpose. This coffer-dam will require
piles of forty-five feet in length. The bed of the river, thus laid
dry, is to be dug out, and a bed of brick-work, set in cement, laid
down: a floor must then be constructed in the form of an inverted
segment of an arch. On the top of the walls of this floor, plates are
to be laid, and in the inclosed area, granite blocks placed; upon
 these again, the girders are to be laid, and over these the joists,
which are to support a first layer of large flints. Upon these, suc
cessive layers of smaller flints are to be laid, each decreasing in size
 as they approach the bed of the river.        Upon the uppermost of
 these, a stratum of clean shingle is to be deposited; then a bed of
 fine and very clean gravel; and lastly a bed of filtering sand, until
 it arrives within a foot of the bed of the river, which last space must
 then be filled up with clean gravel; thereby forming a filtering bed
 of eight feet in depth, the top of which will still be four feet below
 low-water mark. So that, allowing seven feet for the timbers and
 brick-work below, and eighteen feet for the rise and fall of the tide,
 the total depth at high-water will be thirty-seven feet.
    The paper is accompanied by a lithographic drawing, which ex
 hibits the several parts of the scheme.

   The author gives the results of a series of observations on the vi
brations of the magnetic needle, which he undertook last summer,
for the purpose of ascertaining whether the intensity of          its
                                                             directive

or   by   its
         declination with respect     the plane
                                        to             of   its
                                                         equator. He
observed that the magnetic intensity   subject
                                          is       frequent variations,
                                                   to
which are sometimes sudden, and          of
                                      short duration. These anoma

lies he has been unable to refer to any obvious cause, except when
they were accompanied by the appearance of the aurora borealis,
               .
which evidently affected the needle on many occasions.        He also
thinks that the vibrations of the needle became less    rapid  with a
moist atmosphere, and more so when it was very dry. Changes of
the wind       snow storms appeared also to be attended with fluc
tuations in the intensity of the magnetism.   He endeavoured to                                    as
certain whether there existed any decided and constant difference in
the directive force of each pole; conceiving that, on the hypothesis
of a central magnetic force, the north pole of the magnet would, in
these northern latitudes, be acted upon with much greater energy
than the south pole.   From his observing that the relative intensity
of the two poles is not always the same, he infers the probability of
the earth's magnetism being derived from the agency of electric
currents existing under      surface        its
                                         well    above    and that the
                                                              as       as            it,

    A paper was read, entitled “Description of a Mountain Baro
 meter, the column of which is divisible into two portions for safer
 and more convenient transport."          By Mr. Thomas Charles Robin
 son. Communicated         by Captain    Henry  Kater, F.R.S.
    The   object  of the contrivance described in this paper is to re
 duce the    length of the barometer, when not in use, to one-half the
 usual length; and to render the position in which it may be carried
 indifferent.    It consists of a glass tube eighteen inches long, ce
 mented into a steel cistern two inches long, and one inch internal
diameter, which is furnished with an internal screw, for receiving
a hardened steel screw and hemisphere cemented to the end of a
syphon tube.       The long leg of this tube has an internal diameter of
 only the six or eight hundredths of an inch, and it is further con
 tracted at the end to the twenty-fifth of an inch, so that no air can
pass when the mercury is descending through                               it.
                                                              The shorter leg
of  the syphon has the same bore                  as
                                           the tube.
    When the two parts are screwed together, and the whole invert
ed, the mercury descends from the cistern, fills the long leg                the              of
syphon, and ascends           tocertain height
                                   a                  the shorter leg. Any

                                 that column, which         determined solely

                        the external   atmosphere.       On gently reversing
the position        the barometer, the mercury will repass from the
                    of
                                                                          by

especially to the practical purposes of building. He recommends that
the cement should not be applied in two coats, the surfaces being
less likely to adhere when this is done, than if the whole cement is
applied at once. He succeeded in various ways, in forming cements

    The author first inquires into the annual and diurnal variations
of the barometer     and thermometer, for the determination of which
he takes the mean of the observations             each month made at the   in
Apartments        the  Royal
                           of Society,   during  the years 1827, 1828, and

    the barometer. The author, however, has attempted the inquiry,
as of
    far     as
          the limited range       the present records will allow, by clas

cording to the latter, the contrary is the case, and the extent is
      0.05 of an inch.
     astly, the author endeavours to ascertain how far the barometer
is affected by the direction of the wind, and gives in the form of
tables the mean results of observations bearing upon this point.
The fluctuation, he observes, due to this, is much greater than that
due to any other cause. The barometer is lowest, as might be
expected, when the wind is in the rainy quarters of S.W. and
W.S.W. There are not yet sufficient data for any general conclu
sions with regard to the influence of electrical phaenomena on the
weather.

   A  paper was read, “On the Errors in the Course of Wessels oc
casioned by local attraction, with some remarks on the recent
loss of His Majesty's ship Thetis.” By Peter Barlow, Esq. F.R.S.,
&c.
  The author observes that the errors arising from the deviation of
the compass produced by the attraction of ships, were formerly
much less considerable than at present, from the comparatively
small quantity of iron existing in the vessel. The increase of this
disturbing force in a modern ship of war is easily accounted for by
the immense proportion of iron now employed in        its
                                                       construction,

                                         44
by the use of iron ballast and iron tanks, of iron knees, iron cables,
and above all, of iron capstans, besides various other articles made
 of the same material, forming altogether a very large and powerful
magnetic mass.
    The direction and intensity of the deflecting forces thus produced,
vary in different latitudes and on different sides of the equator;
being greatest in the highest latitudes, where the dip is consider
able, and when the ship's course is east or west: and in high south
ern latitudes, being the reverse of what it is in high northern luti
tudes. In His Majesty's ship Gloucester, which may be taken as an
example, the deviation of the compass in the east and west points
was found to be, in the British Channel, 9° 30' : so that after run
ning ten miles, the vessel would be more than a mile and a half to
the southward of her reckoning, and so on in proportion as the                           di
stances increased.     An error of this magnitude, occurring in a nar
row channel and in a dark night, were it unknown or disregarded,
might lead to the most fatal consequences; and the disaster might
 perhaps be erroneously ascribed to the prevalence of a powerful
current, the existence of which was before unknown.
    The Thetis sailed from Rio Janeiro, in December last, with a
million of dollars on board, in the finest weather, directing her
course to the S.E. The next day, thinking they were clear of land,
 they tacked, and were sailing at the rate of nine knots, when the
 first intimation they had of being near land, was the striking of the
jib-boom against a high perpendicular cliff, which broke the bow
sprit short off, and sent     all
                               three masts over the side thus           mo
                                                                        ;        in
                                                                                  a
ment bringing utter destruction          on
                                         this fine vessel and her valuable
cargo. The author shows that the deviation             the compass arising
from the attraction     of the vessel, was exactly         of of
                                                        the kind which was
likely to   occasion this  great  mistake       the
                                                 in ship's  reckoning    for
the distance run       by the Thetis   being   about  eighty   miles,    the      if :
local attraction  of  the vessel had been equal          thatto   the Glou  of
 cester, she would have passed five miles nearer           Cape Frio than
                                                                   to
 her reckoning,    an  error quite sufficient      account for the fetal ca

 more attention than has hitherto been      given          to
                                                      the influence      the      of

   A   paper was read, “On the Anatomy and Physiology of the                                Mi
nute and Capillary Vessels.”         By Marshall Hall, M.D.
    The author, considering the minute blood-vessels as arteries or
veins, as long as their subdivisions or junctions are attended with a
change in their dimensions, denominates them capillaries when no
such change occurs. With the aid of an achromatic microscope of
Dollond's, he endeavoured to ascertain what differences existed be.
tween the systemic and pulmonary circulations, as far as regards
these vessels.      Dr. Edwards had observed that the batrachian rep
tiles are speedily killed by immersion in hot water : and the author
found that although by plunging any of the animals of that order
into water at 120° of Fahrenheit they are speedily deprived of all
power of sensation and of motion, yet the action of the heart con
tinues for a very long time, thus affording an opportunity of leisurely
observing the phenomena of the circulation, without the infliction
of pain, and without any disturbance from the struggles of the
animal.
    In the fins and tail of the stickleback, the number of the capillary
vessels is small, and their distribution simple: the artery runs along
the border of each ray till it reaches the extremity, when it is re
flected, and becoming a vein, pursues a retrograde course by the
side of the artery. This simplicity in the mode of                         its
                                                                 distribution

 But in the pulmonary organs, where the purpose to be answered is
 that of diffusing the blood over the greatest possible extent of sur
 face, the arteries and the veins correspond to each other in    their                           all
 ramifications, and their adjacent branches generally pursue courses
 parallel   toeach other. Their transition into capillaries            effected             is
 with fewer subdivisions than        the case of other arteries.

  A   paper was read, “On the effect of Water, raised to Tempera
tures moderately higher than that of the Atmosphere, upon Batra
chian Reptiles.”    By Marshall Hall, M.D., &c.
   Dr. Edwards had found, by a series of experiments, that the batra
chian reptiles, when immersed in hot water, live for a shorter time
in proportion as the temperature of the water is higher; and that
at 108° of Fahrenheit they die almost instantaneously. The author
of the present paper observes, that the extinction of life in these cases
is owing to a cause of a more immediately destructive agency than
the mere suspension of respiration: he finds that if only the head of
the animal is placed under water of 120°, the animal struggles, but
soon ceases to move; but if the spine as well as the limbs be immersed,
convulsions supervene, and the muscles become rigid : in both cases
the action of the heart continues. If one of the limbs, which after
the extinction of sensibility still remains flexible, be separated from
                                              muscles contract and be
                                           in its
the body, and placed in water of 120°,
come rigid; this effect taking place first     the superficial, and next

 in the deep seated muscles.     When the nerve, separated from the
 other parts, was alone placed in hot water, the muscles were not                                            af
 fected: and when the muscles had been made to contract by hot water,
 they were no longer capable of being affected by irritations applied
 to the nerve.   The heart removed from the body, and placed in hot
 water, gradually contracted and remained rigid. Hence the author con
 cludes that the death of the animal, when occasioned by the sudden
 application of heat to the surface, is not owing to asphyxia, but to
 a positive agency, destroying the functions of the nervous and mus
 cular systems; the muscles of involuntary motion being affected in
 like manner with those of voluntary motion.

the vibration, and which therefore may admit of the settlement there
of light powders, while heavier powders can be stationary only at
the points of absolute rest.
   This explanation not appearing to the author to be satisfactory,
he made a great number of experiments, which are detailed at length
in the present paper, showing that the immediate cause of these
motions exists in the surrounding medium, and is to be found in
the currents arising from the mechanical action of the plate, while
vibrating upon that portion of the medium which is in contact with
the plate. These currents are directed from the quiescent lines
towards those parts where the oscillation is the greatest, and meet
ing from opposite sides at these central points, thence proceed per
pendicularly from the vibrating surface to a certain distance; and
finally, receding from each other, return again in a direction to
wards the nodal lines.          The combination of these motions consti
tutes vortices carrying with them any light particles which may                                                      lie

then be collected, like the heavy powders in air, at the nodal lines.
In a denser medium, such as water, the reverse should happen; the
heavy powders should be carried along by the more powerful cur
rents then produced, and would accumulate in the vibrating parts.

nomy.”      By         J.
                   W. Lubbock, Esq. V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal
Society.
    The first part of this paper relates to the theory of the moon.
The method of solution pursued by Clairaut consisted in the inte
gration of differential equations, in which the true longitude of the
 moon is the independent variable: the time is then obtained in
 terms of the true longitude; and by the reversion of series, the lon
gitude afterwards obtained in terms of the time.            This method
 is the one adopted by Mayer, Laplace, and Damoiseau. The au
thor has been led, by reflecting on the difficulties of this problem,
to believe that the integration of the differential equations in which
 the time is the independent variable would be at least as easy as
the former process; and it would possess the advantage ofemploying
the same system of equations for the moon as for the planets. The
lunar theory proposed by the author, and developed in this paper,
is an extension of the equations given in his former Researches in
JPhysical Astronomy, already published in the Philosophical Trans
actions; by including those terms, which, in consequence of the
great eccentricity of the moon’s orbit, are sensible; and by sup
pressing those which are insensible from the great distance of the
sun, the disturbing body. He has not yet attempted to obtain nu
merical results, but proposes at some future time to engage in their
computation.
    In the second part of the paper, he investigates the precession of
the equinoxes, on the supposition that the earth revolves in a re
sisting medium ; an investigation which may also be considered as
a sequel to the author's last paper on Physical Astronomy.           The
effects of the resistance of such a medium is to increase the latitude
of the axis of rotation (reckoned from the equator of the figure)
till it reaches 90°. Such is now the condition of the axis of the
earth; but as the chances are infinitely great against this having
been    itsoriginal position, may not      attainment      its
                                                         this position                  of                   be

 This plate carries the divisions, which are fine dots upon gold discs
let into the brass; the scale is divided into inches, and there is one
inch to the left of zero, which is subdivided into tenths. The scale
is the work of Mr. Dollond.      The paper is concluded by an account
of the precautions which were taken to ensure the accuracy of the
plane surface on which the bar rested, while the comparisons were
made with the microscopic apparatus described in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1821. The results are given in a table.
   A paper was read, entitled, “An Experimental Examination of
the Blood found in the Vena Portae.”         By James Thackeray, M.D.
Communicated by Sir Astley Cooper, Bart. W.P.R.S.
   The author, in the course of an inquiry into the properties of the
blood, was led to notice some peculiarities in the contents of the
vena portae, and to investigate this subject more minutely. The
results of the experiments which he made for this purpose are
chiefly the following.     The blood contained in the vena portae is
darker than that of the other veins, inclining more to a ruddy hue
than to the Modena red.         Being less homogeneous, it has the ap
pearance of being less perfectly elaborated. Its specific gravity was
found to be very variable, but it is in general less than ordinary
venous blood. It coagulates much more quickly, and contains a
larger proportion of serum, but a much smaller proportion of al
bumen, than blood taken from other veins. The serum obtained
from it is redder than common serum, in consequence of               retain          a its

forty feet from north          south, and varying from eight

                        sheep, birds, cuttle-fish, and foxes, were disco
vered.    Some fine stalactites depended from the roof, and partial
spots  of stalagmite appeared            on
                                      the floor.             In

   The author considers that there exist evidences                 the operation  of
of  water     three distinct periods
              at                                   of

the bones of the hyaena, and the other gnawed bones firmly im
bedded in the diluvial detritus: the second, when sand was depo
sited by the sea in the second fissure, that washed in through the
vertical chimney, and that inundated the whole valley up to Glas
tonbury: the third irruption of the sea occurring within these                                               fif
teen hundred years, and choking up the adit from the level by which
the sheep and foxes had entered, floating in the bones of the cuttle
fish, and depositing the thin crust of mud which covered the sand.
The coins and pottery he supposes to have been introduced through
this entrance from the level.
  The author next gives an account of the Hutton caverns, situated
on the northern escarpment of the range, commonly called Bleadon
Hill. This cavern had been discovered some time ago and noticed
by Mr. Catcott in his “Treatise on the Deluge:” but afterwards it
became inaccessible by the falling in of the roof and sides.  The
 author, led by some indications of pieces of ancient bones in the
 rubbish of some old pits, sought for this cavern by sinking a shaft,
 and succeeded in opening into            The chambers

 abounding      chasms and fissures, and containing
                 in                                             great number             a

                                           of                     the elephant,          to

and ox. Of the bear there are           least two   species;
                                                     at          one      which                    of

been   an animal     immense size and strength. These remains were,
                        of

Hence the author infers that these bones, after accumulating for
                                   by
ages, were carried           intumultuous rush

together before their final deposition. He concludes that the se

similar in appearance to the caves already described, no ante
diluvian remains of animals have been found. Several human
skeletons, and flint knives and celts, were discovered there by Mr.
Williams; from which it has been inferred that it had formerly been
used as a burying-ground. In the upper caverns, remains of the bear,
elk and polecat, were discovered; the two former evidently of the
extinct species.

   The author extends, in the present paper, the equations he has
already given for determining the planetary inequalities, as far as the
terms depending on the squares and products of the eccentricities, to
                                     F

                                                      60
the terms depending on the cubes of the eccentricities and quantities
of that order, which he does by means of a table, similar to the one
given in his lunar theory; and applies them particularly to the deter
mination of the great inequality of Jupiter, or at least such part of it
as depends on the first power of the disturbing force. That part which
depends on the square of the disturbing force may, he thinks, be most
easily calculated by the methods given in his lunar theory.     He                                                 re
commends it as particularly convenient to designate the arguments
of the planetary disturbances by indices. The bulk of the paper is
occupied by the tables, and by examples demonstrating their use.

By James Ivory, A.M., F.R.S., &c.
    Fagnani discovered that the two arcs of the periphery of a given
ellipse may be determined in many ways, so that their difference shall
be equal to an assignable straight line; and proved that any arc of
a lemniscate, like that of a circle, may be multiplified any number
of times, or may be subdivided into any number of equal parts, by
finite algebraic equations.      What he had accomplished with respect
to the arcs of the lemniscates, which are expressed by a particular
elliptic integral, Euler extended to                       all
                                                                                      be of

 Phenomena of Endosmose and Exosmose.” By William Ritchie, Esq.,

    M. Porret had, in the year 1816, announced the discovery, that if
 a vessel containing water be divided into two compartments by a dia
 phragm of bladder, and placed in the voltaic circuit, the water would

    The author considers the action of the animal membrane                   be the
 consequence       of   its
                       strong attraction for water,          attraction      whichan                       to to
it  owes  its  hygrometric properties; while,              the other hand, the
                                                                             on
membrane has no attraction for alcohol, which has itself powerful                                     a
attraction for water. Thewater, therefore, findsits way easily through                                    by
the membrane, and uniting with the alcohol,                carried           isand                  off   it,
diffused through the liquid, making room for the other portions that
successively come over. Whalebone and quills have similar hygro
metric properties, and may                    be
                                        substituted for membranes with the

     A paper   was read, “On the Tides in the Port of London.”      By
 J. W.   Lubbock, Esq., V.P. and Treas. R.S.
    This paper contains a discussion of observations of the tides
 made at the London Docks, and registered in various Tables, showing

                                  63
the time and height of high water, not only at different periods of
the moon's age, but also for the different months of the year, for
every minute of the moon's parallax, and for every three degrees of
her declination. The tables themselves were registered by Mr.
Dessiou of the Admiralty: but the arrangement of the tables and
the methods employed are due to the author. The tides in the river
Thames are extremely regular; and as the rise is considerable, the
observations on them are easily made. Those at the London Docks
present an uninterrupted series from the opening of the Docks in
 1804 to the present time: which is more extensive than any extant,
with the exception only of that made at Brest by order of the French
Government.      Some observations are also given of the tides made
during one year at the East India Docks, under the superintendence
of Captain Eastfield, and which were undertaken at the suggestion
of the author, and made with extreme care.
   The author gives an account of the mode by which the several
tables were constructed; and enters at length into the various ma
thematical considerations which the subject involves.
   The author was enabled, by the kindness of the Chairman and
Directors of the London Dock Company, to present to the Society
the books containing the complete series of original observations on
the tides referred to in this paper.
    A paper was read, “On the Friction of Fluids.” By George
Rennie, Esq., W.P.R.S.
   The object of the author in this paper is to trace the relation sub
sisting between the different quantities of water discharged by
orifices and tubes, and the retardations arising from the friction of
the fluid. The results of the experiments hitherto made with a
view of ascertaining the effects of the friction attending the mutual
motion of solids and fluids, are exceedingly discordant, and there
fore undeserving of confidence. Whether, for example, the retarda
tion from friction be proportional to the surfaces, or to the velo
cities, are points by no means satisfactorily determined.
   The experiments of the author were designed to measure the re
tardations experienced by solids moving in fluids at rest; and of
fluids moving over solids. For this purpose, he employed a cylinder
of wood, about eleven inches in diameter and two feet in length,
traversed by an iron axle, upon the upper part of which a small
pulley was fixed. A fine flexible silken cord was wound round the
pulley, at one end, and had a weight attached to the other end. A
frame was provided, allowing the apparatus to slide up and down;
and the cylinder to be immersed at various depths into the river
Thames. When the velocities were small, the retardation was found
to be nearly as the surface: but with great velocities it appears to
have but little relation to the extent of the surface immersed.    The
resistances of iron discs and wooden    globes  revolving in water were
found to be as the squares of the velocities.
   From the experiments made on the quantities of water discharged
by orifices of different shapes and sizes from vessels kept constantly

                                                           G4.
full, the author concludes, that they are in the ratio of the areas of
the orifices, independently of their shape; and nearly as the square
roots of the heights.  In pipes bent at various angles the retarda
tion occasioned               by the flexure was not in proportion to their                                           num

     A paper was read, “On the Sources and Nature of the Powers on
which the Circulation of the Blood depends." By A. P. W. Philip,
M.D. F.R.S. L. & Ed.
   In the first part of this paper the author discusses the opinions
which ascribe the powers that maintain the circulation in the veins
to the elasticity of the heart, the resilience of the lungs, and the
dilatation of the thoracic cavity in the act of inspiration.             He shows
                                                                                                                           of ofall

        It
        has long been a subject of controversy among physiologists
 whether muscular contraction is the immediate consequence of the
 action of a stimulus on the muscular fibre, or whether it is neces.
 sarily dependent on a change taking place in the nerve distributed
 to the muscle, and excited by the stimulus. This question, the
 author observes, is one which, from              very nature,             its
                                                                    incapable                          is                   of

  A paper was read, entitled, “Experiments on the Length of the
Seconds' Pendulum; made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich."
By Captain Edward Sabine, of the Royal Regiment of Artillery,
F. R. S.
   The experiments described in this paper were made with the
original convertible pendulum constructed by Capt. Kater, and em
ployed by the author in Portland Place, in the year 1817; except that
the tail pieces were removed, and the moveable weight dispensed
with: and they were made on the vacuum apparatus established in
the south-west angle of the Pendulum-room, the place assigned for
it by the Astronomer Royal. Having had reason to suspect that the
retardation of the vibrations of the pendulum performed in circular
arcs, when the weight was above, was greater than that assigned by
the formula commonly employed, the author first investigates the
correction necessary to be applied from this cause. He next as
certains the reduction to a vacuum for the small residue of air
which the apparatus still contained, or for the small portion which
may have introduced itself by leakage.      The alteration of rate for
each degree of Fahrenheit is then determined to be 0.441, a quan
tity almost exactly the same as that which was deduced from a
former inquiry. The result of the present inquiry      that the vibra                 is,
tions  of Captain Kater's pendulum, which       57° were found            at                             to   be
86069.1, are     62°, 86066.9. At this latter temperature, the length

of  the seconds pendulum,        vacuo, would    in 39.13734 inches.             be

ternal objects by the same principle on which the mariner steers by
his compass.     Thus the two cranial eyes are analogous, in principle
and  situation,  to two magnetic compasses placed upon a ship's deck;
while the   third, or cerebral eye, corresponds to another compass
placed in the cabin below; and the mind, situated like the captain
mariner in his cabin, knows, from consulting the cerebral eye, on
what point of direction the body is steering; although the mind no
 more perceives either any external object, nor yet any image in the
cranial eye, than the mariner perceives (even in the vulgar sense
of the word perceiving) the far-off land, or haven, towards which he
is surely making his way.”

  to be itself magnetic. Hence the author was led to conceive that
 an accurate estimation of the magnetic influence transmitted through
 solid substances, might afford an excellent mode of ascertaining the
 thickness of such substances which might not be otherwise deter
 minable. In order to judge of the degree of accuracy with which
 this might be accomplished, he instituted various sets of experi
 ments; first placing the magnet in a line pointing to the centre of
 the compass, and on a level with                                     it,

    A paper was  read, “On a new Register Pyrometer for measuring
the  Expansion   of Solids.” Part II. By J. F. Daniell, Esq. F.R.S.,
Professor of   Chemistry   in King's College, London.
   In this paper, which is a sequel to that published in the Philoso
phical Transactions for 1830, the author prosecutes the series of
experiments he had commenced on the dilatation of the metals:
pursuing the comparison between the results of the experiments of
Dulong and Petit, with those given by his own instrument. He
finds a striking accordance between them in the case of copper, as
he had already done with respect to iron and platina. He gives the
result of some trials which he made with a view to obtain registers
of uniform composition, so as to preclude the necessity of deter
mining the rate of expansion in each individual instance. The re
sults of his experiments on the dilatation of the metals are given in
tables; the first showing in arcs of the scales the expansions of four
metals from 62° to 212°, and thence to 662” of Fahrenheit; and
their respective melting points: and the second, exhibiting the ex
pansion of certain alloys to the same points. The experiments on
the melting point of cast iron give a mean of 2768°, and present a
remarkable coincidence with the corrected temperature deduced
from the expansion of a platina bar, plunged into melted cast iron,
which was 2786°; thus affording a conclusive proof of the accuracy
of the pyrometer, and of                 its
                                  competency                    to

  of iron, about the sixteenth of an inch thick, effectually intercepts
 the action of a revolving magnet on a disc of copper, the same re
 sult is not obtained when the disc acted upon is also of iron, instead
 of being of copper; unless the mass of iron interposed be very con
 siderable. The screening influence he found to depend on the mass
 of iron that is interposed, and not on the surface merely. He was
 led to suspect that a similar effect might be obtained by employing
 substances not of a ferruginous nature, provided they were inter
 posed in considerable masses, and the result of his trials justified
 his conjecture.        An account is given of several experiments made
  with   large  masses of silver, copper, or zinc, of about four inches in
  thickness, which being interposed between a revolving magnetic
 plate and a delicately suspended disc of tinned iron, completely in
 tercepted the action of the magnet on the iron.
     The author considers this interceptive property to be more or
 less common to every class of substance; and that in order to render
 it sensible, it is only necessary to employ the bodies in masses, bear
 ing some direct ratio to their respective magnetic energies.                Thus
 lead, having a weaker magnetic energy than copper, must be em
 ployed in a larger mass in order to produce an equal effect; and to
 render the screening power of ice sensible would require it to be
 above thirty feet in thickness.             instead

   From these observations, and the apparently contradictory ones
of Cassini and         of
                    Roener, the author          this paper infers, that the
                                                                 of

meriting further investigation.
   He then directs attention        the fact that 37 Tauri was of
                                                to                       red                           a
colour when        contact with Mars; whilst 42 Leonis was under
                      in
similar circumstances of         blue colour: and, from inferences de
                                           a
pendent upon observation, states, that the apparent anomaly                                                 is
easily reconcilable, and that       hypothesis      an

   The following Papers wereread. The first was entitled, “Researches
in Physical Astronomy—‘On the Theory of the Moon.’” By J.W.
Lubbock, Esq. V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal Society.
   This paper is a continuation of the author's former paper on the
same subject, in which he gives the developments which are required
in the second approximation, or that in which the square of the dis
turbing force is retained.
   The author has not yet attempted to obtain numerical results, but
he considers this method of solution equally advantageous with the
j
method hitherto adopted, and that the calculation which would tend
to perfect the tables of the moon is a desideratum in physical astro
nomy.
   TÉ author has obtained numerical results in the first approxima
tion; the value of the variation agrees within a few seconds with the
result of Newton in the third volume of the Principia.
   The next paper was entitled, “On the Tides,” by the same.
   This paper contains tables of the results of observations made at
Brest, with regard to the principal inequality of the tides, or that
which is independent of the parallaxes and declinations of the moon
and sun, and depends solely on the moon's age, that         is,   on
                                                               the time
of  her passage through the plane    ofthe meridian; from which ap     it
  ears that the tables     the tides for London are not applicable
                          of                                                to
           merely changing the establishment, that   is,   by
                                                          adding con   a
stant quantity, as  has been hitherto supposed; and the same remark
applies to  any distant parts.
   The third paper was entitled, “On the Structure         of
                                                           the Human
Placenta and  its connection with the Uterus.” By Robert Lee, M.D.
F.R.S. Physician     tothe British Lying-in Hospital.
  In  the year 1780 Mr. John Hunterpresented       paper

 uterus, after both the veins and arteries had been injected, and a lon

where the placenta adhered to          internal surface,

                                                                     on
proceeding obliquely between           and the uterus, pass through

decidua without ramifying; and that just before entering the placenta,
after making two           three spiral turns, they open
                               or                                once into                      at                         its
spongy substance.       The corresponding veins           represents     com         he                       as
mencing from the spongy substance           the placenta        wide mouths,

 and after passing obliquely through the decidua, entering the sub
stance     the uterus and immediately communicating with the proper
       of of
veins     that organ.      Dr. William Hunter's description          the same                         of
vessels accords with that                    of
                                  his brother.   He regards the placenta
 as consisting    two distinct parts, namely,
                    of                             umbilical portion whichan
belongs   to  the  foetus, and     uterine portion,
                                                a     which belongs        the                                      to
mother, each having          peculiar system
                                   its             arteries and veins; andof
 he  supposes that while,      the foetal portion, the arteries and veins
                                         in
                                                  vessels communicate,
                                                                      of of
form continuous canals, these two sets
the uterine portion,               by
                            the intervention      cells, into which the                                                  ar in
teries terminate, and from which the veins begin.
    The subject was afterwards investigated          Noortwych, Roederer,     by
and   Haller,  but without any satisfactory result; and the doctrines
laid down      by
                the Hunters were generally acquiesced                  subse                         in   by
quent anatomists.
    The author      the present paper having had opportunities
                     of                                                exa                                     of
mining six gravid uteri, and many placenta expelled                natural                            in
labour, finds reason       conclude that no cellular structure, such

that described           by
                      Dr. Hunter, exists       the human placenta, and
                                                                     in
that there     is   no
                    connection between this organ and the uterus                                                          by
great arteries and veins. He thinks himself warranted          concluding                        in
that the placenta does not consist        two portions, maternal and foe
                                                           of

  The computations of the quantities themselves being effected by
means  of algebraical equations of great complexity, and of numerical
calculations of considerable length, which afford in themselves no
ready means of verifying their accuracy, the author has been under
the necessity of examining closely every line of figures before he pro
ceeded     to another.Upon the whole he is certain that there is no
error of importance in the numbers he obtained; and that the only
probable source of error is the inevitable rejection of figures beyond
a certain place      of decimals.
    In concluding this investigation, the most laborious, probably, that
has yet been made in the planetary theory, he remarks that the term
in question is a striking instance of the importance to which terms,
apparently the most insignificant, may sometimes rise. As an illus
tration of the magnitude of the errors which might under other cir
cumstances have arisen from the neglect of this term, he further ob
serves, that if the perihelion of Venus and the earth had opposite lon
gitudes, and if the line of nodes coincided with the major axis, the
eccentricities and inclination having the same values as at present,
the coefficient of the inequality in the epoch would be 8".9, and                                all
the other terms would        important.

eccentricities and inclination would double       treble these inequa

thus enlarging upon topics, which, though personal in some respect

to the establishment             of the true                          of surgical or medical
practice in those cases which require that minute criticism of the
symptoms of disease, upon the proper knowledge and study of which
the perfection of medical art must mainly depend. As a lecturer he
was not less distinguished      than as an author; and he appears to
have  possessed   the art of fixing  strongly the attention of his hearers,
not less by  the just authority   of his opinions, than by his ready com
mand of apt and forcible illustrations.         He enjoyed during many
years of his life a more than ordinary share of public favour in the
practice of his profession; and though not a little remarkable for
the eccentricities of his manners and an affected roughness in his
intercourse with his ordinary patients, he was generally kind and
courteous in those cases which required the full exercise of his skill
and knowledge, and also liberal in the extreme when the infliction
of poverty and privation was superadded to those of disease.

  all
    circumstances,        justly celebrated for activity and enterprise,

       The Reverend Fearon Fallows was distinguished cotemporary
                                                             a
of      Sir John Herschel   Cambridge, and throughout his life an
                                     at
ardent cultivator          of
                            astronomical science.                 In   the year 1821         he   was

                                                        83
appointed Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope, to which
place he immediately proceeded, though provided only with a small
transit and an altitude and azimuth instrument, a clock, and a few
other absolutely necessary appendages of an observatory.        In the
course of the two following years he completed a catalogue of 273
southern stars, which was published in our Transactions for 1824.
The delays which subsequently took place in the building of the
observatory, which was not completed before 1828, and the want of
those capital instruments which were required to put it into complete
operation, although they did not interrupt or check either the in
dustry of his research or the accuracy of his observations, yet by
making them necessarily imperfect, deprived them of a very con
siderable part of their value.
   When the mural circle at last arrived, and when he at length ima
gined himself in possession of the means of effecting the great object
of his ambition, by making the catalogues of the stars of the southern
hemisphere rival, in accuracy and completeness, those of the
northern, he found new difficulties meeting him in the derangements
occasioned in so large an instrument, by embarking, disembarking,
and fixing          it,
                thus producing errors which were nearly irremediable                                                   in

of the Society, were rescinded; many which required an altera

whole was expressed was rendered more uniform, consistent and
  recise; and several new regulations were introduced, calculated,
in the opinion of the Committee, to promote the objects and the
welfare of the Society. The result of the labours of the Committee
has been the amended edition of the Statutes in the form in which
they have since been printed, after having been adopted by the
Council, according to the forms prescribed in the Charter, and in
the former Statutes of the Society. The principal alterations that
have been made in the Statutes are the following:
   1. The number of Fellows whose signatures are required as pro
posing and recommending a candidate for election into the Society
is now extended to six instead of three.
   2. The times of election are now limited to the first ordinary
meetings of the Society in December, February, April and June.
   3. Such persons as shall in future be elected Fellows will be al
lowed to pay annual contributions of four pounds, as long as they
shall continue to be Fellows of the Society; but no bonds, as here
tofore, shall be required for enforcing these payments.
   4. Lists of persons whom the Council recommend to the Society
for election as Council and Officers for the ensuing year are to be
prepared previous to the anniversary meeting.
   5. The process of balloting for the Council and Officers at the
anniversary meeting has been simplified by the employment of a
single balloting list for that purpose.
   6. An abstract of the Society's accompts in each year is to be
prepared by the Treasurer, and printed for the use of the Fellows.
   7. The duties of the Assistant Secretary and of the Librarian
are now united in one person, and the office of Housekeeper is
abolished.
   8. Provision has been made for calling special general meetings
of the Society whenever they may appear to be necessary.
   9. A great extension has been given to the time during which
the Library shall be accessible to the Fellows.    It is now ordered
to be  open  every  day,  Sundays   excepted, from eleven o'clock in
the morning till four in the afternoon, excepting on Good Friday,
and during Easter, Whitsun and Christmas weeks.
   10. Provision has been made for an annual inspection of the
Library at a stated period.
   The new Statutes are now printed for the use of the Fellows, and
may be had on application to the Assistant Secretary.
   Since these Statutes have been framed, the Council have besides
adopted several specific regulations calculated to facilitate the bor
rowing of books out of the Library, and for ensuring their regular
return at the proper period. They have also framed regulations
respecting the loan of instruments belonging to the Society, with
a view to the accommodation of Fellows wishing to borrow them,
and consistently with their preservation in good condition.

    Pursuant to the agreement entered into with the Trustees of the
British Museum respecting the exchange of the Arundel manu
scripts for books suited to the objects of the Society, the sum
of £956 Os. 3d. was in July last received from the Trustees of the
Museum, with the condition annexed, that the money was to be
expended exclusively in the purchase of books, and that a list of
the books so purchased should be sent to the Trustees. Nearly
the whole of this sum has since been applied in the manner stipu
lated for, and the Library of the Royal Society has in consequence
been enriched by a very large addition of works on scientific sub
jects, which had long been wanting for the supply of                deficiencies             its

   The Council being desirous of obtaining authentic documents
respecting the tides, applied to the Admiralty for accounts of the
rise and fall of the sea, and the exact periods of high and low water
at the different sea-ports.      Orders have in consequence been given
to the  proper    officers of the Dock-yards at Woolwich, Sheerness,
Portsmouth, and Plymouth, to make these observations, and re
turns have already been received from those places.            The Chair
man and Directors of the London Dock Company have presented
to the Society the books containing a complete series of original
observations on the tides, referred to in a paper read to the Society
on that subject by Mr. Lubbock; for which favour the Council have
returned suitable acknowledgements.
   Considerable uncertainty having prevailed with regard to many
points relating to the powers entrusted to the Society of conferring
certain honorary rewards, and also as to the principles which should
guide them in making the several awards of those honours, the
Council appointed a Committee for considering the whole of this
subject. The Committee, in the execution of this task, have made
a diligent search for                all
                              the documents relating       these subjects,                to
including the extracts from wills and other authorities, and the re
solutions which have from time           time been madeto     the Council                      by
relating     the medals; and have directed that separate lists should

wards bestowed            the Society, specifying the respective dates

been ably and diligently seconded                           by
                                            the Assistant Secretary; and
the Council have directed that the account which Mr. Hudson has

   Inconvenience having arisen from the collection which the
Porter has hitherto been in the habit of making from the Fellows
of gratuities for the delivery of the Lists of the Society, the Council
have now ordered that from the day of the next anniversary, he
shall receive, in lieu of such gratuities, and of his former salary, a

bridge, for his papers on the construction of the Achromatic Eye
pieces of Telescopes, and on the Achromatism of Microscopes; on
the Spherical Aberration of Eye-pieces, and for his other papers on
optical subjects in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions.
   The rules for the practical construction of eye-pieces, which were
chiefly formed by the elder Dollonds, were probably deduced by re
peated trials, conducted with the usual skill and sagacity of those
great opticians, rather than by any very accurate reference to their
mathematical theory: in whatever manner, however, they were dis
covered, they have continued to be adopted by opticians with very
little alteration since that time.
    The correction of the spherical and chromatic aberration of eye
pieces is at least as important in practice as those of object-glasses;
and whilst the theory of the latter has been more than once subjected
to a complete analysis, that of the former has been almost altogether
neglected. The elaborate and complicated formulae of Euler are
altogether useless for the present constructions; and the more prac
tical investigations of Boscovich, though opening the way to more
accurate results, have failed to satisfy the required conditions. Pro
fessor Airy, by a more accurate analysis of the theory of oblique pen
cils of rays, and by connecting                     his

                        December 15, 1831.
JOHN WILLIAM'LUBBOCK,                    Esq. M.A., V.P. and Treasurer,
                               in the Chair.
   The reading of Mr. Faraday's paper, entitled “Experimental
Researches in Electricity,” was concluded.
   This paper is divided into four parts: the first being on the In
duction of Electric Currents; the second, on the Evolution of Elec
tricity from Magnetism; the third, on a new Electrical Condition
of Matter; and the fourth, on Arago's Magnetic Phaenomena.
   The author defines electrical induction to be the power which
electrical currents possess of inducing any particular state upon
matter in their immediate neighbourhood. A great length of copper
wire, 1-20th of an inch in diameter, was wound round a cylinder of
wood so as to compose two helices, the coils of which were inter
mixed, but prevented from touching each other by interposed threads
of twine and calico. One helix was connected with a voltaic battery,
and the other with a galvanometer.     No effect was perceived on the
latter, with a battery of 10 plates: a slight effect only with one of
100 plates; and a distinct deflection of the needle of the galvano
meter occurred when the contact was made with a battery of 120
plates. While the contact was preserved, the needle returned to         its
natural position, and was unaffected         by
                                          the electric current passing
through the wire connected with the battery; but        onbreaking the
connexion, the needle
                       to of
                           the galvanometer was again deflected, but
in   direction contrary
     a                      that  of   its
                                      former deflection.    Hence  itis
inferred that the electric current sent           by
                                             the battery through one
                                   H

                                                   S2
wire, induced a similar current through the other wire, but only at
the moment the contact was made; and a current in the contrary
direction when the passage of the electricity was suddenly inter
rupted. These transitory currents, resembling waves, were found to
be capable of magnetizing needles placed within the helix. Colla
teral currents, either in the same or in opposite directions, exert no
permanent inductive power on each other.
     No other evidence of the electric action of these induced currents
could be detected, such as the appearance of a spark, the ignition of
fine wires, or of charcoal, impressions on the tongue, contractions in
 the muscles of frogs, or chemical decompositions.           Yet these induced
 currents were found to be capable of passing through fluids, when
 interposed to a small extent in the circuit.
     Similar effects were apparently produced by the inductive influence
 of ordinary electricity directed through the first set of wires.
     The second part of this paper contains the account of experi
 ments in which the helix connected with the voltaic battery was
 wound round one side of an iron ring, welded from soft round bar
 iron; while another helix connected with a galvanometer was coiled
 round the opposite side of the ring. The electrical indications ob
 tained by this apparatus were much more considerable than in the
 former case, but were equally transitory, and were of opposite kinds
  on the interruption of the contacts with the battery. By interposing
  charcoal points in the circuit of the induced helix, a minute spark
  was perceived whenever the contacts were made or broken off; but
  no ignition of wires or other electric effects could be obtained.
  Electric currents were also induced in a helix into which a soft iron
  cylinder was introduced, whenever that iron was rendered magne
  tical by induction from magnets applied to               ends.            its
                                                                   The sudden
  introduction       or
                     removal            of

  der, produced similar effects         the helix.on
    In   many      these experiments the author employed the large com
                    of

   In the fourth part of the paper the author        relates a great number
of  experiments,    which concur in    proving   that when a piece of metal
is moved in    any  particular  direction,  either in front of a singlemag
netic  pole,  or between the    opposite   poles   of a horse-shoe magnet,
electrical currents are developed which pass along the substance of
the metal in a direction transverse to that of             own motion.     By

    The first intelligence of the breaking out of the volcano, which is
the subject of the present paper, was brought to Malta, on the 16th
of July last, by a merchant vessel. It was confirmed soon after by
Captain Swinburne, of H.M.S.Rapid, who had succeeded in approach
ing very near the island. The crater of the volcano, which was in
great activity, was then only a few feet above the level of the sea.
 Several shocks of an earthquake had been felt near the same spot
about a month before the eruption. The volcano continued active
 till the 16th of August, and the island it was forming gradually en
 larged in      all   its
                      dimensions; but since that period there has been                                                     no

  It    is a further consequence of this law, that the rotation of the
globe    of the earth itself must tend to induce electric currents in its
own    mass,   passing in each hemisphere from the equatorial to the
polar regions; so that if one set of conductors could be applied at
the equator, and another at the poles, negative electricity would be
collected by the former, and positive electricity by the latter. The
electricity of metalliferous veins in the mines of Cornwall (of which
an account has been given by Mr. Fox, in a paper lately published
in the Philosophical Transactions,) does not appear, however, to be
referrible to magneto-electric induction.          It may be a question
whether the phaenomena of the Aurora Borealis and Australis may
not arise from the discharge of this induced electricity consequent
on the earth's rotation.
    As it appeared probable that there exists some natural difference
in the intensity of these electric currents induced by magnetism in
different conducting bodies, the author endeavoured to determine
what effects might arise from this difference in the case of iron and
copper.       For this purpose he joined together the ends of wires of
each of these metals, each 120 feet in length, extended in the direc
tion of the magnetic meridian. The copper wire was then divided
in the middle and examined by a delicate galvanometer, but no
evidence of any electrical current was obtained. The same negative
 result attended trials with wires of these metals, twisted together,
 and passed between the poles of a powerful magnetic battery.
 Similar experiments tried with other metals, and also with a circuit
 composed of copper and sulphuric acid, afforded in like manner no
 indications of electric currents. Hence it appears that when metals
 or other conductors of different kinds are equally subjected to
 magneto-electric induction, they exhibit equal powers with respect
 to the currents induced in them.
    By another experiment the author shows that these effects of
 magneto-electric induction are not owing to the motion of the
 magnet and conductor relatively to each other, but that they take
 place to an equal degree when the two are united so as to revolve
 together, and when, consequently, they are relatively at rest.
 Electric currents are produced also in the substance of the magnet
 itself, simply by revolution on  by   own axis while floating    mercury,
                                                                    on

     A paper     was read, entitled“On the theory of the Perturbations
of the Planets."     By James Ivory, Esq. A.M. F.R.S., Instit. Reg.
Sc. Paris., & Reg. Sc. Götting., Corresp.
   The methods hitherto employed by mathematicians for deter
mining the variations which the elements of the orbit of a planet
undergo in consequence of perturbation, and for expressing these
variations analytically in the manner best adapted for computation,
are found to depend upon a theory in mechanics, of considerable in
tricacy, known by the name of the Variation of the Arbitrary Con
stants. In seeking the means for abridging the severe labour of the
calculations, we must separate the general principles on which they
are founded from the analytical processes by which they are carried
into effect; and in some important problems great advantage is ob
tained by adapting the investigation to the particular circumstance
of the case, and attending solely to the principles of the method in
deducing the solution. The author suggests the possibility of
simplifying physical astronomy by calling in the aid of only the
usual principles of Dynamics, and by setting aside every formula or
equation not absolutely necessary for arriving at the final results.
   The present paper contains a complete determination of the
variable elements of the elliptic orbit of a disturbed planet, deduced
from three differential equations, that follow readily from the
mechanical conditions of the problem. In applying these equations
the author observes, the procedure is the same whether a planet is
urged by the sole action of the constant force of the sun, or is be
sides disturbed by the attraction of other bodies revolving round
the luminary ; the only difference being that, in the first case, the
elements of the orbit are             all
                                 constant, whereas    the other case they
                                                                       in
are   allvariable. The success               of
                                      the method followed      the author              by

    The reading of the Rev. Dr. Ritchie'spaper, entitled “Experimental
Researches in Voltaic Electricity,” was concluded.
    The author adduces many facts in refutation of the theory by
which Volta endeavoured to explain the development of electricity
in galvanic circles. He shows that the contact of dissimilar metals
is not necessary for producing that effect, for galvanic action may
be obtained by employing only one metal, if the two ends of the
 same copper wire be coiled into helices of different diameters, and
 immersed into dilute nitric acid. The experiments of Mr. Parrot
 of St. Petersburgh are cited as leading to results totally different to
 those on which Volta rested the foundations of this theory. The
 author points out several important marks of distinction between
 voltaic and common electricity, and denies that the latter is capable
 of passing into the former. He shows by an experiment that the
 free electricity developed by heat is independent of that developed
 by galvanic action. Chemical decompositions are effected in a
 totally different manner by voltaic and by ordinary electricity; for
 in the former case the two elements of the decomposed substance
 are found disengaged at the opposite poles, but in the latter they
 are developed at the same point, and appear more as the effect of
  a cleavage of the molecules by the mechanical agency of electricity.
  The author conceives that in a galvanic circle of zinc and copper
  with interposed water, the superior attraction of the zinc for oxygen
  produces an arrangement of the molecules of the water such that
  the particles of oxygen entering into the composition of each are
in allturned towards the zinc. This definite arrangement produces
its      turn,     by
                  production            on
                                   the neutral electric fluid contained    the    in
  metal, a  corresponding definite arrangement                 of
                                                         the two electricities
  along the whole electric circuit.        Hence electro-magnetic effects
  may    be obtained without any chemical decomposition; this latter
  effect taking place only when the attraction                  of
                                                           the metal for one

                                                                     supposing

 of the water, will also          increase the power of the voltaic arrange

composing it; for the magnetic needle is deflected in an equal
degree by every part. He succeeded in exhibiting the rotation of a
piece of charcoal, and of a column of water, while transmitting
voltaic electricity, round the pole of a magnet.     Having noticed a
difference of temperature  in the fluid conductor in the vicinity of the
two poles, he was led to investigate the cause of this phaenomenon.
A rectangular box being divided into three compartments by two
partitions of bladder, and filled with water, and the wires from the
two poles of the battery being inserted into the extreme compart
ment, the temperature of the water surrounding the positive pole was
found to be higher than that surrounding the negative pole, and that
in the middle compartment highest of all. These differences he as
cribes to the cooling effects of the disengagements of the several
gases at each respective pole, the volume of the hydrogen being dou
ble that of the oxygen, producing twice the effect. With metallic
solutions, the reverse takes place, the effect depending in every case
upon the relative specific heat of the substances disengaged at the
two poles.

  A paper was read, entitled, “Some remarks on an Error respect
ing the Site and Origin of Graham's Island.” By Capt.W. H. Smyth,
R.N. K.F.M. F.R.S.
   The author rectifies an erroneous assertion, originating from the
report of Captain Larmour, who in the year 1800, when command
ing the Wassanaer, a troop-ship on the Egyptian expedition, thought
he observed a shoal of four fathoms water with breakers, within a
mile of the latitude and longitude of the new volcanic island.         The
author has determined, by his own observations, that no such reef
exists in that spot, nor is the assigned place of this shoal near that
of Graham's Island, which arose considerably to the eastward, from a
depth of above a hundred fathoms below the surface of the water. A
knoll, with only seven fathoms of water upon            it,
                                                       was discovered not

Sicily nearly   to Pentellaria, where the water deepens'           at

  which are of course substantially identical, but which do not appear

 affords a confirmationof the exactness of those expressions.

      The reading of Sir Charles Bell's paper “On the Organs of the
  Human Voice" was resumed and concluded.
      The author complains that the actions of the organs of the voice
  have been negligently treated by physiologists, and that many of
  the offices of the structures subservient to that function have been
  overlooked; and expects that the study of them will lay a founda
  tion for prosecuting the intricate anatomy of the nerves of the
  neck, which he proposes to himself as an ulterior object. The
 subjects to which he particularly directs his attention in the present
  paper, are the Muscularity of the Trachea, the Position of the
 Thyroid Gland, and the Action of the Pharynx, which he alleges to
 have been entirely omitted in previous systematic             accounts of
 articulate language.
     The trachea is strengthened by imperfect circles of cartilage,
 the ends of which are united at the back part of the tube by a
 transverse layer of muscular fibres, -a structure which is very dis
 tinctly seen in the horse.     This transverse muscle is an antagonist
 to the elasticity of the cartilages, and the effect of         its
                                                             action during

     foreign bodies which may have accidentally got into the trachea.

     The author considers the thyroid gland    as serving the purpose
of interrupting the vibrations of the   cartilages of the trachea, to
which it is closely attached, especially when pressed against it by
the actions of the flat muscles which extend over it. If sound
were given out by the vibrations of the trachea, it would interfere
with the distinctness of the voice. The thyroid gland                          therefore,             is,

  The reading of Dr. Marshall Hall's paper, entitled, “On the In
verse Ratio which subsists between Respiration and Irritability in the
Animal Kingdom; and on Hybernation,” was concluded.
   The object of the author, in the investigation which he has un
dertaken, and of which some of the results are given in the present
paper, is to establish a law of the animal economy, which he ex
presses in the following terms: “The quantity of the respiration is
inversely as the degree of the irritability.” Other authors, such as
Cuvier, attaching a different meaning to the term irritability, have
stated this property, in the different classes of animals, as being                                                    di
rectly proportional to the energy of the respiratory functions; the
purposes of which they have considered to be those of restoring to
the exhausted muscular fibre                   its
                                          contractile power. The author                                                 of
the   present  paper    regards   animal life       consisting       as
                                                                     two essential               in
ingredients; namely, stimulus and irritability; atmospheric air being
the principal source         the former; the heart, where

                                                                     exists, being               it
the   principal   organ      the  latter;   and the blood     being   the medium
by which these are brought into contact.
    For the purpose         ascertaining the quantity
                             of                                 respiration     any of                            in

    From the facts detailed               by
                                       Harvey, Goodwyn and others, which
 establish that     inasphyxia the left ventricle           the heart ceases    of                                      to
 contract before the right ventricle, the author infers that the irrita
bility  of  the latter   isgreater than that        the former        of
                                                                     and proposes            ;
to   distinguish the first           as
                                  arterio-contractile, and the latter         veno                           as

                                               106
 contractile, from the circumstance of their being stimulated respec
 tively by arterial and by venous blood. He considers the power of
 bearing suspended respiration as a measure of irritability, which may
 be expressed by the length of time during which an animal can sup
 port the suspension of this function. He then shows that, conform
 ably to these definitions, the foetus before birth, the reptile, and the
 molluscous animal possess a much higher degree of irritability than
 the adult, or than animals belonging to the class of mammalia and
  birds; in which the quantity of respiration being very great, the
  irritability is proportionally small.
      He then proceeds to consider the phaenomena of hybernation ;
  and shows that they are very similar to those of the ordinary sleep
  of the same animals, but differ from those of the sleep of animals
  which do not hybernate. In the former case the respiration is
  nearly, if not wholly, suspended, and the temperature greatly re
  duced; but the circulation continues unimpaired.                 He notices dif
  ferences also in the habits of different       hybernating    animals,   some of
  which frequently awake from their slumber during the winter, while
 with others the lethargy is uninterrupted. The state of hybernation
 should, he thinks, be carefully distinguished from the torpor induced
 by excessive cold; the former being a conservative, the latter a
 destructive process.        The exclusion of atmospheric air, which is
 speedily fatal to the animal in          its
                                          active state,      sustained with per
                                                                        is
 fect   impunity   during  hybernation,    the  respiration   being then entirely
 suspended.       The animal      being         at
                                             such times reduced               state        to   a
 analogous                  the reptile, but
                               of                      still higher degree, the
                 is to
                   that                                   in   a
 irritability      much increased: the heart continues               beat without  is to
 the stimulus            of
                     aerated blood, and the circulation             kept      with              up
 perfect regularity. This latter fact was ascertained                  actual ob by

     Animals, during hybernation, are easily roused from their le
 thargy, and restored         sensibility and activity; and the muscles

                               hunger, and the food then taken conduces
to    renewed    lethargy.    But frequent excitation from this state                                is
productive           of

   A   Paper was read, entitled “Further Notice of the new Volcano
in the Mediterranean.” By John Davy, M.D. F.R.S. Assistant                                      In
spector of Army Hospitals.
   The author states that since the 25th of October, the date of his
last communication to the Society, the crater of the volcano has un
dergone several changes of form, and has now entirely disappeared.
He infers from the phaenomena observed, that the crater was one of
eruption, composed entirely of loose materials, thrown up by volcanic
action, and not one of elevation, that               is,
                                                formed                 of

     GEORGE RENNIE, Esq. Vice                  President,   in the Chair.
  The following Report, drawn up by the Rev. William Whewell,
M.A. F.R.S.,     and John William Lubbock, Esq. M.A. V.P. and
Treasurer  R.S.,  on Professor Airy's Paper, read before the Royal
Society on November 24, 1831, and entitled, “On an Inequality of
Long Period in the Motions of the Earth and Venus,” was read.
                                    Report.
    The object of this memoir is similar to that of Laplace's celebrated
investigation of the great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, announced
 in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1784, and given in
the volume for the succeeding year. The occasion of that investi
gation was an acceleration of the mean motion of Jupiter and a re
tardation of that of Saturn,--which inequalities in the motions of the
two planets Halley had discovered by a comparison of ancient and
modern observations: and Laplace showed, in the Memoirs just re
ferred to, that inequalities like those thus noticed would arise from
the action of gravitation; that they would reach a considerable
amount in consequence of twice the mean motion of Jupiter being
very nearly equal to five times the mean motion of Saturn; and that
 their period would be nearly 900 years.        The occasion of the                   in
vestigation of Professor Airy was an inequality in the sun's actual
motion, as compared with Delambre's Solar Tables, which appeared
to result from a comparison of late observations with those of the
last century, as Professor Airy has explained in a memoir published
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1828. This comparison having
convinced him of the necessity of seeking for some inequality of long
 period in the earth's motion, it was soon perceived that such an                     in
 equality would arise from the circumstance that 8 times the mean
motion of Venus is very nearly equal to 13 times the mean motion
of the earth. The difference is 1,675 centesimal degrees in a year,
—from which it follows, that if any such inequality exist,          period  its
 will be about 240    years.
    To determine whether such        aninequality arising from the action
of  gravitation, amounts  to   anappreciable magnitude,        problem                of
                                                                 in of is
                                                                        a
great complexity and great labour. The coefficient           the term will
be   of the order  13   minus  8,   or  when expressed
                                         5,                  terms of the
excentricities of the orbits of the Earth and Venus, and their mutual
inclination; all which quantities are small; and the result would
therefore, on   this account,  be very minute. But        the integrations
                                                            in
by   which the  inequalityis   found,  the small fraction expressing the
difference of
             by
               the mean motions      ofthe planets enters twice              as   a   di
                                                                                      of Inof

the process, the term receives      multiplier

Jupiter and Saturn, it was only necessary to take terms of the 3rd
order of smallness, and the multiplier by which the terms are aug
mented has 30° instead of 240° for its factor.
    In the present state of physical astronomy methods exist by which
the results of the law of universal gravitation in the planetary system
may be obtained to any degree of accuracy, by calculating in suc
cession the terms of successive orders of minuteness, the order being
estimated according to the powers and products of the excentricities
of the orbits. But it is well known, that in the actual application of
these methods, the number of the terms arising from the combination
of the several series which occur, and the complexity of the operations
by which the coefficients of these terms are to be deduced, increase
so rapidly in passing beyond the lower orders of inequalities, that
the calculation is difficult and laborious.
    The numerical calculation of a perturbation depending on the 5th
powers of the excentricities has not been executed, so far as we are
aware, except in the case of the great inequality of Jupiter and Sa
turn, where, as Laplace states (Mécanique Céleste, p.          liv. 6.9°), this             ii.
labour, “pénible par son excessive longueur,” has been performed by
Burckhardt with         scrupulous attention.     And       calculation                no                       of   a

of the   great   inequality by Laplace      1784.             in
    One   of the main  parts     the labour  of                     of
                                                such calculations consists
in   obtaining the successive terms                       of

metrical functions of a and a'; and the different quantities C are
of course connected by equations of condition similar to the others.
   The general development of R, given in the third volume of the
Mécanique Céleste, extends only to the terms depending on the
squares of the excentricities. Burckhardt carried the development
much further in the Mémoires de l'Institut for 1808; but Professor
Airy's formulae are not immediately comparable with his, on account
of the employment of C instead of b. The formulae of Burckhardt
include however only 6 out of 12 of Professor Airy's coefficients, in
consequence of the omission of terms depending on the inclination,
by the former mathematician.
   In the expansion of R, the terms which proceed according to the
powers of the excentricities and of the sine of half the inclination
 e, e, f), involve cosines of the multiples of W, T, and                                                                P-T,

order to which it is carried. In Professor Airy's investigation there
are, to each angular factor, twelve terms arising from the combina
tions of e, e,      f;                                      J
                 in that of the inequality of upiter to the 3rd order,
there are four such terms.
   The number of the coefficients C, of the series for R, which it is
requisite to calculate, depends both upon the number of effective
combinations of arcs and the number of effective combinations
of   e,   e,   f.
                Hence the number of such coefficients, and their
differentials, which Professor Airy's calculation demands, is very
considerable. In the calculation for Jupiter, Laplace uses 6 co.
efficients b, and 14 of their differentials, in which however 28 dif
ferentials are virtually obtained. Professor Airy has occasion to use
70 values of C, the corresponding quantity in his process, and 98 of
its differential coefficients; these quantities being calculated to a
number of places from 7 downwards.
    The calculation of the inequalities of the motions of Venus and
the Earth, from the numbers thus obtained, requires the combination
of these numbers with others depending on the excentricities, incli
nation, perihelia, and nodes of the orbits; and contains, as has al
ready been said, 12 compound terms in the present investigation,
and 4 in that of Laplace.
    The greatest amount of the inequality thus explained by Laplace,
was 20' for Jupiter and 47' for Saturn. The effect of the inequality
examined in the memoir before us, would give an error in the geo
centric longitude of Venus of between 20" and 30", if the mean mo
tions of the Earth and Venus were determined, by comparing the
observations about Bradley's time with the observations of a few
years ago; and if the result were applied to calculate the next
transit of Venus (in 1874).
    The method adopted by Professor Airy in this investigation offers
some peculiarities. There are two principal methods which may be
employed in such problems: one is the method of direct solution,
according to which the equations on which the inequalities depend
are solved directly, and the values obtained by the first approximate
solutions are substituted in the terms before neglected, in order
 to obtain a new solution. The other method is that of the variation
of parameters (developed by Lagrange), according to which the
planet, at any moment of time, is conceived to be moving in an el
lipse, and the alterations are investigated which the elements of this
ellipse must continually undergo, in order that the real motion may
result. The former of these methods is the one which has generally
been employed in calculating             all

in Lagrange's method, implicitly includes the differential of R with
regard to the mean motion. But it                                     has been shown by Lagrange
himself, and since him by others, that                                we may finally omit the term
depending on the variation of n, if we                                use <U+017F>nd t throughout instead
of n t- This reduction Professor Airy                                 does not adopt, retaining ex
plicitly the term
                              #.
   This difference in the formulae is equivalent to a change in the
meaning of the term epoch. In determining the longitude of the
epoch of the instantaneous ellipse, Laplace, and others who have
followed Lagrange, fix it by supposing this longitude to be the angle
which we must add to the angle described by the variable elliptical
mean motion since the origin of the time, in order to have the mean
anomaly in the ellipse. Professor Airy assumes the longitude of the
epoch to be that angle, which we must add to the angle described
by the instantaneous elliptical mean motion, considered constant
since the origin of the time, in order to have the mean anomaly: the

while it is revolving from the eastern extremity round the unmarked
pole to the nestern extremity of the axis minor, the current of elec
tricity will be from the upper to the lower end of the wire; and
whatever position the plane in which the wire revolves may take by
revolving about the axis of the magnet, or whatever may be the po
sition of this axis, still the current of electricity will be from the end
of the wire in the same position, relatively to the plane of revolution,
as before.    If the direction of the motion be reversed, the direction
of the current will likewise be reversed.
    It would follow from this, that if two wires parallel to each other,
on opposite sides of a bar magnet, and perpendicular to            axis,                     its        be

experiments approximate towards the direction              radii. Assuming    of
the existence       of
                    these currents,        satisfactorily accounts for the

Mr. Lubbock has     published   (in   Paper     the Phil. Trans. April 1830,)
                                                                    of in

   But the same problems may also                 approximately solved   be                                               di
rectly; for we obtain differential equation involving the radius
vector and the time.                     In a
                               this equation there occurs the same func

                                                 122
tion   R of which  we have already spoken; and this function is ex
panded    according to terms involving cosines of the mean motions
of the disturbing and disturbed planet, and cosines of the difference
of certain multiples of these motions. This expression has been
treated of by various authors, and among others Mr. Lubbock has
himself (in memoirs read May 19 and June 9, 1831,) given the ex
pansion of R in a form suited to his present object.
   The coefficients of the terms in this expansion are arranged, as
usual, according to the order of the excentricities, their powers and
products, and to the power of the sin” of half the inclination.  These
coefficients involve also certain quantities b, where n and i have a
variety of values; and these quantities depend on the ratio of the
mean distances of the disturbing and disturbed bodies from the sun.
   Solving the differential equation which involves r, by the equating
of coefficients, Mr. Lubbock finds a value for the reciprocal of r in
such terms as have been mentioned.        By certain algebraical trans
formations of the fractional coefficients in which i occurs, (and by
 certain equations of condition between bai-1, bai, "3:41,
                                                                              and
 between similar quantities,) the expression for the reciprocal of r is
 transformed and reduced, the arcs remaining as they were.
    But by the properties of the ellipse, the reciprocal of r is equal to
 a series of terms involving the excentricities, and involving also co
 sines of the mean anomaly and                  its
                                          multiples: and hence the variation
of   this reciprocal     equal
                        is            similar series, involving sines and co
                                       to   a
 sines of   such   arcs, and   involving   also the variations       the elliptic   of
 elements. By substituting the variations          the elliptic elements given
                                                               of
 by   the formulae above mentioned, when we put for                  expansion,R    its
 we have    a  certain series of sines and cosines with their coefficients
 multiplied into certain other sines                  of
                                             the same kind.
  It   is  found that the sines and cosines thus multiplied produce, by
 trigonometrical transformations, arcs identical with those which were
 found   in   the value      of
                             the reciprocal          obtained
                                                               of

 method; and the coefficients are also found           be identical with those
                                                                    to
resulting from the former transformations and reductions.
    We have not thought          necessary
                                  it           verify the somewhat complex

reductions      bywhich Mr. Lubbock has shown the identity           the results     of
obtained      by these two methods.       The mode         proceeding    of per               is

   The author begins by an account of some experiments which he
instituted with a view to discover the cause of the irregularities in
the indications of the intensity of terrestrial magnetism given by the
vibrating magnetic needle. By inclosing the needle in a box sur
rounded with water at different temperatures, the number of the vi
brations did not appear to be affected by these differences of tempe
rature when the heat was applied equally on              sides; but when par          all
tially applied, irregular oscillations took place, apparently from the

These papers are in good preservation: the writing is clear, and the
drawings well-defined.    Baron Zach says, that “he compared the
corresponding ones with those observed by Galileo, and found betwixt
them an exact agreement."      This, the author shows, is very far from
being the case, and he also brings evidence to prove that the discovery
of the spots on the sun was made by Galileo at latest in the summer
of the year 1610, and very probably in or before the month of July.
He allows, however, that Harriot's observation in December of the
same year, was the result of his own spontaneous curiosity.
   The first observation made by Harriot of the satellites of Jupiter,
has for date the 17th of October 1610. Those that follow, extend to
the 26th of February 1612; they are clearly written out on thirteen
half sheets of foolscap.  But, even by the statement of Baron Zach,
Galileo discovered them on the 7th of January 1610; that          nearly                      is,
eight months before Harriot.

He concludes, however,                      by
                              observing that Harriot ought not                                             to    be
deprived     of

losophical world is indebted to M. Bessel for having first drawn the
attention of the public more immediately to this subject.    For, al
though Newton evidently suspected that such an influence existed,
and although the subject had been since fully discussed by the Che
valier du Buat, nearly 50 years ago, yet it does not appear that any
of the distinguished individuals, employed by the different Govern
ments in making experiments on the pendulum in more recent times,
have had any notion that the effect of the air, on the moving body,
was any other than that depending on       density; and consequently      its
varying         in
           amount  according     the specific gravity      to

lenses, on cylindrical rods, on bars, on tubes, on convertible pendu.
lums, and on several clock pendulums, amounting to upwards of 40
in number. The results of these experiments give in each case a
different value for the factor n : and which appears to depend on the
extent of surface, in proportion to the bulk of the body exposed to
the direct action of the air when in motion: further experiments,
however, are requisite to establish this point in a satisfactory manner".
But, in the author's opinion, enough is shown to indicate the neces

hitherto made with the       pendulum,    either for the determination                                                     of   its

the method hitherto applied solely to the periodic inequalities.                                       Hi
therto those terms in the disturbing function which give rise to the
secular inequalities, have been detached, and the stability of the
system has been inferred by means of the integration of certain
equations, which are linear when the higher powers of the eccentri
cities are neglected; and from considerations founded on the varia
tion of the elliptic constants.   But the author thinks that the stability
of the  system  may   be inferred also from the expressions which result
at once from the direct integration of the differential equations.   The
theory, he states, may be extended, without any analytical difficulty,
to any power of the disturbing force, or of the eccentricities, ad
mitting the convergence of the series; nor does it seem to be limited
by the circumstance of the planet's moving in the same direction.

Sphinx Ligustri (Linn.), and on the Changes which it undergoes du
ring a part of the Metamorphoses of the Insect,” by George Newport,
Esq. Communicated by Peter Mark Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
   The author gives a minute anatomical description, accompanied by
drawings, of the development and arrangement of the nerves of the
Sphinr Ligustri, and the successive changes they undergo during the
last stage of the larva, and the earlier stages of the pupa state. As

rative size      of
               this species renders the investigation still more easy.
   While     in   its
                 larva state, this insect frequently changes         skin:                  its        it

   When on the point of becoming a pupa, the nervous lobes above
the oesophagus are found to be considerably enlarged, and to have
assumed more of the appearance of a cerebral mass; while, at the
same time, the nervous cords descending from them are shortened
and thickened.    The ganglia are brought nearer together, and their
intervening cords lie between them in an irregular manner, the
ganglia themselves being retained in their proper places in the
segments by the nerves running transversely from          them. The
nerves of the antennae are enlarged, and the optic nerves are become
much thicker and shorter than before. There is a remarkable en
largement        of the thoracic         nerves,   particularly of those sent to             the
wings; and those belonging to the posterior pair of legs are cu
riously convoluted within the thorax, preparatory to their being un
coiled at the instant of the change being made to the pupa state.
   These changes are followed minutely through several stages of
development.    The author expects to be able to lay before the So
ciety, in a subsequent paper, the results of his investigation of the
remaining stages, and to offer some observations upon the manner
in which these changes are effected.

   Papers were read, bearing the following titles:
    l. “An Account of the magnetical Experiments made on the
Western Coast of Africa in 1830 and 1831,” by Commander Edward
Belcher of H.M.S. Etna. Communicated by the Rev. George Fisher,
 M.A. F.R.S., through Captain Beaufort, R.N. F.R.S.
   The object of the inquiry specified in this paper, and of which the
results are given in a tabular form, was to determine the relative
horizontal intensities of terrestrial magnetism on the different parts
of the coast of Africa which the author has been lately employed in
surveying.     The experiments were made with four needles con
structed  by Dollond on the model of those of Professor Hansteen;
and the permanence of their magnetism during the voyage was veri
fied by a comparison of trials made in England before and since the
voyage.     Errors arising from local causes of irregularity were
guarded against by varying the places of observation at each station,
and taking mean results.
   2. “On the Use of a substance called the False Tongue in Foals,”
by Professor Sewell, of the Royal Veterinary College. Communi
cated by Sir Charles Bell, F.R.S.
   The substance called the false tongue, which is thrown out from
the mouth of the foal, either at the period of birth, or shortly before
it, and     to   which    various        whimsical   uses and virtues               have   been
                               by

assigned,     is   conceived        the author       to   requisite            in  this animal
or    the action   of   sucking,    inconsequence                 its   not respiring  through

the mouth, but altogether through the nasal passages: an instinc
tive feeling prompting it to supply the loss of that substance by suck
ing the teat of the mother.       Dr. Prout, who analysed a portion of
this substance at the request of the author, finds it to be composed
principally of coagulated albumen slightly modified. The author
regards it as a secretion from the tongue of the foal.
    3. “Journal of the Weather, kept at High Wycombe during the
year 1831, with monthly Observations,” by James G. Tatem, Esq.
Communicated by William Allen, Esq. F.R.S.
    These tables exhibit the greatest elevations and depressions of the
barometer and thermometer for the year 1831, together with the
means of the observations, which were made at 8 A.M., 3 P.M., and
10 P.M.; the extremes of cold being given by a self-registering ther
mometer. The quantity of rain was measured every morning at 8
o'clock. The course of the wind is noted, and remarks subjoined,
showing the results of a comparison with former years.
    4. “Physical and Geological observations on the Lake of Oo near
Bagneres de la Chou, in the year 1831,” by M. Nerée Boubée, Pro
         of Geology at Paris. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D.,
gº."
   ec. R.S.
    The author ascertained that the bottom of the lake, which is 230
French feet in depth, forms a level plane of great extent, and is co
vered with a stratum of mud composed of fine micaceous sand of a
blue colour. The temperature of the bottom of the lake was 7° of
the centigrade scale, at the middle 9°, at the surface 11°; that of
the air varying from 14° to 15°. There was no indication of any
current on the surface.        A cascade 954 feet in height falls into
 the lake, carrying down the detritus of the surrounding rocks.
    5. “Observations on the anatomy and habits of Marine Testaceous
 Mollusca, illustrative of their mode of feeding,” by Edward Osler,
 Esq. Communicated by L. W. Dillwyn, Esq. F.R.S.
    The author observes that in studying the physiology of the Mol
lusca, more satisfactory results may generally be obtained by tracing
 the organization connected with each important function, through
 different families, than by complete dissections of individual species;
 and, by thus connecting the study of function with that of structure,
the zoologist is led to more certain inferences relating to those habits,
 the knowledge of which the pelagic character of the animal, and the
 difficulty of direct observation, would otherwise have rendered unat
 tainable. The present paper is devoted to the anatomical investiga
tion of the organs by which the food is received into the bodies of
certain Mollusca. The herbivorous Mollusca which the author has
examined have three modes offeeding. Some, as the Trochus crassus,
browse with opposite horizontaljaws; others, as the Turbo littoreus,
 rasp their food with an armed tongue stretched over an elastic and
 moveable support: while others again, as the Patella vulgata, gorge
it entire. The author enters into a minute anatomical description of
the organs of manducation and deglutition, and also of that part of
the nervous system situated in the neighbourhood of these organs, in
each of these respective Mollusca,-illustrated by numerous draw

ings.   He gives in each case a particular account of the mode of
dissection, with a view to direct succeeding observers to obtain a
distinct view of the parts he describes, and to verify the conclusions
he has himself obtained.
   He next notices a considerable modification in the structure of
these organs which is presented in the Chiton.     In this animal he
finds a pair of simple lateral jaws, rather membranous than cartila
ginous. Another variety of structure adapted for gorging food is
met with in the Patella mammillaris, where there is simply a very
 muscular mouth and pharynx, but neither cartilage, tongue, nor
 hard part of any kind.
    The apparatus by which the Buccinum Lapillus drills through shells
 in order to obtain                its
                           food, and the process         employs for that pur      it
 pose, are next investigated         and that      ; the Buccinum undatum    of                                              is
 particularly examined with the same view, the structure                the latter                        of

care the specimens of the female Ornithorhynchus preserved in the
Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, found the structure to
correspond very exactly with the account given by Meckel; and,
moreover, succeeded in injecting the ducts of these glands with mer
cury. He further notices the differences of development occurring in
five different specimens: the size of these glands having an obvious
and direct relation to that of the ovaria and uteri. The gland itself
is composed of from 150 to 200 elongated subcylindrical lobes, dis
posed in an oblong flattened mass, converging to a small oval areola
in the abdominal integument, situated between three and four inches
from the cloaca, and about one inch from the mesial line. It is                                                            si
tuated on the interior of the panniculus carnosus, the fibres of which
separate for the passage of the ducts to the areola; the orifices of
these ducts are               all
                          equal size, and occupy
                                      of                   oval space five lines     an

               Investigation of the Powers of the simple Supporters of
  Combustion to destroy the virulence of Morbid Poisons, and of the
    oisonous Gases, with a view to ascertain the possibility of controul
  ing the extension of contagious or epidemic Diseases," by Edward
  Browne, Esq. FL.S. Communicated by J. H. Green, Esq. F.R.S.
     The author, after giving an account of the diversity of opinions
  entertained with regard to the power of chlorine gas to destroy con
  tagion, states that this gas exerts a similar disinfecting power on the
  virus of small-pox, and mentions the result of some experiments he
  tried on gonorrheal matter, on which it appeared to effect a similar
  change.     Various experiments are stated to have been made with
  iodine and with oxygen, indicating the same disinfecting agency in
  these substances.       The author conceives that these effects are pro
  moted   by  the heat communicated to the respired air in the lungs.
  He conceives that sea air possesses a disinfecting power, which he
  explains by supposing that it contains a portion of iodine. He con
 jectures, from analogy, that fluorine and bromine may have the same
  property.

water deduced from Mr. Bulpit's tables, White's Ephemeris, and the
British Almanac, with the observations at the London Docks, from
data furnished to him by Mr. Stratford; and also a comparison, by
Mr. Deacon, at the London and St. Katherine's Docks.

   In this Paper a method is given of developing the disturbing func
tion, in which the coefficients of the inequalities corresponding to any
given order, are expressed in terms of the coefficients of the inferior
orders; so that, for example, the coefficients of the terms in the dis
turbing function, multiplied by the squares of the eccentricities, are
given analytically by means of the coefficients of those independent
of the eccentricities, and of those multiplied by their first powers. As
the theorems, to which this method gives rise, are of great simplicity,
the author considers them as deserving attention.

   A paper was also read, entitled “An Account of the Construction
of a fluid refracting Telescope of eight inches aperture and eight feet
nine inches in length, made for the Royal Society by George Dollond,
Esq. F.R.S." By Peter Barlow, Esq. F. R.S.
   The author has, in former papers read to this Society, pointed out
the great variety of cases included under the general formulae relating
to the operation of fluid refracting telescopes, and stated the difficulty
of selecting, independently of experiment, the particular case which
was likely to produce the best result. This subject is pursued in the
present paper; and the principles and calculations stated at length
which the author has applied in the construction of the telescope
which the Council of the Royal Society directed should be made by
 Mr. Dollond, under the superintendence of the author, in order to
put these principles to the test of experiment, and to decide the ques
tion of the expediency of proceeding in the construction of a similar
telescope of much larger dimensions.       When the experimental tele
scope was completed, it was found that      performance agreed         its
                                                                     every                                    in

was such, that the corrections are all      them made       the transmis

abstains from offering any remarks        the performance         on
                                                                 this tele                          of

sciences, who have earned by their labours an European reputation,
the Reports which are thus produced prove often more valuable than
the original communications upon which they are founded, and the
collections of them, as is well known, form a most important part of
the stock of modern science.      Many other advantages also have
been found to result from the adoption of this practice.  The deci
sions of men who are elevated     by their character and  reputation

for this reason, that the learned professions, presenting                     they                        as                do is

                                                      144
In  other countries, however, where the learned professions are nei
ther richly paid nor highly honoured, and where the exclusive cul
tivation of particular branches of literature and science presents the
readiest access to the possession of competence and social rank, we
find large bodies of men who have no professional engagements
whatever to divert them from their literary and scientific labours,
which are thus made to constitute the business of their lives.     am                                       I
fully sensible of the great advantages which other countries possess
in these respects above our own, and that it is quite impossible for
us to command an equal concentration of attention to the advance
ment of particular branches of science, or to the concerns of a par
ticular Society; still less so when it is considered, that those services
must with us be afforded gratuitously, which in other countries are
remunerated by the State, or are required as part of the duty of a
salaried office:—we are not less called upon, however, on this account,
to make the best and most efficient use of the means in our power,
and the assistance which we cannot command as due from a sense
of official or professional obligation, we may receive as rendered
from a higher feeling of devotion to the promotion of the general
interests of science, and with it of our national fame.
   However much I may lament the want of establishments, in this
country, for the exclusive and liberal support of men of learning and
of science, and however anxiously I may look forward to the time
when our Government and Legislature may take this subject into
their most serious consideration, with a view to the remedy of so great
an evil, yet I rejoice to observe amongst           ranks    society all zealous     of            so
and   so  ardent  a feeling     favour
                                     in                of
                                           the cultivation     every branch            of                        of
science,    ofart, and     of
                           literature;      general and    so deep      anxiety,     so           an
in  fact, that our country should advance               the front rank     in the                          in
rapid march which European nations are making                  knowledge and          in
improvement.

     It
      becomes my duty now to advert to the heavy and severe losses
which the Society has sustained during the last year, including,     I
regret to say, many celebrated names, more particularly in our
foreign list. Ishall begin, however, with the mention of those names
upon our home list, whose labours in the cause of literature or of
science, appear to entitle them to particular notice.
   Sir Everard Home, Bart., was born at Hull on the 6th of May 1756.
He was the youngest son of Robert Home, a surgeon in the army,
and descended from the Barons of Polwarth, the ancestors of the Earls
of Marchmont in Scotland: he was educated at Westminster School,
and though elected off as a scholar to Trinity College, Cambridge, in
1773, he never went there, having abandoned his prospects in college
upon the invitation of the celebrated John Hunter, who had recently
married his eldest sister, and who offered to superintend his educa
tion in surgery and human and comparative anatomy, and gave him
the free use of his unrivalled collections. Under his auspices he con
tinued to study for several years, availing himself at the same time
of the lectures and instructions of the most eminent anatomical and
medical teachers of his day. He went to the West Indies upon the
medical staff in 1780, where he remained for four years; upon his
return to England in 1784, he continued to assist Mr. Hunter in
the arrangement and completion of his museum, and also in his
various official duties until his death, which took place in 1793.
Mr. Home was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1785; in 1808 he
was made sergeant-surgeon to the King, and in the same year he re
ceived the Copley Medal for his various papers on Anatomy and
Physiology, printed in the Philosophical Transactions.       In 1812
he was created a baronet, being the first surgeon in actual practice
upon whom that honour had been conferred.
   In 1821 he was appointed surgeon to Chelsea Hospital, and in
the following year he was elected President of the College of Sur
geons.    In the year 1827 he began to retire from the practice of
his profession, and from most of his official employments; and he
died at his residence in Chelsea College in August last, in the 77th
year of his age.
    Sir Everard Home was the author of 107 papers in the Transac
tions of this Society, a number exceeding that of any other contri
butor.    He published Lectures upon Comparative Anatomy, in six
volumes quarto; the two first in 1814, the third and fourth in 1823,
 and the two last in 1828. They consist chiefly of the results of his
papers in the Transactions of this Society, with a republication of
 the splendid plates, by the permission of the Society, by which
 many of them were illustrated.      He was also the author of several
 other works   upon   different subjects of anatomy and surgery; and
 he  published   in  1797,   Memoirs of John Hunter, who had be
 queathed to him       all
                       his papers.
    Sir Everard Home must be considered as the successor of John
 Hunter, and      inevery way most closely connected with him. He

                                                             146
aided greatly in the formation of his noble collection; he was a wit
ness of, and a sharer                     in,
                                 his most important investigations;                he was
also the depository          his literary treasures; and

lime or chalk could be rendered fusible, without calcination, and
became, upon cooling, a compact stony mass, and even crystalline,
like marble: it thus appeared that the effect of heat, acting under
enormous pressures, would not necessarily dissipate the gaseous and
evaporable parts of the strata of the earth, but would leave them to
form such new combinations or modifications of existence as might
be determined by the laws of crystallization or of chemical affini
ties;–a most important fact, and one apparently so difficult to esta
blish in a form which might bring into action those gigantic forces
which present themselves in the great operations of nature, as would
have checked the attempts of any man who was not urged onward
by the most determined enthusiasm in the defence of a favourite
 theory.
     Sir James Hall's work on the Origin of Gothic Architecture
 cannot be considered as a serious archaeological inquiry, but rather
as an agreeable exercise of his fancy.       The development however
 of his theory is singularly ingenious and elegant; it proves him to
 have possessed no mean talents as an artist, and shows a mind
 alive to all those beautiful combinations of nature which seem to
 be rendered fixed and permanent in the naves of our Gothic
 cathedrals, and in the tracery of our decorated windows.
     Sir James Mackintosh was born in Morayshire in Scotland, in
  1765; he was the son of an officer, of good family, but of very
 limited fortune; his first destination was for the profession of medi
 cine, and with this view he took the degree of M.D. at Edinburgh,
 in 1787. Upon his removal, however, to London, shortly afterwards,
 he abandoned his medical prospects, and gave himself up entirely
  to the study of the law, and of moral and political philosophy.    In
  1789 he went to Leyden, where he studied for some time, and after
  wards to Liege, where he was a witness of the memorable struggle
  between the Prince Bishop and his subjects, as well as of many other
  ebullitions of popular feelings which preceded and foreboded the
  French Revolution.      It was, probably, the contemplation of scenes
  like these, as well as the observation of the corruptions and abuses
  of many of the continental governments of Europe, which made him,
  like many other ardent young men of that period, an admirer of the
  principles of that great national movement; and the Windicia Gal
  lica, a work of great force and eloquence, was the most powerful
  answer which appeared in that age to Mr. Burke's celebrated Re
  flections, and gained for him, at once, both at home and abroad, a
  distinguished reputation. The atrocities, however, which marked
   the more advanced stages of the French Revolution, his own in
  creasing experience and knowledge of mankind, and still more his
   frequent intercourse with his illustrious adversary, for whose genius
  he had always professed a chivalrous admiration, however much he
  had opposed his views and his reasonings, combined to sober down
   the fervent enthusiasm of his own youthful speculations and hopes;
  and the principles which he avowed and vindicated in his celebrated
   defence of Peltier in 1802, must be considered as those which he
  adopted as the result of the convictions of his maturer age, and

                                                     148
 which he continued to maintain through life.                In 1803 he was ap
 pointed Recorder of Bombay, where he resided for seven years, and
 where he secured the affection and admiration both of natives and
 of foreigners, by the able, impartial, and considerate discharge of his
judicial functions. Upon his return from India in 1811, he was
 elected Member of Parliament for Knaresborough, a place which
 he continued to represent for the remainder of his life.
    Few persons of his own age had read so much as Sir James
 Mackintosh, or remembered what they had read so well. His con
 versation was singularly instructive and brilliant, without being
 overbearing; his manners were conciliating, his temper excellent,
 and he was entirely tolerant of opinions which were different from
 his own.      He was one of the most distinguished Members of the
 House of Commons; and his speeches upon                                       all
                                                              the great questions
 which were       agitated      his
                                 in  time  were    remarkable,      not merely for
 their  eloquence,      but the  large  and   comprehensive      views       national          of
 policy, which were supplied                    by
                                          his almost unrivalled knowledge                                      of
 history and political philosophy.
    Sir James Mackintosh, besides his Windicia Gallicae, was the

      The Baron Cuvier, the most illustrious naturalist of modern times,
 was born at Montbelliard in Alsace, in 1769, and died on the 13th of
 May last, in the 63rd year of his age: it is not necessary for me to
 detail any of the circumstances of the life of one whose name has
 been long known and reverenced in every region of the globe which
 has enjoyed the blessings of European civilization; suffice it to say,
 that he was honoured and even courted by every Government in
 France from the period of the Convention to the present day; that
 he held the most lucrative and distinguished appointments which the
 wise policy of that great nation has provided for the honourable sup

of Anatomy    at Pavia in the twenty-second year of his age, and for
the last half-century he has been placed by the common consent of
his countrymen at the head of their anatomists and surgeons.     He
was the author of  magnificent and classical works on “The Organs of
Hearing and Smell,” “On the Nerves,” “On the principal Diseases
of the Eye,” “On Aneurism,” “On Hernia," with Memoirs on many
other subjects of physiology and practical surgery.      He had ac
cumulated a handsome fortune by the practice of his profession,
and had collected in his palace at Pavia a considerable number of
works of art, where he lived for the latter years of his life, sur
rounded by his pupils, reverenced by his countrymen, and in the
enjoyment and contemplation of that brilliant reputation, the full
development of which a great man can rarely live to witness.
    In thus directing your attention, Gentlemen, to those distinguished
Members of the Royal Society, who, unhappily for the interests of
science, have been taken from us during the last year, there is one
name remaining which I cannot notice without feelings of the most
painful embarrassment.         To what class shall I, or can refer                                   I                 it;

     The name of nearly every distinguished foreigner who has been
 lost to science during the last year has appeared upon the Foreign
 List of the Royal Society, and I cannot help considering it as a cir
 cumstance which does honour to the Royal Society, that it should
 thus have associated with it whoever is most eminent in the great
 aristocracy of European science.       It is my wish, Gentlemen, and                                             I
 feel assured that it is yours  also, that the Royal Society should em
 brace the name of   every  distinguished   man of science in the British
 dominions.     At the last Anniversary it was my pleasing duty to pre
 sent the Copley Medal to Professor Airy, a name which would do
 honour to any Society, but which does not yet appear in the list of
                                        I
 our Members: and lament that I am not allowed to commemorate
 the name of that very distinguished philosopher, Sir John Ileslie,
 upon this occasion in the obituary of the Royal Society.        look for                             I
 ward with    hope,  Gentlemen,    to the time when the     Royal  Society
 shall be so circumstanced as to be free from such a         reproach,  or
 rather from such a misfortune.

THE Council of the Royal Society have, during the past year, used
 their most earnest endeavours to render the Library as effective for the
 purposes of science, as the means at their disposal would enable them.
 They have been desirous, in particular, to make it as complete as pos
 sible in    all
               those departments          science, whichof        more especially      it

 the object        of
                   the   Royal  Society       cultivate and  to  advance.      They
 have accordingly purchased, with the advice             the Library Committee,
                                                                             of

 such books        were more immediately required for these purposes,                                           at
 an  expense       about £1600.          was evident, however, that the mere

     A paper  was read, entitled, “On the extensive atmosphere of Mars.”
In    a Letter to His Royal Highness the President.        By Sir James
South, Knt. F.R.S.
   In this paper the author gives an account of a further observation
which corroborates the conclusion he had stated in a former commu
nication “On the extensive atmosphere of Mars,” namely, that no
indication now existed of any atmosphere being attached to that
planet. A star retained        its
                               light blue colour, and   full brilliancy
                                                           its its
and comparative steadiness       till
                                  the very instant    of
                                                       occultation              by
Mars.     At   its
               emersion    was seen nearly dichotomised. The author
                          it
concludes, that either some physical change has occurred             the   in
atmosphere      that planet,
                of             or
                               that the observations       of
                                                       Cassini and              of
 Roemer were inaccurate.

   A paper was also read, entitled, “On the Law which connects the
various Magneto-electric Phenomena lately discovered by Dr. Fara
day.” By the Rev. William Ritchie, LL.D. F.R.S. Professor of Na
tural and Experimental Philosophy in the Royal Institution of Great
Britain, and Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy in the
University of London.              .
   The general principle from which the author deduces the law in
question, is that of the equality of action and reaction.   The appli
cation of this principle to eléctro-magnetism, he  thinks, may be thus
expressed :-since a current of voltaic electricity can, in certain cir
cumstances, induce magnetism, magnets will, in similar circumstances,
induce similar voltaic currents. He gives an account of several expe
riments in confirmation of the universality of this law.
     paper was then read, entitled, “An Account of an extraordinary
     A
Meteor seen at Malvern, November 12, 1832.” By W. Addison, Esq.
F.L.S. Communicated by W. G. Maton, M.D. V.P.R.S.
   The author beheld, from the Malvern Hills, a constant succession
of meteors, of various degrees of magnitude and brilliancy. The
smaller ones were like those commonly called shooting stars, and left
behind them, for a moment, a train of pale yellowish light. Others
were much more brilliant; and notwithstanding the bright moonshine
threw a strong glare upon every object, they always commenced as a
small luminous point, rapidly increasing in size and splendour, shoot
ing with great swiftness over a considerable arc, and then, suddenly
disappearing, left behind them a long train of very vivid white light,
which slowly changed into a pale yellow. The author witnessed this
scene for upwards of an hour, although it was still going on when he
left     At one time
         it.              counted forty-eight
                                   he            these meteors during of
the interval of five minutes.

    A    paper was read, entitled,               “On           certain properties    of    Vapour.”
By the Rev. Dionysius Lardner, LL.D. F.R.S.
    It    has been generally supposed, that                    ifa   certain volume    of  aqueous
vapour, contained        vessel that was incapable

siders this assumption                to   be
                                    variance with the doctrine
                                                at                   latent                of
heat, and inconsistent with the results deduced from the experiments
which have established that the absolute quantities         heat necessary      of
to  convert   given
                  a weight      water into ofsteam,  under       pressures,          all
are sensibly equal.      follows, from this principle, that steam raised
                              It
from water, under any pressure whatever, admits            indefinite com       of
pression and expansion, without returning         the  liquid  state. The
                                                                     to

ture: but    every state
                   in      density    will have exactly that tempera

ture which it would  have were it immediately raised from water under
the  pressure  which it has acquired by compression or expansion.
The  only  cause of the restoration of vapour to the liquid form is the
abstraction of heat from it; and this cause will be equally operative,
whatever may be the state of the vapour with respect to density: but
compression alone, without such abstraction of redundant heat, can
never convert any portion of vapour into a liquid.       In accordance
with these views, the author regards the permanent gases as vapours,
containing a large quantity of redundant heat.
   A paper was also read, entitled, “On the Secretion and Uses of
the Bile.”  By B. Phillips, Esq.   Communicated by W. G. Maton,
M.D. V.P.R.S.
   The object of the author of this paper is to establish the three fol

       That the principles   the bile pre-exist

portion      of
            this material.
   2°. That bile may            be
                            secreted                  as

    The reading of Mr. Faraday's paper was resumed and concluded.
    The object of the inquiries of which an account is given in the pre
sent paper, is to establish the identity of the electricities derived from
different sources. The author was induced to investigate this sub
ject, because doubts have been frequently expressed as to the accu
 racy of some experiments from which the identity of common and
voltaic electricities is inferred : and distinctions have been drawn
between them, as if they were different forms and modifications of
                                                                                                       or ; its

   The author had long ago observed, that,             frogs, there exists, im   in
mediately under the skin, large spaces containing lymph, whence                                                              it

                                making incisions through the skin. These
receptacles for lymph are larger           the frog than   in the other amphi              in

   The author proceeds to trace the connexions of these cavities with
the lymphatic vessels in the neighbourhood, and with one another:
and it appears from his researches, that the lymph of the hinder ex
tremities, as well as that of the posterior part of the abdomen, is con
veyed by means of these hearts into the trunk of the crural veins.
He also gives a description of the posterior part of the venous system
of the frog, noticing particularly the large transverse anastomosis be
tween the sciatic and the crural veins, which joins the anterior median
vein of the abdomen, and conducts the blood partly into the vena
porta, and partly into the renal veins.
   Professor Müller has likewise discovered two anterior lymphatic
hearts in the frog; a discovery to which he was led by some obser
vations of Dr. Marshall Hall, who stated that he had seen in that
animal an artery pulsate after the removal of the heart. These ante
rior lymphatic hearts         each side upon the great transverse pro

  The following is the abstract of Professor Gauss's                                                     Memoir:-
  Of the   three elements which determine the manifestation of ter
restrial magnetism   in a given place, viz. Declination, Inclination, and
Intensity, the first soonest engaged the attention of philosophers, the
second much later, and the third has only at a very recent period
become an object of investigation and experiment.        This progressive
interest is chiefly to be accounted for by the circumstance, that while
the variation of the compass offered the greatest interest, as applied
to the purposes of navigation and geodesic operations, the dip was
looked upon as more nearly allied to it than was the intensity of ter
restrial magnetism. To the natural philosopher, those three elements
are absolutely of the same import, inasmuch as our knowledge of the
general system of terrestrial magnetism will ever remain imperfect,
 until an equal share of attention has been bestowed on           separate                                        its
branches.

computation unless we know the law of the force exerted on each
other by two elements of free magnetism, or, in other words, with
which, according as they are of the same or different denominations,
they repel or attract each other. Tobias Mayer had already conjec
tured this law to be the same with that of general gravitation, i.e. that
the force is in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance. Coulomb
and Hansteen have endeavoured experimentally to confirm this conjec
ture; and the fact is now completely established by the experiments
detailed in Professor Gauss's forthcoming memoir. This law, however,
only relates to the elementary effect; for the computation of the total
effect of a magnetic body on another, as soon as the nature of the
distribution of free magnetism in these bodies is accurately known,
becomes a problem purely mathematical, and consequently remains
dependent on their casual individual nature; but the greater the
distance, the less the influence of this individuality becomes; and if
the distance be very great, we may, catteris paribus, assume (as indeed
follows from the above principle,) the total effect to be inversely pro
portional to the cube of the distance.      The product of this cube into
the fraction which   expresses   the ratio of the effect of the first needle,
and of the terrestrial magnetism on the second needle, will therefore,
as the distances continually increase, tend to a determined limit. A
proper combination of observations at several judiciously selected
distances will, being mathematically treated, make us acquainted with
that limit, from which may be deduced the ratio of those two quan
tities the product of which was derived from the observed times of
vibration. The combination of both results will then obviously give
those two quantities themselves.
    The experiments for comparing the effects of the magnetism of the
earth, and of the first needle on the second, suspended by a thread,
may be conducted in two different ways; inasmuch as the latter may
be observed either in a state of motion or of rest. The former is best
effected by placing the first needle in the magnetic meridian of the
second, whereby the time of a vibration of the latter is either increased
or diminished, according as poles of the same or of different names
are opposed to each other. The comparison of the time of vibration
thus changed, with that occasioned by terrestrial magnetism alone,
or rather, the comparison of an increased with a diminished one (under
opposite directions of the first needle), will then readily lead to the
ratio sought. The second mode is that of placing the first needle in such
a manner that the direction of its influence on the second makes an
angle with the magnetic terrestrial meridian ; when the angle of de
viation from the meridian, in a state of equilibrium, will equally lead to
the knowledge of the ratio sought. And here, too, it is more advan
tageous to compare with each other two opposite deviations, under op
posite positions of the first needle. The most advantageous position
of this needle is along a straight line drawn through the middle of the
second and perpendicular to the magnetic meridian. The first mode
agrees upon the whole with that proposed some years ago by Poisson;
but the experiments, as far as we have any record of them, made by
some natural philosophers with a view to apply that mode, have either

                                                                  170
 entirely failed, or their results can at best be considered only as                                                            im
 perfect approximations.
    Professor Gauss, who has made frequent trials of both those nodes
 of proceeding, is satisfied that the second          many accounts, far           is,      on
 preferable          to
               the first.
    The real difficulty consists     this, that other elements depending
                                                          in

 dional hours, when the daily variation is most rapid, this may be fol
 lowed almost from one minute of time to the other.
    Of equal importance is this mode of proceeding for observing the
duration of the vibrations.   The passage of the vertical thread in the
telescope before a fixed point of the scale (properly speaking, the re
verse is the case), may, even if the whole deviation only amount to
 a few minutes, be observed with such a degree of precision as never to
leave any uncertainty amounting to the tenth of a second in time. The
considerable duration of a vibration (about 14 seconds in the most in
tensely magnetized needles), and the slow degrees by which the arc
decreases, are productive of other important advantages: only a few
vibrations are required to enable us to determine the time of one vi
bration with such accuracy, that, though the needle be left to itself
for one or even several hours, no doubt will remain on the mind of
the observer as to the number of oscillations performed during the
interval of his absence.  We may commence with vibrations so small
(such, for instance, as those with which we generally leave off,) that
the reduction to infinitely small vibrations becomes almost impercep
tible; and yet, after an interval of six and more hours, the vibrations
are still found sufficiently great to admit of having their beginnings
observed with               all
                    requisite precision.

   The two apparatus may likewise be made use of for another pur
pose, which, though not immediately connected with the principal
subject of the memoir, may still be adverted to in this place. They
are the most sensible and convenient galvanometers both for the
strongest and weakest energies of the galvanic current. To measure
the strongest, it is only required to bring the conducting wire single,
and at a considerable distance (at least several feet), into the magne
tic meridian below or above the needle; for very weak energies a
multiplier is wound round the box containing the needle.               Some of
the experiments were made with a multiplier of 68 circumvolutions,
producing a length of wire equal to 300 feet. No pair of large plates
is requisite: a pair of small buttons, or even simply the ends of two
different metallic wires dipped in acidulated water, produce a cur
rent indicated by the movement of the image along many hundred
parts of the scale ; but on using a pair of plates of very moderate                                             di
mensions, the image of the whole scale, as soon as the circuit is com
pleted, is seen rapidly to dart through the field of vision of the tele
scope. It is obvious that by this method the measurement of galvanic
forces may be conducted with a degree of ease and precision unattain
able by the hitherto employed laborious modes by means of observed
times of vibration; and it is literally true that by it we are enabled to
follow from second to second the gradual decrease of the intensity of
a galvanic current, which, it is well known, is more rapid in the be
ginning.       If,  addition, instead

 have been adopted. The manner in which the measurement of the in
 tensity has been determined by them cannot here be specified : the
 numbers, however, remain the same, provided the unity of space, and
that of weight (properly speaking, unity of masses), are changed in the
same proportion.     These experiments vary partly with regard to the
greater or less degree of care with which they were conducted, partly
with regard to the places in which they were made, and to the needles
employed.
   The experiments VII, VIII, IX, were in every respect performed
with all the precision which the apparatus in the present state admits
of, and the distances were measured with microscopic exactness. In
experiments IV, V, VI, X, some operations have been performed
with rather less care; and the three first experiments are still less
perfect in this respect.
   The needles employed in the first eight experiments were not in
deed the same, but they were nearly alike in size and weight (the
latter between 400 and 440 grammes); the principal needle in ex
periment X. weighs 1062 grammes; experiment IX. on the other
hand is made, with a much smaller needle (weight 55 grammes),
merely for the sake of ascertaining the degree of precision, which,
other precautionary means being alike, may                                                                          is a all

   A   paper was read, entitled,                 “On       the Influence of the Sun's Rays
on the Oscillations of the Magnetic Needle.” By William Snow
Harris, Esq. F.R.S. In a letter addressed to Samuel Hunter Chris
tie, Esq. M.A. F.R.S.
   The apparatus employed by the author in the inquiries of which he
gives the results in the present paper, is very similar to that he has
already described in his former communications to the Royal Society.
It allowed of his carrying on a long series of experiments with freely
suspended magnets, oscillating in a medium either rare or dense, and
either in the sunshine or in the shade. The source of error incident
to experiments in sunshine, made under an air-tight receiver, arise
from the increased temperature, producing, both in the rare and in
the dense medium, an irregular expansion, and a constant circulation
of currents of air, which interfere with the equable movements of the
bar—a condensation of vapour on the interior of the receiver—an
expansion of the bar itself, by which         length,      itspendulum, be
                                                                             as

observing the oscillations, first       the shade, under
                                                     in       close receiver,        a

M.A.  F.R.S.;   in which the latter gentleman, although he admits that
Mr. Harris's experiments   may explain some of the phenomena observed
by Mr. Christie, yet he does not consider them as conclusive against
the existence of the magnetic influence of the solar rays, and points
out several circumstances in support of that opinion.

    A paper was read, entitled, “A Relation of the case of Thomas
Hardy Kirman, with remarks on Corpulence.” By Thomas Joseph
 Pettigrew, Esq: F.R.S.
    The subject of this communication, T. H. Kirman, was born at
Barrow Mill, near Barton-upon-Humber, in Lincolnshire, on the 18th
of April 1821. His father, who is a miller, is of middle stature, but
inclined to corpulency; his mother tall and stout; and both per
 fectly healthy. Their son Thomas was not remarkable at the time of
 his birth for any peculiarity either in size or strength.         He has en
joyed uniform health, excepting that when six years old he fractured
 his thigh, and was in consequence confined for five weeks to his bed;
 on rising from which, by an imprudent exertion, he injured his knee,
 and was obliged to         uponlie  couch for five

relative intensities and conducting power of several of the metals :
but previously to engaging in this inquiry, he made a series of expe
riments, with a view of determining the law of intensities as depend
ing upon the length and diameter of the wire through which the cur
rent is transmitted. For this purpose it was necessary to devise means
of making and breaking the contact in as invariable a manner as pos
sible.   This he accomplished by letting the same weight fall from a
constant height when the contact was to be broken, and suddenly                                   re
lieving the cylinder of the tension caused by the same weight when
the contact was to be formed.      He ascertained that portions of wire
connected with the one which formed the circuit, but not included in
the circuit itself, had scarcely any influence on the intensity of the
current.     He then enters into various theoretical investigations as to
the mode of deducing the absolute intensities of the currents in this
mode of experimenting.
    By comparing the intensity of the electricity in wires of one metal
with that in wires of each of the others, by means of the arrangement
described in the beginning of the paper, and taking a mean of the
results, he found the relative intensities in the following metals to be,

iron 223, and lead 124. The author compared these results with
 those obtained by Davy, Becquerel, Professor Cumming, and Mr.
 Harris, and states what he considers may have been the causes of the
 differences.
   The second object of the author's inquiry relates to the law of va
riation of the intensity of the electricity excited in wires of different
diameters : for determining which he compares the effects of three
different wires of which the diameters were in the proportion of 4, 2,
and 1. The results occupy several tables: and the deduction from
them, with regard to the law in question,                    is,
                                                that the intensity varies
nearly     asthe square        of
                          the diameter: but several causes contribute
    interfere with the accuracy     this determination, and
                                                                                         of to

William Lubbock, Esq. V.P. and Treasurer   the Royal Society.
  This communication contains some interesting results which Mr.
Lubbock has obtained from observations made      Plymouth, Ports          at
mouth, and Sheerness, under the superintendence     the Masters                of                 at
tendant     those dockyards.
            at                 Mr. Dessiou has, with extraordinary
perseverance, just completed the discussion  about 6000 additional of
observations      of    the tides       at   the London Docks, with          view
                                                                                a    found   to

cilable with the theory of Bernoulli, and therefore the tables com
puted upon that theory must be rejected as inaccurate.
     A   paper was also read, entitled,    “On the Nature of Sleep.” By
A. P. W.    Philip,  M.D. F.R.S.L. & E.
   The author intends the present paper as a continuation of his in
quiries into the relations subsisting between the nervous and muscu
lar systems, which form the subject of his former papers, but which
would be incomplete without the consideration of their condition
during sleep. With this view he proposes to determine the particular
organs, on the condition of which this peculiar state of the system
depends; the laws by which it is governed; and the influence it has
upon other parts of the system. The necessity of intervals of repose
applies only to those functions which are the medium of intercourse
with the external world, and which are not directly concerned in the
maintenance of life. The organs subservient to these two classes of
functions may be viewed as in a great degree distinct from one an
other. The brain and spinal marrow constitute alone the active por
tions of the nervous system. The law of excitement, which regulates
the parts connected with the sensorial functions, including sensation,
volition, and other intellectual operations, and the actions of the vo
luntary muscles, is uniform excitement, followed by a proportional
exhaustion; which, when occurring in such a degree as to suspend
their usual functions, constitutes sleep;              degrees       all
                                                                     exhaustion           of
which      donot extend     beyond   the  parts  connected with the sensorial
functions being consistent with health. On the other hand, the law
of excitement        those parts
                        of           the brain and spinal marrow which are

            interrupted excitement, which, like the excitement
           is                                                                the

muscular fibre         everywhere the same; the apparent differences
                        is                                                                                     in

 battery; the whole being properly connected with an exceedingly de
licate galvanometer.     On making the apparatus revolve rapidly, not
the  slightest deflection of the needle was perceptible.    Hence, if so
large a surface of hot water be incapable of conducting as much elec
tricity as would agitate the most delicate astatic needle, though the
exciting cause was sufficient to make a wire revolve round a magnet,
and overcome the resistance of the mercury through which it was
dragged, it would require an enormous power of this kind to decom
pose water.    The author, therefore, considers it unlikely that electri
city induced by magnets will ever supply the place of the voltaic bat
tery in effecting chemical decomposition; and he concludes by ob
serving, that “as no increase of electro-magnetic power is gained by
increasing the decomposing powers of a battery, and as action and             re
action are equal, it appears improbable that we shall ever obtain high
decomposing powers by any increase in magneto-electric induction.”

recent Volcano in the Mediterranean.” By John Davy, M.D.                   F.R.S.
 Assistant lnspector of Army Hospitals.
    The author communicates an account given by Captain Swinburne,
dated the 24th of August, of a dangerous shoal, in latitude 37°9' N.
 and longitude 12° 43' E, consisting principally of black sand and
 stones, with a circular patch of rock, which has been left by the vol
 cano that lately appeared in the Mediterranean. Captain Swinburne
 furnished the author with two specimens of the air which was seen
rising from the site of the volcano, in small silver threads of bubbles.
These were found, upon examination by chemical tests, to consist of
between 9 and 10 parts of oxygenous to 79 or 80 of azotic gases.
    The author adduces arguments in favour of the supposition that this
air is disengaged from sea water at the bottom in contact with the
loose and probably hot ashes and cinders composing the shoal, rather
than that it arises from the extinct volcano.     He is also disposed to
extend this theory to the explanation of the gases disengaged from
hot springs, which are generally found to consist of a mixture of oxy
genous and azotic gases, the former being in less proportion than in
atmospheric air, in consequence of         its
                                          abstraction     oxidating pro

respects, should be placed on the same axis; and points out how, by
means of such a compound needle, both the dip and intensity might
be determined by independent methods, so that the agreement of the
results would        a test of the accuracy of the adjustments and of
the observations.   He considers that the knife-edge support, which
has recently been adapted to a dipping needle, would be peculiarly
applicable to a needle of this construction. The sensibility of such a
needle would be much greater than that of any hitherto constructed,
and the utmost delicacy would be required in the adjustments; but
if the needle were accurately constructed, and due care were taken in
the magnetizing, and in making the adjustments and observations,
the author expects that the dip and intensity would be determined to
a degree of certainty hitherto unattained.
   The advantages proposed to be derived from the use of a dipping
needle on the principle described in this paper, are, that as the dip
would be obtained without inversion of the poles, the results would
be less liable to error than when that operation is necessary, and the
observations would be made in less than half the time usually re
quired; and that a measure of the intensity of terrestrial magnetism
would be obtained from the same observations which give the dip,
the intensity of the force being thus always determined by means of
the same needle, and at the same instant as its direction.

   The noble author's house is situated in lat. 53° 37' N., long.
6°54' W. On the evening of the 21st of March last, at 9 P.M., a
stream of luminous matter, reaching from the eastern to the western
horizon, which it entered to the north of the constellation of Orion,
was observed passing about midway between the Great Bear and
Arcturus, and directly over the two principal stars of Gemini. The
phenomenon was not accompanied by the usual flashings of an
Aurora, but appeared to flow, when attentively observed, in a rapid
stream from east to west, and varying in intensity in     course. His  its

  § VII. Identity of Electricities from different Sources.
  § VIII. Relation, by measure, of Common and Voltaic Electricity.”
   In order to prove the identity of electricities derived from different
sources, the author in this communication, after viewing the pheno
mena exhibited by electricity, shows, that although some effects are
most readily derived from a particular source, yet none are peculiar
to such source.    The principal points in which ordinary and voltaic
electricity have been considered to differ, are the inefficiency of ordi
nary electricity to produce chemical decomposition, or to affect a
magnetic needle like voltaic electricity. The experiments of Wollas
ton were made early in the application of electricity to chemical de
composition, before the general law of the transfer of the elements to
the poles of the battery had been indicated; yet his 4th experiment,
in which electricity from the machine was passed through a solution
of sulphate of copper, and his 5th, where it was passed through a so
lution of corrosive sublimate, have the true characteristic of decom
position by voltaic electricity: and it is surprising that those who
advocate a distinction between these electricities should have ven
tured to overlook these experiments, when they bring forward the
experiment of the decomposition of water, as deficient in this charac
teristic of the transfer of the elements *. This circumstance, how
ever, induced Mr. Faraday not merely to repeat Wollaston's 4th ex
periment, which he did with complete success, but to adopt different
arrangements; and by these, with ordinary electricity, he obtained,
in various instances, chemical decompositions having          the charac    all
ters   ofdecomposition         by
                          voltaic electricity.   Whatever   doubt,  there
fore, may have been thrown upon this part        the subject,
                                                            of     has en         he

      exploded by an electric discharge", which he also employed to effect
      chemical decomposition, Mr. Faraday succeeded in causing the needle
      to deviate, both by the discharge of a battery, and by electricity pass
      ing directly from the conductor of the machine. In justice to M. Col
      ladon, we must remark, that the account which he gives of his expe
      riments affords no reasonable ground for doubting the accuracy of his
      conclusions: the details are clear, and the numerous results unequi
      vocal t. We may also notice, that, in the same memoir, M. Colla
      don gives an account of some very interesting experiments, made with
      a similar arrangement, on the magnetical effects of atmospherical
      electricity, by which       power             its

         Mr. Faraday,       the comparison which
                                          in            makes between the effects         he

                                       voltaic electricity, shows that the follow
      ing, though differing       degree, are commonin         both, viz. attraction                to

      of  the electricities from these sources      may       added,  that batteries            be

  ceeding in intensity, but deficient in quantity. We however think,
  that it would be more in accordance with the phenomena to state,
  that as some effects require continuous action, they can only be ob
  tained from ordinary electricity by rendering the quantity accumu
  lated on a given surface (which quantity is a measure of the inten
  sity,) available as a source of such action.
     Although we agree with the author in the conclusions which he
  draws respecting the identity of electricities, yet there is one point,
  the mode of their conduction, in which they have been said to differ,                                                   :
  on which we wish that he had made some remarks.                             The current

that of two faint and broad prismatic images, situated in a line per
pendicular to that which joins the common coloured images, led the
author to the further discovery of the mode in which the fibres are
united laterally to each other, so as to resist separation, and form a
continuous spherical surface. By viewing a well-prepared lamina with
a microscope of high magnifying power, he observed that the fibres
are united by a series of teeth, locking into one another, exactly like
those of rack-work.           The breadth and depth of each tooth are about
the fifth  part  of the breadth of the fibre itself, and       the adjacent sur          all
faces are       perfect optical contact. This denticulated structure exists

  he finds the sulphate to consist of 73-575 of protoxide of lead, and
  26:425 of sulphuric acid; and that the former contains 5-274 of
  oxygen.    According to these results, the equivalent number for lead
  is 103-6.                                                   -
      By experiments with the chloride of lead, which gave very uniform
  results, Dr. Turner obtained an equivalent number for chlorine, closely
  agreeing with that calculated from the analysis of chlorate of potash
  in the experiments of Berzelius, namely, 35:45, but totally incon
  sistent with the atomic weight assigned to it by British chemists. The
  accuracy of this result was further confirmed by a careful comparative
  analysis of the binoxide and bichloride of mercury.
     The author next endeavoured to determine the equivalent number
  for silver, by the analysis of                   its

  arrive    atany  precision               in

  barium may        calculated from his analysis

   HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF SUSSEX, K.G.,
                                President, in the Chair.
     Mr. Graham's paper was resumed and concluded.
    The tendency of the arsenic and phosphoric acids to form subses
 quisalts with the oxides of silver and lead is well known ; correspond
 ing salts with alkaline bases also exist. The author describes the me
 thod of forming the subarseniate and subphosphate of soda, and their
properties; and shows that they are subsesquisalts, containing one
proportion and a half of base to one of acid. They are the only known
soluble salts of that constitution; and it is remarkable, that the acid
of the subphosphate of soda is not convertible into pyrophosphoric
acid by the action of heat, like the acid of the common phosphate of
soda. This may be explained on the hypothesis, that phosphoric acid,
in contradistinction to pyrophosphoric acid, contains an atom of water,
which stands in a basic relation to the acid, and which may be re
placed by an atom of any of the usual bases.          Hence also arises the
disposition of phosphoric acid to form subsesquisalts; for the common
phosphate, used as a precipitant, exchanges                    its
                                                      basic water for     fixed              a
base; and for this reason, likewise, phosphate          soda,      any neutral
                                                                    of            or
phosphate, cannot         made anhydrous without becoming

phosphate; but the subphosphates having              excess   an base, may    of                  be

that the subarseniate differs from the neutral arseniate, merely by the
substitution of an atom of soda for an atom of water ; for the latter
salt contains 25 atoms of water.
   The author's experiments on the composition of the subarseniate of
soda, the results being reduced to the hypothesis, that it contains
23 atoms of water,-represent it as formed, (per cent.) of arsenic
acid, 27-69; soda, 22:55; water, 49.75. The subphosphate of soda
was found to consist (per cent.) of subsesquiphosphate, 43.97; water,
56-03 ; the soda in the salt amounting to 24'87.
   The author attempted to determine the quantity of phosphoric acid
in this salt, by direct precipitation by nitrate of silver, but could not
obtain rigorously accurate results; for the subphosphate of silver car
ried down with it a portion of the nitrate, which washing could not
entirely separate. He likewise failed in his endeavours to obtain pure
subphosphate and subarseniate of potash.
   The subarseniate of barytes appeared, by a single experiment, to be
composed, (per cent.) of arsenic acid, 32°06; barytes, 67.94: from
which the salt would seem to contain an excess of base; for by theory,
the subsesquiarseniate of barytes should be composed           acid, 33-4;                          of,
base, 66'6.

animal matter, constituting the nacreous or granular structure.    The
former class of shells, which includes most of the turbinated uni
valves, may be divided into those in which the crystals are rhombic,
and those in which they are prismatic.     The first are composed of
three distinct layers, the laminae of which are disposed differently in
the intermediate layer from what they are in the outer and inner
layers.  The direction of the fibres of each being nearly at right
angles to that of the contiguous layer, the strength of the shell is
rendered considerably greater than if the arrangement of the fibres
had been uniform in each plate.        The comparative thickness of the
three  plates  varies in different shells;   but the central plate is gene
rally the thickest.     The outer   plate  is the thinnest; and, in some
shells, is easily detached, in consequence of the deposition underneath
it of a white film of less coherent matter. It often happens, that
when the animal arrives at           full size,  its

 subjected this iron       minute analysis, the results

 ally present in meteoric iron, he unexpectedly found a considerable
 portion of molybdenum,_a rare metal on our planet, occurring only
 in two combinations, viz. with sulphur, as glance molybdenum, and,
 as molybdic acid combined with oxide of lead, in the yellow lead
 ore of Carinthia and a few other places.
    The following are the external characters of the six masses dug up,
 the largest of which was about fifty-seven pounds in weight; the
 others were considerably smaller.   Their shape is more or less oval
 and flat, with surfaces rather oxidated, and here and there covered
 with an earthy crust. The larger lumps did not exhibit any trace of
 scoriae; but in some of the smaller pieces, part of the metallic mass
 had passed into a porous slag-like body; of which latter a few de
 tached pieces were likewise found.            This iron possesses no degree of
 ductility; it is not attacked by the saw, and but slightly and with
 difficulty by the file.      Its tenacity, however, is considerable; the
 masses    required    great  strength     to be broken; but small fragments
 did not   oppose    greater  difficulty    to be reduced to a coarse powder
 than white    cast-iron;    and   glass  was but slightly scratched by them.
 On the fresh    fracture,   this iron exhibits upon the whole a scaly-gra
 nular structure;          its
                          internal lustre        moderately vivid, and
                                                         is                colour           its
 tin-white, with strong cast
                     a                   grey. Two varieties
                                                of                 texture were,  of
 however, observable;           some fragments        was more distinctly scaly,

 (barom. Q"758, therm.              21°5 c.)         =       7,2182; that    of   the fine-grained

      The mass contained much         sulphuret not unlike

        such as snuff or ammonia; yet the sense of smelling continued un
        impaired.    The left side of the tongue was quite insensible to im
        pressions both of touch and of taste.     On examining the brain after
        death, a scirrhous tumour was found lying on the inner surface of the
        sphenoid bone, extending laterally to the foramen auditorium inter
        num, and resting posteriorly on the pons Varolii, which was slightly
        ulcerated.   The tumour had completely obliterated the foramina for
        the exit of the three branches of the fifth pair of nerves.    This case
        proves, therefore, that, contrary to the opinion of Magendie, the senses
        of smell and vision can be exercised independently of the fifth pair of
        nerves; and that the sense of taste is altogether derived from that
        nerve; and corroborates the views of Sir Charles Bell on this part of
        physiology.
           2. “On the Respiratory Organs of the Common Leech (Hirudo off
        cinalis, Linn.), and their Connexions with the Circulatory System.”
        By George Newport, Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D.,
        Sec. R.S.
           The stomach of the leech has been hitherto described as a large
        elongated sac, simply divided into ten compartments by perforated
        membranous partitions : but the author, by a more accurate exami
        nation, finds that each portion of that organ is expanded into two
        lateral caeca, which increase both in size and in length as they are
        traced along the canal towards the pylorus. The caeca belonging to
        the tenth cavity are the longest, extending as far as the anus, and
        have themselves four constrictions: the cavity itself terminates in a
        funnel-shaped pylorus. When the posterior end of the animal is cut
        off, the caecal portions of the stomach are laid open, and the blood
        which it receives flows out freely, as fast as it is swallowed; and
        hence the leech, under these circumstances, continues to suck for an
        indefinite time.
    .       The respiratory organs consist of two series of pulmonary sacs, ar
º
*:* *
        ranged along the under side of the body, on each side of the nervous
        cords and ganglia. They each open upon the surface of the body by
        a very minute but distinctly valvular orifice. The membrane which
        lines them appears to be continuous with the cuticle, and is exceed
        ingly delicate and highly vascular, receiving the blood, for the purpose
        of   itsbeing aerated, from the veins            of
                                                   the system.   The blood       re               is
        turned from these sacs into the lateral     serpentine vessels      vessels          by
        of   a peculiar construction, passing transversely, and forming loops,
        which are situated between the caeca         the stomach, and which are

M.D., Fellow of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh.
   With a view to the future investigation of the osteological deve
lopement of the human race, the author gives, in the present paper,
the results of a great number of measurements, which he has very
carefully made, of the dimensions of the different bones composing
the adult human skeleton.   The male bones examined were those in
the collection of Dr. Monro; the female bones were furnished by
Dr. Hamilton. The author was anxious to fix on some one dimen
sion in the skeleton which might be taken as the standard of                 the                                  all

   This paper, which forms the sequel to the one on the same subject
which was read at the preceding meeting, continues the inquiry into
the combinations of phosphoric acid with different bases, and more
particularly with soda. The crystallized salt of phosphate of soda was

    Such is the origin of some of the most remarkable of the planetary
    inequalities, and, in particular, of the great equations in the mean
    motions of Jupiter and Saturn. It is necessary, therefore, that the
    astronomer be furnished with the means of computing any term in the
    expansion of the disturbing function below the sixth order; since it
    has been found that there are inequalities depending upon terms of
    the fifth order, which have a sensible effect on the motions of some of
    the planets. The object of the author in the present paper is to give
    the function such a form that the astronomer may have it in his power
    to select any inequality he may wish to examine, and to compute the
    coefficient of      its
                       argument                   by     an

    length. The investigation comprehends every argument not passing
    the fifth order; but         as
                             the formulae are regular, the method may                                            be
    extended indefinitely     any order.

  9. “Experimental Researches in Electricity.—Fifth Series."      By
Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., Fullerian Professor of Che
mistry in the Royal Institution of Great Britain.
  The object of the author in this paper is to investigate the nature
of electro-chemical decomposition.           From the consideration of the cir
cumstances          of difference that mark the electricities obtained from the
common electrical machine, and from the voltaic battery, and of which
he had already established the theory in preceding papers, he was
led to expect that the employment of the former in effecting chemi
cal decomposition would exhibit some new conditions of that action,
evolve new series of the internal arrangements and changes of the
substance under decomposition, and perhaps give efficient powers
over matter as yet undecomposed.               For the purpose of greater                                                      di
stinctness, he divides the inquiry into three heads. In the first, he
treats of some new conditions of electro-chemical decomposition, and
shows that that effect does not depend upon the simultaneous action
of two metallic plates, since a single pole might be used to effect de
composition ; in which case one or other of the elements liberated
passes to that pole, and the other element to the other extremity of
                                      of air

siders the influence         water      electro-chemical decomposition; and
                                                     in

    in the lobule by the portal vein; and the second class of hepatic veins

   A  paper was read, entitled,   “Historical Notice to    the supposed
Identity of the large mass of Meteoric Iron now in the British Mu
seum, with the celebrated Otumpa Iron described by Rubin de Celis,
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1786.” Communicated in a
letter from Woodbine Parish, jun., Esq., F.R.S., to Charles Konig,
Esq., Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society.
   The mass of iron in question was transmitted to Buenos Ayres, for
the purpose of being manufactured into fire-arms, at the period when
the people of that country declared themselves independent of Spain;
but a supply of arms having in the meanwhile arrived, it was depo
sited in the Arsenal, and afterwards given to Mr. Parish, who trans.
mitted it to England. Its identity with the mass of iron described by
De Celis, though probable, is not exactly determined.
   A paper was also read, entitled, “Observations of Nebulae and
Clusters of Stars, made at Slough, with a Twenty-feet Reflector, be

K.H., F.R.S.                    -
   This paper contains    the results of observations begun in 1825, and
assiduously prosecuted till the commencement of the present year,
for the purpose of reviewing the nebulae and clusters of stars disco
vered by his father, the late Sir William Herschel, and also of extend
ing his discoveries, and enlarging our knowledge of the nature and
physical constitution of those remarkable and mysterious bodies.
Since the recent improvements in the achromatic telescope, and the
increased diligence of astronomers in surveying every part of the
heavens, and detecting the passage of comets, the want of an exten
sive list of nebulae has become continually more urgent; and hence
the author was induced to supply, as far as he was able, that deficiency,
which he has now attempted by simply stating the results of his own
observations, in preference to waiting until he could present them to
the Society in the more complete form of a general catalogue of ne
bulae and clusters visible in this latitude. All the observations here
given have been reduced to a common epoch, and arranged in the

was observed more than once,                              all

that the true cause of this phenomenon is atmospheric, and that it is
perhaps connected with some highly rarefied material, disseminated
in cloud-like, though invisible, masses in the very highest regions of
our atmosphere, and possibly the same with that which, when ignited
by the passage of electric currents, gives rise to many, if not all, the
phenomena of the aurora borealis. Frequent instances occur of the
proximity of minute stars to nebulae; an appearance which naturally
suggests the idea of their composing planetary systems: for the enor

                   a                    grateful     my feelings, were

the Annual Grant        two Gold   Medals,  which had been     previously
conferred   on the Royal Society by his Royal Predecessor.
  It  must    be well known       you, Gentlemen, that these Royal
                                            to
Medals were not adjudged during the two first years that presided                              I
over the Royal Society; and        there exist many circumstances con
                                                as

      nected with the original grant and distribution of those Medals, as
      well as causes leading to their temporary discontinuance, with which
      the Fellows may not be generally acquainted, I trust that may be         I
      allowed to enter into some details respecting them.
         His late Majesty King George the Fourth announced, towards
      the close of the year 1825, through the medium of the Secretary
      of State for the Home Department (Sir Robert Peel), his gra
      cious intention of founding two Gold Medals, of the value of Fifty
      Guineas each, to be annually awarded as honorary premiums, un
      der the direction of the President and Council of the Royal So
      ciety, in such a manner as should, by the excitement of com
      petition among men of science, seem best calculated to promote
      the objects for which the Royal Society was originally instituted.                     *
      This munificent gift of the Patron of the Royal Society was of
      course accepted by the President and Council with every expres
      sion of gratitude for so valuable an addition to their means of pro
      moting the interests of science ; and it was resolved that, in con
      formity with His Majesty's Commands, the Royal Medals should be
      adjudged for the most important discoveries or series of investiga
      tions completed and made known to the Royal Society in the year
      preceding the day of their award; that their presentation should
      not be limited to British subjects; and that His Majesty's effigy, if
      such should be the Sovereign's pleasure, should form the obverse of
      the Medals; and that two Medals from the same die should be struck
      upon each foundation, one of gold and the other of silver.
         Upon proceeding to the distribution of the Medals, it was found
      that the limitation of time which these Resolutions fixed was of such
      a nature as to interfere most materially with the proper observance
      of the object proposed to be secured by their foundation; and the
      period was therefore, with His Majesty's sanction, extended to five
      years: in accordance with this arrangement the Medals continued
      to be awarded until the year 1830, inclusive, when the demise of
tº:   His late Majesty took place, and in which year I had the honour of
      being elected to fill the Chair of the Royal Society.
         Mr. Chantrey, to whom, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Law
      rence, was intrusted the selection of the subject for the Medal, fur
      nished the cast for the medallion of the head of His late Majesty,
      which was to form the obverse of                    it,
                                                while Sir Thomas undertook
      to  compose the design for the reverse.      Unfortunately, that distin

      that, at the demise      His late Majesty,  although  the  adjudication           of
       ten Medals had been formally made and announced from the Chair

                                   217
of the Royal Society, not even the dies, much less the Medals, were
forthcoming for the purpose of distribution to the various distin
guished persons, some of them foreigners, to whom they had been
 awarded.                                                             -
    It  cannot be necessary for me to impress upon you, Gentlemen,
that the non-completion of an engagement so solemnly entered into
with the whole republic of men of science, would have brought dis
credit not merely upon the Royal Society, but upon the personal
honour of a Monarch of this country, whose name it is our especial
duty as Fellows of the Royal Society, to hand down unsullied to
posterity, as our munificent Patron and benefactor; and as no funds
had been placed at the disposal of our Treasurer, nor in the hands of
any other ostensible person to meet the very heavy expenses which
must be incurred for cutting the dies and furnishing the Medals
already awarded, I felt it to be my duty, when I succeeded to this
 Chair, to recommend to the Council the suspension of any further
adjudgment of the Medals until I could have an opportunity of
 ascertaining the nature of the commands which had been issued con
 cerning them by the late Sovereign through his official advisers or
 otherwise, and also of taking the pleasure of His present Majesty
respecting their continuance in future, and the conditions to which
they should be subject.      These inquiries terminated in the most
satisfactory manner.     On a proper application to those who were
 intrusted with the ultimate arrangement of His late Majesty's affairs,
prompt measures, as far as lay in their power, were adopted for the
immediate fulfilment of every pledge which it was conceived had
been given to the Royal Society and to the public at large in the
name of George the Fourth.
    The dies for the Medals upon the old foundation are now com
pleted, and ready for distribution; they bear upon the one side the
likeness of His late Majesty, while the reverse represents the cele
brated statue of Sir Isaac Newton, which is placed in the chapel
of Trinity College, Cambridge, with such emblematical accompa
niments as seemed best calculated to indicate the magnificent ob
jects of the researches and discoveries of that great philosopher,
whose peculiar connexion with the Royal Society forms the most
glorious circumstance in its annals.
    After having settled that part of the business, and apprized the
 King of my success, I then ventured to petition His Majesty for the
continuance of that protection and munificence which the Royal So
ciety had ever experienced from His Illustrious Predecessors.      The
 Sovereign, with that just and enlightened zeal for the promotion of
 every object allied with the honour and prosperity of this country,
 which as a loyal subject I acknowledge with gratitude, while as an
 affectionate brother I recognise it with pride, acceded at once to my
 request, accepted the charge devolved upon him by the demise of
 the late King, and ordered, in consequence, that a fresh die should
 be cut, and that his effigy should form the obverse side of the
 medal.     This work also is completed.   All the dies have been exe
 cuted by Mr. Wyon with such boldness of outline, depth, and deli

                                     218
 cacy of finish, as do him the highest credit: and I trust that the
  medals will be considered in every way worthy of the exalted rank
  and dignity of the Illustrious Personage in whose name this mark of
  Royal favour is intended to be conferred.
      I am well aware that a diversity of opinion exists respecting the
  advantages which are likely to be conferred upon Science by a fre
  quent distribution of medals.     It is said that they must either con
  firm or contradict the   judgement  which has been either already pro
  nounced, or which posterity will most certainly hereafter pronounce,
  upon the merits, pretensions, and influence of the discoveries or
  series of investigations which such medals are designed to comme
  morate : that in the first case they can confer no additional ho
 nour upon their author, whose rank has already been ascertained
  and fixed by the sentence of a higher tribunal, while, in the second,
 they can only tend to compromise the character of the scientific
 body by whose advice they are conferred.          It is true that I would
 not claim infallibility for the united judgement of any association, or
 of any body of men, however eminent their scientific rank may be :
 but it is the peculiar privilege of the great masters of Science, (and
 more particularly so when acting or speaking as a body,) to be able
 to anticipate, though not without the possibility of error, the de
 cision of Posterity, and thus to offer to the ardent cultivator of Sci
 ence that highest reward of his labours, as an immediate and well
 assured possession, which he might otherwise be allowed silently
 and doubtingly to hope for, but never be permitted to see realized:
 and though some powerful minds might be content to entrust the
 complete developement of their fame to the fulness of time, and might
 pursue their silent labours under the influence of no other motives
 but such as are furnished by their love of truth, the gratification de
 rived from the discovery of the beautiful relations of abstract science,
 or from the contemplation of the agency of a Divine Mind in the har
 monies and constitution of the physical world, yet it is our duty
 and business to deal with men as we find them constituted, and to
 stimulate their exertions by presenting to their view honourable      di
 stinctions attainable by honourable means; to assure them that the
 result of their labours will neither pass unnoticed nor unrewarded;
 and that there exists a tribunal to which they may appeal, or before
which they can appear, whose decision is always for honour, and
never for condemnation.
     It is for these reasons, Gentlemen, that I feel myself justified in
expressing my opinion that the power possessed by your Council of
conferring honorary rewards is a most salutary power, provided it
be exercised boldly, impartially and diligently; and that it may
greatly promote the taste for scientific pursuits in this country, by
presenting a more immediate prospect than would otherwise ex
ist, of a public and distinguished recognition of any valuable dis
covery, or of the completion of any important and laborious course
of investigation.
     I had occasion, Gentlemen, when I had last the honour of address
ing you, to remark that there were many circumstances in the con

                                                                  219
stitution of society in England, and perhaps in the form and work
ing of our Government, which were unfavourable to the cultivation
of Science as a distinct and, as it were, a Professional employment.
Though many of the causes of this evil, if so it may be considered,
are too deeply seated to be reached by any legislative enactment,
                                                                 be   system, the ge

       eleventh hour, (I blush to own that it was not earlier,) first abroad,
       and secondly at home, secured him that public recognition of his sci
       entific rank to which he has long been entitled. With him, Gen
       tlemen, posterity may be said to have already commenced, and though
       full of years and honour,                    I
                                        rejoice to hear that he still retains the
       same zeal and   vigour  in the pursuits  of science which have carried
       him forwards from his earliest youth in his career of discovery, in
       spite of all the discouragements of confined means and of the most
       laborious and depressing employments.         It gives me great pleasure
       to learn that His  Majesty  has lately  expressed   his Royal approbation
       of his services to science  by the  grant of a  pension,  if not commen
       surate with his services, at least as considerable as the severity of
        existing regulations will allow; though                               I
                                                             cannot refrain from ex
        pressing on this occasion my regret at the very narrow limits within
        which the munificence of the King and the generosity of the Nation
        should be confined.
           The second Medal for the same year was awarded to MR. Ivory,
        the first of our mathematicians who transplanted to this country the
        profound analytical science which LaGrange, Laplace, LeGendre,
        Gauss and others upon the continent, had applied to the most im
        portant and sublime physical inquiries. The dignity of such inves
        tigations has not suffered by the association of Mr. Ivory's name
        with them, and the Transactions of the Royal Society present fre
        quent and honourable records of his valuable labours.                  It     how                    is,

   The two other Medals for the corresponding years were awarded
to two distinguished foreign Astronomers. The first, to PRofessor
STRUvE, of Dorpat, who is so justly celebrated for his numerous and
                                                                                                           ***
valuable observations of double stars, a department of astronomy
which is daily acquiring an increase of interest and importance, from
the new and extensive views which it is beginning to open to us of
the constitution of the remoter parts of the universe, and of the laws
which seem to govern some at least of the periodical changes which
they are undergoing.     The second, to PROFEssoR ENcKE, of Berlin,
the greatest of modern astronomical calculators, who first determined
and predicted the motion of the comet which is justly signalized by
his name, with an accuracy approaching to that which before be
longed to the ephemerides of the planets only; and who still more has

diately from himself.       His Majesty has also been graciously pleased

                                   222
 to prescribe the general Rules and Principles which shall regulate
 their distribution hereafter.    The King has therefore commanded
 that   they shall be  adjudged  annually, and that the award shall be
 announced on the day of the Anniversary Meeting of the Royal
 Society; that the Memoirs which shall be entitled to receive them,
 whether composed by Foreigners or by Englishmen, shall be com
 municated to the Royal Society; and that the general subject matter
 of such Memoirs shall be prescribed and announced by the Council
 at least three years preceding the day of their award: and also, that
 for the present and the two following years, the principle of their
 distribution shall be the same as that which has hitherto been adopted,
 with the additional condition, that the succession of branches of sci
 ence which shall be selected as entitled to these rewards, shall be the
 same as that which shall be hereafter followed when the cycle of
 their regular distribution begins.
    The selection of the subjects which should compose this cycle was
 left to the Council of the Royal Society, who have made such a
 choice as seemed to them best calculated to comprehend every de
 partment of science and to prevent the jealousies which might arise
 from the recurrence of similar subjects in immediate or too close
 succession: the subjects themselves and their periodical order (de
 termined by lot) are as follow:-
     1. Astronomy.
    2. Physiology, including the Natural History of Organized Beings.
    3. Geology and Mineralogy.
    4. Physics.
    5. Mathematics.
    6. Chemistry.
    In conformity with these Regulations, which form the existing
law for the distribution of the Royal Medals, they have been awarded
for the current year to PRofessor DE CANDolle, of Geneva, for his
numerous and valuable researches and investigations in Vegetable
Physiology, as detailed in his Work, entitled “Physiologie Végétale,”
published in the year 1832; and to SIR John FREDERICK WILLIAM
HERscHEL, for his Paper “On the Investigation of the Orbits of Re
volving Double Stars,” inserted in the Fifth Volume of the Memoirs
of the Royal Astronomical Society.
    The science of Vegetable Physiology has at all times presented
extraordinary difficulties, and although it has employed the talents
and the industry of a great number of philosophers, from the earliest
period, little progress has been made in obtaining an exact knowledge
of the minute organization of plants, and of the mode in which their
functions are exercised, at least, when compared with the great ad
vance which has taken place in the analogous sciences which relate
to the comparative anatomy and physiology of animals.
    The structure of vegetables, in consequence of   itsminuteness and
intricacy,     involved        greatest obscurity;  itsinvestigation re
                      of in
          is               the
quires the application      powerful microscopes, and    liable
                                                          is   to   all
                                                                     the
fallacies peculiarly incident to    such observations: and the greater
part of   vegetable physiology  being dependenton  the full and accurate

                                                223
knowledge of that organization, is exposed to the same causes of un
 certainty.   But the progress of this department of science has suf
fered less from the want of accurate and sufficiently multiplied ob

of  the Heavens within his observation            repeated and systematic

registered many thousand distances and angles            position     double  of                    of

                              them form systems whose variations          po                             of

           to Sir John Herschel's European labours. He has long contem
           plated a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, as a favourable station
           for observing the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere, and
           the magnificent nebulae which it contains; and when we consider
           the space-penetrating power of his instruments, such as has never
           yet been brought to bear upon them ; his skill and long experience
           and systematic diligence as an observer; his perfect familiarity with
           the class of phenomena which are to be observed; his sagacity in
** * -- --  interpreting and disentangling the most complicated appearances;
** *
            and his profound knowledge of physical as well as practical astro
            nomy, we may look forward to a harvest of discoveries, such as will
            not only extend the existing boundaries of science, but add to the
            lustre of a name which is known and reverenced in every region to
            which European civilization has reached.
               It has been said that distance of place confers the same privileges
            as distance of time, and I should gladly avail myself of the privilege
            which is thus afforded me by Sir John Herschel's separation from
            his country and friends, to express my admiration of his character,
           in stronger terms than I should otherwise venture to use; for the
           language of panegyric, however sincerely it may flow from the heart,
            might be mistaken for that of flattery, if it could not thus claim
            somewhat of an historical character: but his great attainments in
            almost every department of human knowledge, his fine powers as
            a philosophical writer, his great services and his distinguished de
            votion to science, the high principles which have regulated his con
            duct in every relation of life, and, above all, his engaging modesty,
            which is the crown of all his other virtues, presenting such a model
           of an accomplished philospher, as can rarely be found beyond the
           regions of fiction, demand abler pens than mine to describe them in
           adequate terms, however much inclined I might feel to undertake
           the task. That he may live to accomplish all the objects which have
           induced him to transport himself to another continent, and that he
           may long survive his return to witness the respect, reverence and
           gratitude of his countrymen, is my earnest prayer, in which I am
            quite sure that you, Gentlemen, will cordially join.
               It now becomes my painful duty to call your attention to the names
           of those Fellows and Foreign Members whom the Royal Society has
           lost during the last year.
               SIR John MALcolM was born in the year 1769, a year remarkably
           fertile in the production of great men". He was one of a family of .
           seventeen children, which enjoyed the singular distinction of having
           three of its members created Knights of the Bath in the same year.
           At the early age of thirteen he was sent to India as a Cadet, and
           learnt his first lessons of military service in the celebrated wars of
           the Mysore; and during an almost uninterrupted residence of nearly
           forty years, he was employed both in civil and military duties, fre
           quently of great importance and difficulty, in almost every part of
           Central India; and it was chiefly owing to the opportunities afforded
           by this long intercourse with the natives of all classes and nations,
                               * Napoleon, Wellington, Cuvier, &c.

                                        225
aided by the system of carefully recording his observations of their
manners and customs, and by his perfect knowledge of their lan
guages, that he was enabled to acquire the most intimate acquaint
ance with their habits, their feelings and their prejudices, at the
same time that he secured, in a very uncommon degree, their confi
dence and respect by his strict impartiality, and by his considerate
attention to their wants and their interests.
    He was twice sent as Ambassador to Persia, where he con
ducted negotiations of great delicacy and difficulty in such a man
ner as to maintain the honour, at the same time that he secured
the interests of the Government which he represented: he was,
in fact, eminently qualified for the discharge of such a duty by his
profound knowledge of the Persian language and literature, and by
the conformity of his own manners with those of that lively and
polished nation. Nor were the fruits of his mission political merely,
inasmuch as they led to the production of his History of Persia,
a work of great research and of standard value; to his Persian
Sketches, so remarkable for their wit and vivacity, and, I believe,
likewise for the truth of the pictures of manners which they furnish;
and also to a volume of Poems, which display no inconsiderable
powers of versification.
    Sir John Malcolm was a voluminous writer, and amongst other
works may be particularly mentioned his Political History of the
 Government of India, from the year 1784 to the Present Time; his
very interesting Sketch of the Sihks, and his History of Central              In
dia. In all his writings he has shown himself to be the friend of the
native population, and the zealous advocate of a system of govern
ment such as would reconcile the interests of the governed with
those of the governors: and though he has very clearly demon
 strated that our Indian Empire must be progressive in order to be
permanent, and that external attacks upon it must not only be re
pelled, but the means of renewing them either greatly weakened or
altogether removed, yet he stigmatizes with just reprobation the
commencement        or continuance of wars of conquest merely, which
are not rendered necessary by previous and adequate provocation.
 Upon all such subjects Sir John Malcolm was eminently entitled to
pronounce an authoritative opinion, from his great experience, both
 military and civil, and from his almost unequalled knowledge of the
political interests and relations of          all
                                            the various nations who com
 pose or  border upon our Indian Empire.
    Sir John Malcolm returned       to England      1822:in   1827  in   he
                                                                        was
 appointed Governor      ofBombay and Central India. He retained this
 important situation for three years, when                    he
                                                      was recalled for the
 purpose   of taking part      the discussions which were likely
                              in                                         to
                                                                       arise
 upon the renewal       ofthe East India Company's Charter.        He was
 shortly after his return elected Member       Parliament for Launceston;
                                                    of
but the questions which almost entirely absorbed the attention                of
 Parliament and    of  the public  at that period were not calculated for
the favourable    display    of
                              his peculiar  powers. His last public ad
 dress was made   at a  meeting    inLondon      honour
                                                     in            of
                                                            his illustrious

                                     226
 countryman    Sir Walter Scott, of    whose genius and writings he was
 an enthusiastic admirer: on the      following day he was attacked by
 paralysis, from which he never recovered; and he died at his house
 in London on the 31st day of May last.
    Sir John Malcolm was tall and commanding in his person; his
 manners were remarkably free and unconstrained, and his conver
 sation rapid and animated; and notwithstanding his long and inti
 mate intercourse and association with Oriental people and Oriental
 languages and with scenes of life altogether different from those in
 which his earlier boyhood had been passed, yet he continued to speak
 with the accent of his countrymen, and to remember their national
 traditions with all the vividness and to recite their national poetry
 with all the enthusiasm, which characterize our earliest and deepest
 impressions.    As a father, a husband and a brother he was emi
 nently kind and affectionate; and few persons have been more gene
 rally beloved by their friends for their social virtues, or more re
 spected and revered for their great talents and attainments and for
 their eminent public services.
    I observe with pleasure that a monument, from the chisel of Mr.
 Chantrey, is to be erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey, for
 which ample funds have been provided by the almost spontaneous
 contributions of his friends; and it is worthy of remark that amongst
 the subscribers is to be found the name of an Eastern Potentate, the
 Pacha of Egypt, the founder of a great empire, and still more dis
tinguished for his triumphs over Eastern prejudices, who became
acquainted with Sir John Malcolm upon his return from Bombay,
and who has most gladly availed himself of this opportunity of ex
 pressing his respect for the memory of his friend.
    MR. WILLIAM MoRGAN was the author of several papers in our
Transactions, chiefly upon the subject of the value of reversions
 contingent upon different cases of survivorship.     For two of these
papers, printed in 1788 and 1789, he received the Copley Medal.
 He was one of the first authors who rejected altogether the hy
pothesis of the equal decrements of life which had been introduced
by De Moivre, partly from the want of correct tables, and partly for
the purpose of simplifying the formulae employed in the calculation
of contingent reversions; and he showed in what manner such ques
tions could be practically solved with reference to the real proba
bilities of life. Mr. Morgan was the nephew of the celebrated Dr.
Price, whose memoirs he has written, and some of whose works he
has edited; and he partook largely, at one period at least, of some
of the political and financial opinions of that ardent character, par
ticularly relating to the dangers of a national bankruptcy from the
rapid increase of our National Debt. He was appointed early in
life, chiefly by his uncle's influence and recommendation, to the situ
ation of Actuary of the Equitable Assurance Company, which he
continued to hold for nearly sixty years; and the unexampled wealth
and prosperity of that great establishment may be in a great degree
attributed to the confidence inspired by the correct principles of cal
culation and of management which he introduced ; and though he

                                                       227
was exposed towards the close of life to many attacks and much
opposition, in consequence of his too rigid adherence to a system
which might be calculated to do injustice to some classes of insurers,
yet no small indulgence is due even to the prejudices of a man who
had done so much service to society, by establishing upon a firm
basis the security of establishments which act as safeguards against
the fluctuations and vicissitudes of life, and which thus encourage
habits of providence and of foresight amongst the higher and middle
classes of the community.
   MR. THoMAS ALLAN, an eminent citizen of Edinburgh, was the
author of a work on Mineralogical Nomenclature, and of several pa
pers on geology and mineralogy in the Transactions of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, and elsewhere. He was greatly distinguished
for his accurate knowledge of mineral species and their varieties,
and of all the delicate and minute distinctions of external characters
by which they are separated from each other; and his collection of
minerals has been justly celebrated for     great extent and perfect   its
arrangement.        the year 1812
                         In          joined Sir George Steuart Mac

   DR. WILLIAM BABINGToN was distinguished physician   a                    the City                in

                     knowledge, particularly           geology, physiology and
                                                                        in

                                    228
 ledge, were held at his house.     He was a person of great simplicity
 of manners,   a warm   and active friend, zealous in the promotion of
 objects of charity and usefulness, and in the practice of his profession
 singularly kind to the poor.
    The death of LoRD Dover in the course of this year excited an
unusual degree of public sympathy and sorrow, from his youth and
high birth, his domestic virtues, and perhaps also his domestic hap
piness, his unsullied public character, his cultivated taste for the
arts, and his liberal and enlightened patronage of artists, and most
of all from the promise of the highest literary distinction afforded by
his very interesting historical memoirs and other literary productions.
Such qualities and attainments, whilst they give dignity to all who
possess them, acquire a peculiar grace and lustre when found in
those classes of society in which the possession of rank and wealth
separate altogether the pursuit of knowledge and of fame from all
taint of a suspected union with the desire of mere personal aggran
dizement.
    THE REv. BEwick BRIDGE, Fellow of St. Peter's College, Cam
bridge, obtained the highest mathematical honours in his own acade
mical year. He was for many years Mathematical Professor in the East
India College at Haileybury, and was the author of several elemen
tary works on different parts of mathematics, which are remarkable
for their judicious adaptation to the capacities of ordinary students,
by the union of simplicity and fulness in the developement of first
principles, a species of merit which those only can duly estimate
whose experience in education has shown it to be very rarely at
tained. Mr. Bridge was a person of great benevolence, who devoted
his life and fortune to the promotion of objects of charity and pub
lic utility, and whose purity of character and kindness of heart se
cured him the affectionate attachment of a large circle of friends.
    CAPTAIN Lyon became first known to the public from his having
accompanied the late Mr. Ritchie in his journey into the interior of
Africa.     His companion died at Moorzouk, and after encountering
the  ordinary  succession of sufferings and dangers which characterize
the  melancholy   records of African discovery, he succeeded in effect
ing his return, and published a very modest and interesting journal
of his travels.    He afterwards accompanied Captain Parry in the
second voyage to the Arctic Regions, as commander of one of the
two ships which composed that expedition. After his return he was
chosen, from a knowledge of his enterprising and energetic charac
ter, to conduct a party of English miners to Zacatecas and Bolaños
in Mexico, and to undertake the management of the first of these
mining establishments: and though he continued there for a short
time only, being compelled by domestic circumstances to return to
England, his services were of such a kind as to produce the most
important results. His Mexican adventures form a narrative full of
interesting, amusing and instructive details.       He was afterwards
chosen by the Brazilian Company to superintend the celebrated gold
mines at Gongo Soco, in the province of Minas Geraes, which under
his management became so productive, as fully to vindicate and re

                                      229
deem the character of South American mining speculations. Upon
quitting their service he engaged in mining adventures of his own;
and it was in returning to England, in consequence of an accidental
injury which he received in the course of his operations, that he
died at sea, in the thirty-seventh year of his age.
   MR. Joshua BRookEs was for more than forty years a distinguished
teacher of anatomy, and it is said that during the course of his life
he had superintended the anatomical education of more than seven
thousand pupils.     He had formed a Museum of human and com
parative anatomy, which was second only in extent and value to the
Hunterian Collection, and to which he gave the most ready and libe
ral access both to his pupils and to the public. To the completion of
this museum, and to the instruction of his pupils, he devoted the
whole of his time and of his income; and it was a melancholy cir
cumstance that he should have been compelled towards the close of
his life, when his health, and with it his sources of income were de
clining, from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties, to consent to the
sale of his museum.      The dispersion of this collection was to him
a source of the most     poignant   distress; and the latter years of a
long life which had been devoted with singular disinterestedness to
the public service, were imbittered at once by the pressure of po
verty and the despondency occasioned by the annihilation of those
hopes of having raised a lasting monument to his fame, which had
formed the great object of his ambition.
   LIEUTENANT-Colon EL JoHN BAILLIE went to India as a Cadet in
1791, and from the commencement of his residence he devoted himself
with great diligence to the study of the Oriental languages. . Upon
the establishment of the College of Fort William, in 1800, he was
appointed Professor of the Arabic and Persian languages, and of the
Muhammedan law, a situation which he continued to fill with great
credit and distinction for several years.       He was the author of
Tables elucidatory of a Course of Lectures on Arabic Grammar,
of A Collection of the original Terts of the five most celebrated
 Grammars of the Arabic Language, and of A Translation from the
Arabic of a Digest of the Muhammedan Law, of which one volume
only out of four was published. His Oriental studies appear to have
terminated upon his appointment as Resident at Luchow, where he
continued for several years.    He quitted India in 1818, and in 1823
he was appointed a Director of the East India Company. Colonel
Baillie was one of the founders and most active supporters of the
Royal Asiatic Society; and he represented his native town, Inver
ness, and   its contributory burghs,       two successive Parliaments.

said to have been one of the most extensive and valuable that was
ever brought  to this country.
   MR.   Joseph  WHIDBEY was for nearly fifty years   a  Master in  the
Navy, and had been one      ofthe companions     of
                                                 Vancouver in  his voy
age round the world.       He was person
                                  a             great practical know
                                                 of
ledge and skill, and possessed   of more than ordinary general attain
 ments; and       he
                  was  in consequence selected by the Government     to

superintend, under the direction of the late Mr. Rennie, the exe
cution of that great national work, the Breakwater at Plymouth.
He was the author of three papers in our Transactions: one on the
means adopted for raising the Dutch frigate Ambuscade, which had
been sunk at the Nore; and the other two on certain fossil bones
discovered in the limestone quarries at Oreston, near Plymouth.
    ADRIEN MARIE LEGENDRE, one of our Foreign Members, and one
of the most illustrious analysts in Europe, was born in Paris in 1752,
and died on the 10th of January last, in the eighty-first year of his
age.      After the completion of his studies at the Collège Mazarin, he
devoted himself to mathematical and scientific pursuits, which he
continued, with singular perseverance and industry, for the remainder
of his life. At the age of thirty he gained the two prizes proposed
 by the Academies of Berlin and Paris; the one for a memoir on the
 motion of projectiles in a resisting medium, and the other for a me
 moir on the attraction of spheroids upon any external point what
 ever.     It was this second memoir which gained him, in the follow
 ing year, a place in the Academy, as the successor of D'Alembert,
 and which attracted in a peculiar degree the attention of mathema
 ticians. The problem which it treated was one of the greatest im
 portance and difficulty, particular cases only of which had been suc
 cessfully treated by Newton, MacLaurin and Clairaut, but which he
 attacked in all its generality, and mastered its difficulties “sword
 in hand,” to use the expressive language of Lagrange, when speak
 ing of this admirable memoir.       An important proposition discovered
 by Laplace led to a second, and a happy substitution, proposed and
  applied by Mr. Ivory, to a third resumption of this problem, which
 has finally terminated in such an organized system of approaching
  its difficulties, that it has lately been reduced to the order of those
  propositions which are included in the higher class of elementary
 books”.                                                                         -
    It was in the course of his researches upon the attraction of
 spheroids that his attention was first drawn to the subject of elliptic
 integrals, concerning which his first memoir was published in 1786.
 He continued to pursue this most interesting and difficult branch of
 analysis in a succession of works, for a period of nearly forty years,
 and had finally collected his entire labours upon it in two volumes
 quarto, which he published in 1827, forming a vast treasure of ana
 lytical knowledge. He had hitherto laboured in this field without a
 colleague and without a rival, when two young analysts of singular
 genius and boldness, M. Abel, of Christiania in Norway, and M.                       Ja
  cobi, of Königsberg, announced, almost simultaneously, the discovery
  of propositions which have led to an immense extension of this the
  ory. LeGendre, with a nobleness of character which can only result
 from the most disinterested love of truth, was the first to weicome
 the appearance of these illustrious strangers upon his own territories,
  to make known the full importance of their discoveries, and to de
  velope   all
             their consequences; and although already arrived                        at   an

    M. LeGendre was the author many other works and memoirs,

   M. LeGendre was associated with Méchain and Cassini in the
operations which were instituted in 1787, and finished in 1790, for
the junction of the meridians of Paris and London.      He was one of
the three Members of the Council nominated for the purpose of
introducing the new metrical system into France in 1795, and he
constructed the formulae employed for the calculation of the tables for
the centesimal division of the quadrant. He was nominated, both
during the Imperial and subsequent Government, to various public
employments, chiefly, however, of an honorary nature, requiring no
great sacrifice of time or attention,-a fortunate circumstance, when
it is considered to what important labours the leisure of his long life
appears to have been devoted.
   The next name which I feel called upon to notice is that of FRAN
cisco DE BoBjA GARGAo StockLER, BARON DA VILLA DA PRAIA, a
Lieutenant-General in the Portuguese army, and formerly Secretary
of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon: he was the author of several
Papers in the Transactions of the Lisbon Academy, chiefly on subjects
connected with the developement of functions, and also of a volume
of Poems. In 1795 he published his Methodo dos Limites, and in 1824
his Methodo inverso dos Limites. In this latter work, written late in
life, he adopted the opinions of the well-known Hoene de Wronski,
which led to      its
                   rejection           by
                                  the Academy        Lisbon, upon the report

able notes.. This was followed by his Contributions to Comparative
Anatomy; by his System der vergleichenden Anatomie, which he
did not live to complete; his Tabula Anatomico-pathologica;    his
 Handbuch der pathologischen Anatomie ; his work On Human
 Monsters, and several memoirs relating to this branch of medical
 science, which display a remarkable union of laborious research
 with the most profound and original views relating to the pheno
 mena of animal life. He devoted a great portion of his time to the
 publication of the Archiv für Anatomie und Physiologie, one of the
 most valuable and instructive periodical publications on medical
 and physiological science which appeared in Germany.                 One of his
last works, on the Lymphatic System, which is upon a magnificent
scale, was dedicated to the celebrated Sömmerring, upon the comple
 tion of his fiftieth year from the period of his inauguration as Doctor
in Medicine, as a tribute of respect to one who had been his own
 preceptor, the fellow-student of his father, the follower and pupil of
his grandfather, the intimate friend of his family for three genera
tions, and who was also one of the few of his living rivals in the
 sciences which he cultivated.
     Meckel was only fifty years old at the time of his death: he united
 in a very remarkable degree the power of correct and philosophical
 generalization with the most profound and accurate knowledge of
anatomical details; and though he may have left in his own country
 some who may equal or even surpass him in particular departments
 of human and comparative anatomy or physiology, there is no one
of his countrymen,                if,
                             perhaps, Tiedemann          excepted, who can     be                                  be

and of a great number of Memoirs, chiefly in the Annales du Muséum
d'Histoire Naturelle, which were for the most part descriptive of
new genera and species of plants cultivated in the Jardin du Roi,
the management of which had devolved upon him conjointly with
MM. de Jussieu and Thouin.
    M. Desfontaines was a person of mild and inoffensive manners,
and perfectly free from those feelings of jealousy which tend to pro
voke either opposition or controversy. For a considerable period be
fore his death he laboured under the affliction of total blindness,
and was thus debarred from the continuation of those pursuits which
had constituted at once the delight and the business of his life : and
it was a fortunate circumstance that a visitation of Providence,
which under ordinary circumstances would have produced a spirit
of repining and discontent, was deprived of more than half its bit
terness and severity by the spirit of contentment and resignation
 with which it was met.
    At the conclusion of my Address to you, Gentlemen, last year, I felt
 called upon, at once by my subject and my feelings, to pass from the
 notice of the certain losses which the Society had sustained during
 the preceding year, to one which circumstances at that time rendered
 too probable. The long absence of Captain Ross and his companions,
 the perilous enterprise upon which they were engaged, the fearful
 alternative of shipwreck or famine which seemed their almost ine
 vitable fate, had left few elements for hope, except in those who
 steadily trust in the unlimited resources of Providence to accomplish
 its ends, however remote and wonderful. I rejoice at the unlooked
 for accomplishment of that hope, and I know that you, Gentlemen,
 one and all, will equally participate with me in these feelings.
 Captain Ross and his brave companions were “lost, and are found;”
 and I trust that the enthusiastic welcome which has met them upon
 their return will convince them that the heart of their country is that
  of a parent.
     I forbear, Gentlemen, to mix up other topics with the expression
  of those feelings to which this happy event naturally gives rise, and
 however important may be the contributions to geography or to sci
  ence which these perilous and painful adventures may have pro
  duced, I consider them, in the present condition of my feelings, but
  as dust in the balance, when compared with the knowledge of the
  important fact of the recovery of our long lost brethren.
     Permit me then, Gentlemen, in your name as well as in my own,
                                   I
  to offer to Captain Ross, whom rejoice to see amongst us, our most
  cordial congratulations upon his happy return, and to express our
  hope that the sympathy and respect of his countrymen which he has
  already experienced, and which,    I  trust, he will retain for the re
  mainder of his days, will form one of the best compensations for the
  long sufferings which he has endured, and for the incomplete suc
  cess of an enterprise presenting difficulties from the certain operation
  of the laws of the physical world, which not merely baffle, but al
  most annihilate, the powers of the bravest, the strongest, and the
  most persevering of men.

THE Secretary reported,      on the part of the Council, that they had
received an   application from the Lords of the Treasury, for their opi
nion  respecting the construction and mode of applying an instrument
for ascertaining and charging the duty on spirits: in compliance with
which they appointed a Committee to conduct the investigations re
quired for that purpose.     The Committee, after bestowing consider
able labour and   pains  on this subject, agreed in a Report, which was
adopted by the Council, and transmitted to the Lords of the Treasury,
and for which they have received their thanks, for the labour and at
tention they have given to this subject. They have lately also received
an intimation from the Treasury, that their further assistance will be
requested to superintend, examine, and assist in the construction of
the instruments and tables which will be required.
  The Treasurer made the following statements with respect to the
Number of Fellows, the State of the Finances, and the Receipts and
Payments of the Society during the preceding year.
   At   the last Anniversary, the Society consisted   of 748 Members;
of whom     there were,
                 11   Royal Personages,
                 45 Foreign Members, and
                692 Home Members.
Since that date, there have died,
              20 on the Home List, and
               4 on the Foreign List,
and there have been admitted,
              17 on the Home List, with
                1 re-admission, and
               5 on the Foreign List. Of whom
                8 have compounded for life, and
              10 have engaged to pay the Annnal Subscription of    41.
The Society therefore now consists of,
                 11   Royal Personages,
                46 Foreign Members, and
               690 Home Members;
making a total of 747 Members; of whom
               595 have compounded for life,
                       403 at the rate of 27 l. 6s.
                       192 at the rate of 40l. 0s.
                 44 are subject to an annual payment of 21.12s.
                 51 are subject to an annual payment of    41.

       The Disburse MENTs of the Society may be classed under two heads:
              1. Those which are ordinary; and
              2. Those which are extraordinary, and not                      likely to recur.

    The annual expense of printing the Philosophical Transactions has
    been, on an average of the last five years, £894, (without including
    the charges for stitching and for advertisements,) viz.

    These expenses attending their publication vary, of course, very much,
    according to the number of pages, the quantity of engravings, and
    the nature of the Papers, included in each volume.
       Besides these ordinary disbursements, there is at present the ex
    pense of the Catalogue, which will probably cost the Society not less
    than £1000, including the expense of printing; and, for the present
    year, the cost of the Fluid-Lens Telescope (£157 10s.), and print
    ing the Abstracts (£583 6s. 9d.), against the latter of which sum
     £141 18s. 6d. has been already received.

    also whatever may be received from the Admission Fees or Com

    have been, on an average of the last five years, twenty-six, which
    would give of course £260 per annum for Admission Fees of £10
    each; and the average number of Members who have compounded
    for Annual Contributions, during the same period, being twenty-one,
    the amount of Compositions at £40 each would be £840,-making a
    mean total of £1 100 per annum for Admission Fees and Composi
    tions.   But it being now optional for Members to compound or not
    for Annual Payments, the Compositions (of which there have been
    only seven during the past year,) will most probably go on consider

                                                                             237

of the present annual subscription of £4 is come into full operation,
a temporary inconvenience will be experienced from this circum
stance, as well as from the falling off in the Compositions".
   Besides these sources of Income, there are other sums invested in
the Funds; namely,
                                                                      #.           s.     d.

            The Donation Fund, 3820 19 3 Three per Cent. Consols.
of which the dividends are not applicable to the general expenses
of the Society, but must be disposed of according to the intention of
the respective donors.
  The clear annual Income, therefore, which may for some time be
expected,—without taking into consideration whatever may be re
ceived on account of the Admission Fees or Compositions of new
Members,     may be considered as only £1400; and the probable
annual amount of Ordinary Expenses as £2000".

thus:

    1. The great Nebula in Orion.—This            was now three hours and a
quarter over the meridian, and yet it was seen in great beauty and
distinctness under the whole aperture, with eyepieces 90 and 150.
The trapezium was examined very closely with 250 and 400, which
last it bore better than it had yet done; but only four stars were-
visible.
    2. o. Orionis.--All the stars of this group were perceptible under
the power 250, but they had the appearance of being seen in a
second-rate reflector; so that I know not how a micrometer would
work upon this instrument.
    3. Venus-The crescent which this planet now forms was better
seen than heretofore, but an unseemly quantity of light still attended
it; and under the higher powers the colours were intolerable. When,
however, the focus of power 90 was nicely adjusted, and the planet
brought exactly into the centre of the field, it was a beautiful object,
despite of a secondary spectrum.            The aperture was reduced, and      I
did not find, either now or on other occasions, that this sensibly af
fected the ocular focus.
    4. y Leonis-This brilliant object was distinctly seen, and the dark
vacancy between the stars increased more than did the spurious discs,
 while the magnifying powers were being raised, though much loose
light and irradiations were thereby produced. And it is singular that
 the separation was improved by my placing a central disc of card
 paper, two inches in diameter, on the outer lens.
    5. Messier's 46th Nebula.-This was very fairly resolved into stars,
 and better with the whole than the reduced aperture.              Eyepiece 90
 showed it easily, but the higher powers gave it a very turbid appear
 ance.    The preceding cluster was brilliant.                                 -
    6. a Leonis.-This star had a bunch of           disagreeable  rays shooting
 from it; and the light, when under the best adjustment I could give
 the focus, was curiously thrown to the northward. I was able, how
 ever, to raise a tolerable disc, and the small star at a little distance
 from Regulus was unusually distinct.
    7. 24 Comae Beren.—I pointed to this remarkably pretty object to
 test the colours, and very readily perceived the large star to be of a
 bright orange colour, and the small a sea-green. This was one of the
 best sights I had yet had, and on the whole was satisfactory.
    8.    Leonis.--This, though a very close and unequal double star,
 was well shown, yet at times the stray light would obscure the com
 panion. The large star was fairly figured, and the small seemed about
 the 10th magnitude, and of a greenish hue.             It formed a fine test.
    9. Saturn.—I had a good trial of this planet; and though the
 powers 90, 150 and 250 were borne, the disc was certainly not well

                                                   252
defined.  The ring is still a mere bar lying across the equator : it
was very well shown, as were also three satellites. When I applied
the power 400, the whole field was strewed with harsh light.
   10. y Virginis.—This interesting star, though now so exceedingly
close, was made double with 250, and very well shown; but with 400
there was great tremor and irradiation, so that the discs were often
confused into one.
    Saturday, March 30, 1833.—After a continuance of bad weather
for several days, it cleared off a little; but in the mean time I had
missed the favourable phase of the moon, for which I had been wait
ing. I therefore closed my examinations with the following one :
    The Sun.-From the extreme volatility of the sulphuret of carbon,
I was fearful of        its
                          expansion, and therefore had not yet turned the
telescope upon the sun, lest the condensation               the solar rays,
                                                                        of       the                at
place where they traverse the fluid, should prove too much for the
lenses.     But    on mentioning this apprehension              Professor Barlow,
                                                                             to
that gentleman assured me that              exposurean        from five  of  ten mi            to
 nutes could     do   no
                       mischief.     therefore this day reduced the aperture
                                       I
to  three inches, and directed the instrument               the solar disc, when,
                                                                        to
sweeping over the luminary for about three minutes,                  found the sur it,
face was quite clear         spots.
                                of     On turning from                            I I

eye-tube, and looking         the fluid, perceived that the bubble was con
                                at
 siderably diminished, but not           much  so     had expected.

    These are the only experiments            have been able
                                                    I                    make; and   to

 fluid object-glass.    I should also observe, that the magnifying powers
of   both the instruments were equally matched, and their apertures
 were generally proportioned              nearly six inches: the eyepieces
                                               to

   From the result     my observations,

 deviate from the course which had previously been always pursued

of the moon and of the planets, and also in that of a greater rapidity
of approximation by the improvements introduced in these methods.
   Laplace, in the Mécanique Céleste, alludes to an equation of long
period, of which the argument is twice the longitude of the moon's
node, plus the longitude of her perigee, minus three times the longi
tude of the sun's perigee ; and M. Poisson has shown that the co
efficient of the corresponding argument in the development of the
disturbing function equals zero: but the author shows that the same
result may be arrived at very simply, by means of the method of de
veloping the variation of the disturbing function.

     A                          “On the Position of the North Mag
         paper was read, entitled,
netic Pole.”   By Commander James Clark Ross, R.N., F.R.S.
   The author remarks that the discordances in former observations
made with a view to determine the position of the magnetic pole,
have arisen partly from the irregularity of distribution in the earth
of the substances which exert magnetic power, and partly from the
great distances from the magnetic poles at which these observations
have been made.     The latter cause of uncertainty has been now, in
a great measure, removed, by the numerous and accurate observations
made during the late arctic expeditions. The object of the present
paper is to put on record those which were made in the last voyage
of Captain Ross, in which a spot was reached corresponding to the
true north magnetic pole on the surface of the earth. The nature of
the instruments, and the difficulties encountered in their practical
employment, under the circumstances of theexpedition, arefully stated.
Having arrived, on the 1st of June, at north latitude 70° 5' 17", and
west longitude 96° 45'48", the horizontal magnetic needle exhibited
no determinate directive tendency, and the dipping needle was within
a minute of the vertical position, a quantity which may be supposed
to come within the limits of the errors of observation ; hence the
author concludes that this spot may be considered as the true mag
netic pole, or as a very near approximation to        far,      it,

correct. Several tide tables for London are annually published; but
they vary considerably from one another. The method generally
practised in England for the construction of tide tables for other
places, has been to add or subtract some constant quantity, according
to the place, assuming as a basis the tide tables either of London or
of Liverpool; but this assumption of a constant difference is shown
by the author to be, in various instances, incorrect. Much, therefore,
remains to be done, before we can hope to arrive at a scientific solu
tion of this problem.
    The author then proceeds to examine the empirical laws of the
tides of the port of London, deducible from the records of the nine
teen years of observations which have been discussed by Mr. Dessiou,
under the direction of Mr. Lubbock, and which include 13,073 ob
servations. His first object is to determine the manner in which the
time of high-water is affected by the following conditions, namely, the
right ascensions, declinations and parallaxes of the sun and moon ;
for which purpose he considers at some length, first, the establish
ment; secondly, the semimenstrual inequality; thirdly, the correc
tions for lunar parallax ; fourthly, the lunar declination; and lastly,
the solar parallax and declination. He next discusses the empirical
laws of the height of high-water: which he observes will be affected
in the same manner as the periods of the tides, by a semimenstrual
 inequality, by corrections for lunar parallax and declination, and by
 a solar correction; and concludes by giving a formula for computa
 tion which comprehends                    all
                                    these elements.          He then enters into                                             a
 comparison        of
                    the results thus obtained with the theory                    Daniel                           of

   The reading of Mr. Faraday's papers was resumed and concluded.
   “Experimental Researches in Electricity.—Sixth and Seventh Se
ries.” By Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., Fullerian Professor
of Chemistry in the Royal Institution of Great Britain.
   In the course of his experimental investigation of a general and
important law of electro-chemical action, which required the accurate
measurement of the gases evolved during the decomposition of water
and other substances, the author was led to the detection of a curious
effect, which had never been previously noticed, and of which the
knowledge, had he before possessed     it,
                                         would have prevented many
of  the errors and inconsistencies occurring        in
                                                 the conclusions    he   at
first deduced from his earlier experiments.     The phenomenon ob
served was the gradual recombination         byof
                                          elements which had been
previously separated from each other     voltaic action.    This hap
pened when, after water had been decomposed              by
                                                   voltaic electricity,
the mixed  gases resulting from such decomposition  were left  in con

                                         260
tact with the platina wires or plates, which had acted as poles; for
under these circumstances they gradually diminished in volume, water
was reproduced, and at last the whole of the gases disappeared.      On
inquiring into the cause of this reunion of the elements of water, the
author found that it was occasioned principally by the action of the
piece of platina, which had served for the positive pole; and also that
the same piece of platina would produce a similar effect on a mixture
of oxygen and hydrogen gases obtained by other and more ordinary
kinds of chemical action.     By closer examination, it was ascertained
that the platina, which had been the negative pole, could produce the
same effect.    Finally, it was found that the only condition requisite
for rendering   the pieces of platina effective in this recombination of
oxygen and hydrogen is their being perfectly clean, and that ordinary
mechanical processes of cleaning are quite sufficient for bringing them
into that condition, without the use of the battery. Plates of platina,
cleaned by means of a cork, with a little emery and water, or dilute
sulphuric acid, were rendered very active; but they acquired the
greatest power when first heated in a strong solution of caustic alkali,
then dipped in water to wash off the alkali, next dipped in hot strong
oil of vitriol, and finally left for ten or fifteen minutes in distilled
water.    Plates thus prepared, placed in tubes containing mixtures of
oxygen and hydrogen gases, determined the gradual combination of
their elements: the effect was at first slow, but became by degrees
more rapid; and heat was evolved to such a degree, indeed, as fre
quently to give rise to ignition and explosion.
   The author regards this phenomenon as of the same kind as that
discovered by Davy in the glowing platina; that observed by Döbe
reiner in spongy platina, acting on a jet of hydrogen gas in atmo
spheric air; and those so well experimented on by MM. Dulong and
Thenard.     In discussing the theory of these remarkable effects, the
author advances some new views of the conditions of elasticity at the
exterior of a mass of gaseous matter confined by solid surfaces. The
elasticity of gases he considers as being dependent on the mutual ac
tion of the particles, especially of those which are contiguous to each
other; but this reciprocity of condition is wanting on the sides of the
exterior particles which are next to the solid substance.           Then, rea
soning on the principle established by Dalton, that the particles of
different gases are indifferent to one another, so that those of one gas
may come within almost any distance of those of another gas, what
ever may be the respective degrees of tension in each gas among the
                 of its
particles of       own kind,   heconcludes that the particles           gas,

by the author, for exactly measuring electric currents, and which he
terms the volta-electrometer.   The current to be measured is made
to  pass through   water acidulated by sulphuric acid, and the gases
evolved  by            its
                 decomposition   are collected and measured, thereby

acid; the results showing, that not only the quantity of that acid de
composed is constant for a constant quantity of electricity, but that,
when it is compared with water, by making one current of electricity
pass through both substances, the quantities of each that are decom
posed are very exactly the respective chemical equivalents of those
bodies. The same current, for example, which can decompose nine
parts by weight of water, can decompose thirty-seven parts by weight
of muriatic acid, these numbers being respectively the chemical equi
valents of those substances, as deduced from the phenomena of ordi
nary chemical action.
   Cases of decomposition are then produced, in which bodies ren
dered fluid by heat, as oxides, chlorides, iodides, &c., are decomposed
by the electric current, but still in conformity with the law of con
stancy of chemical action. Thus the current which could decompose
an equivalent of water, could also decompose equivalents of muriatic
acid, of proto-chloride of tin, of iodide of lead, of oxide of lead, and
of many other bodies, notwithstanding the greatest differences in their
temperature, in the size of the poles, and in other circumstances; and
even changes in the chemical nature of the poles or electrodes, and
in their affinities for the evolved bodies, occasioned no change in the
quantity of the body decomposed.
   The author proceeds, in the last place, to consider a very important
question with relation to chemical affinity, and the whole theory of
electro-chemical action, namely, the absolute quantity of electricity
associated with the particles or atoms of matter.       This quantity he
considers as precisely the same with that which is required to sepa
rate them from their combination with other particles when subjected
to electrolytic action, and he brings many experiments to bear upon
this point; describing one, in particular, in which the chemical action
of 32:5 parts of zinc, arranged as a voltaic battery, was able to evolve
a current of electricity capable of decomposing and transferring the
elements of 9 grains of water, being the full equivalent of that num
ber. The relation of electricity, thus evolved, to that of the common
electric machine is pointed out in a general way, and the enormous
superiority as to quantity, in the former mode of action, is insisted
upon. In conclusion, the author refers to a statement which he has
made in the third series of these researches, in which he expresses his
belief that the magnetic action of a given quantity of electricity is also
definite; and he is now more confident than ever that this view will
be fully confirmed by future experiment.

    HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF SUSSEX, K.G.,
                                      President, in the Chair.
     The reading of Dr. Philip's paper was resumed and concluded.
  The object of the present paper, which the author intends as a
sequel to those he has lately presented to the Society, and which
have been published in the Philosophical Transactions, is to investi
gate the operation of the different causes of death, and the mode in
which the several powers of the living system influence each other
during the period of their decline. In the more perfect animals, he
observes, there are three distinct classes of functions, namely, the sen
sorial, the nervous and the muscular, which have no direct depend
ence on each other, although they are linked together by the con
nexions of the organs in which they reside; the consequence of which
is,                       any one class
                                 by                              less im                               or

   that the cessation                       functions     more                          is
mediately followed                 of
                        the destruction     the rest. What     commonly                           is
called death consists         the extinction
                                     in             the sensorial functions only;

is,  the cessation       all the functions, and which occurs

    The author enters into       inquiry into the correction due

     The author agrees with                    Mr. Whewell              in    the remark, that the theory

         motions of the moon and planets presented about a century ago;
         and unless considerable exertions be made, it may so continue for
         many years to come. The tables of the planets have acquired their
         present accuracy only through the liberal encouragement of learned
         bodies, and of some of the governments of Europe; nor can tables of
         the tides, adapted to the present state of science, be now constructed,
         unless very considerable expense be incurred, and immense labour
         bestowed.
            The results of numerous observations on the influence of the wind
         on the tides in the River Thames, are stated ; and the author observes,
         that this is a subject of considerable importance as regards the accu
         racy of which tide predictions are susceptible.

   The application of a concave achromatic lens to the wired micro
meter of a telescope, arose out of the series of trials that were made
for the purpose of correcting the aberrations of the eye-glasses applied
to the telescope constructed by the author for the Royal Society, with
a fluid-correcting lens, on the plan suggested by Professor Barlow.
The concave lens, being interposed between the object-glass and the
eye-glass, and being at the same time achromatic, combines the ad
vantages of doubling the magnifying power, without a corresponding
diminution of light, and without altering the apparent distances of
the threads of the micrometer.     The results of the trials made with
telescopes to which this addition was made, are given in a letter to
the author from the Rev. W. R. Dawes, of Ormskirk; from which it
appears that Mr. Dollond's method was attended with complete suc
cess.   Mr. Dawes states, that, in order to put                     its

circulating fluids in these animals as the great agent both in the ab
sorption and the growth of parts, and throws out the suggestion,
that as it flows into the stomach, it may also act as a solvent to the
food received into that cavity. The particles which exist in these fluids
show their analogy to those in the blood of the higher animals on the
one hand, and to those in the sap of vegetables on the other: some
appear to be derived from the digested food, and others from the melt
ing down of parts absorbed. In these polypi the author never saw the
least appearance of cilia, or of currents in the surrounding water,
which are so frequently met with in other tribes of zoophytes.
    The latter part of the paper is occupied by the account which the
author gives of his various observations, first, on Ascidia, of which he
enters into an anatomical description; secondly, on the internal cur
rents of water, permeating the branchial sacs, and determined by the
vibratory movements of cilia which are seen in that animal; and,
 thirdly, on the alternations in the course of the circulation of the
blood in the vessels, which at one time flows in one direction, and,
after a certain interval, takes the contrary course; so that the same
vessel which at one time performs the function of an artery, performs,
at another, that of a vein.    This phenomenon of alternate currents,
like that in the  Sertularia, was met with in every specimen of Ascidiae
which was examined by the author, and also in a Polyclinium.
    The paper concludes with several observations on Flustra, from
 which, as far as relates to the circulation of currents, the author was
 led to results in many respects analogous to the preceding.
   A  paper was then read, entitled, “On the Theory of the Moon.”
By  J. W. Lubbock, Esq., W.P. and Treasurer of the Royal Society.
  The author, adverting to the appearance of M. Plana's admirable
work entitled Théorie du Mouvement de la Lune, enters into a com
parison of the analytical methods employed by that author and M.
Damoiseau, and points out some differences in the numerical values
of the coefficients of some of the arguments in the expression for the
true longitude of the moon in terms of her mean longitude. He then
prosecutes the subject by a series of analytical investigations, which
are not susceptible of abridgement, but from which he obtains formulae
which do not quite agree with those of M. Plana.
   A paper was also read, entitled, “Some Suggestions relative to the
best method of employing the new Zenith Telescope lately erected at
the Royal Observatory.”    By John Pond, Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer
Royal.
  During the observations inade by the author, in the course of last
summer, with the new zenith telescope lately erected at the Royal
Observatory, for the purpose of measuring the zenith distance of
y Draconis, it occurred to the author to avail himself of subsidiary
observations on another star, of about the fifth magnitude, which has
nearly the same zenith distance towards the south that y Draconis
has towards the north, and which passes the meridian between 20
and 30 minutes, in time, after     The angular distance between the
                                 it.

              A paper was also read, entitled, “Observations on the Motions of
           Shingle Beaches.” By Henry R. Palmer, Esq., F.R.S.
              The author states that the object of his inquiries is limited to the
** *** *
** *       collection of such facts as may assist in establishing practical rules
           for controlling the motions of the beach, with a view, on the one hand,
           to the preservation of clear channels where such are wanted, and on
           the other, to the obtaining accumulations of shingles in situations
           where they may be useful.       He considers the actions of the sea on
           the loose pebbles as of three kinds; the first, which he terms the ac
           cumulative action, heaps up or accumulates the pebbles against the
           shore; the second, or the destructive action, disturbs and breaks down
           the accumulations previously made; and the third, or progressive ac
           tion, carries the pebbles forwards in a horizontal direction. The causes
           of these actions are referable to two kinds of forces; the one being that
           of the current, or the motion of the general body of the water in the
           ebbing and flowing of the tides; and the other that of the waves, or
           that undulating motion given to the water by the action of the winds
           upon   it.
              He adduces many facts which show that                    not,    it generally

           believed, the currents which move the pebbles along the coast, the
           real agent being the force          the waves, the direction
                                                  of                           which     de           of

           chiefly made,     isfrom the westward.         Every breaker drives before                                    it

                                                  cases, the finer particles descend the
           whole distance with the        returning    breaker, unless accidentally de
           posited     in
                        some   interstice;   but the  larger  pebbles return only       part                     a

           deposited; and this constitutes the destructive action.              This latter

           down the pebbles, and deposit them below the general surface. The

                                         these effects, from what          has observed    he                            in

    On these principles, the author thinks it will readily appear why
 the various attempts hitherto made to divert the motion of the shin.
 gles to a distance from the general line of the shore, both at Dover
 and at Folkstone, have invariably failed; and he recommends, for
 the prevention of the evil of accumulation, the adoption of a more
 general system of management along the coast, in preference to the
 resorting to particular devices adapted exclusively to each particular
 case.                                                  -

        For the purpose of determining       several questions relative to the
forces exerted by bodies in different states of electricity, the author
contrived an electroscope of peculiar construction, and also an elec
 trometer, both of which he minutely describes; and in order to ob

 The author proposes to distinguish the terms tension and intensity, as
 applied to electricity; expressing by the first, the actual elastic force
 of a given quantity, accumulated in a given space; and by the second,
 the action of that part which is in a state of freedom, and which is in
 dicated by             its   effects        on     the electrometer.

gestive organs, being evidently a provision                                 for their early or prema
ture exercise.
   From the close resemblance in the structures of the ovary and Fal
lopian tubes of the kanguroo with those of ordinary mammalia, and
from the circumstance of the young being nourished, after birth, by a
secretion from mammary glands, the author concludes that the ovu
lum in the former animal quits the ovisac in a condition correspond
ing to that in the latter class, and increases in a similar manner as it
descends to the uterus.     But as there is no formation of a placenta,
it   remains to be determined                    how the aeration                 of the         foetal   blood      is
effected: this, however, probably takes place through the chorion,
although this membrane is not vascular, to an extent sufficient for the
purposes of the vital functions of a foetus so imperfect, and whose
uterine existence is of such short duration, as they are in this animal.
Reasons are given, which render it probable that in the Marsupiata an
allantois and umbilical arteries are developed at a later period of
gestation, corresponding in this respect to the foetal condition of the
Batrachian reptiles, and corroborating the views entertained by the
author, that the former family are essentially ovo-viviparous.
   The author next proceeds to investigate the structure and condition
                                                                                                          its its

   The principal object of this paper is to prove that most combustible
bodies undergo a kind of combustion, attended with light and heat,
at a temperature considerably below that usually assigned as their
point of ignition.     This fact has been already noticed with regard to
phosphorus and sulphur; and the pale blue flame produced in the
vapour of ether by a hot palladium or platina wire, before the wire
itself becomes vividly ignited, is another instance of the same general

quiries that both sensibility and motion belong         the cerebrum; that              to
two columns descend from each        hemisphere;    that one      these, the                       of

                        to             and that the other, which from
                                                        ;

                               is                    the posterior roots         to
the  spinal  nerves,  and      the sensitive root
                                             to        the fifth nerve, and          of
is the column for sensation.     He further shows that the columns for
motion, which come from different sides      the cerebrum, join and        of
decussate      the medulla oblongata; that the columns
                   in                                       sensation                                  of
also join and decussate      the medulla oblongata; and lastly, that

very close resemblance    one  another, to  much                   as                        as
pansions      both are widely extended
                   of                     the hemispheres;    for they in
pass     through similar bodies towards the base                                  of     the brain, and both

concentrate and decussate in the same manner; thus agreeing in
every respect, except in the nervous filaments to which they give
origin. Hence he explains the phenomena of the loss of sensibility
as well as the power of motion of one side of the body, consequent
on injuries       of the other side of the brain.

General Application of the Negative Achromatic Lens to Telescopes
and Eyepieces of every description." By Peter Barlow, Esq., F.R.S.
  This paper is intended as a more full illustration of the principles
on which the negative achromatic lens is constructed and applied, than
has been given in the extract from the author's letter to Mr. Dollond,
contained in the paper of the latter, lately read to the Society, on his
ingenious application of that lens to the micrometer eyepiece. The

 opinion that the primary colours composing white light are not
             as                          by                                                                  by

blue, as imagined by Brewster, but red, green, and violet; the
first and last forming the terminal parts of the spectrum, and the
green occupying an intermediate         position ; and the various tints
which intervene    being  the result of superpositions, in various quan
tities, of these respective primary colours. He pursues the conse
quences of this hypothesis, applying it to a great variety of forms of
experiment, not only by the direct observation of beams of refracted
light, but by viewing the prismatic spectrum through different media,
capable of absorbing each of the primitive colours in different degrees:
and he finds the results to accord exactly with the hypothesis he pro
poses, and on which he therefore concludes that their true explanation
must be founded.       He conceives that the errors of preceding experi
mentalists have arisen from their neglecting to take into account the
effects of diffraction, which introduces considerable confusion into the
results.
   A paper was also read, entitled, “An Investigation of the Laws
which govern the Motion of Steam-Wessels, deduced from expe
riment.”     By P. W. Barlow, Esq. Civil Engineer. Communicated
by Dr. Roget, Sec. R.S.
   The author commences with the description of a paddle-wheel for
steam-vessels, of a new construction, in which the floats are made to
enter and leave the water nearly in a vertical position. He then inves
tigates several formulae adapted to the calculation of the forces and
velocities arising from this form of the apparatus; and gives an ac
count of the results of various experiments made on                efficiency                    its                     as

this are not provided for in the theory of Clairaut, which tacitly as
sumes that the forces urging the interior particles are derived from
the forces at the upper surface, merely by changing the co-ordinates

forces acting on the interior particles are not deducible, in the manner
supposed, from the forces at the surface.

                      FRANCIS BAILY, Esq., Vice-President, in                  the Chair.
                The reading of Mr. Faraday's Eighth Series of Experimental                       Re
             searches in Electricity was resumed and concluded.
                This series is devoted to an investigation of the source, character
             and conditions of the electricity of the voltaic instrument, and is                 di
             vided into five parts. In the first part, simple voltaic circles are con
             sidered ; and at the outset, the great question of “whether the elec
             tricity is due to contact or chemical action ?" is investigated and de
             cided by apparently very conclusive evidence in favour of the latter.
             One principal experiment in favour of this decision is the following:
             A plate of zinc and a plate of platina were prepared; one end of each
             of these was put into a vessel containing a little dilute sulphuric acid
             or sulpho-nitric acid, and between the other ends was placed a piece
             of bibulous paper moistened in a solution of iodide of potassium: the
             two plates did not touch each other anywhere, but still the action of
             the end at the one extremity was able to induce the electro-chemica.
             decomposition of the iodide of potassium at the other. That this de
             composition was due to the chemical action of the acid was proved by
             removing the latter; for then the decomposition ceased. It was also
             farther proved by the appearance of the iodine against the platina;
             for it went there in consequence of the passage of a current (induced
             by the action of the acid) having the opposite direction to that which
             the solution of iodide would have produced had it been the only- ex
             citing body, and metallic contact had been allowed.
                The opposition of the chemical affinities at the two places where
             the acid and the solution of the iodide are placed, is shown when the
             metal plates are allowed to touch each other in the middle; for then
             two opposite electric currents are produced, but that occasioned by
             the acid is the stronger. This opposition is farther shown in the
             manner in which the weaker set of affinities are overcome by the
             stronger (that   is,
                               those      of
                                         the iodide and zinc              by     of

             zinc);  and this dependence and relation        the two explains
                                                                    of             once     at

                                                        if         iodide of       of

                                                                 those pieces           of
                                                                                  metal

the powers active in the acid are more free to act, produce a stronger
current, and effect decomposition more freely.
    The chemical actions at the opposite ends of the metallic arrange
ment are so strongly associated and related, that in the most perfect
form of experiment, action cannot occur at either end without also
taking place at the other extremity to an exactly equivalent amount.
This is considered by the author as the most convincing proof that in
the voltaic pile the chemical and electric action are the same; that
                                                                                                                       is,

gives, cause that no action take place, unless a current be formed and
the hydrogen be transferred to a distance, whilst the forces circulate
in what is called the electric current.  Placing the origin of the cur
rent in the chemical action, which yet could be thus virtually restrained
unless the circuit was completed, the author expected to find a state
of tension in the chemical or electrical forces before metallic contact
was made or the circuit perfect, and was able at last to prove this most
fully by obtaining an electric spark between two plates of different
metals immersed in acid before they came in contact. This fact, with
the former one of decomposition, fully proved that contact was not
necessary to the production of the electricity in the voltaic pile.
   The second part of this memoir contains an investigation of the fol
lowing important points : namely, whether electrolytes could resist
the action of an electric current if below a certain intensity; whether
the intensity at which an electric current might cease to act would be
the same for              all
                   bodies; and also whether the electrolytes, when thus
resisting decomposition, would conduct the electricity             metal

chemical action at one pair of plates cannot pass by another pair ex
cept an equal chemical action take place there; and as the chemical
and electrical action are always equivalent, the equal chemical action
at the second pair will do no more than suffice to transfer forwards the
forces disturbed at the first pair, and can add nothing to their quan
tity: but they can add to their intensity, and in fact the recurrence
of a second chemical action at the second pair of plates has exactly
the same effect as would be produced by a more intense chemical ac
tion at the first pair.   In this way it is that numbers of plates give

 and the author states his reasons for believing that the branchial fila
 ments are the principal absorbing organs, the materials they receive
 being chiefly employed in the construction of the electrical organs,
 while those which enter into the composition of the body generally
 are absorbed by the general surface of the foetus.   The author is led,
 from his researches, to the conclusion that the mode of reproduction
 in the Torpedo is intermediate between the viviparous and the ovo
 viviparous.

   4. “Appendix to a former Paper on Human Osteology.” By Walter
Adam, M.D. Communicated by Dr. Prout, F.R.S.
   This appendix contains linear representations of various dimen
sions of the bones of the human body, both male and female, with a
view to facilitate the comparison of the human frame with that of
other animals, and reduce it to definite laws. The author states that
many of the rectilinear dimensions of human bones appear to be mul
tiples of one unit, namely, the breadth of the cranium directly over
the external passage of the ear; a dimension which he has found to
be the most invariable in the body.       No division of that dimension
was found by him to measure the other dimensions so accurately as
that by seven, or      multiples. its                     Of

 of the restoration of the electrical equilibrium by the intervention of
  the frozen particles, which being imperfect conductors, become lumi
  nous while transmitting this electricity.     In tropical and temperate
  climates this phenomenon does not      occur,  because the electric equi
  librium is restored by means of aqueous vapours, a process which
  often gives rise to thunder and lightning, but never to the Aurora
  Borealis; the latter being peculiar to clear, cold and dry weather.
     8. “Théorie Balistique.”     Par M. Le Comte de Prédaval. Com
  municated by Dr. Roget, Sec. R.S.
     The author inquires into the influence which he conceives the fol
 lowing circumstances may have on the path of a projectile on the
 surface of the earth; namely, first, the direction of the line of pro
jection relatively to the meridian or cardinal points; secondly, the
 latitude of the place ; and thirdly, the barometric conditions of the
 atmosphere.
     9. “On the   Atmospheric Tides and Meteorology of Dukhun, in the
 East Indies.”     By Lieut.-Colonel W. H. Sykes, F.R.S.
     The author premises detailed descriptions of the various instru
 ments used in the meteorological observations recorded in this paper,
 and of the methods employed in obtaining his results; of which the
 great features are the barometrical indications of diurnal and noc
 turnal atmospheric tides, embracing two maxima and two minima in
 the twenty-four hours. The following are the chief topics noticed in
 the paper, and the principal facts established by these inquiries:
 namely, l. The removal of the doubts entertained by Humboldt,
founded on the authority of Horsburgh, of the suspension of the at
 mospheric tides during the monsoon in Western India; the existence
 of the four atmospheric tides already mentioned, and their occurrence
 within the same limiting hours as in America and Europe; the greatest
 mean diurnal oscillations in Dukhun taking place in the coldest
 months, and the smallest in the damp months; whilst at Madras,
 the smallest oscillations are in the hottest months, and in Europe it
 is supposed that the smallest oscillations are in the coldest months.
 2. The regular diurnal and nocturnal occurrence of the tides,
without a single case of interversion, whatever may be the thermo
metric or hydrometric indications, or the state of the weather; storms
and hurricanes only modifying, but not interrupting them.          3. The
anomalous fact of the mean diurnal oscillations being greater at
Poona, at an elevation of 1823 feet, than at the level of the sea, in a
lower latitude, at Madras. 4. The fact of the diurnal tides, at a
higher elevation than Poona, being less, whilst the nocturnal tides
are greater than at Poona; and the seasons apparently not affecting
the limiting hours of the tides.      5. The maximum mean pressure
of the atmosphere being greatest in December and January; then
gradually diminishing until July and August; and subsequently          in
creasing to the coldest months.         6. The very trifling diurnal and
annual oscillations compared with those of extra-tropical climates.
7. The annual range of the thermometer being less in Dukhun

                                 297
than in Europe, but the diurnal range much greater; the maximum
mean temperature occurring in April and May, and gradually de
clining until December and January; and the observed mean tempe
rature of places on the continent of India being much higher than
the calculated mean temperature according to Meyer's formula.
8. The mean annual dew-point being higher at half-past nine o'clock
than either at sunrise or at four in the afternoon ; the dew-point
being highest during the monsoons, and lowest during the cold months,
and varying considerably within very short distances; being, for ex
ample, remarkably contrasted in Bombay and Dukhun; and the fre
quent occurrence of dew quite locally and under anomalous circum
stances. 9. The amount of rain in Dukhun being only 20 per cent.
of that falling in Bombay, 90 or 100 miles to the westward. 10. The
wind being principally from the west and east, and rarely from the
opposite quarters.   11. The great abundance of electricity under cer
 tain circumstances., 12. The rare occurrence of fogs. 13. The great
amount of solar radiation ; and lastly, the singular opacity of the
 atmosphere during hot weather, giving rise occasionally to the mirage.
A variety of tables containing the records of meteorological obser
vations, with instruments, accompany the paper.
  10. “On the Ova of the Ornithorhynchus paradorus.” By Richard
Owen, Esq. Communicated by W. Clift, Esq., F.R.S.
 The author, in this paper, has prosecuted more immediately and
more minutely than in his former communication, the inquiry into the
structure of the ovary of the Ornithorhynchus, with a view to determine
its exact relations with that of the normal Mammalia, and of the ovi
parous Vertebrata.    He has obtained from this investigation the full
confirmation of the truth of the opinion he had previously formed, that
lactation might coexist with a mode of generation essentially similar
to that of the Viper and Salamander; and this fact has been further
established by the subsequent examination which he has made of the
uterine foetus of the Kangaroo.
   The author traces the regular gradation which obtains in different
orders of Mammalia in which true viviparous or placental generation
takes place, towards the ovo-viviparous or oviparous modes, in which
the exterior covering of the ovum never becomes vascular, and shows
 that the Ornithorhynchus constitutes a connecting link in this chain.
   Drawings illustrative of the anatomical descriptions of the parts
 examined by the author accompany the paper.

 during a Voyage from England to New South Wales.” By James
 Dunlop, Esq. Communicated by Capt. Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S.
    This paper contains a very numerous and uninterrupted series of
 magnetical observations, made in the circumstances stated in the title,
 and extending about 180 degrees in longitude and 100 degrees in
 latitude. The apparatus, of which a detailed description is given, was
 suspended from the roof of the cabin, and no alteration was made in
 its suspension from the beginning  tothe end  ofthe voyage.

JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK,                     Esq., M.A.,              V.P.   and Treasurer,
                                   in the Chair.
  A paper     was read, entitled,        “On
                                     the Determination of the Terms
in the disturbing Function of the fourth Order,       as regards the
Eccentricities and Inclinations which give rise to secular inequali
ties.”   By.  J.W. Lubbock, Esq., V.P. and Treas. R.S.
   The author  observes, that the magnitude of the terms of the fourth
order in the disturbing function, relating to the inclinations, in the
theory of the secular inequalities of the planets, does not admit of
being estimated a priori; and consequently the amount of error
which may arise from neglecting them cannot be appreciated.       The
object of the present investigation is to ascertain the analytical ex
pressions of these terms; and the method adopted for this purpose
is derived from principles already explained by the author in a for
mer paper.    He has bestowed great pains in putting these expres
sions into the simplest form of which they are susceptible; and has
finally succeeded, after much labour of reduction, in obtaining ex
pressions of remarkable simplicity. He exemplifies their application
by the calculation, on this method, of one of the terms given by Pro
     Airy as requisite for the determination of the inequality of
fessor
Venus; and arrives, by this shorter process, at the same result. The
same method, he remarks,           is,
                             with certain modifications,                            applicable

longitude.
  A   paper was also read, entitled   “Note        the Astronomical Re

JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK,                    Esq.,  M.A., W.P.   and Treasurer,
                                in the   Chair,
    The Treasurer stated that he took the Chair on the present occa
sion in consequence of the unavoidable absence of His Royal Highness
the President; from whom he had received the following letter:
        “Dear Sir,                     -
               “May I    request of you to express to the gentlemen as

 that the state of my eyesight should prevent my attending in my
place on the present occasion, as it would otherwise have been both
my duty and pleasure to have done P Under these circumstances             I
must rely upon that kindness which I have ever experienced at their
hands since presiding over the interests of the Royal Society, to ex
cuse this involuntary absence on my part.            Should the gentlemen
kindly vote me again into the Chair, aware as they are of my present
infirmities, I can only accept the proffered honour upon an under
standing that should I not be better at this period next year, I may
be now considered as giving them notice that I shall consider myself
bound in duty to resign an office, the duty of which I am no longer
able to perform.      I regret much being deprived of the pleasure of
conferring the medals this day, and particularly the one which has
been so properly adjudged to you, for whom I profess the highest
 consideration, and with which sentiment I subscribe myself,

    Resolved unanimously,–That this Meeting deeply regrets the afflic
tion which deprives the Society of His Royal Highness's attendance
at the Anniversary Meeting, and confidently hope that his health
will be speedily and completely restored.
   The Rev. Mr. Peacock, as one of the Auditors on the part of the
Society, reported that the balance in the Treasurer's hands at the pre
sent audit was £192 7s. 64d. The thanks of the Society were voted
to the Auditors for their trouble in auditing the Society's accounts.
    The Secretary read the following List of Fellows deceased since
the last Anniversary.
    On the Home List.—Sir Gilbert Blane, Bart., M.D.; John, Mar
quis of Breadalbane; John Caley, Esq.; Rev. James Stanier Clarke,
LL.D.; Captain James Franklin; William Wyndham, Lord Gren
ville; Philip, Earl of Hardwicke; George Harvey, Esq.; John Jebb,
Lord Bishop of Limerick; Rev. Daniel Lysons; William Taylor Mo
ney, Esq.; John Sharpe, Esq.; Thomas Snodgrass, Esq.; William
Sotheby, Esq.; George John, Earl Spencer; Thomas Telford, Esq.;
Right Hon. Charles Philip Yorke.
    On the Foreign List.—Don Felipe Bauzà and Professor Karl Lud
wig Harding.
    The Secretary stated that of these only two, namely, Sir Gilbert
Blane and Mr. George Harvey, have contributed papers to the Royal
Society.
    Sir Gilbert Blane  was the author of a paper, entitled, “An     Ac
count of the Nardus Indica, or Spikenard,” which was published in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1790.
    In this paper, Sir Gilbert, then Dr. Blane, establishes the identity
of a species of grass, found in great abundance in a wild unfre
quented part of India at the foot of the mountains north of Lucknow,
and held in great estimation by the natives as a febrifuge, with the
plant denominated by ancient writers the Nardus Indica, and which
Arrian states was found in great quantity by the armies of Alex
ander during their marches through the deserts of Gadrosia, border
ing on the Persian Gulf, and forming part of the modern province
of Mekran. An account of the medicinal properties of this plant
occupies the remainder of this paper.
    In the year 1788, Sir Gilbert Blane was appointed to read the
Croonian Lecture, in which he enters into a general account of the
nature of the muscles and of the theory of muscular motion. This
paper was not published in the Philosophical Transactions. The
portion of it chiefly deserving notice is that which relates to the ex
periments made by him with a view to determine whether the spe
 cific gravity of a muscle is the same in its two states of relaxation
 and contraction. For this purpose he compared equal portions of
 the muscular flesh taken from the opposite sides of a fish, one of
 which had been contracted by crimping, and the other had remained
 relaxed; but he was unable to detect any sensible difference in their
 specific gravities. This conclusion was corroborated by the result
 of experiments on living eels, inclosed in vessels filled with water,

                                 304
and terminating above in a tube of small diameter: the bulk of the
fluid was observed to be unaffected by muscular contractions pur
posely excited in the fish, as appeared from the height of the column
in the tube remaining unchanged during the most violent actions of
the eels.   In caoutchouc, on the other hand, Sir G. Blane found
that extension produced a diminution, and retraction an increase, of
density.
   Mr. George Harvey was the author of a paper entitled “Expe
rimental Inquiries relative to the Distribution and Changes of the
Magnetic Intensity in Ships of War;” and of another “On the                .
Effects of the Density of Air on the Rates of Chronometers;” both
of which are published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1824.
In the first paper he enters into a detail of experiments made on
board several vessels for the purpose of determining the influence of
the iron in the ships upon the mariner's compass in different situa
tions and under different circumstances.     In the second paper he as
certains that the rate of chronometers is accelerated by being placed
in air of diminished density; and that it was, on the contrary, retarded
when they are subjected to increased atmospheric pressure; the arc
of vibration being, in the former case, increased; and in the latter,
diminished.
   The Secretary then read the following Report:
   The Council appointed by the Royal Society for the management
of their affairs during the past year, conceiving, from the Report on
the state of the finances presented by the Treasurer to the last
Anniversary Meeting, that their earliest attention should be directed      º
to this important subject, lost no time in nominating a Committee
for taking it into consideration, and for devising the most eligible
means of obviating the difficulties into which the Society might
eventually be involved by the continuance of the present excess of
their expenditure over their income. It appeared from that Report that
the clear annual income of the Society, exclusive of payments made
by new members, may be estimated at £1400; while the probable
annual amount of ordinary expenses is £2000; leaving a deficiency,
each year, of £600.       By adopting a system of greater economy in
the mode of    arranging and printing the Transactions, and other mea
sures of  retrenchment,   recommended by this Committee, the Council
 expect that in future this annual deficiency may be reduced to little
more than £200.       By an arrangement which they have made with
the Editor of the weekly journal “The Athenaeum,” the expense of
 printing the Meteorological Tables, formerly appended to the Phi
losophical Transactions, and amounting to £26 annually, will be
saved; the Editor, in consideration of their being given to that
journal exclusively, having agreed to deliver a thousand copies of         s
 those tables, printed in manner and form, and on paper, to corre
 spond with the Transactions, every six months, to be bound up with
 the latter, free of  all
                        costto the Society.
    With view
         a       to  improve the permanent resources    of the Society,

                                                   305
all the sums received on account of compositions for annual payments
are in future to   be invested in the funds.      In the present year,
however, this principle cannot be brought into operation; owing
chiefly to the extraordinary expenses attending the arrangements
necessary for the fitting up of the new rooms, and the cost of the
new classed Catalogue.      It has also been determined that, as the
sum thus paid by each member as his composition is found, on an
average, to bear a very inadequate proportion to the annual contri

the apartments lately occupied as the Exchequer Office, and granted

presentation made to them by His Royal Highness our President,
to the Royal, conjointly with the Astronomical, Society. The apart.

    The two Royal Medals for the present year have been awarded,
 the one, on Physics, to John William Lubbock, Esq.; and the other,
 on Mineralogy and Geology, to Charles Lyell, Esq. The first is for
 Mr. Lubbock's highly valuable Investigations on the Tides, contained
in his papers published in the Philosophical Transactions.
    The second is awarded for Mr. Lyell's work, entitled “Principles
of Geology,” on the following grounds, the Council at the same
 time declining to express any opinion on the controverted positions
 contained in that work.
    First, The comprehensive view which the author has taken of the
 subject, and the philosophical spirit and dignity with which he has
treated it.
    Secondly, The important service he has rendered to science by
 specially directing the attention of Geologists to effects produced by
 existing causes.
    Thirdly, His admirable descriptions of many tertiary deposits;
 several of these descriptions being drawn from original observations.
    And lastly, The new mode of investigating tertiary deposits,
which his labours have greatly contributed to introduce; namely,
that of determining the relative proportions of extinct and still ex
isting species, with a view to discover the relative ages of distant
 and unconnected tertiary deposits.
    The Council, being unable to propose any specific Prize-Question
 for the Royal Medal in Physics for the year 1837, propose to give
 one of the Royal Medals for that year to the most important unpub
lished paper in Physics, communicated to the Royal Society for in
sertion in their Transactions, after the present date and prior to the
month of June 1837.
    The Council propose to give the other Royal Medals for the year
 1837 to the author of the best paper, to be entitled “Contributions
towards a system of Geological Chronology, founded on an examina
tion of fossil remains, and their attendant phenomena.”

Testacea which it now contains. A great abundance of shells of the
same species were met with in strata of loam, &c., at various heights,
from 30 to 90 feet above the level of the Baltic. They consist chiefly of
the Cardium edule, the Tellina baltica, and the Littorina littoreus; to
gether with portions of the Mytilus edulis, generally decomposed, but
often recognisable by the violet colour which they have imparted to
the whole mass.    In cutting a canal from Sodertelje to lake Maelar,
several buried vessels were found; some apparently of great antiquity,
from the circumstance of their containing no iron, the planks being
fixed together by wooden nails. In another place, an anchor was dug
up; as also, in one spot, some iron nails. The remains of a square
wooden house were also discovered at the bottom of an excavation                                                 si
made for the canal, nearly at a level with the sea, but at a depth of
64 feet from the surface of the ground. An irregular ring of stones
was found on the floor of this hut, having the appearance of a rude
fire-place, and within it was a heap of charcoal and charred wood.
On the outside of the ring was a heap of unburnt       wood, broken                 fir
 up     as
       for fuel; the dried needles the             of
                                         and the bark         fir

being still preserved.    The whole building was enveloped        fine                                in
sand.

with problems of perturbation, they are applied, in this essay, first,
to a very simple example, suggested by the motions of projectiles,
the parabolic path being treated as the undisturbed; and secondly, to
the problem of determining the motions of a ternary or multiple
system, with any laws of attraction or repulsion, and with one pre
dominant mass. This latter problem, which was touched upon in the
former essay, is here resumed in a new manner, by forming and in
tegrating the differential equations of a new set of varying elements,
entirely distinct in theory (though little differing in practice) from
the elements conceived by Lagrange; and having this advantage,
that the differentials of all the new elements for both the disturbed
and disturbing masses may be expressed by the coefficients of one
disturbing function.

of Mr. Faraday, contained in the Fourth and Fifth Series of his Expe

   Dr. Davy complains that Mr. Faraday has, in the paper referred to,
made certain statements with respect to the opinions of Sir Humphry
Davy relative to the conducting powers of dry nitre, and caustic pot
ash and soda, when in fusion by heat, and also with regard to other
matters connected with voltaic electricity, which are not correct; and
vindicates Sir Humphry Davy from the charge of want of perspicuity
in the statement of his views of these subjects.
   A Note by Mr. Faraday on the preceding Remarks by Dr. Davy
was then read, in which he replies to the charges there brought for
ward, and justifies those statements, the accuracy of which had been
impugned by Dr. Davy.

       Mr. Faraday's paper, entitled, “Experimental Researches in Elec
tricity. Ninth Series,” was resumed and concluded.
    In the series of experiments which are detailed in this paper, the
author inquires into the causes of some remarkable phaenomena rela
ting to the action of an electric current upon itself, under certain cir
cumstances, whereby         intensity
                               its         highly exalted, and occasionally
                                               is
increased      ten, twenty,
                to                      or
                                 even fifty times that which          originally  it
possessed.     For the production        this effect, the principal condition
                                              of
is  that the current traverse    considerable length

                                                                     be of

of   ahelix; and the effect     still farther augmented when this helix
                                        is                                                  is

the spark is still brighter; and if a core of soft iron be placed within
the helix, the spark, at the moment of disjunction, is more brilliant
 than in any of the former cases: and the higher intensity of the cur
rent is also manifested by the occurrence of a shock, at the same mo
ment, to a person who grasps with wetted hands the two ends of the
wire; whereas no such effect, nor even any sensible impression on the
tongue, is produced by the electromotor, when a short wire is em
ployed.
    All these effects of exaltation are produced at a time when the ac
tual current of   electricity from the electromotor is greatly diminished;
as the author shows      by  many  experiments on the ignition of a fine
wire, and the deflection of a galvanometer.        He also proves that the
effects of the spark and the shock, at the moment of disjunction of a
long wire, are due to a current far more powerful than that which
passes through the short wire at the same instant; or indeed than
that which passes through either the long or the short wire at any
other instant of time than when the disjunction takes place.
   That this extraordinary effect is not due to any species of inertia,
is shown by the fact, that the same wire will produce it in a greater or
less degree, under circumstances incapable of influencing any effect
depending on inertia: thus, if 100 feet of wire, when extended,
produce a certain effect, a greater effect will be produced by coiling
the same wire into a helix, and a still more powerful one by employ
ing it as the helix of an electro-magnet.
   The author ultimately refers these phaenomena to an inductive ac
tion of the current, analogous, or perhaps identical, with that described
in the First Series of these Experimental Researches : for he found
 that when a second wire was placed parallel to the long conducting
wire, the ends of this second wire being connected together so that a
current of electricity could circulate roundit, then the spark and shock
did not take place at the first wire at the moment of disjunction, but
a current was induced at the second wire, according to the law ori
ginally described in the First Series. The moment the current in the
second wire was interrupted, the spark and shock appeared at the
first. These and many other experiments were adduced to prove
that these effects, namely, the shock and the spark, result from an    in
ductive action of the original current, producing, at the moment it is
 stopped, a current, in the same direction as itself, in the same wire
which serves to convey the original current.
    The author, lastly, considers the reverse effect produced upon mak
 ing contact; and concludes his paper by some general views of the
consequences resulting from this inductive action in various cases of
electric discharge; pointing out the important influence it must have
in magneto-electrical machines of the ordinary construction.

   A paper was read, entitled, “On the probable Position of the
South Magnetic Pole.”       By Edward Rudge, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
   The recent  discovery  of the site of the North Magnetic Pole, which
has resulted from the experiments of Capt. James Ross, suggested
to the author the inquiry whether any similar indications of an ap
proach to the South Magnetic Pole can be gathered from any obser
vations now on record.     With this view a table is given of the obser
vations made    by Tasman in 1642 and 1643, during his voyage of
discovery in the Southern Ocean, extracted from his journal; from
which it appears that he on one occasion noticed the continual agita
tion of the horizontal needle, in south latitude 42° 25', and longitude
from Paris 160°.     On the presumption that the South Magnetic Pole
was at that time near this spot, and that it has since been retrograd
ing towards the East, the author conjectures that it will now be found
in or about the 43rd parallel of south latitude; and to the south-east
of the Island of Madagascar, a situation extremely convenient for
ascertaining       exact position, which
                  its                           considershe     object  as   an      of

equation of the curve formed by the perpetual intersection of rays,
which, diverging from a luminous point, are reflected by a polished
surface of a given curvature.         Curves of this description have been
denominated       caustics;  and the method usually employed to discover
their polar equations, or the relation between the radius vector of any
point of the curve and the tangent at that point, is both long and                                                   in

inaccuracy of reasoning.         He proposes, therefore, to substitute a new
method of      investigation,  by  taking the polar equation of one of the
reflected rays, and differentiating this equation with respect to the
arbitrary quantities solely which determine            position, and thus ob its

    Continuation of a former paper “On the twenty-five feet Zenith
Telescope, lately erected at the Royal Observatory; ” by John Pond,
Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
   For determining the place of any star passing the meridian near the
zenith, at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, three different me
thods may be employed: first, by means of the mural circles; se
condly, by the zenith telescope, used alternately east and west; and
lastly, by means of a small subsidiary angle, as described by the au
thor in a former paper. The details of computations made according
to each of these three methods are contained in the present paper;
from which it appears that they                          all
                                    give results nearly identical; and
that, when the observations with the two circles are made with suf
ficient care, the greatest error                               be

  It appears, from the information collected by the author, that for a
considerable time previously to the late eruption of Vesuvius, stones
and scoriae had been thrown up from the crater, and had accumulated
into two conical masses, the largest of which was more than two hun
dred feet in height.    On the night of the 24th of August last, after
the flow of considerable currents of lava, a violent concussion took
place, followed by the disappearance of both these conical hillocks,
which, in the course of a single night, were apparently swallowed up
within the cavities of the mountain.     Fresh currents of lava continued
to flow for several  days  subsequently,  destroying about 180 houses,
spreading devastation over a large tract of country, and destroying                                             all
the fish in the neighbouring ponds and lakes. After the 29th      August,                          of
no  further signs    internal commotion were manifested, with the ex

men.    The author endeavours to extend this analogy to other species
of the same family, which, according to the reports of the fishermen
of whom he made inquiries, have a high temperature, and in whose
internal structure he noticed similar peculiarities as in the Thunny;
namely, very large branchial nerves, furnished with ganglia of consi
derable size.   In this respect he considers that in these fishes the
branchial system of organs makes an approximation to the respiratory
apparatus of the Mammalia, and that it probably contributes to the
elevation of temperature, resulting from the more energetic respira
tion which he supposes to be exercised by these organs.       He, how
ever, thinks it not improbable that these fish may possess means of
generating heat peculiar to themselves, and of which at present we
have no adequate idea.     He conceives that the situation of the  kid
neys, of which a considerable portion is even higher than the stomach,
and posterior to the gills, and which are of large size, and well sup
plied with nerves and blood-vessels, may possibly act a part in the
production of an elevated temperature; but, on the whole, he is dis
posed to ascribe the greatest share of this effect to the superior mag
nitude of the branchial nerves.

 ciling the discrepancies of the curve which represents this inequality
 for different places; discrepancies which have hitherto been a source
 of much perplexity. These differences in the semimenstrual inequa
 lity are shown by the author to be consequences of peculiar local cir
 cumstances, such as the particular form of the coast, the distance
 which the tide wave has travelled over, and the meeting of tides pro
 ceeding in different directions; and he traces the influence of each of
 these several causes in producing these differences.       A diurnal dif
ference in the height of the tides manifests itself with remarkable con
 stancy along a large portion of the coast under consideration.       The
 tide hour appears to vary rapidly in rounding the main promon
 tories of the coast, and very slowly in passing along the shores of the
intervening bays; so that the cotidal lines are brought close together
in the former cases, and, in the latter, run along nearly parallel to
the shore; circumstances which will also account for comparative
differences of level, and of corresponding velocities in the tide stream.
The author intends to prosecute the subject when the whole of the
returns of these observations shall have undergone reduction.

and then, although it may be frozen at the surface, it continues to flow
over a perfectly clear bottom.      All these phenomena are considered
by the author as perfectly explicable on the theory he advances, of
different degrees of radiation of heat occurring from the bottom ac
cording to variations of circumstances.      He conceives that when this
radiation takes place from the solid opake materials of the bed of the
stream, through the stratum of transparent water, congelation is in
duced on that portion of fluid, already cooled down to the freezing
point, which is in immediate contact with the radiating body. The
circumstances which, by favouring radiation, contribute to this effect,
are, principally, great clearness of the sky, and great transparency of
the water; the bottom of the river being cooled below the freezing
point sooner than the water which is flowing over it; and the ice,
formed at the bottom, remaining attached to               long     the heat  it,   as           as

    The author enters into         minute anatomical investigation

posterior, two lateral, and two anterior; each column being composed
of  concentric layers, and invested with           external coating

lumns has a double termination; first, in the root of the fifth pair of
cephalic nerves; and secondly, in the place where both columns unite
into one round cord, and mutually decussate.
   Between the lateral and the anterior columns there is interposed a
layer of cineritious matter, constituting a continuous stratum from the
cauda equina to the roots of the auditory nerves.        There is also a
septum, dividing the right and left tracts subservient to sensation in
the region of the fourth ventricle, and apparently terminating at the
point of decussation of these tracts; but, in reality, separating to                                       al
low of this decussation, and joining the central portion of the cord,
which connects the posterior with the anterior columns, and extends
from the pons Varolii to the cauda equina.
   The anterior columns, constituting, at their upper part, the corpora
pyramidalia, after their union and decussation, compose the motor
columns of the spinal cord.      They do not, in their course, unite or
decussate with the   lateral, or sensitive columns; decussation taking
place only among the columns performing similar functions; that                                            is,

   The third paper was entitled, “Hygrometrical Observations made
on board His Majesty's surveying vessel AEtna.”          Communicated
by Captain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S.
   These observations extend from the 27th of March to the 6th of
July, 1834, and were made daily at 8 o'clock A.M., at noon, and at
4 o'clock P.M. They comprise the height of the barometer, the dew
point, degrees of dryness on the thermometrical, and of moisture on
the hygrometrical scales, the elasticity of the vapour, and the number
of grains of vapour in a cubic foot; with occasional remarks.       A se
cond series is also given, exhibiting the progress of solar radiation.
   The fourth was a “Meteorological Register, from the 1st of Janu
ary to the 1st of November, 1834,” by Mr. Edward Barnett. Com
municated by Capt. Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S.
   These observations, made during a voyage across the Atlantic,
relate chiefly to the temperatures of the air, and of the surface of
the sea.
   The fifth was a “Meteorological Register, kept on board His
Majesty's Ship Thunder, between the 1st of January and the 30th of
June, 1834,” by R. Owen, Commander. Communicated by Cap
tain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S.
  These observations relate to the state of the weather, the direction
and force of the wind, and the heights of the thermometer, and of the
marine and oil barometers.

   The author having, during his stay at Jedda, the port of Mecca,
succeeded in procuring about three quarts of the water from the well
of Zem-zem, to which the Mahomedans ascribe a sacred character
and extraordinary virtues; and wishing to preserve this water for the
purposes of analysis, had the can in which it was contained carefully
sealed; but, unfortunately, on         its

sumed and concluded.
    From the fact that no carbonic acid gas is given out by venous blood
 when that fluid is subjected to the action of the air-pump, former
 experimentalists had inferred that this blood contains no carbonic
 acid.   The author of the present paper contends that this is an er
 roneous inference; first, by showing that serum, which had been
 made to absorb a considerable quantity of this gas, does not yield it
 upon the removal of the atmospheric pressure; and next, by addu
 cing several experiments in proof of the strong attraction exerted on
 carbonic acid both by hydrogen and by oxygen gases, which were
 found to absorb it readily through the medium of moistened mem
 brane.    By means of a peculiar apparatus, consisting of a double
 necked   bottle,  to which a set of bent tubes were adapted, he ascer
tained that venous blood, agitated with pure hydrogen gas, and                                        al

   The reading of a paper, entitled, “On the Influence of the Tricus
pid Valve of the Heart on the Circulation of the Blood.” By T. W.
King, Esq., M.R.C.S. Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., F.R.S.,
—was resumed and concluded.
  The purport of this paper is to prove experimentally that the tri
cuspid valve of the human heart does not, in the ordinary state of the
circulation, completely prevent the reflux of blood from the ventricle
into the auricle on the right side, and that the amount of regurgita
tion is continually varying according to the different degrees of disten
tion of the ventricle. The author points out the anatomical differences
between the auriculo-ventricular valves on the right and left sides of
the heart; from the consideration of which it might have been inferred,
independently of direct experiment, that while the structure of the
mitral valve is adapted to close accurately                all
                                                   communication between
the left auricle and ventricle during the contraction        the latter, that
                                                                       of
    the tricuspid valve                                 allow, when closed,
of of
                           designedly calculated
                                 is                               to
   the flow   of certain quantity
                  a                   blood from the right ventricle back
                                              of
again into the auricle. The comparatively imperfect valvular func
tion    of
         these latter membranes        shown  is           by
                                                   various experiments                 on
recent hearts,       which
                       in    was found that fluids injected, through the
                                  it
aorta, into the left ventricle, were perfectly retained      that cavity,
                                                                       in              by
the closing     the mitral valve; but that when the right ventricle was
                  of
similarly injected through the pulmonary artery, the tricuspid valves
generally allowed           of
                        the escape             of
                                        the fluid    streams, more
                                                                 in      less     or
copious,     consequence
             in               the incomplete
                                      of       apposition     their margins.
                                                                       of
On repeating these experiments           different animals the author ob
                                                on
tained similar results; but found that the imperfection           the valvu of
                                               2    C

                                    338
lar function was greater, the sooner the heart was examined after the
death of the animal ; and that if the trials were made after the lapse
of a certain time, the rigidity which gradually supervened on the mus
cular fibres of the heart, and of the carneae columnae attached to the
margins of the valves, brought them into more complete apposition
and led to the accurate closing of the passage.    This effect, however,
was never so perfectly accomplished in the tricuspid, as in the mitral
valves.
   The author regards this peculiarity of structure in the tricuspid
 valve as an express provision against the mischiefs that might result
from an excessive afflux of blood to the lungs, analogous to a safety
valve; and as more especially advantageous in incipient diseased
enlargements of the right ventricle.    He adverts to the conditions of
the heart during the foetal state of existence, in which the same ne
cessity of guarding against excessive pressure does not occur, and
where the structures are found to correspond to the variation of func
tions. A similar adjustment of the right auriculo-ventricular valve
 to the peculiar circumstances and habits of animals may also be
traced by extending the inquiry to various classes of animals.

occurrence of, and the more remarkable Phaenomena connected with,
the Earthquakes lately felt in the Neighbourhood of Chichester.”      By
J. P. Gruggen,   Esq.  Communicated in a letter to P. M.   Roget,  M.D.,
Sec. R.S.
   This paper contains an authentic report of the shocks of earth
quakes which, during the last two years, have been felt at Chi
chester and the surrounding country; drawn up from accounts given
by various correspondents, in answer to printed queries extensively
circulated. The first shock occurred on the 18th of September, and
the second on the 13th of November, 1833.        Another and more se
vere shock was felt on the 23d of January, 1834, and in the latter end
of the same year two slighter shocks were experienced, namely, one
on the 27th of August, and the next on the 21st of September; the
last, which was less than any of the former, took place on the 12th of
January, 1835.
   The Society then adjourned over Whitsun week to meet again on
the 18th instant.

   “Discussion of Tide-Observations made at Liverpool.”         By J. W.
Lubbock, Esq., W.P. and Treas. R.S.
   The author has here presented to the Society, by permission of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, a discussion by
M. Dessiou of about 14,000 tide-observations made at Liverpool, on
the plan similar to that adopted with regard to the London Dock ob
servations.   The first book contains the moon's transits, classified

                                                        339
with the moon's parallax and declination, together with the date and
corresponding time and height of high water; the height of the baro
meter is also added to the observations of about four years. The
second book contains the same quantities, classified further according
to the different calendar months, and for each minute of the moon's
horizontal parallax. The third book contains a similar classification
for the moon's declination. The average results are given in tables
at the end.
   Some remarks are subjoined on the registers of the observations
taken at the London and St. Katherine's Docks; from which it appears
that the tide is about five minutes earlier in the former than in the
latter of these two places; and that the difference in height is about
five feet.

its stem to other bodies, and consequently deprived of the power of

mulus; and, 4thly, the ovum, which is contained in the cavity just
mentioned. The human ovum is so small as to be only just percep
 tible to the naked eye, being the 150th part of an inch in diameter.
It has a soft transparent envelope of considerable thickness, and
contains a substance composed of grains, adhering together by the
 intervention of a delicate mucous tissue. At the inner surface of the
 envelope, the author discovered a delicate transparent vesicle, about
 the 900th part of an inch in diameter, and having on one side a small
 elevation, which, projecting among the grains composing the walls of
 the granular sac, fixes the vesicle in                               its

tuations. Thus, although the animals inhabiting the shells belonging
to the genera Patella and Lottia are extremely dissimilar in many
essential features of their organization, the shells they form cannot be
distinguished from one another by any known character.             In other
instances, when the animals are very different, the distinctive cha
racters of the respective shells belonging to them are so slight as to
be insufficient for the purpose of classing them under separate spe
cies; and this difficulty of discrimination must be much increased in
the cases of fossil shells, especially of those which have no strictly
analogous forms among recent shells.

metamorphoses of a peculiar kind, and of a different character from
those of insects. Mr. Thompson's views are founded upon some cir
cumstances which he has observed in certain animals of the genus
Zoea of Bosc, and which have been recorded by Professor Slabber, and
which have led Mr. Thompson to believe that, of these animals, some
were the young of the Cancer Pagurus, or common crab, and others
the young of the Astacus Pagurus, or common lobster; and these views
are supposed by him to be corroborated by the annual peregrinations
of the land crabs to the sea-side, for the purpose of depositing their
eggs, rendered necessary by the aquatic habits and conformation of
the young. The author proceeds to examine at length the arguments
on which Mr. Thompson has founded these opinions, and adduces his
reasons for concluding that they are erroneous, and that no excep

   The author, expressing his dissatisfaction with the commonly re
ceived theory of the propagation of sonorous undulations by an elastic
medium, advances the hypothesis that each particle of an elastic body,

brought to a state of rest, is carried back by      elasticity with veloits

   The author then investigated many other practical points in the
use of the battery, ascertaining the influence of various circumstances
in the manner already described. Thus he found nitric acid to give a
higher result of voltaic action than sulphuric or muriatic acid; the
quantity of zinc dissolved in order to produce decomposition of an
equivalent of water being only 1.85 per plate when nitric acid was
used, 38 when muriatic acid was used, and 4.66 when sulphuric acid
was employed.      The acid which he afterwards used as the best for
ordinary purposes consisted of 200 water, 4.5          oil  vitriol, and
                                                             of                        4

  “On      the Empirical Laws of the Tides in the Port of Liverpool.”
By the Rev. William Whewell, M.A., F.R.S.
   The author employs the results of the discussion of sixteen years of
tide observations made at Liverpool, published by Mr. Lubbock in the
Philosophical Transactions for the present year, in testing and im
proving the formulae, expressing the mathematical laws of the inequa
lities of the phenomena of the tides, which had already been deduced
by the author from the London tide observations.        He finds that the
Liverpool observations have not only confirmed, in the most satisfac
tory manner, these formulae, but have furnished the means of greatly
improving them. The corrections for lunar parallax and declination,
which, as far as they depended on the former investigation, might be,
considered as in some measure doubtful, and only locally applicable,
have now been fully verified as to their general form ; the nature of
the local differences in the constants of the formulae has also, in part,
come into view ; and the investigation has, moreover, shown that,
notwithstanding the great irregularities to which the tides are subject,
the results of the means of large masses of good observations agree
with the formulae with a precision not far below that of other astrono
mical phenomena.      The formulae obtained point directly to a very
simple theory of the circumstances of tides, namely, that the tide at
any place occurs in the same way as if the ocean assumed the form
of equilibrium, corresponding to a certain antecedent time, and differ
ent place. The ocean, in        positionits equilibrium, would have the

mel, in which it is no longer influenced by the forces of the moon and
sun, it would take a certain time in reaching any place in that chan
nel, and the circumstances of the tide at that place would not depend
on the positions and distances of the moon and sun at the time when
the tide happens, but on the positions and distances of those lumina
ries at a certain time, anterior to the time of the tide, by the interval
occupied in the transmission of the tide along the channel.      This                                                in
terval of time, which, in his former papers, the author had called the
age of the tide, he here terms the retroposition of the theoretical tide
in time.
  Adopting this phraseology, the author finds that the phenomena of
the Liverpool tides may be expressed as follows.
   1. The effects which the changes of the moon's force produce on
the tides are the same as the effects which those changes would pro
duce upon a retroposited equilibrium tide.
  2. The retroposition of the tide in longitude is affected by small
changes, which changes are proportional to the variations in the moon's
force.
  3. The retroposition of the tide in time is also affected by small
changes, which changes depend on the variations in the moon's force.
  On the hypothesis that an equilibrium tide give rise to the Liver
pool tides, we must suppose that the channel by which they are trans
mitted occupies in length, from west to east, 11" 6" of longitude; or
we may suppose the tide spheroid to      behind the position     equi

  An idea formerly prevailed among the inhabitants of Chili, that the
earthquakes of those regions take place at certain regular periods;
but it is now sufficiently proved, from the numerous catastrophes of

efforts to procure an arrangement more advantageous to the Society,
it was finally agreed to sell to the City the whole of the premises,

the terms of the Act in question, is to be paid into the Court of Ex

in some subsequent Act the insertion of a clause can be procured,
authorizing its payment out of Court to the Royal Society.            Every
effort was  made,  in  correspondence    with the  City  authorities, to ob

    The mode of suspension adopted by Capt. Kater was the knife
edge, of which he points out the various advantages and disadvan
tages, and the methods he took for overcoming the difficulties of the
inquiry.      By employing the method of coincidences he found that
the number of vibrations made by the pendulum in twenty-four
hours might be obtained to within half a second of the truth in the
space of eight minutes: and he then applied the usual correction
for the extent of the arc of vibration, and also for the height of the
place of observation above the level of the sea.
    5. This paper was followed by another, “On the length of the
French Metre estimated in parts of the English Standard:” in de
termining which he employed the same micrometer microscopes as
were used in the pendulum experiments, bringing them alternately
 over the metre and over the standard scale, placed in the same plane
parallel to and in contact with one another; care being taken that
 their temperatures were the same.
    6. In the following year (1819) Capt. Kater gives an “Account of
experiments for determining the Variation in the Length of the Pen
 dulum vibrating Seconds, at the principal stations of the Trigonome
 trical Survey of Great Britain:” a paper which is full of laborious
 calculations, founded on the observations therein detailed. The       in
 vestigation of the diminution of terrestrial gravity from the equator
 to the pole is pursued by the comparison of determinations of the
 length of the seconds pendulum at various stations: and is founded
 on the theorem demonstrated by Clairaut; that the sum of the two
 fractions expressing the ellipticity and the diminution of gravity
 from the pole to the equator is always a constant quantity, and is
 equal to 2% times the fraction expressing the ratio of centrifugal
 force, and that of gravity at the equator.       The extreme degree of
 accuracy with which the force of gravitation may be determined by
 the apparatus employed by Capt. Kater, suggested to him the possi
 bility of ascertaining by its means minute variations in this force
 observable in passing through a country composed of materials of
 various degrees of density: instances of the occurrence of which
 are given in this paper.
     7. In the year 1823, Capt. Kater communicated to the Royal Society
 an account of experiments made with an invariable pendulum be
 longing to the Board of Longitude, by Sir Thomas Brisbane and
 Mr. Dunlop, at Paramatta in New South Wales, and thence deduces
 the fraction expressing the terrestrial compression.
    8. In a paper which appeared in the Phil. Trans. for 1821 (p. 75.)
 Capt. Kater gives an account of the comparison which he instituted
 of various British Standards of Linear Measures for the purpose of
 accurately examining the standard yard employed by General Roy,
in the measurement of a base on Hounslow Heath, as a foundation for
 the trigonometrical operations carried on by the Ordnance through
 out the country.     He found material differences to exist between the
 standards of Sir George Shuckburgh, of Bird, of the Royal Society,
 of General Roy's, and of the one constructed by Ramsden, which
 was used in the trigonometrical survey. Capt. Kater then proceeds to
 investigate the effect of these differences on the figure of the earth.

                                    353
    9. Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn had, in the course of his inquiries
respecting a standard of weights and measures, examined with great
care the weights of a standard cube, cylinder, and sphere, and the
methods employed for this purpose had been minutely described;
but the mode of ascertaining the dimensions of these bodies had not
been so fully detailed.      Capt. Kater was accordingly desirous of re
investigating this latter branch of the subject before the Commis
sioners of Weights and Measures should make their final report. The
apparatus he employed for this purpose, and the results of his ex
periments, are stated in a paper also published in the Philosophical
 Transactions for 1821.
    10. These researches were continued by Capt. Kater in the year
 1825; and the details are given in a paper published in the Phil. Trans.
for 1826, and entitled “An Account of the construction and adjust
ment of the new standards of weights and measures of the United
 Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.”
    11. The series was completed in 1830 by the account he gives of
the detection of a source of error in estimating the standard of linear
measure, arising from the thickness of the bar, on the surface of
 which the lines are traced, and of the means he took to obviate it.
    12. The attention of Capt. Kater was at one time directed to the
ascertaining the best kind of steel for the construction of a compass
needle, the most advantageous form to be given to the needle, and
 the most effective mode of communicating to it magnetism.              Many
curious and unexpected results were obtained in the course of this
  investigation.
     13. A remarkable volcanic appearance in the moon being observed
 by Capt. Kater in February 1821, he communicated to the Society
 shortly afterwards an account of the phaenomenon, which was pub
 lished in the Phil. Trans. for the same year.
     14. One of the greatest benefits conferred onscience by Capt. Kater
 was his invention of the floating collimator, an instrument of which
 the object is to determine the situation of the line of collimation of
 a telescope attached to an astronomical circle, with respect to the
 zenith or the horizon in any one position of the instrument; or in
 other words, to determine the zero-point of the divisions on the limb:
 an operation which was before usually performed by the use of the
 level or the plumb-line, or by the reflexion of an object from the
 surface of a fluid.      Each of these methods was liable to many in
 conveniences and defects: all of which are avoided in the floating
 collimator.     The principles on which this instrument is constructed
 are two ; the first is the property of a telescope employed by Gauss,
 and subsequently by Bessel, in virtue of which theºcross wires of a
 telescope adjusted to distinct vision on the wire, may be distinctly
 seen by another telescope also similarly adjusted, at whatever distance
 the telescope may be placed, provided their axes coincide; in which
 case the rays diverging from the cross wires of either telescope, will
 emerge parallel from    its   object-glass, and will therefore  be  refracted
 by that  of   the other telescope  to   its sidereal focus,asif   they came
 from  an   infinite distance.    The other principle, which     is  employed
 as
 a     substitute for the common      level,
                                          is    the invariability with respect

                                                        354
  to the plane of the horizon, of the position of a body of determinate
  figure and weight, when floating on the surface of a fluid. Thus the
  telescope being attached to a box floating on mercury, and serving
  as a stand to the telescope, may be fixed either in a horizontal or a
  vertical position; in which latter case the reverse observations may
  be made by merely turning the float half round in azimuth.
      15. The later improvements made by Capt. Kater in the vertical
 floating collimator are described by him in a subsequent paper pub
 lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1828.                      Besides ob
 viating the sources of error arising from the necessity of transferring
 the instrument to different sides of the observatory, and of taking the
 float out of the mercury and replacing it at each observation, the
 vertical floating collimator has the further advantage of being adapted
 for use, not only with a circle, but also with a telescope, either of
 the refracting or reflecting kind. Such a telescope, furnished with
 a wire micrometer, and directed to the zenith, becomes a zenith
 telescope, free from                 all
                                the objections          which the zenith sector,
                                                                          to
 and the     ordinary    zenith   telescopes    with       plumb-line, are liable.

collimator to the astronomical circle at the observatory of Trinity
College, Dublin.     He regards the results of these observations as
highly favourable to the principle of the collimator, which he con
siders as a new astronomical power, and as even belonging to a more
advanced era of practical astronomy than the present.
   Mr. Edward Troughton is the author of a paper in the Phil. Trans.
for 1809, entitled “An Account of a method of dividing Astronomical
and other instruments by ocular inspection; in which the usual tools
for graduating are not employed; the whole operation being so con
trived, that no error can occur but what is chargeable to vision when
assisted by the best optical means of viewing and measuring minute
quantities.”    The intrinsic excellence of Mr. Troughton's method,
 as detailed in this paper, consists in the process of examination
 employed to correct the imperfections in laying down the divisions
 by methods which give only approximate degrees of accuracy.

you may be sure of my readiness to take the chair. In the mean
time I hope that the Members will not relax in their endeavours to
uphold the character of the Royal Society; and I shall look with
confidence to the attendance of the Vice-Presidents for the main
tenance of that order and regularity so necessary to be observed at
allliterary and scientific meetings.

the second degree, of any quantity, can exist, capable of being re
solved into the sum, or the difference, of two other powers of the
same degree:" or, as it may still more generally be expressed,                                              “If
the exponents of three powers be multiplied by the same number,

    A paper was read, entitled, “ Meteorological Journal kept at the
 Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, from the 1st of June to
 the 31st of December, 1834.”        Communicated by Capt. Beaufort,
 R.N., F.R.S., Hydrographer to the Admiralty.
    The observations recorded in this Journal are those of the baro
 meter, and of two thermometers, one in, and the other out of doors;
 taken at sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight, in each successive day
 from the 1st of June, 1834, to the end of the year.
    “Some Account of the Volcanic Eruption of Cosiguina in the
 Bay of Fonseca, commonly called the Coast of Conchagua, on the
 Western Coast of Central America.”          By Alexander Caldcleugh,
 Esq., F.R.S.
    #. particulars   recorded in this narrative are derived partly from
a voluminous collection of official reports transmitted from the au
 thorities in various towns to the government of Central America,
and partly from the information of intelligent eye-witnesses of the
phenomena.       The eruption occurred on the 19th of January, 1835,
and was preceded by a slight noise, accompanied with a column of
smoke issuing from the mountain, and increasing till it took the form
of alarge and dense cloud, which, when viewed from a distance often
leagues to the southward, appeared like an immense plume of white
feathers, rising with considerable velocity and expanding in every
direction.    Its colour was, at first, of the most brilliant white; but
it gradually   became tinged with grey; then passed into yellow; and
finally assumed a beautiful crimson hue. In the course of the fol
lowing days several shocks of an earthquake were felt, the last of
which were most terrific.     On the morning of the 22nd, the sun had
risen in brightness; but a line of intense darkness denoted the pre
sence of the same cloud which had before presented such remarkable
appearances, and which, extending with great rapidity, soon ob
scured the light of day; so that in the course of half an hour the
darkness equalled in intensity that of the most clouded night: per
sons touched without seeing one another; the cattle hurried back
to their folds; and the fowls went to roost, as on the approach of
night. This atmospheric darkness continued with scarcely any di
minution for three days; during the whole of which time there fell
a fine impalpable dust, covering the ground at St. Antonio to the
depth of two inches and a half, and consisting of three layers of
different shades of grey colour: and for ten or twelve succeeding
days the sky exhibited a dim and murky light. At Nacaome, to
the northward of the volcano, the same degree of darkness was ex
perienced, and the deposit of ashes was from four to five inches in
depth, and exhaled a fetid sulphureous odour, which penetrated
through every interstice in the buildings. The complete obscurity

was only occasionally broken by the lightning, which flashed in every
direction, while the air was rent with loud and reiterated explosions
like the discharges of artillery, which accompanied each eruption of
volcanic matter, and conspired to strike the deepest terror, and to
spread among the inhabitants a universal panic that the day of judge
ment was arrived. On the 24th the atmosphere became clearer, and
the houses were found covered to the depth of eight inches with ashes,
in which many small birds were found suffocated.       Deer and other
wild animals flew to the town for refuge, and the banks of the neigh
bouring streams were strewed with dead fish. In Segovia, and as
far as eight leagues from the volcano, the showers of black sand were
so abundant as to destroy thousands of cattle; and many were
subsequently found whose bodies exhibited one mass of scorched
flesh.
   Within the Bay of Fonseca, and two miles from the volcano, it is
stated that two islands, from two to three hundred yards in diameter,
were thrown up, probably from the deposit of masses of scoriae on
previously existing shoals.

 the irritability of the Mimosa pudica, from which it appeared that
light of a certain intensity is necessary for the maintenance of the
healthy functions of this plant, and that when subjected to the ac

   Sir David Brewster's paper, entitled, “On the Anatomical and
Optical Structure of the Crystalline Lenses of Animals, being the
continuation of the paper published in the Philosophical Transac

   The author has examined the structure of the crystalline lens of
the eye of a great variety of animals belonging to each of the four
classes of Vertebrata; and has communicated in this paper a de
tailed account of his observations, arranged according as they re
late to structures more and more complex. In a former paper,
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833, the lens of the
Cod fish was taken as the type of the simplest of these structures, in

 of the lens occupy positions which are reversed with respect to one
another; thus in the simple case of the double septa at each pole,
the line formed by those of the posterior surface is situated at right
angles to that formed by the septa of the anterior surface. Where
there are three divergent septa at each pole, the direction of those
on the one side bisect the angles formed by those on the other side;
and again, where the septa form a rectangular cross, those of one
surface are inclined 45° to those of the other surface.
    It follows as a consequence of this configuration of the series of
points which constitute the origins and terminations of the fibres,
that all the fibres, with the exception only of those proceeding in a
direct line from the extremities of any of the septa, must, in their
passage from the one surface to the other, follow a course more or
less contorted ; and must form lines of double curvature; that                                                            is,

  A paper was read, entitled, “Discussion of Tide Observations
made at Liverpool.”     By J. W. Lubbock, Esq., F.R.S.
  The chief purpose which the author has in view in presenting the
tables accompanying this paper, which are a continuation of those
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1835, and are
founded on the observations instituted by Mr. Hutchinson at Liver
pool, is to exhibit the diurnal inequality in the height of high water,
which is scarcely sensible in the river Thames, but which at Liver
pool amounts to more than a foot. The diurnal inequality in the
interval appears to be insensible.
   The author has farther ascertained that Bernouilli's formulae ex
pressing the height of the tide, deduced from his theory of the tides,
present a very remarkable accordance with observation.

 which a magnetic needle can take a position vertical to the Earth's
surface.” By Thomas Stephens Davies, Esq., F.R.S. Lond. and
 Edin., F.R.A.S., of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.
   This paper is intended as a continuation of the one by the same
author published in the last volume of the Philosophical Transac
tions; in which it was proposed to investigate the mathematical
consequences of the hypothesis of the earth being a magnet with
two poles, or centres of force, situated anywhere either within, or
at the surface, and of equal intensity, but of contrary characters:
with the ultimate view of verifying this hypothesis by comparing                     its
results,    sodeduced, with the phaenomena furnished              by
                                                               observation.
  In   his former paper the author had shown that            on

nation, he contrived an apparatus, which he designates by the name
of the dissected battery, and which consists of ten cylindrical glass
cells, capable of holding the fluid electrolytes, in which two plates
of metal are immersed; each plate communicating below, by means
of a separate wire, which is made to perforate a glass stopper closing
the bottom of the cell, with a small quantity of mercury, contained
in a separate cup underneath the stopper, and with which electric
communications may bemade at pleasurethrough other wires passing
out of the vessel on each side. The active elements of the circuit,
which were adopted as standards of comparison, were, for the me
tals, plates of platinum and amalgamated zinc three inches in length
by one in breadth; and for the electrolyte, water acidulated with
 sulphuric acid, in the proportion of 100 parts by volume of the for
mer to 2.25 of the latter; this degree of dilution (giving a spe
 cific gravity of 1.0275,) being adopted, in order to connect the au
 thor's experiments with those of Mr. Faraday.
    This dilute acid exerts scarcely any local action on amalgamated
 zinc ; because the surface of the metal becomes covered with bub
bles of hydrogen gas, which adhere strongly to                       and this force

                                             373
momena; and was thus led to discover the cause of the variations
and progressive decline of the power of the ordinary voltaic battery,
one of the principal of which is the departure of the zinc on the
platina plates; and to establish certain principles from which a
method of counteracting this evil may be derived. The particular
construction which he has devised for the attainment of this object,
and which he denominates the constant battery, consists of a hollow
copper cylinder, containing within it a membranous tube formed by
the gullet of an ox, in the axis of which is placed a cylindrical rod
of zinc. The dilute acid is poured into the membranous tube from
above by means of a funnel, and passes off, as occasion requires, by
a siphon tube at the lower part; while the space between the tube
and the sides of the copper cylinder is filled with a solution of sul
phate of copper, which is preserved in a state of saturation by a
quantity of this substance suspended in it by a cullender, allowing
it to percolate in proportion as it is dissolved. Two principal objects
are accomplished by this arrangement; first, the removal out of the
circuit of the oxide of zinc, the deposit of which is so injurious to
the continuance of the effect of the common battery; and, secondly,
the absorption of the hydrogen evolved upon the surface of the
copper, without the precipitation of any substance which would lead
to counteract the voltaic action of that surface.        The first is com
pletely effected by the suspension of the zinc rod in the interior
membranous cell into which fresh acidulated water is allowed slowly
to drop, in proportion as the heavier solution of the oxide of zinc
is withdrawn from the bottom of the cell by the siphon tube.
The second object is attained by charging the exterior space sur
rounding the membrane with a saturated solution of sulphate of
copper, instead of diluted acid; for, on completing the circuit, the
electric current passes freely through this solution, and no hydrogen
makes    itsappearance upon the conducting plate; but             beautiful        a
pink coating      pure copper      precipitated upon       and thus perpe  it,

   When the whole battery        properly arranged and charged
                                       is                               this            in

of theory; which mathematicians are therefore called upon to re
model and perfect.
   The author proceeds to consider the effect of the Moon's declina
tion on the Tides at Liverpool; which, as before observed, it is ne
cessary to eliminate, in order to obtain the Solar inequality; and
gives an explanation of various formulae and tables constructed for
that object.    He then investigates the laws of the solar inequalities,

   “Report of Magnetic Experiments tried on board an Iron Steam
Vessel, by order of the Right Hon. the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty.”    By Edward J. Johnson, Esq., Commander, R.N., ac
companied by plans of the vessel, and tables showing the horizontal
deflection of the Magnetic Needle at different positions on board, to
gether with the dip and magnetic intensity observed at those posi
tions, and compared with that obtained on shore with the same                  in
struments.     Communicated by Captain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S.,
Hydrographer to the Admiralty; by command of the Right Hon. the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
   This report commences with a description of the iron steam-vessel,
the “Garryowen,” belonging to the City of Dublin Steam Packet
 Company, and built by the Messrs. Laird, of Liverpool.           She is con
structed of malleable     iron, is 281 tons    burthen,  and draws only 54
feet  water, although    the   weight  of iron in the   hull, machinery, &c.
is 180 tons.
   This vessel was placed under the directions of the author, in Tar
bert Bay, on the Shannon, on the 19th of October, 1835, for the pur
pose of investigating         its
                             local attractions    onthe compass.    The me
thods which were      adopted   with that view are    given;   together  with
tables of the results      the several experiments, and plans
                             of                                       the va

rious parts  of  the Garryowen.         The horizontal deflections        of
                                                                          the
magnetic needle         different situations      the vessel were observed,

                                                 in
for the purpose        ascertaining the most advantageous place for            a
steering compass, and also for the application              of
                                                         Professor Barlow's
correcting plate: and the dip and intensity           these situations were,
                                                       in
at  the same time, noted.
   An experiment      detailed, showing that where several magnetic
                     is
needles, freely suspended, were placed upon the quay,         Tarbert
                                                                    in
Bay, and the vessel warped from the anchorage towards them, first
with her head   inthat direction and then with her stern, opposite de
flections were produced:       the first case
                                    in                all
                                               the needles showing             a

                                                           379
deviation to the eastward, and in the latter to the westward, of the
true magnetic meridian.
    Considering the height of the general mass of iron in the vessel
and also that of the head and stern, together with the distance (169
feet) at which some of the needles indicated a deviation, the author
concludes that the respective deflections were caused by the magnetic
influence of the iron in the vessel; the combined effect of that about
the bows representing the north pole of a magnet, and that about
the stern a south pole.       He then offers several suggestions for future
observation on this subject, and connected with the little oxidation
that is reported to have taken place in the vessel.
   The experiments having been interrupted by a continuance of wet
and stormy weather, the author proceeds to draw the following gene
 ral practical conclusions, deduced from the series                observations                    of
already made, and points out the further experiments which                  con                                   he

   A paper was read,                  “On
                              the reciprocal attractions of positive

  The author found that a square plate of copper, six inches in dia
meter, placed vertically in the plane of the magnetic meridian, and
connected with a voltaic battery by means of wires soldered to the
middle of two opposite sides of the plate, exhibited magnetic polarities
on   its
       two surfaces, indicative        the passage

          the wires.    The   polarities  were      opposite     kindsof     each

  FRANCIS BAILY, Esq., Vice-President            and Treasurer, in the
                                    Chair.
   The reading of Professor Forbes's paper, “On the Temperatures
and Geological Relations of certain Hot Springs; particularly those
of the Pyrenees; and on the Verification of Thermometers,” was
resumed and concluded.
   The author expresses his regret that notwithstanding the great     in
terest, more especially in a geological point of view, which attaches
to every topic connected with the origin, the nature, and the perma
nence in temperature of the many thermal springs met with in dif
ferent parts of the world, our information on these subjects is exceed
ingly deficient.    On many points which might easily be verified, and
which are of essential consequence towards obtaining a satisfactory
theory of the phenomena, we as yet possess but vague and uncertain
knowledge. It is evident that the first step towards the establish
ment of such a theory must consist in the precise determination of
the actual temperature of each spring; from which we may derive
the means of estimating by comparative observations, at different
periods, the progressive variations, whether secular, monthly, or even
diurnal, to which that temperature is subject.      We have at present,
indeed, not only to lament the total absence of exact data on which
to found such an inquiry; but we are obliged to confess that, owing
to the difficulties which meet us even in the threshhold, we have not,
even at the present day, made any preparation for establishing the
basis of future investigation, by applying such methods of experiment
as are really in our power, and are commensurate with the superior
accuracy of modern science.        The researches of Fourier would lead
us to the conclusion    that, if the high temperature of these springs
be derived   solely from that of the interior portions of the earth, the
changes which can have occurred in that temperature, during any
period to which history extends, must be so minute as to be inappre
ciable.   On the other hand, the theory of internal chemical changes,
which have been assigned as the origin of volcanos, would suggest it
as improbable that this temperature has remained constantly the

                                                        383
same ; and as a more likely occurrence, even were we to suppose that
no uniform secular diminution took place, that it would be liable to
occasional irregular fluctuations. The influence of earthquakes on
the temperature of hot springs is also admitted; and it would be very
desirable to learn, from a series of consecutive observations, whether
abrupt changes, similar to those which have occasionally been noticed,
are not of frequent occurrence.
   The author has diligently laboured to collect, by observations made
on the spot, materials for supplying this great chasm in the natural
history of our globe. As an essential preliminary means of obtaining
accurate results, he applied himself to the verification of the scales of
the thermometers he employed in these researches: and he describes,
in a separate section of this paper, the methods which he adopted
for the attainment of this object. He first fixed with great precision
the standard points of each thermometer, namely the freezing and
boiling temperatures of water, by a mode which he specifies: and
afterwards determined the intermediate points of the scale by a me
thod, similar to that of Bessel; namely, that of causing a detached
column of mercury to traverse the tube; but simpler in practice.
Instead of employing                   for
                              that purpose columns       mercury    arbi             of                  of

              the tube having equal capacities, the author detaches                                            a
column      mercury
            of        from the rest,     such    length    may

   The author has found that the constant battery, of which he de
scribed the construction in a former communication to the Royal So
ciety, might be rendered not only perfectly steady in           action, but                  its

in the present paper, to lay before the Society a series of mathematical
formulae, embodying the most general expressions for the phenomena
of the motion of carriages on these roads.
    The author begins by investigating the analytical formulae for
the traction of trains over a level line which is perfectly straight, and
finds, first, the distance and time within which, with a given amount
of tractive power, the requisite speed may be obtained at starting;
and also the point where the tractive power must be suspended, pre
vious to coming to rest. The excess of tractive power necessary to get
up the requisite speed is shown to be equal to the saving of tractive
power previous to a stoppage; and formulae are given for the determi
nation of the time lost under any given conditions at each stop.
    The motion of trains in ascending inclined planes which are straight,
is next considered; and formulae are given combining the effects of
friction and gravity, in opposition to the tractive force. The cir
cumstances which affect every change of speed, and the excess of
tractive force necessary, in such cases, to maintain the requisite
speed, are determined; as well as the other circumstances already
stated with respect to level planes.
   The friction of trains upon descending planes is next investigated;
and an important distinction is shown to exist between two classes of
planes; viz., those whose acclivities are inferior to the angle of re
pose, and those of more steep acclivities.    A remarkable relation is
shown to exist between the tractive forces in ascending and descend
ing the first class of planes. For descending planes of greater acclivity
than the angle of repose, the use of breaks becomes essentially re
quisite. The effect of these contrivances is investigated, as well as
the motion of trains on the accidental failure of breaks.
   In any attempts which have been hitherto made to obtain the
actual velocities acquired by trains of carriages or waggons under
these circumstances, an error has been committed which invalidates
the precision of the results; the carriages having been treated as
sledges moving down an inclined plane. The author has here given
the analytical formulae by which the effect of the rotatory motion of
the wheels may be brought into computation; this effect, depending
obviously on the amount of inertia of the wheels, and on the propor
tion which their weight bears to the weight of the waggon.
   The properties investigated in this first division of the paper, are
strictly those which depend on the longitudinal section of the line,
                                                                      to on is,
presumed to be straight in every part of       its direction. There
however, another class    of important resistances which depend
the ground-plan  of  the road, and these the author next proceeds
determine.
   The author then gives the analytical formulae which express the
resistance arising, first, from the inequalityof  the spaces over which
the  wheels, fixed   on the same axle, simultaneously  move; secondly,
from the effort of  the  flanges
                               of the wheels to change  the direction of
the train; and thirdly, from the centrifugal force pressing the flange
against the side      the rail. He also gives the formulae necessary
                                                                      byto

a   given velocity and a given load, and investigates the extent to which
these resistances    may  be modified by laying the outer rail of the
curve   higher  than the inner.     He assigns a formula for the de
termination of the height which must be given to the outer rail, in
order to remove as far as possible                                  all
                                         retardation from these causes                                                            ;

effect of curves involving changes of direction of the road, the velocity
of the transit, and the distance between the rails; but, for the reason
already stated, not comprising the radii of the curves.
   Although the radii of the curves do not form a constant element of
the estimate of the mechanical power necessary to work the road,
nevertheless they are of material consequence, as far as regards the
safety of the transit.    Although a short curve with a great resistance
may be moved over with the same expenditure of mechanical power
as a long curve with a long radius, yet, owing to the intensity of the
pressure of the flange against the rail, the danger of the trains run
ning off the road is increased : hence, although sharp curves cannot
be objected to on the score of loss of power, they are yet highly ob
jectionable on the score of danger.
    In the present paper, the author has confined himself to the ama
lytical formulae expressing various mechanical effects of the most
general kind; the coefficients and constants being expressed merely
by algebraical symbols: but he states that he has made an extensivese
ries of experiments within the last few years, and has also procured the
results of experiments made by others, with a view to determine the
mean values of the various constants in the formulae investigated in
this paper.    He has also, with the same view, made numerous ob
servations in the ordinary course of transit on railways; and he an
nounces his intention of soon laying before the Society, in another
paper, the details of these experiments, and the determination of the
mean values of these various constants, without which the present
investigation would be attended with little practical knowledge.

and concluded.
    In this memoir the author gives an account of the optical proper
ties of certain minute crystals, obtained by the evaporation of a solu
tion of borax in phosphoric acid, exhibited when they are examined
by means of the polarizing microscope.             The field of view is then
seen covered with minute circular spots, each composed of a close
assemblage of delicate acicular crystals, radiating from the centre;
together with other circular bodies, in which this disposition is not
observable, on account of the close union of the component crystals,
which, producing optical contact, gives perfect transparency to the
whole mass. When the field of view is rendered dark by the rectan
gular crossing of the polarizing laninae, each of these little circles
becomes luminous, and exhibits a well-defined dark cross, dividing
in its
     area into four equal sectors. These crosses have similar position                        a
    all the circles; and their direction remains unaltered when the
 crystals are turned round       their own plane,

under favourable circumstances           illumination, the author observed

gent light consists of equal portions polarized in every plane, and
according to every diameter of the circle. This action is similar to
that which would be exerted by an assemblage of an infinite number
of pieces of tourmaline cut into the form of infinitely small sectors,
in the direction of the axis, and disposed as radii in a circle. The
author considers it probable that the tourmaline itself is an aggregate
of acicular crystals of this description, disposed in a direction parallel
to      its
       axis, and being          optical contact,

the statical and dynamical effects of friction have been confounded to
gether; whereas they are the same in amount only when the body is
put in motion by gravity; but not when it is urged down an inclined
plane by an extraneous force. In the latter case these effects are no
longer comparable; friction being a force which, in an infinitely small
time, is proportional to the velocity, while that of gravity is constant
at   all
      velocities; or,     other words, the retardation from friction

   A paper   was read, entitled “Note relative to the supposed origin
of the deficient rays in the Solar Spectrum; being an account of an
experiment made at Edinburgh during the Annular Eclipse of May 15,
1836.” By James D. Forbes, Esq., Professor of Natural Philosophy
in the University of Edinburgh.
   The observation that some of the rays of light, artificially produced,
are absorbed by transmission through nitrous acid gas, had suggested
to Sir David Brewster the idea that the dark spaces in the solar pris
matic spectrum may, in like manner, be occasioned by the absorption
of the deficient rays during their passage through the sun's atmosphere.
It occurred to the author that the annular eclipse of the sun of the
present year would afford him an opportunity of ascertaining whether
any difference in the appearance of the spectrum could be detected
when the light came from different parts of the solar disc, and had
consequently traversed portions of the sun's atmosphere of very dif
 ferent thickness; and that accurate observations of this kind would
put the hypothesis in question to a satisfactory test. The result of the
 experiment was that no such differences could be perceived; thus
 proving, as the author conceives, that the sun's atmosphere is in no
 way concerned with the production of the singular phenomenon of
 the existence of dark lines in the solar spectrum.
    A  paper was also read, entitled “On the connexion of the anterior
 columns of the Spinal Cord with the Cerebellum; illustrated by pre
 parations of these parts in the Human subject, the Horse, and the
 Sheep.”     By Samuel Solly, Esq., Lecturer on Anatomy and Physi
 ology at St. Thomas's Hospital, M.R.I., Fellow of the Royal Medical
 and Chirurgical Society, and Member of the Hunterian Society.

    The exact line of demarcation between the tracts of nervous matter,
 subservient to motion and to sensation, which compose the spinal cord,
 has not yet been clearly determined.       The proofs which exist of a
 power residing in the cerebellum which regulates and controls the

actions of muscles, would lead us to suppose that the fibres of the
motor nerves are continuous with those of the cerebellum ; but hi
therto no observations have been made which prove the existence of
this connexion; and it is the object of the author, in this paper, to
establish, by a more careful examination of the anatomical structure
of this part of the nervous system, such continuity of fibres between
the anterior columns of the spinal cord and the cerebellum.       The
corpora pyramidalia have been hitherto considered as formed by the
entire mass of the anterior, or motor columns of the spinal cord; but
the author shows that not more than one half of the anterior columns
enters into the composition of these bodies: and that another portion,
which he terms the antero-lateral column, when traced on each side
in      its
       progress upwards,     found    cross the cord below the corpora
                                         is              to
olivaria, forming, after mutual decussation, the surface    the corpora                           of
restiformia; and ultimately being continuous with the cerebellum.
These fibres are particularly distinct    the medulla oblongata
                                                                                                                  of of

sheep and           of
               the horse.  The author conceives that the office   the

in the negro is smaller than in the European, and consequently makes,
in this respect, an approach to that of the ape, in which it is still farther
diminished. The author denies that there is any innate difference
in the intellectual faculties of these two varieties of the human race;
and maintains that the apparent inferiority of the Negro is altogether
the result of the demoralizing influence of slavery, and of the long
continued oppression and cruelty which have been exercised towards
this unhappy portion of mankind by their more early civilized, and con
sequently more successful competitors for the dominion of the world.

an extensive system of Tide Observations, made on the Coasts of
Europe and America, in June 1835.” By the Rev. William Whewell,
F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
   The author having, in several previous communications to the Royal
Society, urged the importance of simultaneous tide observations made
at distant places, here gives an account of the steps taken to carry
this plan into effect, in consequence of his representations, both by
the Government in England, and by the other maritime powers of
Europe. He explains, in the present paper, the general character of
the observations thus obtained, the mode employed in reducing them,
and enters at considerable length into a discussion of the immense
mass of information which they supply with respect to the phenomena
of the tides. One of his principal objects was to            with precisionfix

  The discussions            of   tide observations which the author has hitherto
   various times laid before the Society, were instituted with reference
to at
   the transit         of
                  the Moon immediately preceding the time            high                of

                        to
very satisfactorily that the laws      which the phenomena are subject

accord generally with the views propounded long since by Bernoui<U+017F>i.
The relations which the author points out between the height of high
water and the atmospheric pressure as indicated by the barometer are
particularly interesting and important. The influence of the wind is
also considered; and such corrections indicated as are requisite in
consequence of the employment by several observers of solar instead
of mean time.

   4. “On the Powers on which the Functions of Life depend in the more
perfect Animals, and on the Manner in which these Powers are asso
ciated in their more complicated results.” By A. P. W. Philip, M.D.,
F.R.S.
  This paper is divisible into three portions.In the first, the author
considers the functions and seat of each of the powers of the living
animal ; in the second, the nature of each power; and in the third,
the manner in which they are associated in the more complicated re
sults which constitute life.
   Of these powers the simplest is the muscular, which consists
merely in a contractile power residing in the muscular fibre itself:
and various experiments are referred to in proof that it depends ex
clusively on the state of this fibre, and in no degree on that of the
nervous system, which some physiologists have regarded as the real
seat of this power: for, instead of being recruited, it is exhausted by
the action of the nervous system upon                                  it,

the only powers of this class which are concerned in the maintenance
of life.
   The functions of the living blood are evidently those of supplying
the proper materials, in their requisite condition, (to the preservation
of which the vital powers are essential,) for the action of the nervous
power, properly so called, in the processes of secretion and assimila
tion. The seat of the powers of the blood is in itself; as appears
from  itsretaining them for short time after    a    separated from the           it  is
body.
   These four vital powers, viz. the muscular, the nervous, the sen
sorial, and that     living blood, have
                            of              direct dependence       one    no                                      on

The system of muscles, both of inspiration and of expiration, is mi
nutely detailed, and their various modes of action examined. He
next investigates the series of nerves appropriated to the exercise of
the respiratory function, and establishes a distinction in the offices of
these nerves, corresponding to the sources from which they derive
their origin, and presenting remarkable analogies with similar distinc
tions in the nerves of vertebrate animals.   The manner in which re
spiration is performed, and the phenomena presented with regard to
this function under various circumstances, such as submersion, and
confinement in unrespirable or deleterious gases, are next considered.
An account is then given of a series of experiments made with a view
to determine the quantity of oxygen consumed, and of carbonic acid
produced, by the respiration of various kinds of insects in different
states, from which the conclusion is drawn that the quantity of air
deteriorated is governed by several circumstances not necessarily con
nected with the natural habits of the species. When the insect is in

                        of                                                car                                            of
bonic acid. He thinks that,         this change taking place, the olefiant
                                                       on

                                  407
gas is held in solution by the water by an affinity which can be over
come, and that the foreign matter which, with the carbon, formed the
sugar, or other vegetable substance, is then at liberty to form new
combinations. He finds that the products resulting from the decom
position exceed the weight of the sugar, or other vegetable matter,
by about 10 per cent. of the former, and from 11 to 12 per cent. of
the latter, as calculated according to the prevailing theory that sugar,
or vegetable matter, is the only substance decomposed during the
process of vinous fermentation.
   From his analysis of sugar he obtains certain proportions of water
and of carbonic acid which are different from those given by preceding
chemists, the carbonic acid being 45 to 45.5 per cent.       His analysis
of alcohol gives him 59-7 to 60  per  cent. of olefiant gas, the remain
der being water.
   His experiments on the acetous and putrefactive fermentations are
numerous and elaborate,    and the results, which are nearly the same
as those of former   analyses, are given in a tabular form.    He finds
that in the acetous fermentation 57 parts by weight of olefiant gas,
5 of sugar, or other vegetable matter, and 64 of oxygen from the            at
mosphere, combine to form 100 parts of acetic acid, and about 24 of
water; leaving an insoluble substance at liberty to form other com
binations : and thus includes in his account of this process the decom
position of vegetable matter, which is overlooked in the generally re
ceived theory.
   During the putrefactive fermentation of vinous fermented liquors,
when exposed to the atmosphere, the author considers that one equi
valent of carbon from the olefiant gas (= 6-12) unites with two of
oxygen from the atmosphere (= 16*) to form 22:12 parts of carbonic
acid : while one equivalent of hydrogen from the olefiant gas (= 1.)
combines with one of atmospheric oxygen (= 8) to form 9 parts of
water; a portion of sugar, or other vegetable matter, being also de
composed; and an insoluble substance remaining, which, on exposure
to the air, undergoes further decomposition, and forms products highly
deleterious. The author is not aware that this latter decomposition
has been hitherto noticed.
   During the putrefactive fermentation of acetic acid exposed to the
atmosphere, he regards one equivalent of carbon from acetic acid
(= 6-12) as combining with two of atmospheric oxygen (= 16*) to
form 22:12 parts of carbonic acid : the oxygen and hydrogen, with
which the carbon had formed the acetic acid, remain in the state of
water, as they are found by analysis in this substance: a portion of
vegetable matter is also decomposed;  and an insoluble substance left
behind. Other substances are also formed during some of the changes
resulting from exposure to the air.
   During the direct putrefactive fermentation of solutions of sugar,
or other vegetable matters, he finds, that one equivalent of       its   car
bon (= 6-12) unites with two        atmospheric oxygen (= 16*),

tween different velocities of rotation in these instruments and the
corresponding effects: first, with regard to the deflection of a mag
netic galvanometer; secondly, with regard to chemical decompo
sitions; thirdly, with regard to the production of sparks; and lastly,
with regard to the intensity of the shock communicated to the hu
man body.      He compares the effects produced by the magnetic
electrical battery, first, when the coil consisted          continuous           *...
length of wire; secondly, when the coil was doubled upon itself so
as to constitute two sets of conductors of half the length of the
former; thirdly, when, upon being again doubled, it composed four
conductors of one quarter of the length of the first; and lastly, when,
on being doubled a third time, the electric current was made to pass
through eight wires, each one eighth of the original length of the
single wire. It was found that by thus multiplying the channels of
conduction, although both the magnetic and the luminous effects
continue to be produced with scarcely any sensible difference of
intensity, the power of effecting chemical decompositions becomes
more and more impaired, and the physiological influence is weak
ened in a still more remarkable degree. In the four-stranded coil,                                         in
deed, no shock whatever could be produced, however rapidly the in
strument was made to revolve. The author endeavours to account for
 these variations of effect by the diminution of velocity in the elec
                      its
                                                                                                           to its
 tric current,      quantity remaining unaltered, consequent                                          on

                                   the multiplied channels offered
 its progress. He also tried the effects      conjoining the magnetic
                                                                  of
 electrical machine with ordinary voltaic combinations; sometimes
 acting  in cooperation, and    other times   at opposition     one an in                   to
 other; and notices the corresponding results, which were sufficiently
 accordant with theory.

  At  a Special General Meeting of the Royal Society, convened by
     order of H. R. Highness the President and Council, to take into

. The Secretary, by direction of the Chairman, read a requisition,
  signed by Dr. Granville and five other Fellows, to convene a Spe
  cial General Meeting of the Royal Society for the purpose of con
  sidering and determining the necessity of expunging from the Jour
  nal-Book of the Society the minutes of certain Resolutions passed
  at three several ordinary meetings on account of an alleged informa
  lity, and also the            of the Resolution of the 5th of May,
                     {...".
  which goes to withhold the thanks of the Society to the author of
  a work presented by him to the Society, which requisition was de
  livered to the Secretary at the ordinary meeting on the 2nd in
  stant.
     The Chairman then informed the Society, that, upon the above
  requisition being laid before the Council, they passed the following
  resolutions, viz.
     “That it is the unanimous opinion of His Royal Highness the
  “President, and the Council, that no Special Meeting has the
  “power of expunging minutes of past proceedings of the Society.”
     “That a General Special Meeting of the Society be called on
  “ the 23rd instant, at two o'clock, for the purpose of taking into
  “ consideration that part of the above requisition which proposes
  “ to afford to the Society an opportunity of taking into considera
  “tion the principle of the Resolution passed on the 5th ult, which
  “goes to withhold the thanks of the Society from the author of a
  “work presented by him to the Society.”
     The Chairman then made a statement of what had taken place at
  the meetings of the Society with regard to the Resolutions referred
  to in the above requisition.
     On being asked by a Fellow present, by what authority the pre
  sent meeting had been convened, he referred him to Statute I.
  Chap. XII. of the Statutes, which is as follows:
     “The President or Council may at any time call a Special Gene
  “ral Meeting of the Society when it may appear to them to be ne
  “ cessary.”
     It was then moved and seconded, That, in the opinion of this
  meeting, the meeting of May the 5th exercised a sound discretion
  in refusing thanks to Dr. Granville for his publication entitled “The
  Royal Society in the XIXth Century”; which motion, being put,
  was carried in the affirmative.

Gilpin and of Beaufoy, omitting however to mention the important
ones by Canton, he observes that the arctic expeditions have fur
mished a rich harvest of important observations to Captains Sabine,
Franklin, Parry, Foster, Beechey, and James. Ross, and Lieutenant
Hood *; and that thus physical geography is indebted to the at
tempts which have been made to discover the north-west passage,
and also to the explorations of the icy coast of Asia, by Wrangel,
Lutke, and Anjou, for a considerable accession of knowledge in ter
restrial magnetism and meteorology. Excited, he observes, by the
great discoveries of Oersted, Arago, Ampere, Seebeck, and Faraday,
MM. Hansteen, Due and Adolphe Erman have explored, in the
whole of the immense extent of Northern Asia, the course of the iso
clinal, isogonal, and isodynamic curves; and M. Adolphe Erman has
had the advantage during a long voyage from Kamtschatka round
Cape Horn to Europe, of observing the three manifestations of ter
restrial magnetism on the surface of the earth, with the same                                   in
struments and by the same methods which he had employed from
Berlin to the mouth of the Obi, and thence to the sea of Okhotsk.
   M. de Humboldt remarks that our epoch, marked by great disco
veries in optics, electricity, and magnetism, is characterized by the
possibility of connecting phenomena by the generalization of em
pirical laws, and by the mutual assistance rendered by sciences
which had long remained isolated. Now, he observes, simple ob
servations of horary variation or of magnetic intensity made at
places far distant from each other, reveal to us what passes at great
depths in the interior of our planet or in the upper regions of our
atmosphere: those luminous emanations, those polar explosions
which accompany the “magnetic storm” appear to succeed the
changes which the mean or ordinary tension of terrestrial magnetism
undergoes.                   -
   M. de Humboldt considers that it deeply interests the advance
ment of mathematical and physical sciences that, under the auspices
of His Royal Highness the President, the Royal Society should

and adds, that, perhaps, they would also previously concert upon
the mode of publication of partial observations and of mean re
sults.
     M. de Humboldt finally refers to the labours and accurate ob
servations of M. Gauss at the Observatory of Göttingen.       The me
thods, however, adopted by M. Gauss being already before the
Royal Society in a memoir which has been communicated by him,
renders it unnecessary here to enter into the explanation given of
them by M. de Humboldt.         He has referred to them in order that
those members of the Royal Society who have most advanced the
study of terrestrial magnetism, and who are acquainted with the
localities of colonial establishments, may take into consideration,
whether, in the new stations to be established, a bar of great weight
furnished with a mirror should be employed, or whether Gambey's
 needle should be used: his wish is only to see the lines of magnetic
 stations extended, by whatever means the precision of the observa
 tions may be attained.
     M. de Humboldt concludes by begging His Royal Highness to
excuse the extent of his communication.        He considered it would
 be advantageous to unite under a single point of view what has been
 done or prepared in different countries towards attaining the object
 of great simultaneous operations for the discovery of the laws of
 terrestrial magnetism.
     Having very fully laid before the Council the contents of M. de
  Humboldt's letter, we have now to offer our opinion upon the sub
 ject it embraces. There can, we consider, be no question of the im
 portance of the plan of observation which is here proposed for the
 investigation of the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, or of the
 prospect which such a plan holds out of the ultimate discovery of
 the laws by which those phenomena are governed. Although the
 most striking of these phenomena have now been known for two
  centuries, although careful observations of them have within that
 period been made, and that still more care and attention have been
  bestowed upon those more recently discovered, yet the accessions
  to our knowledge, not only regarding the cause of the phenomena,
  but even with respect to the laws which connect them, bears a very
  small proportion to the mass of observations which have been made.
  This has arisen in a great measure, if not wholly, from the imper
  fection of the data from which attempts have been made to draw
  conclusions. Whatever theories may have been advanced in ex
  planation of these phenomena, or attempts made to connect them
  by empirical laws, still, whenever comparisons have been instituted
 between the results of observation and such theories or laws, it has,
 in general, been doubtful whether the discrepancies which have been
 found might not as justly be attributed to errors in the observations,
  as to fallacies in the theory or incorrectness in the laws.   Under
  these circumstances, the Royal Society, as a society for the promo
  tion of natural knowledge, cannot but hail with satisfaction a pro
  position for carrying on observations of phenomena most interest
  ing in their nature and most obscure in their laws, in a manner that

                                                       423
shall not only give greater precision to the observations, but at the
same time render all the results strictly comparative.
   There are, however, other grounds on which such a proposition as
that made by M. de Humboldt should be most cordially received
by the Royal Society. This Society is here called upon, as a mem
ber of a great confederation, to cooperate with several other mem
bers, already in active cooperation, for the attainment of an object
which ought to be common to all; and to such a call the Royal So

 magnetism, by simultaneous observations made at a few well-chosen
 fixed stations, than by an almost indefinite multiplication of obser

    That a magnetic chart that should correctly exhibit the several
 lines of equal variation, Humboldt's “Isogonal Lines”, would be of
 the greatest advantage to navigation, those who are best qualified
 to judge are most ready to admit. If to these lines were added the
 isoclinal lines, or lines of equal dip, the value of such a chart would,
 for the purposes of navigation in particular, be greatly enhanced.

                                     Humboldt has mentioned Quebec                                                           as
                                                                                                                              a
desirable station. To this place, and also              Montreal, we conceive     to
that    anobjection exists,                    of
                                    which possibly M.           Humboldt       not          de                          is
aware: many               of
                       the houses       those cities are roofed with tinned
                                                     in
iron. This objection may not, however, exist                  some       the esta         in               of

                                                  425
that the most advantageous positions would be, one near the most
northerly establishments in Hudson's Bay, and another at or near to
Fort Resolution on Great Slave Lake. As, however, observers in
such positions would be placed almost beyond the pale of civilization,
we fear that, for some time at least, it will be found quite impracti
cable to obtain regular observations at these important stations. It
would likewise be desirable that there should be a station in Nova
Scotia or Newfoundland: the latter would be the preferable position.
   If the Government of the United States were to give their cordial
cooperation to M. de Humboldt's plan, by the establishment of three
or more permanent magnetical observatories, in different longitudes,
these, with what we may expect to be undertaken by Russia in the
extreme north-west, and our own establishments, would afford the
means of obtaining a mass of more interesting magnetical observa
tions than could perhaps be derived from any other portion of the
earth's surface.
   M. de Humboldt mentions New Holland, Ceylon, the Mauritius,
the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and a point on the east coast of
South America, as desirable stations, and we fully concur in the
propriety of the selection. Although Van Diemen's Land, from
its  greater proximity         the southern magnetic pole, would
                                  to                                                                    be

more advantageous position for magnetical observations than Para

   Although M. de Humboldt has not adverted to any other pointbé
sides Ceylon in our Indian possessions, yet no doubt he would, with
us, consider it desirable that observatories should be established at
different points on the continent of India; and it appears to us that
Calcutta and Agra are in positions well adapted for the purpose.
As, however, there is an Astronomical Observatory established at
Madras, there would be greater facility in obtaining magnetical ob
servations there than at places where no such establishment exists.
We feel assured that the East India Company, which has shown so
much zeal and liberality in the promotion of scientific inquiry, and
such a desire for the advancement of scientific knowledge in the ex
tensive possessions under                its
                                   controul, would afford        powerful as          its

Swan River, the latter being a most desirable station. We have not
alluded to the observatory at the Cape of Good Hope; if however no
such establishment existed, the presence of Sir John Herschel would
ensure cooperation there, in any plan calculated to advance sci
entific knowledge. Thus, altogether, there might be formed a most
extensive spread of stations, in which the principal expense would
consist in the purchase of the requisite instruments; and the means
of establishing stations where the same facilities do not exist might
afterwards be taken into consideration. As it would be necessary
that, at all the stations, observations of the barometer, thermometer,
and of atmospheric phenomena should be made simultaneously
with the magnetical observations, these would altogether form a
mass of valuable meteorological information which it would be
scarcely possible to collect by any other means.
    There is one point in M. de Humboldt's communication on which
we have not yet touched : the nature of the instruments best cal
culated to attain the objects in view by the establishment of mag
netical observatories. This is a subject on which it will be most
proper to enter fully when their establishment has been determined
upon ; and we would recommend that then a Committee should be
appointed to investigate the subject, and that this Committee should
report to the Council of the Royal Society what instruments they
 consider it would be most advisable to adopt at                       all
                                                             the stations, and,
at  the same    time, give     in   an

                                                    expense    that must     in                   be
 curred for one complete set             of
                                     such instruments. We may, however,
in  the mean time, offer       remark                 on
                                              one apparatus referred         by                    to

                 the governments under which they flourish.            To sup
 pose, even without the example thus held out, that the Government
 of  this, the first maritime and commercial nation           the globe, should

vigation, would imply that our Government is not alive either to
the interests or to the scientific character of the country, and would
show that we had little attended to the history, even in our own
times, of scientific research, which has been so liberally promoted
by the Government.       Although the investigation of the phenomena
of terrestrial magnetism   was not the primary object of the expedi
tions which have     now,   almost uninterruptedly, for twenty years
been fitted out  by  Government,       another of which, and one of the
highest interest, is on the point of departure, yet a greater acces
sion of observations of those phenomena has been derived from
these expeditions than from any other source in the same period.
We therefore feel assured that, when it shall have been represented to
the Government that the plan of observation advocated by the Baron
de Humboldt is eminently calculated to advance our knowledge of
the laws which govern some of the most interesting phenomena in
physical science; it appears to be perhaps the only one by which
we can hope ultimately to discover the cause of these phenomena;

     GENTLEMEN,
I   APPEAR before you, after an absence of two years from this
chair, under circumstances which deeply affect my feelings. I have
been secluded, during nearly the whole of that period, from the
active business of life and of society, by the slow but sure ap
proaches of almost total blindness; by preparations for a most de
licate and, to me, most important operation, and by the precautions
which were necessary to accomplish my recovery, after it had been
most skilfully and successfully performed. In resuming now, there
fore, my public duties in this place,     Ifeel sensibly the novelty of
                   I
my situation, as if were entering, by the blessing of God, upon a
new tenure of existence, which, whilst it offers to my view many
prospects of happiness, imposes upon me likewise heavy responsi
 bilities; andI    can only express my fervent hope and prayer, that
 the same merciful Providence which has vouchsafed, through his
 appointed means, to restore me to sight, may enable me, like a
 willing and humble-minded scholar, to apply the lessons taught me
 by the experience of my past life, to the just and useful regulation
                                      I
 of that portion of my course which may be still permitted to run.
    It is my first and most pleasing duty, Gentlemen, to thank you
 for your congratulations upon my recovery, which have been con
 veyed to me in terms most grateful to my feelings.    I have on many
 occasions experienced both your kindness and forbearance, and         I
  deeply regret that circumstances should so frequently have com
 pelled me to appeal to them: but at no moment could the expression
  of your good-will be more welcome to me than at the present, when    I
  am enabled to reappear amongst you, upon being again entrusted
                                                           I
  with the possession of that blessing, the value of which have learnt
  to appreciate more fully by my experience of   its privation.

                                                                430
    Could I have foreseen, when the progress of my malady first
 removed me from public life, the length of time which was to
elapse before            its
                        termination, even          case     could have felt assured

the      establishment,   but likewise to protect your ordinary meetings
  from those   irregular    and somewhat tumultuary discussions on mat
 ters of   business,   or  personal   conduct, which might otherwise be in
 danger of arising.
     I believe that many persons have expressed a wish that the regula
 tions of this Society should be so far relaxed as to allow, in conformity
 with the practice of some other similar establishments, discussions
 upon the papers, and those papers only, which are read before us:                            I
 confess, for my own part, that I am not at present prepared to accede
 to this recommendation. A practice which has been sanctioned by
 the usage of more than a century and a half, and found to be produc
 tive of scientific results unrivalled for their extent and value, should
 not be abandoned by us without the most mature consideration; and
 though I am the last person to recommend a slavish submission to
 the dictates or to the customs of antiquity, which may be unsuited
 either to the altered circumstances of modern times, or incapable of
 defence upon other and independent grounds, yet a reverence is
justly due both to maxims and observances which have been sanc
 tioned by high authorities, or connected with great and important
 public benefits.      It may be quite true that such discussions would
 tend   materially  to increase the personal interest which is taken, by
 imany of our members, in our proceedings; but when we consider
 the abstract and abstruse nature of many of the papers which come
 before us, and which no single reading can make perfectly intel
 ligible, even to the best-instructed hearer, as well as the vast variety
 of subjects which they comprehend,               Ithink we may fairly infer
 that such discussions would           rarely add much to the stock of facts
or of reasonings which they contain, or that their influence would be
materially felt in the publications of your Transactions, which have
always formed, and which ought always to form, the great object of
the foundation of this Society, and the only means by which                   cha      its
racter and influence can continue             to   be maintained unimpaired
throughout the civilized world. When we likewise take into further
consideration the irregularities and personalities               which such de
                                                                   to

influence which the premature expression                opinions upon the con

sion     ofthe Council       inselecting them for publication, you will                      be
disposed       agree with me,
              to                     trust,    thinking that such          experi an

might prove ultimately injurious         to   the scientific character,        the     of

independent of the theoretical inferences that may be deduced from

  Mr. Pond              Dr. Maskelyne as Astronomer Royal in 1810,
                succeeded
and retired from that important situation, under the pressure of many
infirmities, in the autumn of last year: he was formerly a member of
Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a pupil of Professor Lax,
whose name appears also in the list of deaths which has been just
read to you. After leaving the University, he travelled in many
parts of the East, and particularly in Egypt, partly urged by the
spirit of adventure which is natural to youth and partly with a view
of making astronomical    observations in climates more pure and more
regular than our own. After his return home in 1800, he settled at
Westbury, in Somersetshire, and devoted himself, amidst other pur
suits, chiefly to astronomy, making use of a circular instrument of 2%
feet diameter, which had been constructed and divided by Troughton
with more than ordinary care. With this instrument he observed
by a peculiar method, the declinations of some of the principal fixed
stars, which were communicated to the Royal Society in 1806; and
it afterwards enabled him to establish the fact of a change of form
in the great quadrants at Greenwich, a discovery of great importance,
inasmuch as it not only led to the substitution of circular instru
ments for them in our national observatory, but subsequently like
wise to his own appointment as Astronomer Royal.
    After Mr. Pond's establishment at Greenwich, he communicated
 to the Royal Society from time to time, not merely the general re
 sults of his labours, but likewise his views of the theory of astrono
 mical observations and of the grounds of judging of their relative
 accuracy: his system was to observe differences of declination and
 right ascension, making every star a point of departure for the rest,
 and considering the pole as a point in the heavens whose position
 was capable of a determination, equally, and not more accurate than
 that of any given star. To such a view of the theory of observation,
 circular instruments were particularly adapted, and there is no reason
 to doubt that the relative catalogues of the stars which were formed
 by Mr. Pond were more accurate and complete than those of any
 preceding or cotemporary observer.      Such a result, however, might
 have been reasonably expected from the great powers and resources
 of the establishment over which he presided and which he had him.
 self been the chief means of calling into action.
    The method which was adopted by Mr. Pond to determine the
 limits of the annual parallax of certain fixed stars by means of fixed
 telescopes of great focal length, was singularly ingenious and com
 plete. The existence and amount of such a parallax had been asserted
 and assigned by Dr. Brinkley, in 2 Lyrae, a Aquilae, and a Cygni;
 but this opinion, although most ingeniously and even obstinately vin
 dicated and maintained by him, was, in the judgement of most other
 astronomers, most decisively negatived by Mr. Pond, who showed
 that the parallax of those fixed stars, supposing         its
                                                          amount           to   be
 sensible, was confined within the limits of the errors of the most deli
  cate and perfect observations which have been hitherto made. There

                                  435
is no great question in astronomy, the present position and limits of
which are more satisfactorily settled.
   Mr. Pond was remarkable for his skill and delicacy in the mani
pulation of his instruments, and no man was more capable of form
ing a correct judgement of their capacities and powers, and of the
nature and extent of the errors to which they were liable: he was in
the habit of placing great reliance on the results of a great num
ber of observations, when no apparent or assignable cause existed for
giving a determinate sign or character to the errors of individual ob
servations: this confidence, however, was founded on his great know
ledge of the theory of observation, and was fully justified by a com
parison both of his own results with each other, and with those of
other observers.
   Mr. Pond was a man of gentle and amiable character, and singu
larly candid and unprejudiced. His health for many years before his
death was greatly deranged, but he continued to struggle against the
progress of his infirmities, and, from a conscientious feeling, he never
abandoned the active duties of superintending the observatory, though
hardly able to sustain them.    He died in August last, at Lee, in Kent,
and was buried in the tomb of his great predecessor Halley.
   Mr. Pond, though a great practical astronomer and a man of un
commonly clear intellect and correct judgement, was deficient in one
very considerable qualification for the station which he filled,—I mean,
an acquaintance with the higher branches of Analysis, and their ap
plication to Physical Astronomy.      His successor, Gentlemen, is well
known to you, and needs no eulogium of mine; but I cannot omit
the opportunity which is now offered to me of congratulating the
friends of astronomy and of science on the appointment of a gen
tleman to this most important office, who is second to none in this
country in his great attainments in almost every department of accu
rate science, in his indefatigable and systematic industry, in his high
sense of public duty, and in his profound knowledge both of physical
and of practical astronomy.
   The names which I shall next bring before your notice are those
of three men, venerable alike for their great age and public services,
and who must always be regarded as entitled to hold a distinguished
place amongst that illustrious body of great men, who have been pro
duced or brought forward by the important trusts, the varied employ
ments, and, let me add likewise, the great rewards of our Indian empire;
I mean Sir Charles Wilkins, Mr. Marsden, and Captain Horsburgh.
   Sir Charles Wilkins went to India in 1770, and was the first
Englishman who thoroughly mastered the difficulties of the Sanscrit
language, of the classical works in which he published several
translations, and smoothed the obstacles to      its
                                                 attainment       by noble

                         composed for the especial benefit
                                             ,                         the

Bengali and Persian types which were used           Bengal, and

blishment of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, whose labours have
contributed so greatly to the advancement of our knowledge of the
languages and general condition of the provinces of our Eastern
empire.     It is now more than fifty years since he returned to this
country, in possession of a competent fortune and vigorous health,
which he continued to enjoy, in conjunction with every social and
domestic comfort, with hardly any interruption, to the day of his
death.    Sir Charles Wilkins was appointed, in 1800, Librarian of the
great collection of Oriental MSS., which are preserved in the India
 House; and this Society is indebted to him for the catalogue and
description of the Sanscrit and other Oriental MSS., which were
 presented to it by Sir William and Lady Jones.
    Sir Charles Wilkins was the father-in-law of Mr. Marsden,
 though nearly his cotemporary in age. They went to the East about
 the same time, and whilst one devoted himself to the study of the
 languages and literature of the ancient and modern inhabitants of
 continental India, the other availed himself of his position on the great
island of Sumatra and the Malayan peninsula, to gain a thorough ac
quaintance with the presentconditionand past history of that active and
adventurous race, whose character has been so deeply and so generally
impressed upon the languages and customs of nearly                         all
                                                                    the tribes who

tinued   to  enjoy  to    an extreme old age, extraordinary vigour both

    Captain James Horsburgh entered the sea service                        of

and islands of the Indian and Chinese seas. It was soon after his
return to Europe in 1805, that he communicated to this Society,
through Mr. Cavendish, his very remarkable observations of the
equatropical motions of the mercury in the barometer when at sea;
and contributed along with Captain Flinders, both by these observa
tions and by other directions which he subsequently published, to
make more fully known the importance of barometrical observations
at sea, as affording indications of great or sudden atmospheric
changes. Captain Horsburgh was soon afterwards appointed Hydro
grapher to the East India Company, with the usual judgement, and
discrimination of the Directors of that Body, in the selection and
rewarding of their officers; and it was in this capacity that he pub
lished not merely a great number of charts, but also “the East India
Sailing Directory,” the result of the unremitting labour of many
years, and founded partly upon his own observations, and partly
upon a very accurate examination and reduction of the vast hy
drographical records which are in the possession of the East India
Company; forming altogether one of the most valuable contributions
that was ever made by the labours of one man to the interests of
navigation.    Captain Horsburgh was the author of other works con
nected with his favourite science, and he continued to devote him
self, until within a few days of his death, with almost unexampled
industry, to those pursuits which had formed, throughout his whole
life, the means by which he sought to benefit his countrymen and
 mankind.

    Dr. David Hosack, of New York, was the author of a paper in
our Transactions, published in the year 1794. It related to the ex
planation of the power which is possessed by the eye of adapting
itself to different distances, which he attributed to the action of the
external muscles of the eye, and not to the dilatation and contraction
of the iris, nor to the muscularity of the crystalline lens, by which          its
convexity could      be                diminished,

    Sir William Gell was well known                   topographical antiquary,
                                                                 as   a

nesus, Attica and Rome. He was                very accomplished artist and

                                     439
ners. Sir William Gell was formerly Fellow of Emanuel College,
Cambridge, and was attached, for some time, in the quality of Vice
chamberlain, to the late Queen Caroline.         He spent the later years
of his life, a victim to the gout and other infirmities, at Naples, in
the neighbourhood of those remarkable ruins which he had so care
fully and so beautifully illustrated, and which continued to supply
him, from day to day, with fresh objects of interesting inquiry.
   Dr. Warren, though one of the most distinguished physicians in
this metropolis, contributed very little, by his writings, to medical or
general literature: he was considered to be an accomplished classical
scholar, and a man of very extensive acquirements: he was a
strenuous vindicator of the character and independence of his pro
fession, and though his manners were somewhat abrupt, and some
times apparently uncourteous, yet he was a man of very warm
affections, and greatly beloved and respected by a large body of
friends.
   Those to whom Dr.William Elford Leach was known in his happier
days, when in the full enjoyment of health and reason, can best ap
preciate the great loss which the natural sciences and our national
museum sustained by that melancholy visitation, which, like the
hand of death, terminated his scientific labours. His enthusiastic
devotion to his favourite studies, his great knowledge of details,
combined with no inconsiderable talents for classification, were
eminently calculated to raise him to the very highest eminence as an
original and philosophical naturalist. Though his career of research
and discovery was prematurely cutshort, yet we are chiefly indebted
to him for the first introduction into this country of the natural
system of arrangement in conchology and entomology, and for the
adoption of those more general and philosophical views of those
sciences which originated with Latreille and Cuvier. Dr. Leach was
the author of a paper in our Transactions on the genus Ocythoé,
to prove that it is a parasitical inhabitant of the Argonaut. He wrote
several memoirs in the Linnaean Transactions; an excellent treatise
on British Malacostraca: and he also contributed largely to the
Zoological Miscellany, to Brewster's Encyclopaedia and to the French
Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles.          He died of an attack of
cholera on the 25th of   August    last, at the Palazzo St. Sebastiano, in
the  province  of Tortona in   Italy.
   The last name which occurs in the melancholy list of our departed
compatriot associates, is that of Dr. William Henry, to whom the
science of chemistry generally, and of gaseous chemistry in parti
cular, is under great obligations. He was the author of nine papers
in our Transactions, many of them of great merit; and his System of
Chemistry is one of the best written and best arranged compen
diums of that important and extensive science, which has been pub
lished of late years, whether in our own language or in any other.
The Memoirs of the Manchester Society are chiefly indebted to
him, in conjunction with Dr. Dalton, for the high character which
they have so long maintained.        Dr. Henry, like Dr. Wollaston, made
the results of science, obtained by the most original and diffi

                                                     440
cult researches, the foundation of a splendid fortune, and few persons
have contributed more effectually, by their discoveries and exertions
to the promotion of those arts and manufactures which form the
foundation of the prosperity of a great commercial nation.
    The names of the Foreign members whom the Society has lost
during the last year are, André Marie Ampère and Antoine
Laurent de Jussieu, both of them members of the Académie des
Sciences de France.
    Mons. Ampère was born at Lyons in 1775, and made his first
appearance in the scientific world in a short work which showed con
siderable command of analysis, entitled Considérations sur la Théorie
Mathématique du Jeu, in which the question of the safety of habitual
and indefinite play, either against a single person of greater fortune,
or indifferently against any number of persons, even when the game
is perfectly fair and equal, is discussed and solved, and              result ex                     its

technic School, and published memoirs                      the integration       on                                  of

succeeded his uncle as administrator                                 of the Jardin des Plantes in 1779,
and published two memoirs of great originality and importance on
the relative value of characters in the distinction of the genera and
orders of plants.  In the year 1789 he published his great and truly
classical work entitled Genera Plantarum secundum Ordines na
turales disposita, which caused a total revolution in the science of
botany. To the modification and extension of the views contained in
that work, rendered necessary by new observations and by the vast
accession of new genera and orders, brought from the tropics,
South America, Australia, and elsewhere, he devoted the remainder
of his life. His later memoirs, many of which are of great value, are
chiefly contained in the Annales, and subsequently in the Mémoires
du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle.     M. de Jussieu was a man of very
simple manners and amiable character, of a social and affectionate tem
per, and a perfect stranger to scientific jealousies and intrigues. He
attained to an extreme old age, and had the happiness of witnessing
the almost universal adoption of that system of botanical arrange
ment, the establishment of which had formed the great object of the
labours of his life.
 The Secretary then read the following Report of the Proceedings of
                 the Council since the last Anniversary.
   The Council, on the 3rd of March, adopted a Report, submitted
to them by the Committee whom they had appointed for considering
the communications      from the Treasury and Excise Office, on the
subject of the construction of instruments and tables for ascertaining
the strength of spirits, in reference to the charge of duty thereon, and
ordered it to be transmitted to the Lords Commissioners of His
Majesty's Treasury; who, in acknowledging           receipt, were pleased           its
to express “their best thanks      H.        the President, and

   Before the researches     Mr. Kiernan, the liver was supposed
                                                  of                                                                                   to
consist    two dissimilar substances, composed
               of                                   brown parenchy                            of

matous granules, contained in a yellow substratum.        The relation
of the vessels and   excretory ducts to these supposed dissimilar sub
stances was not known; nor, although the organ was considered
 to be a conglomerate gland, were the glandules of which it was con
jectured to be composed, defined in magnitude, shape, or disposition.
 Mr. Kiernan's discoveries show that in place of two textures there
 exists but one ; and that the difference of colour results from the
 accidental congestion of one or other of the systems of vessels, which
are found in the liver. Mr. Kiernan has further satisfactorily de
monstrated the size and limits of the integral glandules of which
the liver consists.      He has traced the relation to these glandules of
the different orders of vessels, which are distributed through the organ,
and has explained the mechanism of biliary secretion.                      He has
shown that             all
                   the blood employed            secreting bile        in

modifying the form of different systems of organs.             The labours of
Mr. Newport have determined, with great exactness, those periods,
which had not before been ascertained.
    Among the numerous original observations of Mr. Newport on the
arrangement and connexions of the several parts of the nervous
system, the description he gives of the origin and distribution of the
visceral nerve, which he shows to be analogous to the pneumo
gastric nerve of vertebrated animals, and also of the system of nerves
corresponding to those which have been considered as peculiarly
subservient to the supply of the respiratory organs, are particularly
deserving of notice.       In the course of this investigation many new
and   important     facts are brought to light, which had escaped the
observation of    Lyonet,    Müller, Brandt and Straus-Durkheim.           Mr.
Newport has also traced a remarkable analogy in the origin and dis
tribution of the two distinct classes of nerves, the one subservient
to sensation, and the other to volition, belonging to insects, with
those belonging to vertebrated animals, and has thus given greater
extension to our views of the uniformity existing in the plans of
animal organization than we before possessed, and which are thus
made to comprehend the more minute, as well as the larger tribes
of the animal creation.
    In a memoir on the Respiration of Insects, more recently commu
nicated to the Society, and of which, at          last meeting    itsJune, the                in

 under circumstances which would have repressed the exertions of a
 less ardent inquirer into truth, the Council have considered Mr.
 Newport as highly deserving the distinction they have conferred
 upon him by the award of the Royal Medal for Animal Physiology in
 the present year.

sale of MSS. to the British Museum, which, together with the

be specially appropriated to particular purposes, and not to the ge

      FRANCIS BAILY,         Esq., W.P. and Treas., in the Chair.

   A paper  was read, entitled,  “Inquiries respecting the Constitu
tion of Salts. Of    Oxalates,   Nitrates,   Phosphates, Sulphates, and
Chlorides.” By Thomas Graham, Esq., F.R.S. Edin., Professor of
Chemistry in the Andersonian University of Glasgow, Correspond
ing Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin, &c. Com
municated by Richard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S.
   The results which the author had obtained from his former expe
riments, and of which he communicated an account to the Royal
Society, suggested to him the probability that the law with re
spect to water being a constituent of sulphates, would extend also
to any hydrated acid and the magnesian salt of that acid. As he
had already found that the sulphate of water is constituted like the
sulphate of magnesia, so he now finds the oxalate of water to re
semble the oxalate of magnesia, and the nitrate of water to resem
ble the nitrate of magnesia.     His researches render it probable that
the correspondence between water and the magnesian class of oxides
extends beyond their character as bases; and that in certain subsalts
of the magnesian class of oxides, the metallic oxide replaces the
water of crystallization of the neutral salt, and discharges a func
tion which was thought peculiar to water.         In the formation of a
double sulphate, the author finds that a certain degree of substitu
tion or displacement occurs; such as the displacement of an atom
of water pertaining to the sulphate of magnesia, by an atom of sul
phate of potash, to form the double sulphate of magnesia and pot
ash. The same kind of displacement appears to occur, likewise, in
the construction of double oxalates; and the application of this
principle enables us to understand the constitution both of the
double and super-oxalates, and to explain the mode of their deriva
tion.

In the  present   memoir,              he
                                describes some deviations from the usual
forms      of
          crystalline   circles; the most striking varieties consisting
the cross being itself highly coloured, instead               black, upon           of                        a in
white ground. The author shows that these crystals consist                bo                             of
racic acid alone, resulting from the decomposition              the borax by             of
the phosphoric acid.       He gives         explanation    an the optical ap        of
pearances they present          the    on

sence   or absence of combined water, are next described. These
sometimes produce crystals composed of two opposite sectors of a
circle, united at the centre; at other times, they exhibit irregular
elongated shapes, having a stem, either subdivided at both extremi
ties into minute diverging fibres, or abruptly truncated; and occa
sionally they present regular geometric forms : but, whatever be
their shape, they undergo, in general, spontaneous changes in the
course of one or two days after they have been formed.
    The author then notices a property belonging to some crystals,
similar to that possessed by the tourmaline, of analysing polarized
light; for which reason he denominates them analytic crystals. As
an example, he mentions those obtained by dissolving sulphate of
chromium and potash in tartaric acid by the aid of heat. A drop
of this solution, placed on a plate of glass, soon yields, by evapora
tion, filmy crystals, which frequently have this property.        The
plumose crystals of boracic acid, when crystallized from a solution
of borax in phosphoric acid, also possess this analytic power, and
present very beautiful appearances when viewed with the polarizing
microscope.      Another instance occurs in the oxalate of potash and
chromium, a salt whose optical properties have been investigated by
Sir David Brewster.       If
                           gum arabic be added to a solution of this
salt, and a drop of it be put between two plates of glass, a very
beautiful arborescent, but microscopic crystallization takes place,
composing a multitude of minute prisms, growing, as if by a species
of vegetation, and variously arranged in sprigs and branchlets, often
resembling in miniature, the tufts of marine confervae.       A similar
 plumose appearance, accompanied with the same analytic proper
 ties, is obtained from the evaporation of a drop of a mixed solution
 of nitre and gum arabic. This analytic effect is shown to be the
 consequence of the high degree of doubly refractive power pos
 sessed by these crystalline filaments, and which exists even in those
 whose diameter is evanescent on microscopic examination.          The
 author entertains hopes that it will be possible to obtain large and
 permanent artificial crystals, which may possess the advantages of
 the tourmaline, without the inconvenience resulting from         dark.   its
 colour.

   “An   attempt to account for the discrepancy between the actual
Velocity of Sound in Air or Vapour, and that resulting from theory."
By the Rev. William Ritchie, LL.D., F.R.S. Professor of Natural
Philosophy at the Royal Institution, and in University College,
London.
   Sir Isaac Newton determined from theory that the velocity of the
undulations of an elastic medium generally is equal to that which a
heavy body acquires in falling by the action of gravity through half
the height of a homogeneous atmosphere of that medium; but the
actual velocity of sound in atmospheric air is found to be one eighth
greater than what is assigned by that formula. This difference was
attempted to be accounted for by Newton on the supposition that
the molecules of air are solid spheres, and that sound is transmitted
through them instanter.       Laplace endeavoured to reconcile the
difference between theory and observation, by the hypothesis that
heat is disengaged from each successive portion of air during the
progress of the condensed wave.       The author of the present paper
regards the hypothesis of Laplace as a gratuitous and improbable
assumption; the falsehood of which he thinks is apparent from the
fact that a rarefied wave advances through air with the same velocity
as a condensed wave, which would not be the case if in either instance
their progress were influenced by the heat evolved. He then enters
into calculations to show that if the molecules of water be assumed
as incompressible, and, when at the temperature of maximum den
sity, very nearly in absolute contact, we ought, in estimating the
velocity of sound in steam, to add to the velocity given by the for
mula of Newton, the rectilinear space occupied by the molecules;
which, if a cubic inch of water be converted into a cubic foot of
steam, will be one twelfth of the distance.      By comparative expe
riments with a tuning-fork held over a tube, closed at one end, and
containing at one time air, and at another steam, and also by simi
lar trials with organ pipes of variable lengths, the author found a
close agreement between his theory and observation. He also shows
that this theory furnishes the means of determining, à priori, the
density of a liquid, if the velocity of sound in the vapour of that
liquid be given. In a postscript he adduces further confirmation of
the truth of his theory by observations on the velocity of sound in
hydrogen gas, and in carbonic acid gas.

   “Researches towards establishing a Theory of the Dispersion of
Light.” By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Pro
fessor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
  The author here prosecutes the inquiry on the dispersion of light
which was the subject of his former papers published in the Philo
sophical Transactions for 1835 and 1836, extending it to media of
º
higher dispersive powers, which afford a severer test of the accuracy
    M. Cauchy's theory. He explains his methods of calcula
tion and the formulae on which his computations are founded, and
which are different from those employed in his former investigations:
and then states the results in a tabular form. On the whole he con
cludes that the formula, as already deduced from the undulatory
theory, applies sufficiently well to the case of media whose disper
                                                                                                        It of it,

considers      it  extremely probable that the essential principle

   “Observations on the Electro-chemical Influence of long-con
tinued   Electric Currents of Low Tension.”           By G. Golding Bird,
Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S., Lecturer on Experimental Philosophy at Guy's
Hospital. Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author, after observing that the brilliant discoveries in electro
chemistry obtained by Sir Humphry Davy were effected by the employ
ment of voltaic currents of high intensity, elicited by means of large bat
teries, adverts to the labours of M. Becquerel, to whom we are indebted
for the knowledge of the chemical agency of feeble currents in re
ducing several refractory oxides to the metallic state : and also to
those of Dr. E. Davy, Bucholtz, and Professor Faraday in effecting
decompositions of other substances by similar means. In prosecuting
this branch of inquiry, the author employed an apparatus analogous
to that of Professor Daniell, for obtaining an equal and continuous
current of low intensity from a single pair of plates: the metallic so
lution, in which a copper-plate was immersed, being contained in a
glass tube, closed at the bottom by a diaphragm of plaster of Paris,
and itself plunged in a weak solution of brine contained in a larger
vessel, in which a plate of zinc was immersed ; and a communication
being established between the two metallic plates by connecting wires.
By the feeble, but continuous current thus elicited, sulphate of copper
is found to be slowly decomposed, affording beautiful crystals of me
tallic copper.    Iron, tin, zinc, bismuth, antimony, lead, and silver
may, in like manner, be reduced, by a similar and slightly modified
process; in general appearing with metallic lustre, and in a crystal
line form, and presenting a remarkable contrast in their appearance
to the irregular, soft, and spongy masses obtained from the same so
lutions by means of large batteries.      The crystals of copper rival in
hardness and malleability the finest specimens of native copper, which
they much resemble in appearance.        The crystallization of bismuth,
lead, and silver, by this process, is very beautiful; that of bismuth
being lamellar, of a lustre approaching to that of iron, but with the
reddish tint peculiar to the former metal.         Silver may thus be pro
cured of the whiteness of snow, and usually in the form of needles.
Some metals, such as nickel, which, when acted on by currents from
large batteries, are deposited from their solutions as oxides only, are
obtained, by means of the apparatus used by the author, in a brilliant
metallic form. He farther found that he could in this way reduce even
the more refractory metallic oxides, such as silica, which resist the
action of powerful batteries, and which M. Becquerel could only ob
tain in alloy with iron. By a slight modification of the apparatus he
was enabled to form amalgams both of potassium and of sodium with
mercury, by the decomposition of solutions of chlorides of those bases;
and in like manner ammonium was easily reduced, when in contact
with mercury, by the influence of a feeble voltaic current. In this last
                                      O

                                        462
experiment  it was found that an interruption to the continuance of the
current, even for a few seconds, is sufficient to destroy the whole of
the product which had been the result of the previous long-continued
action; the spongy ammoniacal amalgam being instantly decomposed,
and the ammonia formed being dissolved in the surrounding fluid.

    The reading of a paper entitled, “On the Elementary Structure of
Muscular Fibre of Animal and Organic Life.” By Frederick Skey,
Esq., Assistant Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Commu
nicated by John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
    The author concludes, from his microscopic examinations of the
structure of muscular fibres, that those subservient to the functions of
animal life have, in man, an average diameter of one 400dth of an inch,
and are surrounded by transverse circular striae varying in thickness,
and in the number contained in a given space.            He describes these
striae as constituted by actual elevations on the surface of the fibre,
with intermediate depressions, considerably narrower than the dia
meter of a globule of the blood.          Each of these muscular fibres, of
which the diameter is one 400dth of an inch, is divisible into bands or
fibrillae, each of which is again subdivisible into about one hundred
tubular filaments, arranged parallel to one another, in a longitudinal
direction, around the axis of the tubular fibre which they compose, and
which contains in    its  centre a   soluble gluten. The partial separation
of  the fibrillae gives riseto   the appearance      of
                                                     broken      interrupted

circular striae, which are occasionally seen. The diameter          each fila

globule    ofthe blood. On the other hand, the muscles           organic life

      composed,      of
                   not     fibres similar     to           described,  but
                                                                                   in of
are                                           those above
filaments only; these filaments being interwoven with each other
irregularly disposed lines      of various thickness; having for the most
part longitudinal direction, but forming kind
      a                                            a       untraceable net
                                                           of
 work. They are readily distinguishable from tendinous fibres,            the by

                                  463
filaments of the latter being uniform in their size, and pursuing indi
vidually one unvarying course, in lines parallel to each other.     The
fibres of the heart appear to possess a somewhat compound character
of texture. The muscles of the pharynx exhibit the character of ani
mal life; while those of the oesophagus, the stomach, the intestines,
and the arterial system, possess that of inorganic life. The determi
nation of the exact nature of the muscular fibres of the iris presented
considerable difficulties, which the author has not yet been able satis
factorily to overcome.

  The reading of a paper, entitled, “On the Function of the Medulla
Oblongata and Medulla Spinalis, and on the Excito-motory System
of Nerves.” By Marshall Hall, M.D., F.R.S., L. and E., &c., was
resumed and concluded.
    The author begins by observing that a former memoir of his, en
titled, “On the Reflex Function of the Medulla Oblongata and Me
dulla Spinalis,” published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833,
has been translated into German, and favourably spoken of by Pro
fessor Muller, of Berlin. He states that his object in the present paper
is to unfold what he calls a great principle in physiology; namely, that
of the special function, and the physiological and pathological action
and reactions of the true spinal marrow, and of the excito-motory
nerves. The two experiments which he regards as affording the type
of those physiological phenomena and pathological conditions, which
are the direct effects of causes acting in the spinal marrow, or in the
course of the motor nerves, are the following:—1. If a muscular nerve
be stimulated, either mechanically by the forceps, or by means of gal
                                      to its
 vanism passed transversely across       fibres, the muscle  or
                                                              muscles to
 which  it   distributed are excited
             is                           contract.—2. The same result
   obtained when the spinal marrow itself
of is                                       subjected
                                                 is        the agency
                                                             to

tion of the spinal marrow, and of the excito-motory system of nerves,
and of an exclusive series of physiological and pathological pheno
mena:—If in a turtle, from which the head and sternum have been
removed, we lay bare the sixth or seventh intercostal nerve, and sti
mulate it either by means of the forceps or galvanism, both the ante
rior and posterior fins, with the tail, are immediately moved with
energy. Hence the author infers the existence: 1st, of a true spinal
marrow, physiologically distinct from the chord of intra-spinal nerves;
2ndly, of a system of excito-motory nerves, physiologically distinct
from the sentient and voluntary nerves; and, 3rdly, of currents of
nervous influence, incident, upwards, downwards, and reflex with re
 gard to the spinal marrow.
  A    review is then taken of the labours of preceding physiologists
relative to the functions of the nervous system : in which the author
criticises the reasonings of Whytt, Legallois, Mr. Mayo, Dr. Alison,
and Professor Muller; and illustrates his own peculiar views by several
experiments and pathological observations, which appear to him to
show that muscular movements may occur, under circumstances imply
ing the cessation of sensation, volition, and every other function of the
brain; and that these phenomena are explicable only on the hypothesis
that impressions made on a certain set of nerves, which he terms excito
motory, are conveyed to a particular portion of the spinal marrow
belonging to that system, and are thence reflected, by means of cer
tain motor nerves, upon certain sets of muscles, inducing certain ac
tions. The same actions may also be the result of impressions made
directly either on the spinal marrow or on the motor nerves.        He
accordingly considers that the whole nervous system may be divided
into, 1st, the cerebral, or the sentient and voluntary; 2ndly, the
true spinal, or the excitor and motor; and, 3rdly, the ganglionic, or
the nutrient, the secretory, &c. The excito-motory system presides
over ingestion and exclusion, retention and egestion, and over the
orifices and sphincters of the animal frame: it is therefore the ner
vous system of respiration, deglutition, &c., and the source of tone
in the whole muscular system. The true spinal system is the seat or
nervous agent of the appetites and passions, but is also susceptible
of modification by volition. This theory he proceeds to apply to the
explanation of several phenomena relating to the motions of the eye
lids, pharynx, cardia, larynx, muscles of inspiration, sphincter ani,
expulsors of the feces and semen, to the tone of the muscular system
generally, and to actions resulting from the passions.      Lastly, he
considers   its   application    to   various diseased states    of   the same   func
tions, as  manifested    cynic spasm, vomiting, asthma, tenesmus,
                           in
strangury, crowing inspiration, convulsions, epilepsy, tetanus, hydro
phobia, and paralysis.

  A     paper was read, entitled, “Researches         on the Tides. Seventh
Series. On the Diurnal Inequality of the Height of the Tide, espe
cially at Plymouth and at Sincapore : and on the Mean Level of the
Sea.” By the Rev. W. Whewell, A.M., F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge.
    The diurnal inequality which the author investigates in the present
paper, is that by which the height of the morning tide differs from that
of the evening of the same day; a difference which is often very con
siderable, and of great importance in practical navigation, naval offi
cers having frequently found that the preservation or destruction of
a ship depended on a correct knowledge of the amount of this varia
tion. In the first section of the paper he treats of the diurnal ine
quality in the height of the tides at Plymouth, at which port good tide
observations are regularly made at the Dock Yard; and these obser
vations clearly indicate the existence of this inequality. As                   the                               all
other inequalities              of

the equilibrium theory, the author has endeavoured                trace the laws               to
of   the diurnal  inequality        assuming   bysimilar kind        correspond

Spain, Portugal, and France, it is successively two, and three days;
and on those of Cornwall and Devonshire, four days; thus observing
a tolerably regular augmentation as it is traced along the line of coast
from the shores of the Atlantic to the Firth of Forth, but travelling
more slowly than the other inequalities.
   In section fourth, the author treats of certain extreme cases of diur
nal inequality; particularly those which produce the phenomenon of
a single tide in the twenty-four hours: such as that noticed by Capt.
Fitzroy at King George's Sound, on the south coast of New Holland;
and that of Tonquin, referred by Newton to the interference of two
tides arriving by different channels, but probably owing to the opera
tion of the same law as that which gives rise to the diurnal inequality.
   In section fifth, the author considers the subject of the mean height
of the sea; that            is,
                        the height midway between low water and high
water each day: and arrives                       at
                                    the result that      very nearly con         it    is
stant.

                                                                     at

                                   467
remarkable difference also obtains in the London semi-menstrual     cor
rection for the height.
   The calendar month inequality at Liverpool, considered as result
ing implicitly from the corrections due to changes in the declinations
of the luminaries, and in the sun's parallax, agrees generally with Ber
nouilli's theory, and with the results deduced from the London obser
vations given in the author's last paper.
   The author finds that the Establishment of the Port of London has
been subject to changes even since the beginning of the present cen
tury, and he notices the difficulty of predicting the time of high water
with accuracy unless these changes can be accounted for. He also
cites a very ancient Tide Table, from which it would appear that for
merly the time of high water at London was an hour later than it is
at present.

       FRANCIS BAILY,        Esq.,   V.P.      and Treasurer, in the Chair.
     William Archibald Armstrong White, Esq., was elected a Fellow
of the Society.
     The reading of Professor Daniell's paper on Voltaic Combinations
was resumed and concluded.
   In the course of an inquiry on the effects of changes of tempe
rature upon voltaic action, the author was led to observe some curious
disturbances and divisions of the electric current produced by the
battery, arising from secondary combinations; the results of which
observations form the subject of the present paper. He found that
the resistance to the passage of the current was diminished by dis
solving the sulphate of copper which was in contact with the copper
in the standard sulphuric acid, instead of water. The increased
effect of the current, as measured by the voltameter, was farther
augmented by the heat evolved during the mixture; and wishing
to study the influence of temperature in modifying these effects,
the author placed the cells of the battery in a tub, filled with hot
water. On charging the cells with a solution of muriate of am
monia in the interior, and aqueous solution of sulphate of copper in
the exterior compartment, he observed that a portion of the current
is discharged by the water in which the apparatus was immersed;
 its passage being indicated         by
                                    the disengagement            of
                                                           gas betwixt
 the  adjacent  cells;  inwhich  case, one             of
                                               the zinc rods    thrown is
 out    action, and the copper
       of                         that cell acts merely
                                  of                             as   an
                                                              electrode
to  the antecedent zinc.      Asaturated solution           of
                                                      common salt was

                                                470
 next placed in contact with the zinc, while the exterior compart
 ments of the cells were filled with a saturated aqueous solution of
 sulphate of copper; but the effects were much diminished. It thus
 appeared that the substitution of solutions of the muriates for dilute
 sulphuric acid was in every way disadvantageous; and it was more
 over found that, when the circuit was broken, the copper became
 seriously injured by their action, and by the formation of a sub
 muriate of that metal.
    Finding that the membranous tubes were unable to resist the
 action of the acid under the influence of high temperatures, the au
 thor substituted for them tubes of porous earthenware, of the same
 texture as that of which wine-coolers are commonly made, closed
 at their lower ends, and of the same height as the copper cells.
 The bottoms of the latter were fitted with sockets, for the reception
 of the tubes, and for confining them in their proper places; the
 perforated copper plates, or colanders, which held the solid
 sulphate of copper, passing over their upper ends.          The tubes can
 be easily removed, and instantly replaced ; and the facility of
 emptying and refilling them renders the addition of siphon-tubes
 unnecessary,    except in very particular circumstances. A cir
 cular steam-vessel of tin plate was then provided, around which
 the cells could be placed upon blocks of wood, and closed in with
a cover, containing a socket, which could, at pleasure, be connected
 with the steam pipe of a boiler. Two other sockets were also con
 veniently placed, provided with cork stoppers, through which the
electrodes of the battery could pass, when the proper connexions
were made. By using this apparatus the author determined that the
increase of effect consequent on an augmentation of temperature is
but in a slight degree dependent on an increase of conducting power
in the electrolyte, but arises principally from                 its
                                                       increased energy          of
affinity, producing    greater electromotive force.
                          a
     Inheating the battery            by
                               the steamer,     frequently happened that,
                                                       it
when the thermometer had nearly reached the boiling point, and
the action     the battery was
               of                               its
                                        maximum, sudden cessation
                                           at                   a                of
its  action would take place; and this suspension             power would
                                                                      of
continue for   hours, provided   the  high  temperature   were maintained.
On turning off the steam, and quickly cooling the apparatus, the
action would return           as
                          suddenly         had ceased, though, generally,
                                                asit
not   to the full amount.    On closely examining the voltameter,                on
these occasions,     was found that the current was not wholly stopped;
                     it
but that there existed     small residual current.       This residual cur
rent was observed         to   be a
                            often directed        course opposite
                                                          in           that to
which had before    prevailed;    and    was,    it    in a
                                                  that case, the excess          of
a  counter current, arising from         force which was acting

contrary direction. The author found that variable currents might
be  produced, under ordinary circumstances, from the separate single
cells     the battery when the whole series
          of                                          connectedis    short by
wires. He proved           by
                            series          of

the secondary currents; but that when the course             the main cur

rent of the battery is obstructed by causing it to pass through the
long wire of a galvanometer, or through the electrolyteof a voltameter,
the course of the secondary current from each separate cell is always
normal, or in the same direction: when, on the other hand, the
battery-current is allowed to flow with the least possible resistance,
as by completing the main circuit by a short wire, the secondary
current of the separate cells is in the opposite direction. Hence
the resistance may be so adjusted as that the secondary current shall
altogether disappear, or alternate between the two directions.
   The remainder of the paper is occupied with the detail of ex
periments made with a view to ascertain the effects of different degrees
of resistance to the voltaic currents under a great variety of cir

   The   reading  of Mr. Douglas and Major Sabine's paper, was re
sumed and concluded.
   In the report prefixed to this paper, Major Sabine states, that
Mr. Douglas was originally a gardener, and was, in the year 1833,
recommended by Sir William Jackson Hooker to the late Mr. Joseph
Sabine, who was then Secretary to the Horticultural Society of Lon
don, as a                    employed

which preceded his departure from England, he studied with un
remitting ardour and perseverance for no less than eighteen hours
each day; and, conquering every difficulty, acquired a competent
knowledge of the principles of science, learned the uses of various
instruments, and made himself thoroughly master of the methods of
taking observations both at sea and on land.
    The narrative proceeds to notice the arrival of Mr. Douglas in
America, the progress of his undertaking, the loss of his collections
and most of his books and papers, by the upsetting and dashing to
pieces of the canoe in which he attempted to pass the rapids, and,
lastly, his death in 1833, at Owhyhee, in the Sandwich Islands,
 whither he had proceeded on his return to Europe.
    The books which were preserved, and which have been received
 by Major Sabine, consist of several volumes of Lunar, Chrono
metrical, Magnetical, Meteorological and Geographical observa
 tions, together with a volume of field sketches.      The geographical
 observations of latitude and    longitude  refer to two distinct tracts
 of country; first, the Columbia river, and         tributaries; and the   its
 district   to
            the westward       them; and, secondly, California.

    “On the first changes in the Ova of the Mammifera, in conse

By Thomas Wharton Jones, Esq. Communicated by Richard Owen,
Esq., F.R.S.
    The author having, in a former paper, described the structure
of the unimpregnated ovum of mammiferous animals, now proceeds
to investigate the changes which the ovum undergoes in consequence
of impregnation. In the rabbit, the first perceptible difference is the
addition of a thick gelatinous matter surrounding the parts of which
the ovum was composed in                          its
                                          original state, and apparently derived
from the ovaries.                the progress

many    of    the  oviparous    animals.      The  gelatinous    envelope  acquired
in   the  ovary,   and which        more   especially

     “On the adaptation of different                modes       of illuminating Light-houses,
as depending on their situations and the object contemplated in
 their erection.”       By William Henry Barlow, Esq., in a Letter ad
 dressed to Peter Barlow, Esq., F.R.S., and communicated by

    The letter of Mr. W. H. Barlow, addressed to his father, in which
 the paper is contained, is dated Constantinople, March 14th, 1837,
 and states that the experiments which he made with the Drummond
 light, and other means of illuminating Light-houses, and of which
 he now communicates the results, were undertaken at the request
 of the Turkish Government, with the view of placing lights at the
 entrance of the Bosphorus from the Black Sea. The object of his
inquiry is to investigate the principles on which the illuminating
 power, resulting from the employment of reflectors, and of lenses,
depends; and the most advantageous application of that power to
 the purposes of Light-houses.
    In discussing the relation which exists between the illuminating
power and the intensity of an artificial light, he observes that the
former is proportional to the quantity of light projected on a given
 surface at a given distance; and that the latter is dependent on
the quantity of light projected by a given area of the luminous
body on a given surface at a given distance.              Hence the intensity
 of a light  multiplied  into        its
                                   surface    the measure
                                                      is       the illuminating
                                                                              of
power, whether the light proceed from one                          or
                                                       from several luminous
bodies: and the illuminating power               equal     that
                                                           is          sphere
                                                                        to          to of             of
light, whose intensity and apparent surface are equal                that     the      a         of

    Within       certain limit           of
                                     distance, the property         light which     of
 produces the strongest impression              the eye,  on    intensity; but
                                                                         is   its
 when the light            remote that the angle subtended by
                          is   so                                             the           it   at
eye   is very minute,           generally the case
                                    as
                                    is                      Light-houses, the
                                                                        in

only    to  the illuminating   power.      The mathematical      investigations
of the author lead him              the conclusion that all reflectors and
                                         to
lenses     ofthe same diameter have the same illuminating power when
illuminated          by
                     the same lamp; and that                       by
                                                        diminishing the focal
distance, and intercepting more rays, the illuminating power                  not                is
increased, but simply the divergence, and consequently the surface
or  space over which         acts.
                                it    The author then proceeds            inquire        to
into the comparative utility            lenses and reflectors, and arrives
                                              of                                                      at
the inference that the advantage gained                           by

former does not arise from their superior perfection                  optical       as                in
struments, but from their using the light more economically,                 con              in

the horizon.        Rules are then deduced for the application             lenses           of
and reflectors        Light-houses, according
                       in                            the particular situations
                                                                  to

                                                      475
serve.  With this view, the author divides Light-houses into three
classes: the first comprising Beacon or Warning Lights, placed in
order to prevent the approach of vessels, and which consequently
can   never be nearer than three or four miles;                                       the second being
Guiding or Leading Lights, placed to guide a vessel, and therefore
admitting of a very near approach ; and the third including those
which, according to the respective directions in which they are seen,
have both these duties to fulfil.   In the first we require great                                                   il
luminating power, and a long duration of the brightest period, with
a small angle of vertical divergence; in the second, less illumina
ting power, but a larger angle of vertical divergence are requisite,
while the duration of the extreme brightness is of minor importance;
and in the third,             all
                       these properties, namely, great illuminating
power,    long duration
           a               the brightest period, and

     A  paper was read, entitled, “On the development and extinction
 of   regular doubly refracting structures in the crystalline lenses of
 animals after death.” By Sir David Brewster, K.H., L.L.D., F.R.S.
     Since the year 1816, when the author communicated to the Royal
 Society an account of the doubly refracting structures which exist in
 the crystalline lenses of fishes and other animals, he has examined a
 great variety of recent lenses with the view of ascertaining the origin
 of these structures, the order of their succession in different lenses,
 and the purpose which they answer in the animal economy. He had
 discovered in the lenses of many fishes the alternation of portions,
 exerting, the one a positive, and the other a negative refractive
 action; but in his subsequent investigations he met with the greatest
 discrepancy as to the regularity of their arrangement.        He found
 that in quadrupeds the central structure is positive ; while in fishes,
 where there are three structures, it is always negative ; but their po
 sitive structure in the former case sometimes exists alone, with faint
 traces of a negative structure, and sometimes it is followed by
 another positive structure separated from the first by a black neutral
 circle, in which the double refraction disappears ; at other times va
 rious other combinations of these structures are presented.       Occa
 sionally, in the dark neutral line which separated two positive struc
 tures, he perceived a trace of an intervening structure, which seemed
 to be either about to disappear or about to be developed. This con
jecture was satisfactorily verified by a series of observations which he
 made on the lenses of the sheep, the ox, and the horse, at different
 ages, and also on the same lens, during the spontaneous changes
 it undergoes when kept in distilled water. The negative structure
was in these experiments gradually developed at the space inter
vening between the portions of the lens which had possessed the
positive structure; and thus the same parts assumed in succession
doubly refractive actions of opposite kinds. The author intimates
his intention of pointing out, in a separate paper, the conclusions
deducible from these facts respecting the cause and cure of cataract.

class.” By Arthur Farre, M.B., Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy
at St. Bartholomew's Hospital.     Communicated by Richard Owen,
Esq., F.R.S., was resumed and concluded.
   After a short account of the labours of preceding naturalists in
that department of zoology which comprises the various kinds of
polypes, and of the different characters on which they have founded
the classification of these animals, the author proceeds to the state
ment of his own observations on several species which had not
been previously investigated with sufficient minuteness and care.
Two of the species described he believes to be entirely new, and he
has accordingly given them the names of Bowerbankia densa, and
Lagenella repens.      The other species which are the subject of the
author's   investigation,  are Vesicularia spinosa, Walkeria cuscuta,
Alcyonidium diaphanum, Membranipora pilosa, and Notania lori
culata.                                                            -
   He then discusses the principles on which the classification of
this tribe of zoophytes should be founded, and proposes on these
principles to give the name of Ciliobrachiata to the whole group of
polypes characterised by the possession of ciliated tentacula, and a
free alimentary canal with two orifices: this group again he divides
into two subordinate groups, namely, the Hydriform and the Acti
niform, or Zoanthiform polypes. Under the title of Nudibrachiata
he proposes to comprehend                  all
                               those polypes which partake       the                       of
nature     of

    Since the time when the author has been engaged in the prose
cution of this inquiry, some observations on the same subject have
been published by Dr. Berthold, of Göttingen, who expresses it as
his opinion that insects ought not to be regarded as cold-blooded
animals, but who does not appear to have detected the existence
of a temperature higher than the surrounding medium in any indi
vidual insect. The author also notices the observations on this subject
made by Hansmann, Juch, Rengger, Dr. John Davy, and others,
some of whom have detected, while others have not observed, the
existence of an increased temperature in this class of animals. He
then gives a detailed account of the precautions to be taken for
 ensuring accuracy in making observations of this kind; and remarks
that greater reliance is to be placed on those made on the external
than on the internal temperature of the animal, seeing that compa
parative results areall that can be obtained, and that the injury inflicted
 on the insect by                      its

  In a former communication, published       the Philosophical Trans    in
actions for 1833, the author endeavoured       show that the quantity       to
of voltaic electricity conducted,     the force    the current, was
                                                            or                    of                                  a
function    ofagreater number                      of
                                  variables than had been previously

                                  483
supposed.    As the theory which he proposed for estimating the con
ducting powers of substances has been controverted by M. Lenz, he
has been induced to reconsider the subject, and finds reason to be
satisfied with the correctness of his former views.    He farther finds
that with feeble magnetic needles the deflecting forces are not pro
portional to the force of the current, but approach nearer and nearer
to that proportion by increasing the magnetic power of the needles;
a result which the author thinks is strictly deducible from the uni
versal law of nature, that the attraction mutually exerted by two
bodies is measured by the sum of their masses.      He shows that the
formula of Ohen, expressive of the conducting powers of wires, and
of the resistances which they offer to currents of voltaic electricity,
is an approximation to the truth only in the case of feeble currents,
and that with the same metal, the conducting powers are not as the
lengths of the wires.
   The author next inquires into the relation between the heat de
veloped, which he finds to be, in the same wire, as the square of the
intensity of the current; and in wires of the same diameter, and
conducting equal quantities of electricity, it is inversely as the con
ducting power, or directly as the resistance which they oppose to
the current. The facts he has adduced in this paper seem to be at
variance with the generally received theory of caloric, and to be in
perfect accordance with the undulatory theory.
   He concludes by describing an experiment confirming the views
he has elsewhere advanced with regard to the difference between the
physical, the physiological, and the chemical effects resulting from
the employment of coils formed of wires of different lengths, being
dependent on the time required by the conductor for returning to
its natural state.
   “On the Ipoh or Upas poison used by the Jacoons and other
aboriginal tribes of the Malayan Peninsula.” By Lieut. T. S. New
bold, Aide-de-Camp to Brigadier-General Wilson, C.B. Communi

   The author gives an account of the process by which the Jacoons,
an aboriginal tribe inhabiting the mountains and forests of the Ma
layan Peninsula, prepare the poison applied to the points of the
slender arrows which are propelled from the Simpitan or blow-pipe.
Three preparations are employed for this purpose, distinguished by
the names of Krohi, Tennik or Kennik, and Mallaye; the last of
these is more powerful than the other two, and is obtained from the
roots of the Tuba, the Perachi, the Kopah, and the Chey, and from that
of the shrub Mallaye, whence it derives      its
                                               name. The Krohi poison

   “Considérations physiquessur le passage Nord-ouest;” by the same.
 Communicated by the Right Hon. the Earl of Minto, G.C.B. F.R.S.
    The author of this memoir, considering that the practicability of
 a North-west Arctic passage must depend on the mean summer at
 mospheric temperature of the most northern point of the continent of
America being above that at which the congelation of sea water takes
 place, applies himself to the determination of these temperatures.
 The results of his calculations are given in a table, exhibiting the
 extreme and the mean temperatures of the atmosphere for each of the
 summer months, from May to September, at                   degrees     latitude, all               of

  “Sequel to an Essay on the Constitution of the Atmosphere
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826; with some ac
count of the Sulphurets of Lime;” by John Dalton, D.C.L., F.R.S.
  The author communicates in this paper an account of the inves
tigations on the constitution of the atmosphere, which have engaged
his attention during a long period of years. He enters into an ex
amination of the comparative advantages of the three methods which
are most in use for analysing common air, namely, firing it with hy
drogen in Volta's eudiometer, or abstracting the oxygen by means
of nitrous gas and quadrisulphuret of lime; and details the pre
cautions to be taken in the employment of each of these methods,
and the degree of accuracy to be expected from the results under dif.
ferent circumstances. He then relates numerous experiments made
on air obtained from great heights, from which he is led to the con
clusion that the proportion of oxygen to azote in the atmosphere on
the surface of the earth is not precisely the same at     places and                       all
times; and that     elevatedinregions this proportion  somewhat less
than      the surface
          at              the earth, but not nearly
                                   of                    much    the                 so is              as

     The author verified, both at Liverpool and at London, the exist
  ence  of a fact similar to that which M. Daussy had ascertained at
  Brest, namely, the rise of the ocean when the barometer is depressed;
  and remarks that the correction due to changes in the atmospheric
  pressure is by no means inconsiderable. He suggests the question
  whether the surface of the ocean rises in narrow seas simultaneously
  with the depression of the barometer, or otherwise. With a view to
  the solution of this question, he gives a tabular diagram showing the
  correspondence between the calculated and the observed heights, in
  their relation to the heights of the barometer at Liverpool and at
  London, from which it would appear that the effect of changes in the
  atmospheric pressure on the tide is immediate.

  Cunningham, Esq., Member of the Cork Scientific and Literary So
  ciety.   Communicated by North Ludlow Beamish, Esq., F.R.S.,
  President of that Society.
     The material recommended by the author for the most economical,
  as well as effectual method of constructing magnets, is cast iron,
  which should be formed in small castings in the form of a horse-shoe,
  each weighing about seven ounces; these he finds, on being touched
  in the usual manner by a small compound magnet, received and re
  tained the impregnation better than any which he had previously
  constructed of steel.

  on the 16th of November next.
