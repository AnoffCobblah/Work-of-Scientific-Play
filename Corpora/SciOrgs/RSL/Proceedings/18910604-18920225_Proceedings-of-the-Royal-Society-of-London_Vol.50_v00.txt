    The Presents received were laid on the table, and thanks ordered
for them.
    The following Papers were read :—
 1.   “Experiments      on the Discharge of Leyden Jars.”              By
          OLIVER    J. LODGE, F.R.S.        Received May 2, 1891.
            Exrnmnsurs      ON  THE  DISCHARGE   0F LEYDEN JARS.
    The following experiments among others were made in the course
 of 1888, beginning in February of that year. A brief account of the
early experiments, with some of the deductions from them, was given
in a couple of lectures to the Society of Arts in March, 1888, on
                                         ‘
Lightning Conductors ; and in the Electrician,’ vols. 21, 22, 23, under
 the same title, a number of others were published at length,
viz., the series of experiments relating to “the alternative path.”
But the rest of the experiments has never been published in any
detail; though, as they led to some interesting observations con
cerning electromagnetic         waves, and incidentally measured the
velocity of transmission of a pulse along an isolated wire, they
ought to have been written out for publication long ago.
    I  now venture to communicate them to the Royal Society, beginning
 with such brief account of the earliest experiments as may su<U+FB01>ice
 to render the steps intelligible.
                           Description of Ja/rs Used.
    1.  The pattern of jar ordinarily used was an open cylinder without
lid or neck, with the charging rod <U+FB01>rmly supported from the interior
 and quite free from the glass above the tinfoil.
    They were of two principal sizes, which I call for short “gallon
                                                                         ’7
 and   “pint.”   _
    Each gallon jar was 40 cm. high and 13 cm. diameter, coated to
 within 10'5 cm. of the top; and the capacity of the pair chie<U+FB02>y used
 was 0'0062 microfarad each.         Two in series had a capacity of 28 K
 metres.    Each   pint jar  was   165  cm. high and 8'2 cm. diameter, and
 was coated to within 5 cm.         of  the top.   The capacity of the one
 chie<U+FB02>y used was 0‘0016 microfarad.          Two pint jars in series had a
capacity of 6'6    K metres.

  1891.]                     the Disc/Large       of Leyden Jam.                            3
      In addition to these ordinary jars, a couple of large condensers
  were made,         each consisting          of 16 pairs of 11_inch square tinfoil
  sheets, separated by double              thicknesses of window glass, each pane
  about    %   inch thick, and with a good margin; tinfoil strip con
  nectors    protruding on alternate sides, and copper wire prolonga
  tions, with all joints soldered, terminating in a pair of knobbed rods
  projecting upwards through stout glass tubes more than a foot apart;
 the whole thoroughly soaked and embedded in a mass of paraf<U+FB01>n,
 poured molten into a strong teak outer case 22 X 20 X 13 inches,
 the whole when <U+FB01>nished weighing about 3 cwt.
     The capacity of one of these condensers was 0'028, of the other 0‘02,
 microfarad.         Single glass thickness would have given much greater
 capacity, but preliminary experiments showed that single thicknesses
 of glass were punctured              by very modest sparks.
     It is important      in    these experiments to have joints better made
 than is usual for high-tension electricity.                      Fizzing or sparkling
 inside jars is abominable.
   ACCOUNT OF THE LONG CONDUCTORS ussn IN THE EARLY EXPERIMENTS.
    2.  Round the Lecture Theatre,* supported on four vertical posts a
 good way from every wall, were stretched and supported, either by
 silk thread or silk ribbon according to the strength demanded, four
 or <U+FB01>ve wires, two of them of copper, one thick (No. 1                                 and
the other thin (No. 19); two of them of iron, one thick (No. 1) and
 the other thin (No. 18).                They are called respectively “long thick
 copper,”    “long      thick      iron,”    “long thin copper,” “long thin iron.”
                     “                      ”
 Sometimes a thinnest iron                     of No. 27 B.W.G. was used too. The
 thick wires formed a rude rectangle 840x515 cm.; being joined
 mechanically not far from their ends by a foot or so of silk ribbon,
and suf<U+FB01>cient free ends being left to connect directly with jars or
machine; connexion being usually made by wrapping tinfoil tightly
round the joined conductors.                       The thinner wires formed rather
larger rectangles.
    Particulars of these conductors here follow :—

   3.   The large glass condenser (0028 mid.) was charged through
one   or other of the long wires, and a choice was o<U+FB02>'ered the discharge,
so that it might go either round the wire or leap an air-gap, as it
chose; as shown in <U+FB01>g. 1.

   A    are the  ordinary terminal knobs     of the Voss   or Wimshurst
machine where the spark occurs; B is the discharge         interval acting
as a   shunt to the wire or other resistance.    MQN represents diagram
metrically one of the wires round the room. The spark-length B was
adjusted so that it was an 03 chance whether the discharge chose it
or the wire. It was noticed that when the discharge chose B the A
spark was strong, but when the discharge chose the wire the A spark
was weak.      The di<U+FB02>'erence appeared to be only in the noise or sud
denness    of  the  spark, for when a Riess’s electro-thermometer     was
inserted in the circuit it indicated about the same in either case.
   A   capillary tube was <U+FB01>lled with very dilute acid   so that  its resis
tance was about % megohm, and was connected across the B knobs
instead of the long wire.      When this acid tube was thus made the
alternative path, and the B knobs placed so far apart that the dis
charge was obliged to choose it, the A spark was very weak, being
reduced to a quiet spit, which could be analysed by a slowly rotating
mirror into several detached sparks.

 1891.]                the Discharge of Leyden    Jars.                    5
    After a number of readings of spark-length, which have been else
 where published (and which showed among other things thatit made
very little di<U+FB01>erence whether the alternative path were copper or
iron), a common Leyden jar was substituted for' the condenser, and
 similar results were obtained with it.
    But it was now noticed, in addition, that the         frequently over
 <U+FB02>owed by sparking over its lip; and that when this happened a spark
still occurred at B though not at A.
    A special over<U+FB02>ow or short-circuiting path was then provided,
equivalent to a pair of discharging tongs; calling this air-gap C, it
was found that, according to the adjustment of the width of spark
gaps, <U+FB02>ashes at B and C could be got without A; or at A and B
without C; or at C only. (This was the beginning of experiments on
over<U+FB02>ow.)
    Putting acid resistance into the circuit at M or at N weakens but
 does  not stop the B sparks; and it has the same eifect at M as at N.
But inserting resistance at Q does not weaken the B spark per
ceptibly; neither does cutting the wire there; only of course, in
order to permit the charging of the jar in this case, the B gap has to
be bridged by some imperfect conductor; this shunt high resistance,
which may be a piece of dry wood or anything just su<U+FB02>icient to
convey the charging current, having no appreciable eifect upon the
B spark.
    But it was noticed that when the wire was cut at Q a singularly
long spark or strong brush discharge attempted to jump the space
there whenever the machine spark occurred.         (This was the beginning
of experiments    on “  recoil-kick”)
    It was also found that connecting the machine side of the jar to
earth (the long wire, not interrupted anywhere, being insulated)
increased the strength of the B sparks very much, and made them
easier to get.    Evidently the wire was acting as one coat of a con
denser,   the wall being the other coat. Even when the jar was dis
carded, no connexion being made in its place, and the wire alone
used, sparks occurred at B perfectly well whenever the machine gave
a spark at A.                                   “

   Separating the machine knobs too far for a spark there, sparks
could be got either at C or at F or over the lip Of the jar, or in two or
three places at once.    The lengths were D = 0'72 inch, F = 0'68 inch.
Bringing   the A knobs nearer together, a distance of 0'57 inch, it went
there too.   The A spark is the noisiest, then D, and lastly F; F is in
fact quite weak.    When it sparks at D it mostly goes at F too, and
likewise over<U+FB02>ows the lip of the jar, but not always.
   Shorten all the air-gaps so as to avoid over<U+FB02>ow, and they spark
simultaneously at the following distances :—

   Modi<U+FB01>ed the plan of connexions to that shown in <U+FB01>g. 3 ; the second
water resistance or “leak ” being now introduced merely in order to
give the jar the possibility of charging.
   Whenever an A spark occurs, a considerable range is permissible
with the others. As to F, it does not matter how short that is made ;
it is a<U+FB01>ected by the others, but has no effect on them. The over<U+FB02>ow
of jar specially accompanies a spark at D. Frequently sparks occur
in all four places at once; and at times the over<U+FB02>ows of jars are
violent and numerous, so that, when A and D are both pretty long,
<U+FB02>ashes <U+FB02>y from cork and wood and almost anything that happens to
be in contact with the jar.      (The jar stood on a wooden block on an
insulating stool : it was principally from this that <U+FB02>ashes sprang
sometimes.)

    (The capacity of the jar was 0'0062 microfarad.)
    With A spark 0'62 inch long, the D and F gaps might be anything,
but so long as the D spark was allowed to pass the jar over<U+FB02>owed
every time the machine gave a spark at A.
    On putting one terminal of the machine to earth (the one not
attached to the jar), the D spark is considerably lengthened; and,
even when the knobs are widely separated, brushes leap from each
into the air whenever an A <U+FB02>ash occurs.
                          Simpli<U+FB01>ed    Connections.
    5. Tried now this  same gallon    jar connected up to the machine in
the simplest possible manner, either direct by a foot or so of ordinary
wire, or else by the long thick copper round room or some other long
wire, or sometimes by both, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 4, so as to see what
di<U+FB01>erence the length of connecting circuit made to ease of over<U+FB02>ow.

    The machine’s knobs were gradually, separated until the jar <U+FB02>ashed
 over its lip, and then their distance apart was read. It was found
 that with the long connector       a   very much shorter A spark was
 suf<U+FB01>cient to cause over<U+FB02>ow than with the short-circuiting wire. And
 not only was it shorter, it was incomparably quieter; the jar seemed
 to over<U+FB02>ow without any trouble or violence when attached to the
 long circuit, whereas, when this was short-circuited out, the
 A spark had to be long to cause an over<U+FB02>ow, and when it occurred
 its violence was great, as if threatening to smash the jar. If, under
 these circumstances, the short circuit was removed and the long wire
 replaced, the jar over<U+FB02>owed, not in one streak, but in a torrent or

                            ;
down to one again as the spark A was shortened.
   It was also found that after an over<U+FB02>ow another was more likely,
whereas after a failure another failure was probable : that there was,
in fact, a kind of hysteresis, the conditions of over<U+FB02>ow being easier
for a decreasing A spark than for an increasing one of the same
length.    This seemed especially noticeable when the long connector
was  thin copper, instead of being so thick and massive as the N 0. 1
copper  on the one hand, or so highly resisting as thin iron on the other.
   The table on p. 10 summarises the readings.         The full contrast
does not come out strOng in the early numbers : there is some caprice
about whether the        over<U+FB02>ows or not, probably having something
to do with the state  of the glass surface.
   The contrast comes out best towards the middle of the table. The

of the       thick copper wire, putting it at one or other end of it, and the
jar refuses to over<U+FB02>ow, although the spark-length A is increased to
2% inches.
   The spark is quiet, long, and zigzagg'y.     The resistance has the
same e<U+FB01>ect at either end, but the spark seemed straighter when the
resistance was at jar end of long wire.
   To test effect of putting resistance into the middle of a long con
nector, both the thick wires round room (one copper, the other iron)
were joined in series and used as connector.     Over<U+FB02>ow began when
A = 0'6 inch. The wires were now disconnected at their far ends,
and the capillary tube made to bridge the gap.    The jar now refused
to over<U+FB02>ow, though A was more than trebled in length.         (Fizzing

(as indicated by the strong line to a C knob in <U+FB01>g. 5) the matter is
di<U+FB01>erent.  It does not now feel the e<U+FB01>ect of a long circuit as different
from that of a short one.    The space at C being 0'94 inch, a spark
jumped there sometimes and sometimes at A = 0'75, with the high
resistance interposed in the two long leads; and just the same hap
pened when the resistance was removed and the long wires directly

Under these circumstances, simultaneous sparks could be got at A
and at C, and both about the same length, but not when they are too
long, say, A = 0'52, C = 0'57 inch.           But now the jar can be made
to over<U+FB02>ow by either spark if of suf<U+FB01>cient length.       Thus if A = 0'61
or if C = 074, the jar lip gets jumped, and sometimes the A spark
occurs, sometimes the C, but not both.         Another reading: A = 0'69
or C = 0'94 ; jar over<U+FB02>ows in either case.
   Restore now the usual short wire to the C knobs, and the C spark
still often goes, but it has no e<U+FB01>ect 0n the jar.      The A spark makes
the jar over<U+FB02>ow as before.
   But if the long lead between machine and jar be short-circuited
out (as by the dotted line of <U+FB01>g. 4), while the thick copper spiral
still joins up to the C knobs (as indicated by the dotted line in <U+FB01>g. 5),
then   A cannot make the jar jump, while C can easily.
   Thus over<U+FB02>ow is always easily produced by the action of the spark
occurring in a long good-conducting lead, not in a short or bad-con
ducting one.

   10.  Using the thick copper spiral as before (§ 6) to make the pint
jar over<U+FB02>ow,   I tried whether inserting large massive iron bars in it
 as a magnetic core would have any effect.          There happened to be
three large bars, each about 3 inches in diameter, which were used.
 They were of soft iron, and intended for the legs of an electromagnet.
   NO effect was found.       The length of the A spark needed to make
the jar over<U+FB02>ow was, as near as one could tell, the same, whether the
iron was in the spiral or not.      Thus :—
                Without iron    ........ .....
                                           '.       A=   0'53

                With three bars    ............          0'515
 No difference that   one could be sure of.

                                           Summary.
   14. The noteworthy circumstance    in all these experiments    the              is
remarkable action of a long thick good conductor in causing the jar
to over<U+FB02>ow,  especially       be insulated, the most powerful con
                                 if   it
ductor for this purpose being one with considerable self-induction
and capacity but very little resistance.  Evidently such a conductor
assists the formation   of an electric surging, whose accumulated
momentum charges the jar momentarily up to bursting point.       He
sistance damps the vibrations down, and short wires have insuf<U+FB01>cient
 electricinertia and capacity to get them up. Iron, whether massive
0r subdivided, shows no e<U+FB01>ect whatever on the e<U+FB01>ective inductance of
a circuit surrounding it.

 discharging tongs held round the lip.      Probably the sharp edges of
 the tinfoil contributed to this e<U+FB02>'ect, possibly also dust or other
 specks on the surface of the glass, or it may be the action of the air
 <U+FB01>lm itself, but it seems as if the extremely small inductance of such a
 path likewise aids what, if it is to occur at all, must take advantage
 of a <U+FB02>ood tide, a millionth of a second’s duration.

     A   spark at           A new
                   caused the distant                        jar to over<U+FB02>ow easily, but had
no e<U+FB01>ect on the near one.   Similarly,                       a  spark at C  caused the jar
 distant from     to over<U+FB02>ow easily, but had no effect on its own

   An A spark never caused spark at C. Sparks occurred either at
                                            a
A or at      according to which happened to be the narrowest gap, but
                      C,
not at both; and       was always the jar most distant from the

                                                                    spark
that over<U+FB02>owed its lip.
   16. The explanation probably depends upon the fact that
                                                                 when a
spark discharges its near jar the charge from the distant one rushes
forward, but, not being able to arrive in time, surges back
                                                                violently
and over<U+FB02>ows.       The eifect can probably be imitated with
                                                                     long          a

door at one end. It can certainly be observed in         lavatory where  a

opening and suddenly closing one of the wash-basin taps a surging
is set up in the connecting pipe, and the dribble becomes a

    Something       apparently of the same sort has been quite recently
observed      with  sinuously alternating currents by Mr. Ferranti in the
Deptford mains.            But whereas that case can be described as a long
stretch of capacity with locally concentrated inductance, mine is a long
stretch of inductance with locally concentrated capacity.                           Accord

            DISCUSSION       or Ovnsrnow        AND   SURGiNG     EXPERIMENTS.
    17.   For the complete explanation of the over<U+FB02>ow experiments, the
static capacity        of the long wire, and the momentum of the pulses
rushing along         it,   must be taken into account, and a wire is more
effective when insulated and charged                     than when lying on the
ground.
    It  does act, however, even when             lying on the ground, i.e., when its
magnetic momentum is all that can be supposed e<U+FB01>ective.                             But the
ordinary      theory    of  discharge     oscillation   will   not  account     for  the jar
being thereby raised to a higher potential                   than   it was   at the begin
 ning of the series; the amplitude of the vibration necessarily de
 creases.      Hence it is probable that the fact of over<U+FB02>ow does not
prove that the entire potential of the jar is raised; only that the
 potentiale the tinfoil edges is excessive. The charge is probably
 not uniformly distributed at the extremity of each swing.                                 The
 fringe of sparklings above the edge of the tinfoil are well known
 whenever a jar is discharged; and over<U+FB02>ow is merely an exaggera_
 tion of these sparklings, which usually leap up and subside.                         In fact
 they    can  be  seen    to  jump   higher   and   higher,   as  the  spark   is  gradually
 increased, until the lip is leaped.
     The idea of the pulses rushing along the connecting wires, and
 adding their momentum to the oscillation of the jar-discharge,                            sug
  gests that    there   must      be a best  length    for the   connectors,      viz.,   when
  the period of their pulses agrees with the period of oscillation of the
  discharge; and the fact that there is a best length is found experi
  mentally.
     The same length of connector is not equally e<U+FB02>’ective with pint and
  gallon jars.      A longer one is best for the larger jar; and if a con
  nector be too long it does not promote over<U+FB02>ow any more vigorously
  that   if it were somewhat too short.

16                   Mr. O.  J. Lodge.       Experiments    on         [June 4,
    The damping e<U+FB01>ect of resistance no doubt partly comes in here as
helping to account for the evil of unnecessarily long connecting wires;
and no <U+FB01>ne adjustment of length has been found necessary to bring
out in a marked manner the surging effects.
    If any experimenter should fail to obtain these conspicuously, he
probably has his connectors too short or too long.             It is advantage
ous, though not essential, to have the long wire insulated.                 It is
essential to have it highly conducting.          Iron is for these purposes by
far the worst conducting metal, because it is magnetically throttled
   Another small point is that good contacts aid in causing over<U+FB02>ow ;
especially when the connecting wires are not long enough.               Insigni
<U+FB01>cant air spaces suf<U+FB01>ce to damp out some of the vigour of the sub
sidiary oscillation to which these effects seem due.                 With long
massive leads, however, good joints are not of so much consequence.
    (Parenthetically it may be remarked how well adapted the usual
orthodox lightning conductor            is to develop violent surging and
splashing effects.)
            Further Over<U+FB02>ow and Surging Otrcwit Ezpertments.
   18. TWU     jars standing side by side, and connected in parallel by
long    wires   to the machine, sometimes both over<U+FB02>owed.                Sparks
taken at the jar knobs with ordinary. discharging tongs had no such
effect.
   The tongs were sometimes arranged over'the lip of a jar, so as to
help its over<U+FB02>ow if possible; but it was not easy to do this. Near
the edge of each coating they had the best chance, but the splash
usually preferred an immense jump through air over a glass surface
to a much smaller jump through the discharging tongs.                Over<U+FB02>ow is
evidently   a  very quick   effect,  and   must   occuryin  a   hurry or not at
all.
   A   couple of jars standing side by side on the same metal plate had
a gap between their knobs as shown in <U+FB01>g. 7, and one of them was
connected by long leads to the machine.            It now often sparked across
G  into the second jar when       an Aspark occurred.       But the second jar
was not thereby charged.           The charge just sprang into it and out
again.

being otherwise leakily connected so that they might charge.                     Every

markably long <U+FB02>ashes between the plates.

   A jar   standing   on bottom    plate    will receive a <U+FB02>ash, but it will not

Crowds Of points, and knobs of all sizes, get struck equally well, if
of the same height and all equally well connected to the bottom

however, several get struck at once.               A gas-<U+FB02>ame burning on the
bottom plate gets struck at a much greater distance than does any
metallic conductor.        The weak hot-air column is precisely what this

of twice the apparent elevation, and strikes down right through the
<U+FB02>ame.
    But though     it  thus readily smashes a weak dielectric, it will not
take a bad     conductor.      A wet string or water tube may, in fact,
reach right up till it touches the top plate, and yet receive no <U+FB02>ash,
while the other things shall be getting struck all the time.
    When the striking distance is too great for a noisy <U+FB02>ash, a crowd
of violet brushes     spit between the top plate and protuberances 0n the
lower plate: reminding one of some lightning photographs.               The
e<U+FB01>ect is still more marked if the top plate is a reservoir of water with
a perforated bottom.        The rain shower increases the length of these
multiple gentle high-resistance purple discharges. Adding salt to the
water tends to bring about the ordinary noisy white <U+FB02>ash of great
length.

 things of the same height struck equally well, independently of their
shape.

 the plates was established gradually, as in <U+FB01>g. 10, so that the strain

    Unless the jars are large, compared with the capacity of the plates,
even the conditions of <U+FB01>g. 9 will not make the rush quite sudden;
and in that case points and small knobs do get struck more easily
than large knobs and domes, especially when the top plate is nega
tive.‘      But when the rush is really sudden, no di<U+FB01>erence as to sign
manages to show itself ; and even such insigni<U+FB01>cant advantage as the
point happens to show in the <U+FB01>rst column of the above table dis
appears.
     High resistance, interposed between knob and. bottom plate in
<U+FB01>g. 10, alters the character of the spark entirely, making it soft and
velvety, but has no effect upon its length nor upon the ease with
which its knob gets struck as compared with others connected direct.
But the same resistance, interposed in <U+FB01>g. 9, prevents its being struck
 altogether.
     In other words, sudden rushes strike good conductors, independent
 of terminal: steady strain selects sharp or small terminals, almost
independent of conductivity; the violence of the <U+FB02>ash being, how
 ever, by high resistance very much altered.                             The total energy is,
doubtless, the same, or even greater with the quiet heating spark,
because of concentration                 and no loss by radiation; but the duration

of the discharge is what makes the difference.          The spark through
high resistance, instead of being alternating, can be seen to be in
termittent (110., multiple), when analysed in a revolving mirror.
    There is no need in these sudden rush experiments for the long
leads of <U+FB01>g. 9, though perhaps they add to the length of the sparks.
    22. Sparks thus obtained from the outer coats of jars are con
venient for taking under water, or to water ; and the phenomena thus
seen    are singular, and sometimes violent.
   Water acts mainly as a dielectric under these circumstances, and,
with small electrodes, such as the bared end of a gutta-percha wire,
the water between gets burst with extraordinary violence: often
breaking the containing glass vessel.
    This arrangement of Leyden jars should be handy for blasting
operations, because no specially good insulation of the leads is
necessary.
                  EXPERIMENTS    ON SURGING   CIRCUIT PROPER.
    23.   Although all the over<U+FB02>ow         experiments   are controlled by
electrical surgings,      I  have been accustomed specially to apply the

name “surging circuit          to the case where sparks are obtained not
between two distinct parts of a circuit, but between two points on
one and the same good conductor, under circumstances when it'does
not form the alternative          path to anywhere, and when it would
ordinarily be supposed there was no possible reason for a spark at
all. For instance, in <U+FB01>g. 12 the loop of wire round the room is a
 mere off-shoot      or appendage of an otherwise complete and very
ordinary arrangement, and yet a spark can occur at E whenever the
ordinary discharge occurs at A; a spark, too, often quite          as  long,
though not so strong, as the main spark at A.

   This table evidently shows that the main part of the    spark    the                               E           is
rushing of the charge in the N part of the wire back to the discharged
A knob. It has two paths, through the wire via”. 0, and direct across
the spark-gap E. Most of        chooses     except when there
                                                   it              high   E,                                 is

have this e<U+FB01>ect.       Resistance at Q prevents any sudden e<U+FB01>ect of the
A spark on the long circuit, and therefore never calls out a spark at
E at all: the charged wire discharges leisurely through resistance at
Q, and accordingly (there being no jar) the spark at A is quiet.
   The fact in the table not immediately intelligible is the extra
length of E spark caused by insertion of resistance at P; or, to a less
extent, at 0. It would appear to indicate the eifect of surgings in
the conductor, which accumulate a momentary opposite charge on one
of the knobs before the one partitioned off by high resistance has had
time appreciably to discharge.

    24.  Although the        over<U+FB02>ow     experiments     are evidence of the
momentum        of  a re<U+FB02>ected    pulse,   an  idea  which   is intended to be
conveyed by the term “recoil kick,” yet            I have been accustomed to
apply the term specially to cases where re<U+FB02>exion takes place at the
free end of a long wire, constituting an appendage or lateral exten
sion, without forming any necessary part, of a discharging circuit.
Usually a pair of similar wires were employed, and their ends were
brought near enough for the momentum of the recoiling pulse, when
spitting off from each wire, to bridge the interval and thereby cause
aregular spark.         If the wires were too far separate, a momentary
brush leaped from each end and subsided again.                Occasionally these
brushes extended over a considerable length of wire, giving them a
peculiar luminous appearance at each discharge.              The fact that the
 brush was an up-rush and subsidence was shown by the similar
appearance of both the wires, and by the fact that if a spark from
either wire was taken into a jar the jar was not found to be charged
 by  it.
    2-5. The brush or sparking out from the wires, which I call the
 recoil kick, is most marked at certain places on those wires; and
 usually at the distant ends.         This was what called attention to the
 e<U+FB02>ect (see above § 3).       I <U+FB01>nd that Mr. A. P. Chattock obtained the
 <U+FB01>rst direct evidence of it, in some experiments with my apparatus
 which he made in my absence on March 1, 1888.                 The plan of the
 particular  counexions     used by   him  (<U+FB01>g.  14) has  no importance, but it
 su<U+FB01>ced to show how much more readily a long spark could be
 obtained at the far end of long wires than at the near end; and
 Mr. Chattock was quite clear about the e<U+FB01>ect being due to re<U+FB02>ected
 electric pulses or stationary waves in the wires, and was prepared to
 look for evidence of nodes and loops if the wires had been long
  enough.

 liquid    resistance   W  (which was useless) by a wire, and ordinarily
 using two jars in series instead of one, connecting their knobs one to
 each wire (more nearly as shown in <U+FB01>g. 15), and connecting their
 outer coats together and roughly to the earth by standing them on
 the same sheet of tinfoil on a wooden table. And because the knobs
 of machine and of discharger were not the same size, they were <U+FB01>rst
 compared by letting an ordinary discharge choose between them.
 They o<U+FB02>ered equally good paths when A = 0'45, C = 0'54: inch.
 The discharger was put in one or other of two positions: bridging

   And at greater distances, when no regular spark occurred at C,
there was still a brush discharge there at every A spark.
   Joining up a small jar to the Ca terminals, the long sparking and
brushing there ceased.
   Without this shunt jar, however, and with the terminals well sepa
rated, the wires glowed at every A spark along a considerable port-ion
of their length, looking thick and fuzzy with momentary luminosity.
 (The wires were the long thin (No. 18 B.W.G.) copper and iron
round the room: those two being up and handy for the experiment.
They show the luminous appearance better than either thicker or
much thinner ones.) With a small condenser the e<U+FB01>ect was not great,
and with a very big one it was also not great; but with a single
gallon jar the glow on the wires extended more than half way round
the theatre, and a pair in series (i.e., half the capacity) seemed to do
even a tri<U+FB02>e better.

   27. To see if the proximity of the opposite wires assisted the effect
one of them was reversed, so that the plan was as in <U+FB01>g. 15; but the
far ends of both wires got luminous as before (although the luminous
portions were now on opposite sides of the room), and the luminosity
extended from 3 to 2 on the one wire, and from 3' to 2 on the other.
   28. A jar was held in the hand near either glowing terminal, for
the wires to spark into. They kept on doing-so, but the jar was not
charged, showing that they sparked in and out again.

 called “ side flash.”

    29.   Although there is nothing precisely metrical about these experi
ments, as so far conducted, it is well to notice that an approximation
to the     self-induction of the main discharge circuit can be obtained
from them. For the capacity of the two gallon jars in cascade is about
28 K metres; and if the length of the wires which give the best
recoil be taken as half a wave-length, the waves emitted are 60 metres
long.      So the inductance of the discharge circuit can be got from
21rJ(28L/,u) = 60; whence L = 32/1. metres.
    This is too small, showing that the waves are longer than 60 metres,
and     that the most appropriate capacity for these particular wires
is  something less than that of the two gallon jars in cascade<U+FB01>“
                            HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS.
    30.   This evidence of the existence of electro-magnetic waves seemed
to me      of considerable interest, because I had been for some years
contemplating the production of radiation by direct electro-magnetic
experiments, the di<U+FB02>iculty being their detection, i.e., the proof of
their existence.
    My early notions, described to Section A of the British Associa
tion at    York   (1881), were directed towards the ambitious attempt of
trying to make the waves short enough to be visible, at least to a
thermopile or to some chemical detector.                  But two years later, at
Southport, Fitzgerald pointed         out  that  a discharging Leyden jar must
emit radiation, and that though its waves would be yards or miles
long, yet it might not be hopeless to prove that they were waves by
obtaining interference phenomena.
    Some of Lord Rayleigh’s large-scale interference experiments                 with
sound waves, exhibited to the Royal Institution on January 20,                   1888
(‘Nature,’ vol. 38, p. 208), re-awakened in me the h0pe that                     such
experiments were possible, and the desire to try them. And                       now,
simply by attaching long wires to a discharging Leyden jar circuit,
the waves had become without trouble conspicuous.                    One had only
 to lengthen the wires enough, and to look at them in the dark, to see
 by the brushes the nodes caused by the interference of the direct
 and re<U+FB02>ected pulses surging to and fro in the wires; to see in fact
 the waves themselves, and to measure their length in a manner pre
                                                                                    '

28                 Mr. O.  J. Lodge.     Erperiments  on          [June 4,
   True that the Melde experiment      does not measure the wave-length
in air, and so  also the  observation of Mr. Chattock and myself would
only measure the wave-length on wire; but it had already been shown
by Mr. Heaviside among others, by Kircholf also (though did not   I
know of Kircho<U+FB01>’s work), that pulses travelled along insulated non
magnetic wires at the same speed as waves through air, or at a speed
only insigni<U+FB01>cantly less. In fact Mr. Poynting has taught us to
regard all these effects as conveyed through the air, i.e., by the ethereal
medium, in a manner only very subordinately affected by the material
of the conductor.
   Hence the waves guided by long isolated wires and measured in
recoil kick experiments ought to be the same length as, or only
slightly shorter than, the true ether-waves spreading out from the
oscillating circuit into space.
   The fact that electric waves could be thus detected and measured,
I stated at the Society of Arts, on March 17, 1888, and published
more precisely in the ‘Phil. Mag.’ for August, 1888; but to this
latter I appended a footnote to say that in the current number of
Wiedemann’s ‘Annalen,’ viz., that for July, the same year, there
was a paper by Dr. Hertz, describing some experiments he had made
at Karlsruhe, whereby he had detected the waves in free space: a
research which in the following September was enthusiastically pro
claimed to the world by Fitzgerald, at Bath. At the same meeting I
described in general terms my detection of the waves on the surface
of conducting wires.      It appears that Hertz began, much as I had
done, by the observation of surging circuits ; for, using a coil instead
of an inductive machine, and attaching to one terminal a nearly
closed rectangle, he observed it spark across the gap. In this obser
vation also he had the start of me, for his <U+FB01>rst paper appeared in
 1887; and in his rapid development of it, in the comparative freedom
from students of Karlsruhe, he struck on the in<U+FB02>uence between one
circuit and another across space, and so made the astonishing dis
covery that the radiation in air was intense enough to cause sparks
in conductors upon which it fell.
   This same discovery would have been made by the audience at the
Royal Institution on the evening of March 8, 1889, if it had not
been made before; for, during a lecture on Leyden jars, every time
one was discharged through a considerable length of wire, the heavily
gilt wall paper sparkled brightly, by reason of the incident radia
tion.
   The achievement      of Hertz is well known, and it is only the
customary   interest  attaching to circumstances connected with what
will probably be regarded as an epoch in electrical science that con
stitutes my excuse for making the above statement.

riments    do make    clear, viz., that the velocity of a pulse along an
isolated thin copper wire is practically identical with the speed of
light; in accordance with the theory based on Maxwell, and previously
mentioned.      Hertz at one time stated, as the result of some of his
experiments, that there was considerable discrepancy between the
speed    of waves along wires and of waves in free space ; and, though
my own experiments were (to me at least) conclusive in the opposite
direction, yet as they had not been published in detail, they could not
be properly taken into account.        The supposed discrepancy, however,
had the good eifect of leading Professor J. J. Thomson              to make
several interesting experiments.
         QUANTITATIVE Recon.      KICK EXPERIMENTS (May, 1888).
                           Description of Wires used.
    31.  In order to make real measurements of wave-length, a circuit
 was carefully prepared, consisting of two copper wires (about N o. 17
 B.W.G.), 15cm. diameter, stretched parallel to one another, half a
metre    apart, by silk suspenders.
    They lay parallel to the theatre table, i.e., north and south; but
 the room was not big enough for them to be wholly straight, so after
travelling the length of the table horizontally they were taken
 a few feet vertically up, then back over head, and down again to the
 spark micrometer, according to the plan of <U+FB01>g. 16, nowhere being
 taken near any wall or other surface.       Their total lengths were
                        1526+28'5+16 = 15705 cm.
                        1529+36'5+16 =      1-581'5 ,,
 so  each may be taken as 15% metres long, and the wave length corre
 sponding to their fundamental oscillation period as 31% metres, corre
 sponding to about 10,000,000 vibrations per second.
     When used alOne, these are spoken of as “the shorter leads,” be
  cause it was very soon necessary to supplement them by a similar pair
  of No. 17 copper wires half a metre apart, suspended similarly, but in
  an east and west direction, and used as extensions.       When joined up
  in series with the former pair of wires the whole is spoken of as “ the
  longer leads.” The additional portions measured 2263 and 22%? cm.
  respectively.   Hence the entire length of each of the longer leads
  may   be  taken   as 382 metres, and the wave-length           correspond
  ing to their recoil as    76%  metres, or say, 4,000,000 vibrations per
  second.
     The total resistance of the “ shorter leads ” was 0'78 ohm, and of
  the “ longer leads,” 1'95 ohms.
     The static capacity of the longer leads     I estimate, by the formula

arrangement with millimetre thread, and head divided into 400 parts,
made for reading Newton’s rings, but supplied for present purposes
with a pair of knobs l'94sO and 1'965 cm. diameter, on insulating
glass     pillars.   These constitute the C spark gap at which the e<U+FB01>ect
of the recoil kick is to be observed.
     At the other end of the leads is arranged the condenser, usually a
pair of jars back to back in one line, so as to close the circuit in
a simple geometrical         manner, and the Voss jars being at <U+FB01>rst used,
i.e., the small jars forming part of the Voss machine.
     The A knobs at which the exciting spark is taken are constituted
by the universal discharger, which, standing on a block under the
two parallel wires above it, and connecting them together through an
air gap, can easily be moved along the table to and fro, always in con
tact with the wires above it; and its distance from the jars at one end
of the wires can be readily measured.         This distance is called u, and
is indicated in <U+FB01>g. 16.
     The distance between the A knobs was supposed to remain con
 stant, but to avoid any uncertainty, and to eliminate the eifect of the
different size of its knobs, the virtual length of the A spark was
 measured with the spark-micrometer by bringing its knobs near enough
 to just shunt out the discharger, so that half the sparks chose one and
 half the other.       The distance between the C knobs under these cir
 cumstances is entered in the table as the virtual length of the A spark.
 They are then separated further, so that the spark occurs every time
 at A, but it does not cease at C until they have been widened dis
 tinctly.      The maximum distance to which they can be separated with
 out causing the C spark to altogether cease is then read, and the excess
                                                                       ’

 of the one     reading over the other constitutes the recoil kick.” This
 procedure was then repeated for another position of the discharger A.
     The plan of operation usually was to begin with the discharger close
 to the jars, and to move it away along the leads 5 cm. at a time, read
  ing in each position the minimum and maximum 0 sparks, as just
  explained, the maximum reading being that at which 0 began to
  fail. Tuning is more easily done by thus varying the inductance of
  the discharge circuit than in any other way.
      A short range would have been suf<U+FB01>cient to give the position at
   which the maximum recoil kick occurred, but an extensive range was
  often used with the idea of getting indications of harmonics.

      33.  Rough estimates     of the jars employed in this and similar
   experiments     could be made in various ways, and no great accuracy
   is worth aiming at with ordinary shapes of jar, because of the differ
   ence between the circumstance under which they are used from those

   32                Mr. 0.   J. Lodge.    Experiments on         [June 4,
   under    which they are measured. Nevertheless, in order to get a
   fairly good measure of their capacity, a standard condenser was made,
   with which they could be compared.
                            Standard Air-condenser.
      A   couple of plates of carefully selected plate glass, as used for
   mirrors, about 2 feet square, were silvered chemically on both faces,
   secure connexion between the two faces round the edge of the top
   plate being made. A circular cut or clean scratch,     I  mm. broad and
   5304 cm. inside diameter, was then made on the under surface of the
  top plate so as to isolate a trap-door portion.       A hole previously
   drilled through the centre of the top plate, and silvered inside, per
   mitted conductive access to the central area; and the borders of the
   plate acted as guard ring. The silver was cleared away from a small
   patch near the centre of the upper surface of the top plate, and a glass
   tube cemented on permitted the trap-door terminal to emerge in a
   well-insulated  manner.      Two other terminals, one attached to the
  bottom plate, and the other to the general surface of the top plate
   (the guard-ring terminal), were provided.
      Four glass distance-pieces with wide bevelled edges (to improve in
   sulation) were carefully cut out of one piece of glass, and their thick
  ness was measured     with a spherometer as 01208?» inch.
      The top plate was supported on these, near its four corners, and the
  whole placed in a uitable box with arti<U+FB01>cially dried atmosphere, the
   bottom plate being similarly supported near its corners, so that what
}
  ever bending there was might result in concentric surfaces.          The
  electrostatic capacity   of the trap-door was thus 5729   cm.
      There was some di<U+FB01>iculty with the insulation of the trap-door por
  tion, and the main leak was traced to dust, viz., <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>bres of some
  length, which settled on the bottom plate and bridged the interval
  between it and the top one.      The narrow gap between trap-door and
  guard-ring, being of course carefully cleaned, was not found to leak
  anything like so much as one of these <U+FB01>bres. By care, the causes of
  leak could be minimised, and a special key was constructed whereby
  the trap-door could be discharged through a ballistic galvanometer
  the merest instant before the guard-ring was discharged to earth.      In
  fact, by a screw adjustment the two events could be made simul
  taneons.
      34. A set of 1444 secondary Planté cells, made by bending strips of
  lead over small glass vessels standing in a sort of test-tube rack,
  having been charged in twelve sets of twelve each, were connected
  in series and used to <U+FB01>ll the condensers with.
      Sometimes di<U+FB01>erent kicks were obtained with the whole series of
  cells; sometimes the same kick was imitated by tapping off a certain

    The two jars supplied with the Voss machine happen to be, un

                  Fi'rst Approximation        to Inductance of Circuit.
   35.   In order     to estimate the inductance          of the discharge circuit,          ii
is necessary to       know the following data :—
            Thickness      of the N0. 17 wires . .      ......            0'15 cm.
             Thickness     of A discharging rods. .          . . . .      0'60   ,,

            Thickness      inside other jars ..... .        . . . .       0'6   ,,
   Now, the discharge circuit consisted of a rectangle with one pair oi
opposite sides made by certain length, it, of the No. 17 wires 50 cm
apart, and with the other pair of opposite sides made by discharge
and jar rods, 50 cm. in length, and separated by a distance, it.
   I am not prepared to calculate the inductance of this rectangle
precisely, but when approximately square it makes but little differ
 ence whether      I   reckon it as a pair of parallel wires of length u, dis'
 tance 50, and diameter 0'15, plus a pair of parallel rods of length 50

    Here the maximum occurs somewhere about the 35 cm. distance,
probably on the hither side of it; so we may judge that the value
'11,= 34   about the place where the waves emitted agree with twice
             is
the length of the “ shorter leads,” i.e., are 31—2Lmetres long.
   To see how this agrees with calculation, we must decide how much
of the capacity of those wires ought to be added to the capacity of
the jars in calculating the period of the discharge oscillation. If we

 include none of the leads in the discharged capacity, S/ K = 134 em.
if we include the whole, S/K = 195 cm.
    As for the self-induction, we get that approximately by puttin,
u = 34 in the expression (24), which gives it as 1768 cm.
    So the calculated wave-length is, with the whole of the leads capa
city,  21r/ (195      X 1768)    = 3690 cm. or 37 metres; and the agreemen
is not   very good.       If   the   leads capacity is not supposed effective i1
forcing the vibrations, its charge being merely forced to vibrate b;
the jar discharge, then the calculated wave-length is 31 metres, whicj
is suspiciously accordant with observation.

   Here the maximum is evidently off the scale ; so that, to show it
the discharging circuit requires to be still further diminished in size
which is impracticable.              As to calculated wave-length, the lowes
estimate makes        it 30 metres, when u     =  5 : the highest estimate make;
it 32%   metres, either of which is so far accordant with observation.

   Here the sharpness of the maximum is so great as to make it
probable that u = 30 happens to hit the right place pretty exactly.
   The calculated wave-length for this value of u (remembering to
substitute 0'3 for 0'41 in equation (24) because of the less thickness of
these jar-rods) is 2r](1700 X 721) = 7000 cm., or 70 metres ; a
tri<U+FB02>e less if the leads capacity is omitted ; whereas the double length
of the recoiling wires indicates 761; metres.
   This is not very good, and I hope that better calculation applied to
the data will give a better result.       The self-induction as estimated is
almost certainly less than the true: but how much less I am unable
to say.    Another uncertainty is the appropriate capacity of the jars for
these high frequencies.        It is not likely that the K for the glass will
be just the same for 4,000,000 vibrations a second as it is under
steady strain.

   Here the maximum is not quite so well marked, and it is a little
uncertain on which side of the 15-cm. position it lies.
   Take it = 15 however, and add the capacity of the leads, 147, to
that of the jar, 357, and the calculated wave-length comes out 47
metres ; or, without the capacity of the leads, 39% metres.
   This is hopelessly di<U+FB01>erent from 76% metres, but it is probable
that  it is the upper octave. To make the fundamental wave-length
79 metres would require it to be about 130 cm.
   It is evidently desirable in these experiments that the jar capacity
shall be    much greater than the leads capacity; for when the two
capacities are comparable in size, the recoil kick, although it still
exists, has no very well de<U+FB01>ned maximum.
   It would also be desirable in future experiments on the same plan
to use, as dielectric in the condenser, a substance, like para<U+FB02>tin,
whose speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity may be depended on as fairly
constant.
                    Experiments with Sliding Condenser.
   41.  The following     experiments, made with an adjustable con
denser, were intended to examine the effect of varying the capacity
as well as the self-induction; also to see what evidence of harmonics
could be detected.
   The condensers used were each of them a. pair of silvered tubes
sliding into one another; their capacity, as the inner tubes were
pushed into six different graduations, being measured above (§ 34).
   The discharge circuit was a pair of No. 17 B.W.G. copper wires
each 2 metres long, stretched horizonally on glass pillars, parallel to
 one another and 10 cm. apart.         One of the tube condensers was
arranged     as a bridge at one end of these wires; and the diseharger,
with its knobs set 1 cm. apart, was used as a movable       bridge and set
at di<U+FB01>erent measured distances from the condenser.
   Charging from the machine was done through wooden sticks, so
as not to introduce unknown capacities.          The “longer leads "lead
from the coats of the tube-condenser      to the spark-micrometer, where
 the  equivalent  A  spark and the maximum        C or recoil spark were
 observed.
    The numbers entered    in the following table are the excess of the
 max.  0 spark over the virtual A spark, i.e., C spark-length minus A
 spark-length, in millimetres. The maximum occurs in the di<U+FB01>erent
 columns at about u = 50, say 35, 30, 25, 20, and 15, respectively.

                                       (Abstract)
   In a paper printed in the ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society,’
No. 190, 1878, an account was given of some experiments undertaken
in order to test the possibility of using the common balance in place
of the torsion balance in the Cavendish experiment.      The success
obtained seemed to justify the continuation of the work, and this
paper contains an account of an experiment carried out with a large
bullion balance, in place of the chemical balance used in the pre
liminary trials. The work has been carried out at the Mason College,
Birmingham.
   The Principle of the Experiment—The immediate object of the
experiment may be regarded as the determination of the attraction of
one known mass on another.       If two spheres, of masses M and M’,
have their centres a distance d apart, the attraction is, according to
the law of gravitation, GMM'ld”, where G is the gravitation constant.
Astronomy justi<U+FB01>es the law in certain cases as regards M’/d’, but
does not give the value of G or M, except in the product GM.          To
<U+FB01>nd G we must measure GMM'/al2 in some case in which both M and
M’ are known.      Having found G, we may determine the mean
density of the earth, for, assuming that it is a sphere of radius R, the
weight     any mass M' at its surface

                                       = §G7rRAM'.
But if   g     is   the acceleration of gravity the weight of M’ may be
expressed as M'g.           Equating these values, we get

   Method     Using the Common Balance—With the length of beam

                              a
the attraction on the beam was eliminated.   Two spherical masses of
lead and antimony, about 21 kilos. each, were hung from the two
arms of the balance, so that their centres in the <U+FB01>rst position
were about 30 cm. above the centre of a large attracting mass, a
sphere of lead and antimony about 153 kilos., placed on a turntable,

 1891.]    Density    of the Earth and     the  Gravitation Constant.       41
so  that it could be brought in turn immediately under either of the
suspended     attracted masses.     A balancing mass of half the weight,
and at  double the distance from the centre of the turntable on the other
side, was found necessary, so that the centre of gravity should be in
the axis of rotation.       Before this was used, the ground level was
seriously   altered  by the rotation of the turntable.        The attraction of
the balancing mass was calculated and allowed for.
   The alteration in the weights of the attracted masses, due to the
motion of    the attracting   masses   from one side to the other, was the
quantity to be measured.         When this was determined in the lower
position  of the attracted masses they were raised to about double the
distance, and the attraction again determined.           The di<U+FB01>erence elimi
nated the pull on the beam, suspending wires, &c. To lessen the effect
of want of homogeneity         or sphericity in the masses, or of want of
symmetry in the turntable, the masses were all inverted and changed
over each   to the other side, and the weighings repeated.
   The position of the beam was determined by the re<U+FB02>ection of a
scale in a mirror used with “double suspension.”              The mirror was
suspended by       two  silk  threads,   one   attached   to   the end of the
ordinary   pointer about 60 cm. below the central knife edge, the other
parallel to  it, being attached to a <U+FB01>xed support.         The mirror turned
through   an  angle about 150 times      as  great as that  through which the
beam turned, and one scale division corresponded to an angle of tilt
in the beam of about 2/15ths of a second.
   The value of a scale division was determined by the use of two
equal centigram riders which could be placed on or taken oif wire
frames representing the scale pans of a small subsidiary beam, 25 cm.
long, <U+FB01>xed parallel to and at the centre of the large beam.         When one
lider was placed on one supporting frame the other was at the same
instant lifted olf the other frame.
   The balance was left free throughout a series of weighings, and no
moving parts of the apparatus were connected with the case.
   The values obtained are as follows :—
                    The gravitation constant G =
                  Mean density of the earth A = 54934.
   In the paper a description is given of a new form of cathetometer
used to  measure the diameters of the masses.

 III.  “ On the Pressure of Wind on Curved Vanes.” By W. H.
       DINES, B.A. Communicated by the Meteorological Council.
       Received May 14, 1891.
    In June,  1890, a paper" was presented to the Royal Society showing
the results of some experiments upon wind pressure upon an inclined
 surface, and I now give an account of some supplementary work
upon the same subject which has been done during the past winter.
    The apparatus was the same as that previously described, with the
exception of the actual pressure plate, and precisely the same method
 of observation has been adopted.
    Instead of a <U+FB02>at wooden plate, a piece of sheet metal 1 foot square
has been used, the metal being bent so as to form a portion of a
cylinder, the curvature of which was easily varied by drawing the
opposite edges more or less together by means of two <U+FB01>ne wires.
The plate was attached to the lever of the apparatus by about
 13 in. of 1-in. brass tube, the tube passing a little more than
half way across the back of the plate.              It is evident that the tube
must interfere with the free passage of the air over the back of the
plate, but some kind of support behind cannot be avoided.
    In certain positions, experiments could not be made on account of
the unsteadiness of the motion, and the consequent <U+FB02>uttering of the
sheet metal. There was no trouble in getting the value of the pressure
in these positions, but the vibratory motion was often so violent
that it tore the metal, almost as though it were paper, and soon
rendered the plate useless. These positions are all marked * in the
tables; and the corresponding values are more or less uncertain,
because, as soon as the vibrations were apparent, the engine was
stopped as quickly as possible to avoid the trouble of having to obtain
a new plate.
   As in the preceding paper, 100 has been taken to represent the
moment of the pressure upon one sq. ft. exposed normally at 1 ft. from
the axis, and all other moments are expressed relatively to this.
    The results obtained are given in the following tables, the diagram
at the head of each table showing the form of surface to which it
applies.    No attempt has been made to eliminate the e<U+FB02>ect of the
eddy from the frame of the apparatus, a full discussion of which will
be found in the paper referred to. The values given also include the
pressure upon the supporting arm.              This is counterbalanced in the
normal position, but must have an increasing effect as the angle of
incidence increases, and for this reason it has been considered useless
to carry the experiments much beyond an angle of 60° or 70°.

1891.]               On the Pressure      of  l/Vz'nd on    Curved Vanes.                   43
    The diagrams showing the way in which the normal component of
the pressure varies            with the angle of incidence have been obtained by
taking the mean values from positions                     I   and II.     In drawing the
curves, the want of observations at the intermediate angles was felt,
but    I  do    not think that further experiments would greatly modify
the   forms obtained.
    A few observations with the plate in the other position, i.e., with
the axis        of the cylinder parallel to the long arm of the whirling
machine, have been made.                 They are given in Tables IV and V.
    In Tables        I, II, IV,    and  V the results have been reduced to pres
sures    per sq.      ft.;   this has been done by multiplying by 12/11‘7 and
12/9    respectively.           In Table III, the rectangle contained by the two
straight edges and the chords                of the curved        edges  contains    1  sq. ft.
(the length           being 288 in.)       ; hence in this         case  no reduction        is

    Experiments for the purpose of <U+FB01>nding how the curvature in<U+FB02>uences
 the resistance at perpendicular incidence have also been made.
    The curvature of the plate was gradually increased by drawing the
 opposite edges more closely together, and the corresponding pressures
 were obtained, both with the concave and convex surfaces facing the
 wind.
    The projection of the plate upon a plane perpendicular to the wind
 direction becomes less as the curvature increases, but the pressures
 have been reduced to unit area, so that they may be easily comparable.
 It should be noted, however, that the pressure upon a rectangle is less
 than upon an equal square, the difference        I

1V. “Quadrant      Electrometers.”     By \V. E.       AYRTON, F.R.S.,
      J. PERRY, F.R.S., and W. E. SUMPNER,             D.Sc. Received
      May 19, 1891.
                                (Abstract)
   In 1886 it was noticed, on continuously charging up the needle
of Sir VVillinm Thomson’s bi<U+FB01>lar suspension quadrant electrometer
No. 5, made by Messrs. White, of Glasgow, and in use at the labo
ratories at the Central Institution, that the de<U+FB02>ection of the needle,
when the same Pl). (potential diiference) was maintained between the
quadrants instead of steadily increasing, <U+FB01>rst increased, and then
diminished ; so that, both for a large charge on the needle as well as
for a small, the sensibility of the instrument was small.        A similar
e<U+FB02>ect had been described by Dr. J. Hopkinson, in the ‘ Proceedings
of the Physical Society,’ vol. 7, Part 1, for the previous year, and
the explanation he gives of this curious result is, that if the aluminium
needle be below the centre of the quadrants, the downward attrac
tion of the needle which varies with the square of the needle’s
charge increases the pull on the bi<U+FB01>lar suspension, and so for high
charges more than cempensates for the increased de<U+FB02>ecting couple
due to electrical action.      On raising, however, the needle of our
electrometer much above the centre of the quadrants, the anomalous
 variation of sensibility of the instrument with increase of charge in
the needle did not disappear, and even when the needle was raised
so that it was very close to the top of the quadrants, and when, if
 Dr. Hopkinson’s explanation were correct, the sensibility (or de<U+FB02>ection
corresponding with a. given P.D. between the quadrants) ought to
have been very great for a large charge on the needle, it was, on the
contrary, found to be small.
    The needle was carefully weighed, with the platinum wire attached
and the weight dipping into the acid, and a calculation was made as
to the magnitude of the e<U+FB01>ect that should arise from the change of
 the pull of the <U+FB01>bres due to any upward or downward attraction of
the needle by the quadrants.        This calculation showed that for a
 P.D. of 3000 volts between the needle and the quadrants, the amount
 of such attraction was quite unable to account for the observed dimi
 nution of sensibility with large charges in the needle. Dr. Hopkin
                         “ Increased tension of the <U+FB01>bres from electrical
 son says in his paper,
 attraction does not therefore account for the whole of the facts,
 although it does play the principal part.” The experiments that we
 made at the end of 1886 and beginning of 1887, con<U+FB01>rmed by the
 calculation above referred to, proved that, at any rate in our speci
 men of the quadrant electrometer, the principal part of the anomalous

action was not caused by an increased tension of the <U+FB01>bres, and that
therefore some other cause must be looked for to explain the observed
results.
    An investigation, which turned out to be both lengthy and very
 laborious, was therefore undertaken to ascertain the cause of this
 curious behaviour of our White electrometer.       At <U+FB01>rst we thought
 that it might be due to some capillary action between the platinum
 weight and the sulphuric acid, which varied with the potential of
the acid, but, experiment having shown that this was not the explana
tion,   we decided to make an exhaustive series of experiments for
determining the laws connecting the variation of sensibility of the
White quadrant electrometer with the potential of the needle, the
distance between the silk <U+FB01>bres, and the distance between the quad
rants.    The investigation has occupied us on and off for some years,
and in carrying it out the quadrant electrometer has had to be taken
to pieces many times.
   To facilitate the frequent removal of the interior of the Leyden jar,
rendered necessary for carrying out the various experiments, an im
provement was introduced into the method of clamping the needle,
and to diminish leakage, an improvement was introduced into the
replenisher, both of which are described in detail in the paper.
    The PD. between the needle and the outside case of the electro
meter was measured by means of one of Sir William Thomson’s
absolute electrometers, made especially sensitive by thinning the
coach springs supporting the attracted aluminium disc.
   In July, 1888, several large P.Ds. were measured by means of this
absolute electrometer (using the constants that we had determined
for this instrument), and by means of one of Sir William Thomson’s
commercial “ electrostatic voltmeters,” reading to 20,000 volts, kindly
lent us by Messrs. Elliott Brothers. The result of these comparisons
led <U+FB01>rst to a correction in the constants that had been previously
sent out with the electrostatic voltmeters from Glasgow, and secondly,
to a new determination of the value of “'0.”            For Sir William
Thomson had calibrated these voltmeters electromagnetically on the
basis of the value of the electrochemical        equivalent of silver, as
determined by Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick, while we had
checked the calibration of the electrostatic voltmeter by comparing
this instrument with the absolute electrometer.        The value of “0”
thus obtained was 298 million metres per second.
   From the experiments made on varying the distance between the
<U+FB01>bres supporting the needle of the quadrant electrometer, it was
found that, when the control due to the <U+FB01>bres was large, the sensi
bility of the quadrant     electrometer increased more rapidly than the
potential  of the  needle, whereas, when the control due to the <U+FB01>bres
was small, the sensibility increased with the potential of the needle

up to a certain point, and then diminished        again as the potential of
the needle   was still further increased.
    From    experiments    made by varying the distance between the
quadrants, we     found that when the distance between the quadrants
was small, the    sensibility <U+FB01>rst increased as the potential of the needle
was raised, then it diminished,       and <U+FB01>nally it increased again for a
still further increase of the potential of the needle. The curve, there
fore, connecting     sensibility with potential of the needle was inva
riably of an    cu shape for a small distance between the quadrants.
    As the distance between the quadrants was increased, the sensi
bility curve <U+FB02>attened, becoming practically straight when the distance
separating the quadrants “as 39 mm.            For a greater distance than
this between the quadrants, the sensibility increased more rapidly
than the potential of the needle.
    The various curves accompanying            the paper show that this
quadrant     electrometer may be adjusted so that the variation of
sensibility with the potential of the needle may be made to follow
one or other of three distinct laws.     If the quadrants be near together,
there are certain limits between which the potential of the needle
may vary without producing            more than a small change in the
de<U+FB02>ection corresponding        with a <U+FB01>xed P.D. between the quadrants;
for example,     when the quadrants were about 2% mm. apart, and the
<U+FB01>bres   near together at the top, the de<U+FB02>ection produced by a P.D. of
 1'45 volts between the quadrants only varied about 11 per cent. when
 the potential of the needle varied from 896 to 3586 volts, that is, by
2690 volts.     When the <U+FB01>bres were far apart at the top, it was when the
 quadrants   were  about 1 mm. apart, as seen in sheet III, that a similar
 <U+FB02>atness was obtained in the curve connecting de<U+FB02>ection with potential
 of the needle.    In this case the de<U+FB02>ection of the needle was practically
 quite constant when its potential varied between 2152 and 3227 volts,
 and even when the potential of the needle was increased from 1434
 to 3407 volts, that is, by nearly 2000 volts, the de<U+FB02>ection did not
 increase by as much as 9 per cent.        This arrangement of the quad
 rants gives but a comparatively small sensibility, but, where great
 sensibility  is not required, it would be a convenient one to employ,
 as leakage of the Leyden jar, or loss of potential of the needle due to
  the rapid absorption that occurs when the jar is <U+FB01>rst charged, would
 only slightly a<U+FB01>ect the de<U+FB02>ection         for a <U+FB01>xed P.D. between the
  quadrants.
     When the quadrants were at about 39 mm. apart, the de<U+FB02>ection for
  a given P.D. between the quadrants was almost directly proportional
  to the potential of the needle.     This then would be the arrangement
  to employ    when the electrometer is used with alternating P.Ds.
  And lastly, when the quadrants were 41 mm. or more apart, the
  de<U+FB02>ection increased much more rapidly than the potential of the

56         Profs. Ayrton and Perry and Dr. Sumpner.             [June 4,
needle, so that maximum sensibility, bordering on instability, is
obtained with this arrangement of the quadrants.
   After carrying out a large number of experiments, the cause of the
irregularity in the action of the Thomson quadrant electrometer, as
made by Messrs. White, began to dawn on us.      The wire supporting
the aluminium needle, as well as the wire which connects the needle
with the sulphuric acid in the Leyden jar, is enclosed in a metallic
guard tube to screen the wire from external action. But, in order
that the needle may project outside the guard tube, openings are
made in its two sides. Hence the moment the needle is de<U+FB02>ected
from its zero position, each half of the needle becomes unsymmetri
cally placed relatively to the two metallic pieces which join the
upper and lower half of the guard tube. Therefore, in spite of the
needle and the guard tube being always maintained at the same
potential, there is a repulsion between the charges on the two con
necting pieces of the guard tube and the charges on the two halves of
the needle. And this repulsion has not only the defect of seriously
diminishing the sensibility of the quadrant electrometer as made by
Messrs. White, but causes the variation of sensibility of the electro
meter with variation of the RD. between the needle and the outer
coating of the Leyden jar to follow a far more complicated law than
that expressed by the conventional formula just given.
    To test this theory, that the peculiarities in the law of the quad
rant electrometer are due to the electric action of the guard tube on
the needle in consequence of the special shape of the former, we
intensi<U+FB01>ed and varied the want of symmetry         'of  the guard tube by
 attaching  a  piece  of  thin aluminium   foil to
                                                it    above and below the
 needle, and experiments made on the law connecting the sensibility
 of the electrometer with the potential of the needle showed that the
 law could be much altered in character by a slight shift in the
 position of the piece of aluminium foil.
    The paper then goes on to describe experiments connecting the
 motion of the electrical zero with the potential of the needle, and
 with the position of the adjustable quadrant.
    Guided by the results of long course of experiments on the White
                             a
 electrometer, we were led, with the assistance of Mr. Mather, to
 construct an improved uni<U+FB01>lar quadrant electrometer which        is  fully
 described and    illustrated  in the paper.    This improved electrometer
 differs in numerous particulars from that made by. Messrs. White.
 The bi<U+FB01>lar suspension is    abandoned for reasons given in the paper, and
 thereis  employed instead a new form of adjustable magnetic control,
so arranged that the needle   is    practically unaffected by outside mag
netic disturbance.       All the working parts are supported from the
base, so that on removing the glass shade, which serves as the Leyden
jar, all the parts can be got at and adjusted in position; all the

insulated stems are made of glass, and are under cover, protected
from dust and damp; pressure contact between the electrodes and the
quadrants is replaced by spirals of <U+FB01>ne wire screwed to the quadrants
and to the electrodes;       the needle, quadrants, and guard tube are
so shaped that, in whatever symmetrical       position the quadrants be
placed, the de<U+FB02>ection produced by a given P.D. between the quadrants
is   directly proportional to the potential of the needle, and further,
this improved electrometer is at least ten times as sensitive as our
specimen of the White pattern when the instruments are adjusted to
be in equally trustworthy condition as regards de<U+FB01>niteness of the zero
and of the de<U+FB02>ected position of the spot of light.
    Next follows an account of some experiments made by us on a
White electrometer, the needle of which Mr. Boys had suspended
with a single quartz <U+FB01>bre. Although this instrument was in excellent
condition as regards de<U+FB01>niteness, &c., the raising of the potential of
the needle to only 400 volts was su<U+FB01>icient to show that the sensibility
was not proportional to the needle’s potential.
    Lastly, for the purpose of obtaining conclusive evidence as to
whether our idea was correct about the connecting pieces of the
guard tube in the White electrometer causing the sensibility of this
instrument to be in many cases actually less when the needle had a
high potential than when it had a low, we had constructed a little
collar with two legs.       This collar could be clamped to the upper
portion of the guard tube of the improved electrometer with the legs
projecting down into the quadrants on each side of the needle, and
experiments showed that when this collar was attached to the guard
tube the improved electrometer, although not a bi<U+FB01>lar instrument,
became as bad as the White pattern.        For while before the attach
ment of this collar the sensibility increased proportionately to the
potential of the needle, after the collar was attached the sensibility
<U+FB01>rst increased and then diminished again as the potential of the
needle increased, and with the same adjustment of the quadrants,
controlling magnets, &c., and with the needle charged to a potential
of 1300 volts, the mere attachment of this little collar reduced the
 sensibility to one quarter.
    The paper concludes with a sketch of the mathematical investiga
 tion that we carried out, and it is explained that by taking into
 account the electrical action of the connecting pieces of the guard
 tube of the White electrometer, the diminution in this action as the
 quadrants are pulled out, the alteration produced by the tilting of
 the needle at high potentials on the magnitude         of this electrical
 action as well as on the rate of variation, per radian de<U+FB02>ection of the
 needle,  of the coef<U+FB01>cient of induction between the insulated pair of
 quadrants   and the needle, an expression was obtained for the de<U+FB02>ec
 tion  of the needle in terms of its potential and 0118 RD. between the

58             Dr. Marcet.    Absorption of   0.1'j/gen and     [June 4,
quadrants.     And this expression, although containing only three
constants, <U+FB01>tted with considerable accuracy all the curves given in
the several sheets accompanying the paper.
   The results of the investigation,      brie<U+FB02>y summed up, are as
follows :—
   1. The quadrant electrometer as made by Messrs. White, although
it may be carefully adjusted for symmetry, does not usually even
approximately obey the recognised law for a quadrant electrometer
when the potential of the needle is altered.
   2. The peculiarities in the behaviour of the thite electrometer are
due mainly to the electrical action between the guard tube and the
needle, and to the slight tilting of the needle that occurs at high
potentials.
   3. By special adjustments of the quadrants of the White electro
meter the sensibility can be made to be either nearly independent
of the potential of the needle, or to be directly proportional to the
potential, or to increase more rapidly than the potential of the needle.

conventional   law for the quadrant electrometer is obtained without
any special adjustment of the quadrants beyond that for symmetry,
and the instrument is rendered many times as sensitive as the
specimen we possess of the White pattern.
V. “Researches on the Absorption of Oxygen and Formation
      of Carbonic Acid in ordinary Human Respiration, and in
      the Respiration of Air containing an Excess of Carbonic
      Acid.”     By WILLIAM MARGET, M.D., F.R.S. Received
      May 25, 1891.
   Allow me to begin by recording the valuable help         I have expe
rienced throughout the present enquiry from my assistant, Mr. Ed
ward Russell, F.C.S. We have both put our shoulders to the Wheel,
and have gone together through the great number of calculations
the work entailed.     I am much indebted to Mr. Russell for the pains
be has taken, and the accuracy of his judgment whenever a knotty
point had to be met and overcome.
   My object in the following paper is to give an account of the con
sumption of oxygen in human respiration, or, in other words, to
determine the proportions of oxygen transformed into carbonic acid,
and of oxygen retained in the blood, to which is added a short in-‘
quiry into the e<U+FB01>ects produced by the inhalation of air containing
C02 on the interchange of the pulmonary gases.          The investigation
was carried out, so far, on myself and Mr. Russell, while under the

1891.]         Formation of Carbonic Acid in Human Respiration.                      59
in<U+FB02>uence of food and when fasting, or at a period of four hours at
least from breakfast, when a desire for lunch was clearly felt.
     The results aimed at, although applying to man instead of animals,
were similar in kind to those obtained on animals by Messrs. Reg
nault and Reiset<U+FB01>“ and more recently by Messrs. Chapman and Bru
backer, of Philadelphia?             Regnault and Reiset by their admirable
researches have paved the way to a correct history of the chemical
phenomena of respiration, and Chapman and Brubacker, who have
repeated these experiments by a similar method, deserve much praise
for their laborious and interesting investigation,                  con<U+FB01>rming, in a
marked degree, the results obtained            by Regnault and Reiset.
     Rabbits being the subject of the experiments, Regnault and Reiset
obtained for the relation between the oxygen consumed and C02
produced a mean <U+FB01>gure of 0919 from six experiments;                      with Messrs.
 Chapman         and  Brubacker    the corresponding      result, also  from   rabbits,
was 0'90.
     These     experiments were made by con<U+FB01>ning animals in a receiver
or     bell-jar, and absorbing the C02 they produced with potassium
 hydrate aided by mechanical means, while oxygen was supplied
 automatically as fast as the C02 was absorbed, and as nearly as
 possible in equal volumes.          An examination of the <U+FB01>gures expressing
 the results obtained          by Regnault and Reiset and the American
 physiologists will show that the animals at the end of the experi
 ment had to breathe an atmosphere containing an excess of COZ, as
 it was impossible to rid the air entirely of this gas.              The proportion
 of 002 present in the air at the close of the experiment occasionally
 rose to 3 per cent. and higher, and this is a rather large contamina
 tion to     allow of results being applied to natural breathing, considering
 that atmospheric air contains only from 0'04: to 0‘1 per cent. C02.
      Moreover, the proportions of oxygen in the chamber at the end of
  the experiments varied considerably, although always lower than the
  corresponding proportion in atmospheric air.                So that, towards the
  end of the experiments, the animals were breathing air containing
  an excess of C02 and a de<U+FB01>ciency of 0.
      There must be another di<U+FB01>iculty to contend with in such kinds of
  experiments, amounting to the impossibility of keeping the animals
  quiet, and muscular action exerts, we know, a very positive in<U+FB02>uence
  on the     phenomena of respiration.
      In addition to the labours of Regnault and Reiset, and Chapman
   and Brubacker, I have to quote the papers of Carl Speck,1 and of

          J
Messrs. olyet, C. T. Bergonié, and Sigalas,m while an elaborate paper
has appeared last month (April) in the ‘Annales de Chimie et de
Physique," by Messrs. Hanriot and Ch. Richet, which also treats of
the interchange of the respiratory gases in man.                In the experi
ments last mentioned, the air inspired was breathed through a gas
meter, and then expired through another meter, Next, the air expired
was conducted through an apparatus destined to the absorption of
the C02, and <U+FB01>nally through a third meter.         The meter on the inspira
tory   track  showed    the volume    of air  inspired, the <U+FB01>rst expiratory
meter registered the volume of air expired, and the second the volume
of 002 produced, which was equal to the di<U+FB01>'erence of volumes as
indicated by the two meters. The difference of volume registered by
the inspiratory and <U+FB01>rst expiratory meters yielded the volume of
oxygen absorbed.
    The method is ingenious; at <U+FB01>rst sight it appears satisfactory, but
on looking into the process with an experience acquired from about
15 years’ work, on and o<U+FB01>, on the chemical phenomena of respira
tion, and with the knowledge of the dif<U+FB01>culties                concerning   the
volumetric determination of carbonic acid, I cannot help considering
the method too rough for an inquiry which requires extremely deli
cate manipulation.
    I  must also take exception to the use of the face-pieces and
valves which were introduced in these experiments, though reluc
tantly, as the authors remark. In my earliest inquiries on the
 chemical phenomena of respiration, face-pieces and valves were
employed; but eventually       I gave them up from their interfering with
 free respiration, and from the dif<U+FB01>culty of maintaining the valves in
 an absolutely reliable state.
                  Method of Investigation and Instruments.
    The method of investigation adopted in the present researches is
quite different from any of those made use of by other authors. Every
care was taken to breathe naturally during the experiment.                 The
 recumbent position was assumed in a deck chair, with the body per
 fectly supported, and the person under experiment inspired through
 the nose and expired through the mouth, compressing his nostrils,
 during expiration, if it was thought necessary, with a slight motion of
 the hand, or of the index <U+FB01>ngers of both hands.          The movement was,
 indeed, hardly perceptible, and could not, by any means, in<U+FB02>uence the
 CO; expired. After a suf<U+FB01>cient period of rest had been allowed, the
 expired air was collected in a receiver or bell-jar suspended over salt
 water, which has been described on former occasions.                  The re

ceiver was so carefully counterpoised that the person under experi
ment could not tell whether he was breathing into it or into the
external air.         It was supplied with a scale divided into litres and
fractions of litres; an oil gauge showed the pressure of the air
within it, and a thermometer its temperature.                     A number of pre~
cautions       were taken in connexion with the mode of collecting the air
expired, which cannot be entered into at present.                   I   have satis<U+FB01>ed
myself       that   breathing  into   these bell-jars is identical with natural
respiration : the volumes expired, say, per minute really correspond
ing with the volume of air expired per minute while breathing natu
rally into the open air. Each experiment lasted between 7 and 8
minutes.
    The determination of carbonic acid in the air expired was made
exactly in the way described in a previous paper to the Royal Society?
 The air expired was transferred from the bell-jar to a cylinder, shaken
 with baryta-water, and <U+FB01>nally determined by titration, according to
 Pettenkofer’s method.
    The oxygen was determined in a eudiometer, constructed on the
 same principle as the eudiometer I have described in the
                                                                         ‘

 of the Royal Society/T but modi<U+FB01>ed and improved.                         Instead of a
 straight tube this instrument consists of a U-tube, with a neck and a
 glass stop-cock at its bend.          One limb is left open, and the other is
 closed at the top by an iron cap, in which a three-way cock is <U+FB01>tted,
 perfectly air-tight.        Two short iron tubes project beyond the tap.
 Both     limbs of the U-tube are graduated.             The limb bearing the iron
 cap   is  graduated     into cubic  centimetres,    and   the open limb is gradu
 ated into divisions corresponding             exactly with those on the other
 limb, so that, whatever be the level of the mercury in the U-tube
 under atmospheric pressure, the readings are identical in both limbs.
  The scale at the back of the open limb is movable, so that it can be
  brought easily into its proper position and <U+FB01>xed there.                   The closed
  limb is surrounded with a water jacket, and the iron cap is partly
  immersed        in water, while the platinum wires are embedded in a
  shellac cement,       so as to be e<U+FB01>ectually        protected from contact with
  the water.
     The hydrogen for exploding the gas was prepared with every care
  from     zinc and sulphuric acid; it was washed <U+FB01>rst through a strong
  solution of potassium hydrate, and then through water.                   A volume of
   hydrogen, at least nine or ten times that of the air-spaces in the
   Woulee’s bottles, was passed through before collecting the gas; it was
   <U+FB01>nally aspired into a glass bell-jar of a capacity of about a litre, and
   movable up and down in a glass receiver holding water.

    Before the hydrogen was used it was tested in nearly every case
 with atmospheric air.
    The determinations of oxygen were made as follows :—The U-tube
 was <U+FB01>rst of all <U+FB01>lled to over<U+FB02>owing with mercury through its open
 limb, the three-way cock being turned so as to let out the mercury
 after <U+FB01>lling the tube; by this means every trace of gas was driven out
                                                                             '
 of the tube.
    Then the stop-cock was turned so as to close the eudiometer and
 let the hydrogen gas through it, and the instrument having been
 brought into connexion with the gas-holder by indie-rubber tubing,
 the hydrogen, under a pressure of an inch or more of water, was
 driven rapidly through the stop-cock, being, moreover, aspired by
 the dilatation of an india-rubber syringe.      The cock was now turned
 so as to admit the hydrogen into the eudiometer, and the mercury,
 being let out at the bend of the U-tube, aspired the required volume
of hydrogen into the instrument; this amounted to from 18 to 20 0.0.
 The bell-jar was then placed under atmospheric pressure, the gas
 turned o<U+FB02>‘, and the height of the mercury if not exactly the same in
 both limbs was adjusted by adding or withdrawing mercury until the
 readings were alike.
    The air to be analysed for the determination of oxygen had been
collected by displacement with water in a cylinder holding from 1 to
 1'5 litre, and shaken with a solution of barium hydrate, to rid it
entirely of its carbonic acid.  The cylinder was now placed on a stand,
over which was disposed a glass receiver full of water, communicating
by india-rubber tubing with the lower end of the cylinder. The india
rubber tube was carefully <U+FB01>lled with water, so as to let no air into
the cylinder, and then the cylinder was placed in communication
with the eudiometer. The next stage was to wash out the passage
in the stop-cock with the air to be analysed; this was done by con
necting by india-rubber tubing the three-way cock with the cylinder,
and some 200 or 300 cc. of air were driven through it from the cylinder
by the pressure of the water in the receiver; the iron tube was
now stoppered on the opposite side by a short rubber-tube and
pinch-cock.     The mercury in the eudiometer was next let out at the
bottom until a suf<U+FB01>cient diminution of pressure had been obtained to
aspire the requisite volume of air from the cylinder. This air was
admitted from the cylinder while under pressure, and taken into the
eudiometer by aspiration, so that the effect produced was that of a
piston driving the hydrogen before it, and giving it no time to diffuse
out of the instrument. The height of the mercury was now adjusted
in both limbs by pouring in mercury, or letting it out at the bottom,
and <U+FB01>nally the reading was taken and recorded.           The air and hydro
gen   were  now  thoroughly  mixed   by   <U+FB01>tting an  india-rubber    syringe
to the open   end  of the eudiometer   and  pressing  it  with  the hand; a

succession      of pressures soon e<U+FB01>ected a perfect mixture.                        The mixture
was    exploded as usual with a battery, when but little commotion was
produced.         Then mercury was added through the Open limb, and the
level adjusted in the two limbs ; a very short time suf<U+FB01>ced to ensure
no further contraction or dilatation, and then the height of the
mercury was read o<U+FB01>.              In the calculation of the analyses a slight
correction was introduced, from the increased temperature of the
water in the jacket owing to the <U+FB02>ash.
     This method proved extremely convenient and reliable.                                       Ar
experiment could be commenced in the afternoon, say 4 o’clock ; the
combination with barium hydrate for the determination of 002 was
e<U+FB01>ected immediately after the air had been expired, and the tu rbic'
<U+FB02>uid left     till the following morning for titration.                  Next, air was draw:
into another cylinder by displacement with water, shaken with a solu
 tion of barium hydrate for about 12 minutes, and then the cylinde1
 was placed on the stand for the determination                          of the oxygen in th(
 air it contained.         Fresh hydrogen was prepared for each experiment
 and, as stated before, it was, in nearly every case, tested with atmo'
 spheric air before being used.
     The calculations of the analyses were made as follows : the volumr
 of the air expired, amounting to about 36 litres, was reduced to the dry
 state, 0° C., and 760 mm. pressure.                   This was done very rapidly by
 means of the
                     Table   I have     constructed     for the purpose.*               Then thr
 volume of CO2 present was easily obtained from the weight of thi:
 gas found in the analysis.              Next, the volume of 002 was subtractec
 from the volume of air expired, and the oxygen calculated on the re
 duced volume.         With these data concerning the volume of air expired
 :1 Table was constructed,          of which the following is an illustration :—

    The volume of air inspired was calculated from the nitrogen found
 in the air expired, and this is one of the main features of the present
 paper. A number of experiments were undertaken to try if any
 accurate determination could be made of the air inspired and expired
 by <U+FB01>lling a counterpoise bell-jar with a measured volume of air, in
spiring this air through the nose and expiring it into an empty
bell-jar through the mouth.       The plan, however, did not prove suc
cessful, and it was found impossible by this means to determine with
a suf<U+FB01>cient degree of accuracy the di<U+FB01>erences of volumes between the
air inspired and expired.      It then occurred to me that the volume of
nitrogen found in air expired might a<U+FB01>ord a means of determining
the volume of air inspired. According to one of the results obtained
from Regnault and Reiset’s experiments there is, under ordinary cir
cumstances, a tri<U+FB02>ing amount of nitrogen exhaled from the blood in
the process of respiration.      The volume of this gas is, however, so
small that its mean proportion in dogs fed with meat was only found
to amount to the 00066 part of the oxygen consumed.                         This means
from 11 to 13 0.0. in 1800 or 2000 0.0. of oxygen consumed
and in about 33,000 0.0. of air breathed, a <U+FB01>gure so low that,
practically, the nitrogen exhaled may be ignored in the calcula
tion of the analyses. I have entered the correction in some oi the
calculations, and it alters the volume of oxygen consumed by about
0'6 per cent., and that of the oxygen absorbed by 1 or 1'5 per cent.
These corrections are so small that I have not thought it worth while
to make them, and the nitrogen has been taken as the same in the air
expired and inspired.
   It was now easy to calculate the volume of air inspired. This
volume consisted of the atmospheric carbonic acid, oxygen, which
was taken in the proportion of 2093 per cent., and nitrogen.                         The
atmospheric    carbonic   acid   was     determined           in   every experiment
by Pettenkofer’s method; it ranged from 5 to 10 parts in 10,000.                      In
the course of last April an additional window was made in my
                                                                              I
laboratory,  which allowed of improved ventilation.
   Having prepared a table of the constituents per cent. of the air
inspired, the volume of air inspired was calculated as follows :—The
nitrogen (per cent.) in the air inspired is to 100, so is the nitrogen in
the air expired to the volume of air inspired.               The volume of air in
spired is thus obtained with much greater accuracy than by any
experimental method, as the nitrogen must invariably exhibit the

 1891.]       Formation    of Carbonic Acid in Human Respiration.            65
same     proportion whatever the volume of air expired.          By this means
the results obtained      for the volumes of oxygen consumed and absorbed,
which are the main objects of the present enquiry, are thoroughly
reliable.
    The experiments are made on          two different persons, and show that
not only the carbonic acid expired within a given time but also the
oxygen consumed varies according to individuals. The subjects of these
                                             “ extremes ” as to the function of
experiments are well suited to show
respiration,     one of them being 63 years of age and the other 21, both
in perfect health.
    Twelve experiments were made in both cases, six while under the
in<U+FB02>uence      of food and six while fasting.        N0 experiments were made
under extreme fasting?“
    On considering the Tables, the composition per cent. of the air
expired is observed to alter but little.            In my case the CO2 varies
from 4'53 to 5'14.
    The   proportion of oxygen was very constant, ranging also with me
from 15'30 to 16'0.
    The    volumes of oxygen consumed represented the volumes of
oxygen      the body took up, on one hand for the combustion and
elimination of carbon in the form of carbonic acid, on the other, for
the probable elimination of tissues in the form of crystalloid com
pounds.        The relations between the oxygen consumed and the
carbonic acid produced varied in my case between 0'816 and 0'912
with a mean of       0863.
    The proportion      of the oxygen consumed which is absorbed is easily
found by subtracting the volume of CO, produced from the total volume
of oxygen consumed.           This volume has been expressed asabsorbed per
minute,    a  result obtained    by dividing the <U+FB01>gure found by the number
of minutes and seconds the experiment lasted.                 The volumes ab
sorbed per minute varied in my case from 21'3 to 42'8 0.0., with a
mean     of 33'0 0.0.; this was equal to 2'83 grams of oxygen absorbed
per hour.       It may be concluded that this absorption of oxygen is an
important factor towards the phenomena of nutrition.
    The proportion of oxygen absorbed in my case for 100 parts of air
 inspired exhibits a mean of 0‘74: part, and varies from 0‘44 to
1'03.     This does not agree with the volume of oxygen usually con
 sidered as absorbed, amounting to about 2 per cent.           The correspond
ingproportion for the experiments on Mr. Russell will be found nearly
 exactly that obtained         for myself, and     I  must conclude that 0‘74
 per cent, or a closely approximating          <U+FB01>gure, shows the proportion of
 the air inspired
                       (in   the   form   of  oxygen)    which remains in the
 blood,   and   consequently    does  not  reappear   in the corresponding air

66              Dr. Marcet.      Absorption  of  Oxygen and       [June  4,
expired.     The mean proportion of oxygen absorbed in the oxygen
inspired amounted to 3‘57 per cent.
    The weight of oxygen consumed per hour varies according to the
person under experiment, and also in relation to the lapse of time
after the ingestion of food.      It ranged in my case from 19'75 grams
to 2202; and per kilo. weight of my body, from 0338 to 0376
gram.       This is a much smaller proportion than that given for
animals either by Regnault and Reiset or Chapman and Brubacker.
    In<U+FB02>uence of Food.—Food, in my case, at a mean time of 2 hours
and 16 minutes after its ingestion, exerted apparently no e<U+FB01>ect on the
 proportions of 002, O, and N expired, as they were nearly exactly
 the same in both cases.
    The ratio between the oxygen consumed and CO, produced exhibited,
in my case, a decided tendency to fall while under the fasting state,
the <U+FB01>gures obtained being 0870 while under the in<U+FB02>uence of food,
and 0650 while fasting.
    The volumes of oxygen absorbed were much the same in both
cases, although    exhibiting a tendency to rise while fasting.
    The differences between the proportions of oxygen absorbed in 100
 volumes of air, or 100 of oxygen, under the in<U+FB02>uence of digestion or
fasting are inappreciable.
    There is a decided excess in the weight of oxygen consumed under
the in<U+FB02>uence of food over that consumed fasting; the <U+FB01>gures being
2137 grams after food, and 20'26 grams fasting.
    The weight of CO, expired per minute varies as usual according
to the in<U+FB02>uence of food, and calls for no comment.
    Mr. Russell also submitted to'twelve experiments, six made at a
 mean time of two hours after a meal, and six while fasting, or at a
 mean time of four hours and twenty-three minutes after food.          The
 proportions per cent.     of 00,, O,  and  N expired are much alike in
 every experiment, varying as follows :—C02, 5'38 to 5'96; 0, 14:39
 to 15'26; N, 7936 to 7992.        The ratio of oxygen consumed to CO;
 produced varies from 0818 to 0923, with a mean of 0878. This
 closely approximates the corresponding means obtained in my own
case, amounting to 0863, which, however, is slightly lower.            The
 next <U+FB01>gures in the table, showing the proPortion of oxygen con'.
 sumed on 100 of air and 100 of O breathed, give means very nearly
 the same as when     I  submitted to experiment.
     The weights of oxygen consumed per hour, 2598 grams, and per
 kilo. of body weight per hour, 0380, are decidedly higher than in my
 case.    Mr. Russell also expired a greater weight of C02 per minute
 than   I  did, showing greater activity in the process of nutrition—a
 phenomenon probably due to youth.
     The in<U+FB02>uence of digestion and fasting shows no alteration in the
 proportions of    00.2,  0, and N expired.     The difference in the ratio

1891.]        Formation   of Carbonic Acid in Human Respiration.         67
between       0 consumed and CO; produced is barely perceptible,
although      exhibiting a slight tendency to fall while fasting. The pro
portions     of oxygen absorbed in 100 of air and oxygen inspired are
much the same under the in<U+FB02>uence of food and fasting.
   The main effect produced         on Mr. Russell by the ingestion of food
and    fasting   is  to be  found  in the weight of oxygen consumed per
hour, which falls from 2866 grams under the influence of food to
2330 when fasting, and per kilo. weight from 0417 gram to 0'330
gram.        There is also, when fasting, a considerable reduction of
weight of the CO2 expired per minute         (0'578 gram to 0'468 gram).
   The results      obtained from the present investigation of the inter
change of gases in the respiratory process of man may be summed up
as follows :—
   l. The percentage of C02, 0, and N in the air expired alters
          according to the person under experiment, but in every case
           the proportions of each gas vary but slightly up to a period
           of about four hours and a half after the mid-day meal, a result
           I had  formerly obtained for 002.
    2.  The ratio between the oxygen consumed and the carbonic acid
          produced exhibited a mean of 0871 for two persons and
          twenty-four experiments.       This is nearly the same <U+FB01>gure as
          that obtained by Messrs. Jolyet, Bergonié, and Sigalas—O‘868,
          and a marked approximation to 0‘90, the corresponding ratio
           given for rabbits by Messrs. Chapman and Brubacker.
   3.   The mean volume of oxygen absorbed per minute was very
          nearly the same for the two persons, and amounted to a total
          mean of 34‘3 0.0. on twenty-four experiments.       This would be
          equal to 2'94: grams of oxygen absorbed per hour.
   4.   The mean volume of oxygen absorbed in relation to the air
          inspired proved nearly the same in both persons submitted to
         experiment, and amounted to 0'75 per cent. A similar remark
          applies to the proportions of oxygen absorbed to the oxygen
         inhaled; the <U+FB01>gures are 36'9 in one case, and 3'55 in the other,
         with a mean of 3'63.
   5.  The mean weight of oxygen consumed per hour varied with each
         person submitted to experiment, amounting to 20'8] grams in
          the older and 26'09 in the younger man.       The corresponding
         <U+FB01>gures per kilo. of body weight were 0355 gram and 0'380
         gram.
   6.  The weight of carbonic acid expired per minute is notably
         higher in the younger man, and corresponds approximately to
          proportionally increased amount of oxygen consumed.
   The elaborate      investigation of Messrs. Hanriot and Richet calls for
.5 few   remarks.
                                                                    L'\
                                                                  F a

    The mean ventilation of the lungs, by which expression           I  con
 clude Messrs. Hanriot and Richet mean the sum of the air
 inspired and expired, amounts, according to these authors, to 10 litres
 of air per kilo. weight of the body per hour. This result agrees,
 within certain limits, with those 1 have obtained. The sum of the air
 inspired and expired in each experiment gives, in my case, amaximum
 of 9‘94 litres per kilo. weight per hour, and a minimum of 8'33 litres,
with a mean of 9'12 litres, which is near to Messrs. Hanriot and
 Richet’s <U+FB01>gure of 10 litres. Mr. Russell’s mean pulmonary ventila
tion is decidedly less than mine, and lower than the <U+FB01>gure obtained
by the French authors, amounting to a maximum of 951 litres and a
minimum of 6'87 litres, the mean being 8'13 litres. It is therefore
obvious that the pulmonary ventilation varies per kilo. weight of
body, according to di<U+FB01>erent people. Messrs. Hanriot and Richet
apparently experimented only on a single person.
    The volume of carbonic acid in 100 of expired air appears decidedly
low in Messrs. Hanriot and Richet’s experiments, amounting to a
mean of 330. In the experiments which form the subject of the
present paper, the corresponding        proportion varied, for myself
between 4'53 and 5'14, and for Mr. Russell between 5'38 and 5'90.
These proportions, to which     I have drawn attention in former com
munications, vary not only with different individuals, but with the
same person under different circumstances.         The relation between
the oxygen consumed and CO2 produced is decidedly smaller in Messrs.
Hanriot and Richet’s experiments than in my own; those gentlemen
<U+FB01>nd the mean relation in question to be 0'78, while the mean from
my experiments on two di<U+FB01>erent persons yield O'871-.
   The second part of the present communication deals with the respira
tion of air containing from 25 to 41 per cent. of carbonic acid.        The
mixture was made by introducing carbonic acid, prepared       from  marble
and hydrochloric acid, into a certain volume of air drawn into one of
the bell-jars. The mixture was <U+FB01>rst of all analysed for the determination
of the C02 it contained, and then it was inspired through the nose,
by means of a well-<U+FB01>tting nose-piece, and expired into the other
bell-jar through the mouth.       The <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve or six inspirations were
used for rinsing out the lungs and the bell-jar, and were driven
out of the second bell-jar through a T-piece, while the person
under experiment was expiring into the open air; this was easily
eifected by means of the three-way stop-cock; then the stop-cock
was again turned, and the expired air collected in the bell-jar while
the time was taken.      The e<U+FB02>ects produced were a sensation of want
of air and a considerable increase in the volume of air breathed per
minute.     The air expired, during a period of from 2 to 4 minutes,
was collected for experiment; but the breathing of the air and CO2
was carried on altogether for 4 or 5 minutes.        N o lasting ill effec's

    On a consideration of the foregoing tables it will be seen that the
CO, expired (per cent. of air expired) does not represent the C02
exhaled from the blood, but the <U+FB01>gure is much higher, as it includes
the C02 inspired, which is expired together with the proportion
exhaled.      The volume of CO: actually exhaled from the blood can
be calculated       by subtracting the proportion of CO, in the air
inspired from the corresponding proportion of CO, in the air expired.
The volumes of CO; actually found in the expired air have not been
entered in the following table (p. 71), but the <U+FB01>gures represent these
volumes less the corresponding proportions of CO, in the air inspired,
and they show that the CO; actually exhaled from the blood is very
much less than in ordinary respiration.
    It will therefore be observed that nearly half the C02 which would
have been expired in natural breathing has been retained in the
body.      Of course this is assuming that no CO, has been absorbed
 directly at the lungs.      Hence there must be a very great accumula
 tion of CO; in the blood when air containing CO, is inspired.
    It follows from this inquiry on the respiration of air containing
from 2'5 to 4 per cent. of 002—
    1st. That the proportion of oxygen in 100 of air expired exhibits
a slight increase beyond its proportion in ordinary breathing.
    2nd. That the relation between the oxygen consumed and C02 pro
duced is very much smaller than in ordinary respiration, amounting
to a mean of 0654 for myself and 0567 for Mr. Russell, against a
total mean of 0871 for both of us in ordinary breathing.

      3rd.   That the volume of oxygen absorbed per minute is greatly
increased,          my own mean amounting to 103 0.0., and Mr. Russell’s
 to 155 0.0.,       instead of 32'2 in my case and 37'5 in the other.
      4th. That the proportions per cent. of oxygen absorbed in the air
inspired are increased in both cases to a mean of 1'39, against 0'66,
 and to a mean of 1'98 against 0'75 in ordinary breathing.                        A corre
 sponding        increase      is observed   in  the   proportion  of oxygen   absorbed   to
 the oxygen inspired.
      5th. That the weight of oxygen consumed by the body per hour is
 considerably increased, amounting to a mean in my case of 2542
  grams, against 21'37 grams, and with Mr. Russell of 3095 grams
  against 2866 in ordinary breathing.
      6th. That the weight of carbonic acid expired per‘ minute is con
  siderably reduced, amounting in my case to a mean of 0378 instead
  of 0430, and with Mr. Russell to a mean of 0402 instead of 0578
  expired in normal respiration.
       These experiments, although but few in number, suf<U+FB01>ce to show
   that when air is breathed containing from 2'5 to 41 per cent. of
   CO,     the amount of oxygen consumed is much greater than in
   ordinary breathing, while the carbonic acid expired is very much less.
   There must consequently remain in the blood a considerable amount
    )f oxygen to be transformed into an excess of 002 besides the pro
   portion required towards the other functions of the body.

     THOMSON, D.C.L., P.R.S. Received June 11, 1891.

                                  (‘

importance in the kinetic theory of gases, to the effect that, in an
assemblage of large numbers of mutually colliding spheres of ‘two or
of several di<U+FB01>erent magnitudes, the mean kinetic energy         the same

for equal numbers of the spheres irrespectively'of their masses and
diameters or, in other words, the time-averages of the squares of the
              ;
velocities of individual spheres are inversely as their masses.      The
mathematical investigation given as a proof of this theorem in that
<U+FB01>rst article on the subject     quite unsatisfactory; but the mere enun
                                 is
ciatiou of it, even     without proof, was
                        it                     very valuable contribution
                                                 a
to science.    In a subsequent paper (“Dynamical Theory of Gases,"
‘
   Phil. Trans.’ for May, 1866) Maxwell <U+FB01>nds in his equation (34»)
 (‘Collected Works,’ p. 417), as a result of a thorough mathematical
 investigation, the same theorem extended to include collisions between
 Boscovich points with mutual forces according to any law of distance,
 provided only that not more than two points are in collision (that         is
 to say, within the distances of their mutual in<U+FB02>uence) simultaneously.

theorem, and Maxwell      a still wider generalisation in his paper “ On

System of Material Points         (‘ Cambridge Phil. Soc. Trans.,’ May 6,
1878, republished in vol. 2 of Maxwell’s ‘ Scienti<U+FB01>c Papers,’ pp.
 713—741), to the following e<U+FB02>’ect (p. 716) :—
    “ In the ultimate state of the system, the average kinetic energy of
two given portions of the system must be in the ratio of the number
of degrees of freedom of those portions.”
   Much disbelief and doubt has been felt as to the complete truth, or
the extent of cases for which there is truth, of this proposition.
   3. For a test case. differing as little as possible from Maxwell’s
original case of solid elastic spheres, consider a hollow spherical
shell and a solid sphere—globule we shall call it for brevity—within
the shell.    I  must <U+FB01>rst digress to remark that what has hitherto by
Maxwell and Clausius and others before and after them been called
for brevity an “elastic sphere,” is not an elastic solid, capable of
rotation and of elastic deformation; and therefore capable of an
in<U+FB01>nite number of modes of steady vibration, into which, of <U+FB01>ner and
<U+FB01>ner degrees of nodal sub-division and shorter and shorter periods,
all translational energy would, if the Boltzmann-Maxwell generalised
proposition were true, be ultimately transformed             by collisions.
        “                           ”
The       smooth elastic spheres       are really Boscovich point-atoms,
with their translational inertia, and with, for law of force, zero force
at every distance between two points exceeding the sum of the radii
of the two balls, and in<U+FB01>nite repulsion at exactly this distance. We
may use Boscovich similarly for the hollow shell with globule in its
interior, and so do away with all question as to vibrations due to
elasticity of material, whether of the shell or of the globule. Let us
simply suppose the mutual action between the shell and the globule
to be nothing except at an instant of collision, and then to be such
that their relative component velocity along the radius through the
point of contact is reversed by the collision, while the motion of their
centre of inertia remains unchanged.
   4. For brevity, we shall call the shell and interior globule of § 3, a
double molecule, or sometimes, for more brevity, a doublet.            The
“ smooth elastic sphere ” of
                                 § 3 will be called simply an atom, or a
single atom ; and the radius or diameter or surface of the atom will
mean the radius or diameter or surface of the corresponding sphere.
(This explanation is necessary to avoid an ambiguity which might
occur with reference to the common expression “sphere of action
                                                                       " of
a Boscovich atom.)
   5. Consider now a vast number of atoms and doublets, enclosed in
a perfectly rigid <U+FB01>xed surface, having the property of reversing the
normal component velocity of approach of any atom or shell or doublet

1891.]           Doctrine regarding Distribution          of Energy.               81
at the instant of contact of surfaces, while leaving unchanged the
absolute velocity of the centre of inertia of the two. Let any velocity
or velocities in any direction or directions be given to any one or more
of the atoms or of the shells or globules constituting the doublets.
According to the Boltzmann-Maxwell doctrine, the motion will become
distributed through the system, so that ultimately the time-average
kinetic energy of each atom, each shell, and each globule shall be equal ;
and therefore that of each doublet double that of each atom. This is
certainly a very marvellous conclusion; but              I  see no reason to doubt
it on that account. After: all, it is not obviously more marvellous
than the seemingly well proved conclusion, that in a mixed assemblage
of colliding single atoms, some of which have a million million times
the mass of others, the smaller masses will ultimately average a
million      times the velocity of the larger. But it is not included in
Maxwell’s proof for single atoms of different masses [(34) of his
                                         ”
 “Dynamical Theory of Gases referred to above] ; and the condition
that the globules enclosed in the shells are prevented by the shells
 from collisions with one another violates Tait’s condition                         of
     18   of “ Foundations of K.T. Gases "j, “ that there is perfectly free
 §_
 access for collision between each pair of particles whether of the
 same or of different systems.”            An independent investigation of such
 a   simple and de<U+FB01>nite case as that of the atoms and doublets de<U+FB01>ned
 in        3—5 is desirable as a test, or would be interesting as an illus
 tration were test not needed, for the exceedingly wide generalisation
 set    forth in the Boltzmann-Maxwell doctrine.
      6. Next, instead of only a single globule within the shell of § 4,
  let there be a vast number.           To <U+FB01>x ideas let the mass of the shell be
  equal to a hundred times the sum of the masses               of the globules, and
 let the number        of the globules be a hundred million million. Let
 two      such shells be connected by a push-and-pull massless spring.
  Let all be given at rest, with the spring stretched to any extent; and
 then left free.       According to the Boltzmann-Maxwell doctrine, the
 motion produced initially by the spring will become distributed
  through the system, so that ultimately the sum of the kinetic
  energies of the globules within each shell will be a hundred million
  million times the average kinetic energy of the shell.               The average
  velocity“ of the shell will ultimately be a hundred-millionth of the
  average velocity of the globules.          A corresponding proposition in the
  kinetic theory of gases is that, if two rigid shells each weighing
   1  gram, and containing a centigram of monatomic gas, be attached to
   the two prongs of a massless perfectly elastic tuning fork, and set to
   vibrate, the gas will become heated in virtue of its viscous resistance
      '  The “average velocity of a particle,"  irrespectiver of direction, is (in the
   kinetic theory of gases) a convenient expression   for the square root of the time
   avemge of the square of its velocity.

to the vibration excited in it by the vibration of the shell, until nearly
all the initial energy of the tuning fork is thus spent.
   7. Going back to the double molecules of § 5, suppose the internal
globule to be so connected by massless springs with the shell that the
globule is urged towards the centre of the shell with a force simply
proportional to the distance between the centres of the two. This
arrangement, which        I
                       gave in my Baltimore Lectures, in 1884, as an
illustration for vibratory molecules embedded in ether, would be
equivalent to two masses connected by a massless spring, if we had
only motions in one line to consider; but it has the advantage of
being perfectly isotropic, and giving for all motions parallel to any
<U+FB01>xed line exactly the same result as if there were no motion perpen
dicular to it.   When a pair of masses connected by a spring strikes a
<U+FB01>xed obstacle or a movable body, with the line of their centres not
exactly perpendicular to the tangent plane of contact, it is caused to
rotate.   No such complication a<U+FB01>ects our isotropic doublet.          An
assemblage    of  such doublets  being   given moving   about  within   a
rigid enclosing surface, will the ultimate statistics be, for each
doublet,’n equal average kinetic energies of motion of centre of inertia,
and of relative motion of the two constituents ?
  "' This implies equal average kinetic energies of the two constituents; and, con
versely, equal average kinetic energies of the two constituents, except in the case of
their masses being equal, implies the equality stated in the text.  Let u, u' be abso
lute component velocities of two masses, m, m’, perpendicular to a <U+FB01>xed plane;
U the corresponding component velocity of their centre of inertia; and r that

    8.  If  we try to answer this question syntheticaliy, we <U+FB01>nd a com;
plex and troublesome problem in the details of all but the very simplest
case of collision which can occur, which is direct collision between two
not previously vibrating doublets, or any collision of one not previously
vibrating doublet against a <U+FB01>xed plane.         In this case, if the masses
of globule     and shell are equal, a complete collision consists of two
impacts at an interval of time equal to half the period of free vibration
of the doublet, and after the second impact there is separation without
vibration, just as if we had had single spheres instead of the doublets.v
But in oblique collision between two not previously vibrating doublets,
even if the masses of shell and globule are equal, we have a somewhat
troublesome     problem to <U+FB01>nd the interval between the two impacts,
when there     are two, and to <U+FB01>nd the <U+FB01>nal resulting vibration. When
the   component relative motion parallel to the tangent plane of the <U+FB01>rst
impact exceeds a certain value depending         on the radius of the outer
surface of the shell, the period of free vibration of the doublets, and’
the relative velocity of approach ; there is no second impact, and- the
doublets separate with no relative velocity perpendicular to the tangent;
plane, but each with the energy of that component of its previous motion
converted    into vibrational energy. When the mass of the shell is much
smaller    than the mass of the interior globule, almost every collision
will consist     of a large number     of impacts.   It seems   exceedingly
dif<U+FB01>cult to   <U+FB01>nd how to calculate true statistics of these chattering
collisions, and arrive at sound conclusions as to the ultimate distribu-.
tion of energy in any of the very simplest               cases other than
Maxwell’s original case of 1860; but, if the Boltzmann-Maxwell
generalised doctrine is true, we ought to be able to see its truth as
essential, with special clearness in the simplest cases, even without
going through the full problem presented by the details.          I can <U+FB01>nd
nothing in Maxwell’s latest article on the subject (‘ Camb. Phil.
Trans.,’ May 6, 1878), or in any of his previous papers, proving an
af<U+FB01>rmative answer to the question of § 7.
    9. Going back to
                         § 6, let the globules be initially distributed as
nearly as may be homogeneously through the hollow; let each globule
be connected with neighbours         by massless springs; and let all the
globules which are near the inner surface of the shell be connected
with it also by massless springs.         Or let any number of smaller
 Shells be enclosed within our outer shell, and connected by massless'
 springs as represented by the accompanying diagram, taken from a
 reprint of my Baltimore lectures now in progress.            Let two such
 outer shells, given at rest with their systems of globules in equi
 librium within them, be connected by massless springs, and be started
 in motion, as were the shells of
                                        § 6.  There will not now be the
 great loss of energy from the vibration of the shells which there was
 in
     § 6.   On the contrary, the ultimate average kinetic energy of the
                                                                 G  2

 84          Sir W. Thomson.         On the ilfawwell-Boltzmunn           [June   11,
                         ‘
 whole two hundred million million globules will he certainly small in
 comparison with the ultimate average kinetic energy of the single
 shell.      It may be because each globule of § 6 is free to wander that
 the energy is lost from the shell in that case, and distributed among
 them.        There is nothing vague in their motion allowing them to
 take more and more energy, now when they are connected by the
 massless springs.          If we suppose the motions in<U+FB01>nitesimal, or if,
 whatever their ranges may be, all forces are in simple proportion
 to displacements, the elementary dynamical theorem of fundamental
 modes shows how to <U+FB01>nd determinater each of the 600 million million
 and six simple harmonic vibrations of which the motion resulting from
the prescribed initial circumstances is constituted. It tells us that the
sum of the potential and kinetic energies of each mode remains
always of constant value, and that the time-average of the changing
kinetic energy during its period is half of this constant value.
Without fully solving the problem for the 600 million million and
six co-ordinates, it is easy to see that the gravest fundamental mode
of the motion actually produced in the prescribed circumstances
differs but little in period and energy from the single simple harmonic
vibration which the two shells would take if the globules were
rigidly connected to them, or were removed from within them, and
the other initial circumstances were those of § 6. But this conclu
sion depends on the forces being rigorously in simple proportion to
displacements.
    103* In no real case could they be so, and if there is any deviation
from the simple proportionality of force to displacement, the inde
pendent superposition of motions does not hold good. We have still a
theorem of fundamental modes, although, so far as                     I  known this
theory has not yet been investigatedit For any stable system moving
with a given sum, E, of potential and kinetic energies, there must in
general be at least as many fundamental modes of rigorously periodic
motion as there are freedoms (or independent variables).                    But the
con<U+FB01>guration of each fundamental mode is now not generally similar

no meaning.        It seems to me probable that every fundamental mode
is essentially unstable.           It is so if Maxwell’s fundamental assump
         “
tion“ that the system if left to itself in its actual state of motion,
will, sooner or later, pass through every phase which is consistent
with the equation of energy ” is true.              It seems to me quite probable
that this assumption is true, provided the “actual state of motion
                                                                                       ” is
not exactly, as to position and velocity, a con<U+FB01>guration                   of some one
of the fundamental modes of rigorously periodic motion, and pro
vided also that the
                               “
                                  system” has not any exceptional character,
such as those indicated by Maxwell for cases in which he warns‘t us
that his assumption does not hold good.
    11. But, conceding Maxwell’s fundamental                   assumption, I do not
see in the mathematical               workings   of  his   paper}; any proof of his
conclusion      “that the average kinetic energy corresponding to any
one of the variables is the same for every one of the variables of
the system.”          Indeed, as a general proposition its meaning is not
explained,      and seems to me inexplicable. The reduction of the
kinetic energy to a sum of squares§ leaves the several parts of the
whole with no correspondence to any de<U+FB01>ned or de<U+FB01>nable set of inde
pendent variables.             What, for example, can the meaning of the
conclusion“ be for the case of a jointed pendulum? (a system of
two rigid bodies, one supported on a <U+FB01>xed, horizontal axis and the
other on a parallel axis <U+FB01>xed relatively to the <U+FB01>rst body, and both
acted on only by gravity).              The conclusion is quite intelligible, how
ever (but is it true ?), when the kinetic energy is expressible as a
sum of squares of rates of change of single co-ordinates                     each multi
plied by a function of all, or of some, of the co-ordinates<U+FB02>                    Consider,

where    V   is the potential energy, which may be any function of w, y,
subject only to the condition         (required for stability) that it is
essentially positive (its least value being, for brevity, taken as zero).
It   is easily proved that, with any given value, E, for the sum of
kinetic and potential energies there are two determinate modes of
 periodic motion; that is to say, there are two <U+FB01>nite closed curves
such that if m be projected from any point of either with velocity
equal to /[2(E—V)] in the direction, eitherwards, of the tangent to
the curve, its path will be exactly that curve.        In a very special class
of cases there are only two such periodic motions, but           it is obvious
that there are more than two in other cases.

                 y=0              land x=bcos(<U+FB02>t—f)}
as two     fundamental modes. When E is in<U+FB01>nitely small we have
only these two; but for any <U+FB01>nite value of E we have clearly an
in<U+FB01>nite number of fundamental modes, and every mode di<U+FB02>’ers
in<U+FB01>nitely little from being a fundamental mode. To see this let m be
projected     from any point N in OX, in a direction perpendicular to
OX, with       a velocity equal to \/(2E—aQON2).          After a suf<U+FB01>ciently
great number of crossings and re-crossings across the line X'OX, the
particle will cross this line very nearly at right angles, at some point,
N'. Vary the position of N very slightly in one direction or other,
and re-project m from it perpendicularly and with proper velocity;
till (by proper “trial and error” method) a path is found, which,
after still the same number of crossings and re-crossings, crosses
exactly at right angles at a point N", very near the point N '. Let m
continue its journey along this path and, after just as many more
crossings and re-crossings, it will return exactly to N, and cross OX
                                                                   "
there, exactly at right angles. Thus the path from N to N is exactly
half an orbit, and from N” to N the remaining half.
   14. When cE/(an’<U+FB01>z) is a small numeric, the part of the kinetic
energy expressed by licm’yz is very small in comparison with the total
energy, E. Hence the path is at every time very nearly the resultant
of the two primary fundamental modes formulated in § 13 ; and an

    It is  well known that when a vacuum tube is furnished with in_
ternal platinum electrodes, the adjacent glass, especially near the
 negative pole, speedily becomes blackened, owing to the deposition
 of metallic platinum. The passage of the induction current greatly
 stimulates the motion of the residual gaseous molecules; those con
 densed upon and in the immediate neighbourhood of the negative
 pole are shot away at an immense speed in almost straight lines, the
 speed varying with the degree of exhaustion and with the intensity
 of the induced current.        Platinum being used for the negative pole,

not only are the gaseous molecules shot away from the electrode, but
the passage of the current so a<U+FB01>iects the normal molecular motions of
the metal as to remove some‘of the molecules from the sphere of attrac
tion of the mass, causing them to <U+FB02>y off with the stream of gaseous
molecules      proceeding        from the negative pole, and to adhere to any
object near it.        This property was,          I believe, <U+FB01>rst pointed out by
Dr. Wright, of Yale College, and some interesting experiments are
described by him in ‘The American Journal of Science and Arts.""‘
The process has been much used for the production of small mirrors
for    physical apparatus.
    This    electrical volatilisation or evaporation                is very similar to
ordinary      evaporation       by the agency of heat.               Cohesion in solids
varies according'to physical and chemical constitution; thus every
kind of' solid matter requires to be raised to a certain temperature
before the molecules lose their <U+FB01>xity of position and are rendered
liquid, a    result which is reached at widely diiferent temperatures.                   If
we consider a liquid at atmospheric pressure,—say,                        for instance, a
basin of water in                    room,—at    molecular    distances     the boundary
                         an open
surface between the liquid aud‘the superincumbent gas will not be a
plane, but turbulent like a stormy ocean.                      The molecules at the
surface of the liquid dart to and fro, rebound from their neigh
bours, and <U+FB02>y o<U+FB02> in every direction.                 Their initial velocity may be
either accelerated or retarded according to the direction of impact.
The result of a collision may drive a molecule in such a direction
that it remains part and parcel of the liquid; on the other hand, it
maybe sent upwards without any diminution of speed, and it will
 then he carried beyond the range of attraction of neighbouring mole
 cules and <U+FB02>y off into and mingle with the super-incumbent gas.                        If a
 molecule of the liquid has been driven at an angle with a velocity not
 su<U+FB01>icient to carry it beyond the range of the molecular attraction of
 the liquid it may still escape,              since, in its excursion upwards, a
 gaseous molecule may strike it in the right direction, and its tem
 porary visit may be converted into permanent residence.
    The intrinsic velocity of the molecules is intensi<U+FB01>ed by heat and
 diminished by cold.           If, therefore, we raise the temperature of the
 water without materially increasing that of the surrounding air, the
  excursions of the molecules of the liquid are rendered longer and the
 force of impact greater, and thus the escape of molecules into the
  upper region of gas is increased, and we say that evaporation                          is
  augmented.
     If the initial velocities of the liquid molecules can              be increased by
  any other   means than by raising the temperature, so that their escape
  into the gas is rendered             more rapid, the result may be called

    Hitherto I have spoken of a liquid evaporating into a gas; but the
same reasoning applies equally to a solid body.        But whilst a solid
body like platinum requires an intense heat to enable its upper
stratum of molecules to pass beyond the sphere of attraction of the
neighbouring molecules, experiment shows that a very moderate
amount of negative electri<U+FB01>cation superadds suf<U+FB01>cient energy to
enable the upper stratum of metallic molecules to <U+FB02>y beyond the
attractive power of the rest of the metal.
    If a gaseous medium exists above the liquid or solid, it prevents to
some degree the molecules from <U+FB02>ying 011'. Thus both ordinary and
electrical evaporation are more rapid in a vacuum than at the ordinary
atmospheric pressure.
    I have recently made some experiments upon the evaporation of
different substances under the electric stress.
    Evaporation of Water.—A delicate balance was taken, and two very
shallow porcelain dishes were <U+FB01>lled with acidulated water and
balanced on the pans. Dipping into each dish—touching the liquid,
but not the dish—was a platinum wire, one connected with the in
duction coil and the other insulated.        The balance was left free to
move, but was not swinging, the pointer resting at the centre of the
scale. The water in connection with the coil was <U+FB01>rst made positive.
After    1%  hours there was scarcely any difference between the weight
of the insulated water and that which had been exposed to the
positive current.      Equilibrium being restored, the current was re
versed, the negative current being kept on the dish for two hours.
At the end of this time the electri<U+FB01>ed water was decidedly lighter.
After having again restored equilibrium, the electri<U+FB01>cation of the
dishes was reversed, i.e., the one that had before been insulated was
made negative and the other one was insulated.           In an hour the
electri<U+FB01>ed     water  had become   decidedly  lighter than the insulated
water.      The experiment was performed in a room of uniform tempera
ture, and any draught was prevented by the glass case of the
balance.      In a subsequent experiment in which the quantities were
weighed, it was found that negatively electri<U+FB01>ed water lost in 1% hours
l/lOOOth part of its weight more than did insulated water.
    This experiment shows that the disturbing in<U+FB02>uence which assists
evaporation is peculiar to the negative pole even at atmospheric
pressures.
   The metal cadmium was next experimented upon.
   Evaporation of Cadmium.—~If the <U+FB02>ying-OE of the metal of the
negative pole is similar to evaporation or volatilisation, the operation
should be accelerated by heat.
   A tube was made as shown in <U+FB01>g. 1. A and B are the platinum
poles sealed through the glass. C and D are two blocks of metallic
cadmium of the same size and weight.           The piece 0 is in contact

with the pole      B, which in the experiment was always kept negative,
the pole    A   being positive.      When the exhaustion was such that the
passage of the current gave green phosphorescence Over the glass,
heat was applied simultaneously             to both ends of the U-shaped tube
by means of      a  gas-burner    and   air-bath, so that one piece of cadmium
was at the same temperature as the other.                 The current was then
applied     and  was   kept    on  for  about   an  hour, and it was remarkable
that  no   metal   was  deposited    in the  neighbourhood of the positive pole,
the surrounding portion of the tube being quite clean, while the
corresponding part of the other limb of the tube, having no electrodes,
was thickly coated, the appearance being shown in the drawing.
   As the temperature was high, metal had distilled 0E from both
lumps; hence there was no visible difference in the amount of the
deposit    in the two   sides.    It  is evident that, to render the electrical
action most       visible, the temperature should be kept short of the
normal volatilising point.
    In the next experiment an exactly similar tube was used ; the
vacuum was such that the green phosphorescence of the glass was
well seen, the temperature was kept just below the melting point of
cadmium, and the current was kept on for an hour.                 On examining
the tube at the end of this time, the appearance was as seen in <U+FB01>g. 2.
 A considerable deposit had taken place on the end of the tube near
 the negative pole, the space round the positive pole was clear, while
 in the limb of the tube where no electricity had been passing only
 a very   little deposit of metal was seen, as shown in the <U+FB01>gure.
    The temperature       in this experiment having been kept below the
  melting point, had no electricity been applied, there would have been
  very little, if any, evaporation.           The amplitude of the molecular
  Oscillations was increased      by the rise of temperature, but not suf<U+FB01>

ciently to allow many of the molecules to pass beyond the sphere of
attraction of the mass. When, however, the current was turned on,
the oscillations were increased suf<U+FB01>ciently to carry some of the mole
cules beyond their spheres of attraction and hence into the vacuous
space above.     As in the water experiment, this only happens at the
negative pole.     It would seem that, even after having been removed
from the rest of the mass, the on-rnshing stream of gaseous molecules
is necessary to carry the metallic molecules away, and, as I shall pre
sently show, even then they very quickly drop out of the ranks and
deposit on the walls of the tube.

metal removed, and the cadmium only res-ted by its ewn weight upon
the platinum wires that had been sealed through the glass.      To
render the experiment quantitative, and at the same time to remove
any disturbing effect that might be caused by heating at the point of
indi<U+FB01>erent contact, the following experiments were made :—

thirty-<U+FB01>ve minutes, the pole A being negative and B positive. At the
end of this time it was seen that most of the cadmium had dis

been shot off to a distance of about 2‘ inch.         The appearance of the

the far end of the tube, near, but not touching, the positive pole.

silver electrode. On subsequent examination it was found that the

continuously glowing with phosphorescent light, was practically free
from silver.

    A tube was    next made as shown in <U+FB01>g. 10. It had two negative poles
connected together, A, A', s0 placed as to project two luminous spots
on the phosphorescent glass of the tube.        One of the electrodes, A’,
was of   silver,  a volatile metal; the other, A, was of aluminium, prac
tically non-volatile.      On connecting the two negative poles, A, A',
 with one terminal of the coil, and the positive pole, B, with the other
 terminal, it was seen in the course of half an hour that a considerable
 quantity of metal had been projected from the silver negative pole,
 blackening the tube in its neighbourhood, while no projection of
 metallic particles took place from the aluminium positive            pole.
 During the whole time of the experiment, however, the two patches
 of phosphorescent light, C and C', had been glowing with exactly the
 same intensity, showing that the active agent in effecting phosphor
 escence was not the molecules of the solid projected from the poles,
 but the residual gaseous particles, or “radiant matter.”
    In the tubes hitherto made containing silver, it had not been easy
 to observe the spectrum of the negative pole, owing to the rapid
 manner in Which the deposit obscured the glass. A special tube
  (<U+FB01>g. 11) was therefore devised, of the following character.    The silver
 pole, A, was attached to the platinum pole at one end of the tube, and
  the aluminium positive pole, B, was at the side. The end of the tube
 opposite the silver pole was rounded, and the spectroscope was

obstruction to the light, as none was deposited except on the sides of
the tube surrounding the silver.              At a vacuum giving a dark space
of about 3 mm. from the silver, a. greenish-white                glow was seen to
surround the metal.           This glow gave a very brilliant spectrum.           The
spark from silver poles in air was brought into the same <U+FB01>eld of view
as the vacuum glow, by means of a right-angled prism attached to
the spectroscope, and the two spectra were compared.                          The two
strong green lines of silver were visible in each spectrum; the
measurements taken of their wave-lengths                   were 3344: and 3675,
numbers which are so close to Thalén’s numbers as to leave no doubt
                                                                              '
that they are the silver lines.           At a pressure giving a dark space of
2 mm. the spectrum was very bright, and consisted chie<U+FB02>y of the two
 green lines and the red and green hydrogen lines.                The interealation
 of a Leyden jar into the circuit does not materially increase the
 brilliancy of the lines, but it brings out the well-known air lines.
 At this pressure not much silver <U+FB02>ies 05 from the pole. At a higher
 vacuum, the luminosity round the silver pole gets less and the green
lines vanish.       At an exhaustion of about one-millionth of an atmo
 sphere the luminosity is feeble, the silver pole has exactly the appear
 ance of being red hot, and the volatilisation of the metal proceeds
 rapidly?

 appearance of red heat the moment the current is turned on or oif, showing that,

 volatilise them is, in these experiments, con<U+FB01>ned to the surface only, or the whole

   If, for the negative electrode, instead of a pure metal such as
cadmium or silver, an alloy was used, the di<U+FB01>ereut components might
be shot off to different distances, and in this way make an electrical
separation—a      sort of fractional distillation.        A negative terminal
was formed of clean brass, and submitted to the electrical discharge
in vacuo ; the deposit obtained was of the colour of brass throughout,

of its component metals, copper and zinc.
    [A remarkable alloy of gold and aluminium, of a rich purple colour,
has been kindly sent me by Professor Roberts-Austen.                 Gold being
very   volatile in  the  vacuum    tube,  and   aluminium    almost    <U+FB01>xed, this
alloy was likely to give di<U+FB01>erent results from those yielded by brass,
where both constituents <U+FB02>y off with almost equal readiness.                   The
AuAl alloy had been cast in a clay tube in the form of a rod 2 cm.
long and about 2 mm. in diameter.           It was sealed in a vacuum tube
as the negative pole, an     aluminium pole being at the other side. Part
of the alloy, where it joined the platinum wire passing through the
glass, was closely surrounded with a narrow glass tube; a clean glass
plate was supported about 3 mm. from the rod of alloy.                After good
exhaustion the induction current was passed, the alloy being kept
negative.     Volatilisation was very slight, but at the end of half an
hour a faint purple deposit was seen both on the glass plate and on
the walls of the tube.      On removing the rod from the apparatus, it
was seen that the portion which had been covered by the small glass
tube retained its original purple appearance, while the part that had
been exposed to electrical action had changed to the dull white colour
of aluminium.     Examined under the microscope, the whitened surface
of the Austen alloy was seen to be pitted irregularly, with no trace
of crystalline appearance. This experiment shows that from an alloy
of gold and aluminium the gold is the <U+FB01>rst to volatilise under elec
trical in<U+FB02>uence, the aluminium‘being left behind.            The purple colour
of the deposit on glass is probably due to <U+FB01>nely divided metallic gold.
The <U+FB01>rst deposit from a negative pole of pure gold is pink; this
changes to purple as the thickness increases.            The purple then turns
to green, which gets darker        and   darker    until the metallic lustre of

   Returning to the analogy of liquid evaporation, if we take several
liquids of different boiling points, put them under the same pressure,
and apply the same amount of heat to each, the quantity passing
to imagine that when the extra activity is produced by electricity the emission of
red light should also accompany the separation of molecules from the mass.       In
comparison with electricity heat is a wasteful agent for promoting volatilisation,
as the whole mass must be raised to the requisite temperature to produce a surface
action merely; whereas the action of electri<U+FB01>cation does not appear to penetrate
much below the surface.

gold, its electrical volatility being great, and    it being easy to prepare

   An apparatus was made       as in <U+FB01>g.    12.  It is practically a vacuum
 tube with four negative poles at one end and one positive pole at the
 other.  By a revolving commutator            I was able to make electrical
 connection with each of the four negative poles in succession for
 exactly the same length of time (about six seconds) 5 by this means

   the variations in the strength of the current, the experiment lasting
   some hours, affected each metal alike.
     The exposed surface of the various metals used as negative poles
  was kept uniform by taking them in the form of wires that had all
  been drawn through the same standard hole in the drawplate, and
  cutting them by gauge to a uniform length; the actual size used was
  0'8 mm. in diameter, and 20 mm. long.
     The comparison metal gold had to be used in each experiment; the
  apparatus thus enabled me to compare three different metals each
  time.   The length of time that the current was kept on the revolving
  commutator in each experiment was eight hours, making two hours
  of electri<U+FB01>cation for each of the four negative electrodes ; the pressure
  was such as to give a dark space of 6 mm.
     The fusible metals, tin, cadmium, and lead, when put into the appa
  ratus in the form of wires, very quickly melted.      To avoid this di<U+FB02>i
  oulty a special form of pole was devised. Some small circular porce
  lain basins were made, 9 mm. diameter; through a small hole in
  the bottom a short length of iron wire, 0‘8 mm. in diameter, was
  passed, projecting downwards about 5 mm.; the basin was then <U+FB01>lled
  to the brim with the metal to be tested, and was <U+FB01>tted into the appa
  ratus exactly in the same way as the wires; the internal diameter
  of the basins at the brim was 7 mm., and the negative metal <U+FB01>led <U+FB01>at
  was thus formed of a circular disc 7 mm. diameter.          The standard
  gold pole being treated in the same way, the numbers obtained for
  the fusible metals can be compared with gold, and take their place in
- the table.
     The following table of the comparative volatilities was in this way
  obtained, taking gold as =         :—

    Aluminium and magnesium appear to                    be     practically non-volatile
under these circumstances.
    The order of metals in the table shows at once that the electrical
volatility in the solid state does not correspond with the order of melt
ing points, of atomic weights, or of any other well-known constant.
The experiment with some of the typical metals was repeated, and
the   numbers obtained did not vary materially from those given above,
showing that the order is not likely to be far wrong.                              -
    It is seen in the above table that the electrical volatility of silver
is high, while that of cadmium               is low.    In the two earlier experi
ments, where cadmium           and   silver    were  taken, the cadmium negative
electrode    in   30   minutes lost 7 '52 grs., whilst the silver negative
electrode    in  1%   hours   only lost 0'19 gr. This apparent discrepancy
is easily explained by the fact (already noted in the case of cadmium)
that the maximum evaporation e<U+FB01>ect, due to electrical disturbance,
takes place when the metal is at or near the point of liquefaction.                    If
it were possible       to form a negative pole in vacuo of molten silver,
then    the quantity volatilised in a given time would be probably much
 more than that of cadmium.
    Gold having proved. to be readily volatile under the electric current,
an experiment was tried with a view to producing a larger quantity
of the volatilised metal.        A tube was made having at one end a nega
 tive pole composed of a weighed brush of <U+FB01>ne wires of pure gold, and
                                                                            -
 an aluminium pole at the other end.
    The tube was exhausted and the current from the induction coil put
 on, making the gold brush negative;              the resistance of the tube was
 found to increase considerably as the walls became coated with metal,
 so  much so that, to enable the          current to pass through, air had to be
 let  in after a while, depressing the gauge % mm.
     The weight of the brush before experiment was 3549410 grs.
  The induction current was kept on the tube for 141% hours; at the
 end of this time the tube was opened and the brush removed.                     It now
  weighed     32'5613,    showing       a loss   of   2'9327      grs.   When    heated

below redness the deposited <U+FB01>lm of gold was easily removed from the
walls of the tube in the form of very brilliant foil.
    After having been subjected to electrical volatilisation, the appear
ance of the residual piece of gold under the microscope, using a i-inch
object glass, was very like that of electrolytically deposited metal,
pitted all over with minute hollows.
    This experiment on the volatilisation of gold having produced
good coherent <U+FB01>lms of that metal, a similar experiment was tried,
using a brush of platinum as a negative electrode.         On referring to
the table it will be seen that the electrical volatility of platinum is
much lower than that of gold, but it was thought that by taking
longer time a su<U+FB02>icient quantity might be volatilised to enable it to
                                          '
be removed from the tube.
   The vacuum tube was exhausted to such         a point as to give a dark
space   of 6 mm.,  and  it was  found, as   in the case of gold, that as a
coating of metal was deposited upon the glass the resistance rapidly
increased, but in a much more marked degree, the residual gas in the
tube apparently becoming absorbed as the deposition proceeded. It was
necessary to let a little air into the tube about every 30 minutes, to
reduce the vacuum.         This appears to show that the platinum was
being deposited in a porous spongy form, with great power of
occluding    the residual gas.
    Heating the tube when it had become in this way non~conducting
liberated su<U+FB02>icient gas to depress the gauge of the pump 1 mm., and
to reduce the vacuum so as to give a dark space of about 3 mm.
This gas was not re-absorbed on cooling, but on passing the current for

The tube was again heated, with another liberation of gas, but much
less than before, and this time the whole was re-absorbed on cooling.

opened, but I could not remove the deposited metal except in
small pieces, as it was brittle and porous.           Weighing the brush
that had formed the negative pole gave the following results :—

       oxide Cell, from a Chemical Stand-point.                Part I.”- By
       G. H. ROBERTSON.        Communicated      by Professor ARMSTRONG,
      F.R.S.       Received May 27, 1891.
                                    (Abstract)
   The author,    in the introduction, states that though, since Frankland
in 1883   published his <U+FB01>rst“ Contribution to the Chemistry of Storage
Batteries,”    the capabilities of the Planté cell have been well       tested
and are   now thoroughly understood, there is still considerable        uncer
tainty as to the precise nature of the chemical changes which           attend
their use; and that it was principally to study the part played         by the
electrolyte    that the investigation, the results of which are recorded in
this paper, was     instituted about a year ago at the Central Institution
at   Dr.  Armstrong’s suggestion, as McLeod’s observations on the
electrolysis of sulphuric acid solutions led to the supposition that the
changes occurring in the acid were probably less simple than was
commonly supposed.          This supposition was veri<U+FB01>ed.
    The <U+FB01>rst section of the paper deals with the nature of the lead salt
formed during discharge.        It is pointed out that, aslis well known, red
lead varies considerably in composition, generally containing a smaller
proportion of peroxide than is represented by the formula Pb304 =
PbOZQPbO ; and that with nitric acid it behaves as though it were a
mixture of the two oxides, the nitric acid always dissolving out the
monoxide.        There is no reason why sulphuric acid should not behave
similarly, and, since lead sulphate is but very slightly soluble, red
lead may be expected always to yield a corresponding           sulphate, i.e., a
mixture of peroxide and sulphate, containing an amount of sulphate
corresponding to the amount of monoxide originally present in com
bination with the peroxide.        At Dr. Armstrong’s request a number of
experiments were made at the Central Institution (long prior to the
reading of Messrs. Gladstone and Hibbert’s papers) by two students,
Messrs. Briggs and Ingold, on various samples of red lead, with the
result that the sulphate formed always corresponded to the monoxide
originally present.
    As no proof of the existence of a de<U+FB01>nite homogeneous sulphate
 corresponding to red lead can be a<U+FB01>orded by analysis alone, evidence
 must be obtained that the product differs in some of its properties
 from a   mixture.

106            Mr. G. H. Robertson.       A Study  of the      [June   11,
   It  was to be expected that the     E.M.F. of  an  oxysulphate would
differ from that of  a corresponding   mixture of sulphate and peroxide,
and haVe some de<U+FB01>nite value; therefore pastes were made of peroxide
of lead, peroxide of lead and sulphate in the proportions of l to _l and
l to 2, and also from the product obtained by treating red lead with
dilute sulphuric acid (1 to 5). Experiments made with these pastes
showed that there was a di<U+FB01>erence of degree only between the red
lead pastes and the mixtures, and that the lowering of the E.M.F.
appeared to depend rather on the intimacy of the mixture, and con
sequent thorough coating of the peroxide granules with sulphate, than
on the proportion of sulphate present.
   Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald had already shown, in 1887, at the Institu
tion of Electrical Engineers, that the mere admixture of lead sulphate
with peroxide of lead produces a lowering of the E.M.F.
    With regard to Frankland’s observations respecting the colour of
the product formed on the peroxide plate during discharge and the
reducibility of the sulphate, the author points out that the colour is
due to the incomplete reduction of the peroxide, owing probably to
the almost complete blocking up by lead sulphate 0f the pathways by
which the current travels through the electrolyte in the paste; that
careful examination of the plugs from a discharged cell shows that
 the base consists of practically unaltered peroxide of lead, and that the
surface, which is rich in PbSO,, is really a mass of partially reduced
granules of peroxide of lead which are coated with sulphate.
    Also, though pure lead sulphate is very dif<U+FB01>cult to reduce, it is very
well known that mixtures of lead sulphate and peroxide of lead, or
other conducting substances, are reduced with comparative ease, and
 it is very intimate mixtures of this nature which have to be dealt
 with as a rule in charging a cell.
    In conclusion, the author points out :—
    That neither chemical nor electrical tests give any ground for sup
 posing that any other sulphate than the ordinary White PbSO, is
 concerned in the interactions occurring in the cell;
    That were the sudden lowering of the              caused by a change
 in the nature of the chemical compounds formed on the plates, it is
 very di<U+FB01>cult to account for the very rapid recovery of the
 exhibited by an apparently discharged cell.
    In the second section the electrolyte is dealt with, and, after refer
ring. to the work of Berthelot, Richarz, Schone, Traube, and others
 on the electrolysis of sulphuric acid solutions, the author describes
 experiments made to test the effect of the addition of sodium sulphate
 to the electrolyte, as, from information received from Mr. Barber
 Starkey, it seemed probable that the different behaviour of cells con
taining sodium sulphate was due to the catalytic action of this salt
on the hydrogen dioxide always found in electrolysed acid of the

  1891.]         Plantc’ Cell from a Chemical Stand-point.           107
 strength used in batteries, and which is probably formed by secondary
 action from persulphuric acid.                            ‘
     Mr. Preece most kindly aided the investigation by allowing experi
 ments to be carried out at the General Post Of<U+FB01>ce, where one-half of
 the secondary cells contain 1 per cent. of sodium sulphate and the
 other half ordinary dilute acid, sp. gr. 1180.   He also put at the dis
 posal of the author the records of the behaviour of the cells, and as
 they    showed that there was much less sulphating with sodium
 sulphate, as shown by the sp. gr. never falling to the same extent as
 in the plain cells, but that the general character of the changes in
 temperature and in sp. gr. during charge and discharge were the
 same in both types of cell, and of the nature which the work of Pro
 fessor Ayrton and others has rendered familiar to all, it was only the
 distribution of temperature and of sp. gr. which was investigated, and
 this was found to be very irregular.
     It was found that the addition of sodium sulphate, in about the
 proportion of 1 per cent., to freshly electrolysed acid, or during
 electrolysis, always produced a diminution in the total quantity of
 “ active
            oxygen,” and brought the amount present in the plain cells
 down almost exactly to that found in the sodium sulphate cells.
     Experiments on the growth of the “peroxides” were carried on
 during <U+FB01>ve charges and discharges, but only the <U+FB01>gures relating to
 the <U+FB01>rst discharge are given, as the other charges and discharges are
 mere repetitions.       The peroxides form at once, then undergo a
 diminution, and then increase again. The alteration in the totals is
 due mainly to actions occurring at the lead plate in the plain cell, as
 at the peroxide plate the amounts steadily increase; in the sodium
 sulphate electrolyte there is a diminution at both plates, followed by
 an   increase.
     Determinations were made of the amounts of “active oxygen”
present as persulphuric acid and hydrogen dioxide respectively, and
 it was established that acid taken from the cell reduced peroxide of
 lead.    The presence of hydrogen dioxide being thus established both
 directly and indirectly, its effect on the E.M.F. of a cell was tested.
 It was found that, while its addition to the acid in the case of a lead
 peroxide couple in dilute sulphuric acid produced an annulment or
 reversal of the E.M.F., the introduction of hydrogen dioxide into the
 body of the peroxide paste produced an increase of E.M.F. in the case
 of a platinum-lead peroxide couple.
     The latter experiment was made with a View of reproducing, if
 possible, the conditions of a cell which is started discharging directly
  it is fully charged, and in which the persulphuric acid formed at the
  positive during charge may be supposed to break up with the forma
  tion of hydrogen dioxide on the cessation of the charging current,
  thereby increasing the normal E.M.F. of the cell.

    That their in<U+FB02>uence must not be neglected in considering the
behaviour of the Planté cell;

attention must be directed if any considerable improvement is to be
effected.

      of the Chemical Changes occurring in the Cell." By H. E.

                                 (Abstract)
    The authors arrive in this paper at the following conclusions :—
    1. That the cooling observed in the Planté cell can only be ex
plained as resulting from the dissociation of the dilute sulphuric acid;
and as the values given by Messrs. Ayrton, Lamb, Smith, and Woods
are in practical agreement with those calculated on the assumption
that the acid used is sulphuric acid itself, H230” that in all proba
bility such acid and not the dilute acid contained in the cell is opera
tive throughout.
    2. That the observed loss in e<U+FB02>iciency cannot be due to temperature
changes, as these arise through actions occurring out of circuit.
    3. That it is dif<U+FB01>cult from a\comparison of calculated with observed
values of the E.M.F. to arrive at any <U+FB01>nal conclusion as to the exact
nature of the changes which take place in the cell.      On the assump
tion that sulphating occurs at both plates in circuit and under the
in<U+FB02>uence of HQSOM the calculated value is considerably too high ;
while, if sulphating occur only at the lead plate, the value calculated
is far too low.
   4. That a counter E.M.F. of about 0'5 volt would account for the
observed departure from the highest calculated value.       As peroxides
are always-present in the electrolyte, it is conceivable that such a
counter E.M.F. may exist; moreover, there is also the possible in
<U+FB02>uence of the lead support to be considered.
   5. That the observed loss of e<U+FB01>iciency is to be attributed to the
formation of peroxides in the electrolyte, and to the excessive sulphat
ing occurring chie<U+FB02>y at the peroxide plate in the local circuit existing
between the support and the paste.

        VVILDE, F.R.S. Received May 8, 1891.
    In my paper on the “Unsymmetrical Distribution of Terrestrial
Magnetism,“ it was shown that by heating small surfaces of the thin
sheet iron entirely covering the ocean areas of the mapped globe
strong magnetic polarity was induced at the heated parts, just as
when the magnetic continuity of the iron was interrupted by cutting
through the same parts of the iron in an equatorial direction.
Although this experiment appeared to me to demonstrate conclusively
that the magnetic power of iron was reduced by heating at compara
tively low temperatures, and with small magnetising forces, yet, from
the contradictory results which have been obtained by other experi
menters on the magnetisation of heated iron, directly opposite con
clusions as to the magnetic intensities of the land and ocean areas
respectively might, with some reason, be drawn from those which                     I
had arrived at.
   Barlow, in an interesting paper on the magnetic behaviour 'of
heated iron,T refers to the discordant opinions which prevailed
on this subject among natural philosophers from the 17th century to
his time, and assigned the cause of these discordances to the obser
 vations being made with iron at different degrees of heat.
    Barlow found that the magnetic power of the bars of iron which he
 experimented upon, as measured by the de<U+FB02>ections of a compass needle,
increased with the temperature up to a dull red heat, at which it was
 the strongest; but, at a bright red heat, all magnetic action of the
 iron suddenly disappeared.             Scoresby,I Christie,§ and others had also
 noted a similar increase in the magnetic power of iron with increase
 of temperature, when measured by the same means.
    Faraday, on the other hand, has described experiments to show
 that the magnetic power of iron diminishes with increase of tempera
 ture."      He also found that iron at a bright red heat was not entirely
 insensible to the action of large magnetising forces.
     More recently, Rowland<U+FB02>l Baur,** and Hopkinson,H' by the em
 ployment of electro-dynamic methods, have also found an increase in

  the magnetic power of iron with increase of temperature.               These
  experimenters were, however, the <U+FB01>rst to recognise that the apparent
  increase of the magnetic power of iron, up to the dull red heat, only
  held good for small magnetising forces, and, further, that the power
  diminished for large magnetising             forces with ascending tempera
  tures.
     Rowland extended his observations to the magnetisation of nickel
  and cobalt, and found that the magnetic behaviour of these metals
  with increase of temperature was the same as that observed in
  iron.
     Experiments have also recently been made by Professor Riicker“
  on the effects of temperature on the natural magnet magnetite), and
  he has found, by means of an extremely sensitive instrument, that
  the magnetic power of this mineral increases as the temperature
  rises, as in the case of iron.
     The important hearing which the in<U+FB02>uence of temperature has upon
  the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism induced me to undertake
  an investigation into the causes of the con<U+FB02>icting results obtained by
  those physicists who have preceded me in this research, with the hope
  also that I might be able to extend still further our knowledge of
  magnetic     substances, especially        in.   their relation to terrestrial
  physics.
     The apparatus used in the investigation consisted of a bar electro
  magnet, formed of a cylinder of iron 24 inches in length and 3'5
  inches in diameter.        The electro-magnet was placed in a vertical
  position,  with  its  lower   end screwed <U+FB01>rmly into a massive base of
   cast iron. The upper end of the core was furnished with a short
I
  cylinder of iron, of the same diameter as the core, and having a
   conoidal termination, which constituted the pole of the magnet.
     The magnetometer was a plain cylindrical needle, 4 inches long
   and 0'13 inch in diameter, suspended from a single <U+FB01>bre of un
   twisted silk.   The needle received a charge of magnetism su<U+FB01>icient
  to support fourteen times its own weight from either pole, and was
  thickly covered with spun silk to prevent the weakening of its mag
  netism by close proximity to the heated substances under examina
  tion.
     The iron experimented upon was a cylindrical bar of good mal
  leable iron, 6 inches long and 0'7 inch in diameter.              One end of
  the iron bar was drilled through its diameter to receive a strong iron
  pin, which projected crosswise on each side of the bar for the purpose
  of dropping it readily, when heated, into a stirrup placed over the
  electro-magnet.      Several of these bars were prepared from the same
  rod of iron, to replace those which were reduced in thickness by
  fusion and oxidation, as well as for other experiments.

   The iron bar, with its stirrup, was pendent from the end of a
balanced lever placed over the pole of the electro-magnet, while the
arm of the lever, on the other side of the fulcrum, was weighted with
a sliding weight, or with variable weights, to balance the attractive
force of the iron when in contact with the electro-magnet.
   For the measurement of smaller magnetic forces, a special balance
was constructed which, besides balancing forces up to 15 lbs., would
turn with a weight of less than half a grain.
   Preliminary experiments were made upon the bar by placing              it,
when cold, in the direction of the dip, with one of its ends at a
de<U+FB01>nite distance    from the magnetometer, and in the same horizontal
plane.\When in thisposition, the magnetic force of the iron bar, aug
mented by the earth’s magnetism, produced a de<U+FB02>ection of the needle
from the magnetic meridian of 20°.
    The bar was then heated to bright redness, and replaced in the
same     position as before, when all the phenomena described by
Barlow were reproduced.       The heated bar had no perceptible action
on the magnetometer,       but  on cooling down to a less red heat the
magnetic action of the iron began to manifest itself, gradually at
<U+FB01>rst, and then very rapidly, till the de<U+FB02>ection of the needle, which
was 20° with the cold iron, now advanced to 43°, thereby showing an
 increase of the magnetic power of the iron at this temperature.      011
 the further cooling of the bar, the magnetic action of the iron
 gradually diminished, till the same de<U+FB02>ection of the needle was
  obtained as at the commencement of the experiments.
     The increase in the magnetism of the bar, as shown by this experi
 ment, although greatly augmented by the earth’s magnetism, was,
  however, very feeble; for when the bar was placed horizontally at the
  same distance from the needle the de<U+FB02>ection was only increased 5° by
  heating it to the temperature most favourable to its magnetisation;
  and no increase     of magnetism could be perceived when a small
  electro-magnet, however feebly excited, was brought into direct
  contact with the heated iron.
     The bar was again heated to incipient whiteness, and placed over the
  pole of the electro-magnet.    As the cooling proceeded, observations
  were taken of the intervals of time required before the magnetic
   force was su<U+FB02>icient to cause the bar to adhere to the pole of the
   electro-magnet for each de<U+FB01>nite increase of weight on the lever.
      The colour, and several shades of colour, of the heated iron above
 visible   redness,   progressing   towards   the orange   and yellow,    are
 expressed  in wave-lengths of well-known spectral lines of the
 alkaline and alkaline earth metals in the arc spectrum, as observed

   The principal result shown by these experiments is the continued
diminution       of the magnetic power of the iron, from the lowest to the
highest temperature to which the bar was subjected.
   As it was of importance to determine whether iron entirely loses
its magnetic power by heating, the temperature of one of the bars was
raised to incipient fusion; but when the bar was carefully balanced
there still remained in it a measurable amount of magnetic force
when the electro-magnet was brought into action.

       The results also show a rapid increase of the magnetic power of the
  bar from 7t 6496 to x 6705.         This increase was attributed, in the <U+FB01>rst
  instance, to an error of observation, but on repeating the experiment
  similar       results were obtained.        The rapid increment of magnetic
  force     in the interval of cooling between these spectral lines may, there
  fore, be regarded       as a real phenomenon.
       In all the experiments which have hitherto              been made, where an
  increase of the magnetic power of iron with increase of temperature
  has been observed, it does not appear to have been suspected that the
  mass‘of the iron, in relation to the magnetising forces employed,
  might be an important factor in the results obtained, and that
  small magnetising forces might only penetrate to a small depth                      -
  below the surface of the iron, when cold, till the more central por
  tions of the mass were brought into action by increase of tempera
  ture.       Several magnetic properties of iron and steel, however, point
  to the     probability of this action of weak magnetising forces. Coulomb
  found that the magnetism of similar steel bars did not increase in the
p ratio'of their number when laid together, from which it was inferred
  that the magnetism diminished‘from the surface to the centre of the
  bars.       Joule has shown that a hollow electro-magnet has greater
  attractive force than a solid one of the same sectional area, with a
   small magnetisingvcnrrent<U+FB01>            It is also well known that the dis
   tribution of magnetism on the polar surfaces of electro-magnets is
   much greater at the circumference than it is at the centre.
       That small magnetising forces penetrate but a small depth into a
   mass of iron was shown by heating one of the bars to redness, and
   sprinkling over its surface ferrocyanide             of potassium, in powder,
   before plunging the heated bar into cold water.                  The conversion of
   the surface of the iron into steel by this well known process was
   suf<U+FB01>cient to reduce the deflection of the needle from 20° to 15°, when
   the bar was placed in the direction of the dip.
       In addition to the evidence adduced of the surface action of small
   magnetising forces on a mass of iron, it further appeared to me that
   as the time and limit of magnetisation of iron vary with the mass, for
   constant magnetising currents, or that the time and limit of magneti
   sation are constant when the magnetising current and mass vary in
   proportion, so it also appeared to me that, when the mass of iron and
   magnetising force were proportional, the diminution of the magnetic
   power of iron with increase of temperature would be constant for
   small, as well as for large, magnetising forces.
       That the increase of the magnetic power of the heated bar, as
   showa by the magnetometer, was caused by the large mass of the
    iron in relation to the magnetising force of the needle was shown
    by the following experiments :—

114      Mr. H. Wilde.       0n   the In<U+FB02>uence   of  Temperature    [June   11,
   ((1.)  A  small cylinder of iron wire, 0‘2 inch long and 0'5 inch
in diameter, was mounted in a twisted loop formed at the end
of a piece of thin copper wire. The copper wire was <U+FB01>xed to an arm
moving horizontally, in such manner that, when the cylinder of iron
was brought into close proximity to one pole of the needle, the iron
drew the needle' from the magnetic meridian                 to a point where
equilibrium     was established    between   the  attractive force of the iron
and the earth’s magnetism.           The needle was then blocked a small
fraction of an inch in advance and also behind this position; so that
any increase or diminution of the magnetic power of the iron would'
limit the range of the needle to a fraction of an inch in either
direction.
   When a small gas-<U+FB02>ame, or a lighted taper, was brought under the
cylinder of iron wire till it became visibly red hot, the needle receded
from the iron towards the magnetic meridian, thereby indicating a
diminution of the magnetic power of the iron by the magnetometer
which had previously shown an increase in the magnetic action of'
the large bar. On removing the source of heat from the iron, the
needle again advanced towards it. On reheating the iron, the needle
again receded, and the operation could be repeated at pleasure.
   [That the recession of the needle from the heated iron was not due
to the temperature being suf<U+FB01>ciently high to render the iron virtually
non-magnetic was shown by the needle again advancing towards the
heated iron when brought into closer proximity to it without change
of temperature, but no increase was observable in the magnetic power
of the iron with any increase of temperature above 13° O.—sze 3,
1891.]
   (b.) A small cylinder of steel was prepared from the same piece as
that from which the magnetometer needle was cut, and of the same
dimensions as the one used in the previous experiment.             All trace of
permanent magnetism        was    removed from the steel by heating it to
bright redness in    a blowpipe <U+FB02>ame, so that either end of the cylinder
when cold was attracted indifferently by the same pole of the needle.
When the steel was submitted to the process of heating and cooling
in proximity to the magnetometer, as in experiment (a), its magnetic
behaviour was the same as that observed with the iron.
   The increase of magnetic power in the iron and steel, during the
period of cooling, appeared to come on gradually, in the same manner
as the magnetic power of the bar in relation to the large electro
magnet; and both experiments show decisively that the magnetic
power of iron diminishes with increase of temperature for small, as
well   as for large, magnetising     forces.
    (0.)  A  fragment   of  the    natural  magnet (magnetite), weighing 2
 grains,  was  detached  from   a  compact and well crystallised mass of this
 mineral.     The magnetite was heated to bright redness to remove all

1891.]     upon the Magnetisation    of Iron and other Substances.    115
trace of polarity, and care was taken to prevent new polarities being
given to it by accidental contact with the needle. On heating the
magnetite in the wire loop, as in experiment (a), the in<U+FB02>uence of
temperature was more marked than with the iron, as the needle
receded towards the magnetic meridian before the magnetite was
visibly red-hot, and advanced again very readin when the source of
heat was removed.
   (d.)  Asmall rectangular prism of nickel,0'2 inch long and 0'05 inch
across  the sides, was submitted to the magnetometer as in the previous
experiments, when the increase of temperature in diminishing the
magnetic power of the nickel was most pronounced at the temperature
of melted tin, and the metal became quite insensible to the needle at
a point much below the red heat.
   (e.) A rectangular prism of pure cobalt, of the same dimensions
as that used in the previous experiment, was submitted to the action
of the magnetometer,         when, contrary to expectation, the needle
advanced towards the cobalt before it became visibly red-hot, and
remained stationary when the- temperature was raised to redness;
thereby showing an increase of. magnetic power of the cobalt with
increase   of temperature.
   The   magnetic behaviour of the cobalt was so remarkable as to
induce   me to make further experiments upon the metal with more
powerful magnetising forces
   A cube of pure cobalt from the- Chemical Museum of the Owens
College was kindly placed at my disposal for these experiments by
Professor H. B. Dixon, F.R.S..           The cube was 0'3 inch across
the sides, and a short piece of platinum was screwed into the centre
of one    of its faces for suspension from the balance over the large
electro-magnet.      rl‘he temperature of the cube, below the red heat,
was determined by the fusion of small fragments of zinc and tin,
 placed in a conical recess drilled into the upper face of the cube.
    Similar cubes of nickel and malleable iron were prepared for com
 parison with the results obtained with the cobalt.
    The method of experimenting          was as follows :——The cube of
 magnetic metal was suspended over the electro-magnet, excited by a
 current of 20 amperes, and while in this position was heated by an
 oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame until the requisite temperature was attained.
 The cube was then quickly brought into contact with the pole of the
 electro-maguet, without any intermission of the heating blast, and
 the magnetic force was measured by the weight required to detach
 the cube from the electro-magnet.         The cube was reduced to the
 temperature of    —76°    C. by immersing it in a bath of solid carbonic
 acid and ether, whilst suspended over the electro-magnet.
    The results of these experiments with the magnetic metals are
 given below   :—

   The principal feature of interest in the table is the same inversion
of the magnetic power of the heated cube of cobalt, in relation to
iron and nickel, as was obtained by the minute force of the magneto
meter needle acting upon the small prism of the same metal.                             The
increase    of  the    magnetic power           of  the  heated    cube was, however,
much greater relatively with smaller magnetising forces; for, while
the ratio of increase with 20 amperes of current was as 1:1'15
between 13° C. and 442° C., the ratio wit-h 3 amperes was as 1 : 1'6
between the same temperatures.
   The abruptness of the change in the magnetic condition of iron,
nickel, and cobalt, observed by Faraday,* at what is now aptly
termed the critical temperature, is also well seen in the table.
   Following up the results of the experiments which showed that
the apparent increase in the magnetic power of heated iron was
dependent upon ’the mass in relation to the magnetising force, it
appeared to me that heated cobalt might show a diminution of mag
netic power, as in the case of iron and nickel, if a suf<U+FB01>ciently large
magnetising force were brought to bear upon a minute quantity of
the metal, notwithstanding that it had so far shown an increase of
power for large, as well as for small, magnetising forces.
   A minute cylinder of cobalt, 0'06 inch long, 0'05 inch in diameter,
and   i grain in weight, was formed from a piece of the same cube of
the metal      used in the previous experiments.                      A small hole was
drilled up the end of a thick piece of copper wire in the direction of
its axis, into which the cylinder of cobalt was driven tightly for
nearly the whole of its length. An eye was formed at the other end
of the copper wire for suspending the cobalt over the electro
                                                                                      '

experimented with, and mounted for suspension over the electro
magnet in the same manner as the cylinder of cobalt.
    The <U+FB02>at end of the electro-magnet was surmounted by a cone of
iron 4 inches high and 3 inches in diameter at the base, with the apex
rounded to form a pole 0‘1 inch in diameter.
    As a test of the magnetic intensity at the pole of the electro
magnet, the little cylinder of iron was suspended from the balance,
when the tractive force was 0601. lb. with 20 ampéres of current,
which is equal to 305 lbs. per square inch of section, or more than
17,000 times the weight of the iron.
    When the cobalt was submitted to the same magnetising force as
the iron, the tractive force at 13° C. was 0304; -lb., which is equal to
154.- lbs. per square inch of section, or 8000 times the weight of the
cylinder of cobalt.
    On heating the cobalt, whilst suspended over the electro-magnet, a
constant      diminution of the magnetic power of the metal was now
observed      from 13° (1., as in the case of iron and nickel, the tractive
 force diminishing from 0304 lb. at 13° C. to 0296 lb. at 442° C.

     That the property of the anomalous increase of the magnetic power
  of the    heated cobalt was broken down by the intensity of the mag
  netic force and the diminution of the mass conjointly, as in the case
  of the small and large bars of iron, was further shown by submitting
  the  little cylinder of cobalt to the action of the electro-magnet excited
  by 5 amperes of current, when the tractive force of the heated cobalt
   was increased from 0'140 lb. at 13° C. to 0156 lb. at 442° C.

l 18                              Presents.                         [June  11,
   On comparing the tractive force of the cobalt with that of iron.
each with 5 amperes of current, it will be seen from the table that it
was still very high, being no less, for the iron, than 0'437 lb. =
222 lbs. per square inch of section, or more than 12,000 times its own
weight.     Although this amount of tractive force is greater than any
so far recorded for iron, yet the magnetising force was not suf<U+FB01>cient
to break down the property of the increase of magnetic force of the
heated cobalt.     It is well, however, that I should point out that the
property only pertains in the highest degree to the metal when in a
state of purity, as several of the specimens experimented upon, from
different sources, only exhibit the property in a feeble manner, the
diminution being due to therpresence of iron in the cobalt.
   As the determination of the limit of the magnetisability of iron by
di<U+FB01>erent methods is of some importance to magnetical science, an
experiment was made on a cylinder of annealed charcoal iron wire
0‘2 inch long, 0'05 inch in diameter, and it grain in weight.             The
cylinder was driven up the end of a thick copper wire for the purpose
of suspension as in the previous experiments.           The tractive force of
this specimen of iron at 13° 0., with 40 ampéres of current, was
0‘75 1b., which is equal to 381 lbs. per square inch of section, or
7000 times the weight of the iron.
   That the limit of magnetisability was virtually arrived at in this
experiment was shown by reducing the current to 20 amperes, when
the tractive force remained at 0734, lb. = 373 lbs. per square inch of
section, or only 8 lbs. less per square inch than the tractive force
obtained with &O amperes of current.

I. “Results of Hemisection of the Spinal Cord in. Monkeys.”
      By FREDERICK W. MOTT, M.D., B.S., M.R.C.P. Communi
      cated by Professor SCHA'FER, F .R.S. Received June 1,
      1891.
                                (Abstract)
   While engaged in studying experimentally the connexions of the
cells of Clarke’s column with the ascending tracts of the spinal cord
in the monkey, I was surprised to <U+FB01>nd that after hemisection in the
lower dorsal region the sensory disturbances produced in no way
corresponded with those already obtained‘by eminent observers.
   I was, therefore, led to continue my experiments, and, by the kind
 permission of Professor Sch'afer,   I  carried‘ them out in the Physio-
logical Laboratory of University College.       My thanks are also due to
 him for much valuable advice and‘assistance.
   The subject is one of great importance" from a scienti<U+FB01>c, as well as
from a clinical, point of view.   Some years ago, a case occurred in my
practice which tended to shake my faith in the absolute truth of the
 doctrine of complete and. immediate decussation of sensory impulses
in the spinal cord, as taught by Brown-Séquard.
   The experiments which I have performed exhibit the following
principal points of interest :—
   1. Return of associated movements after complete destruction         of
the crossed pyramidal tract below the lesion.
   2. That all sensory impulses do not decussate in the cord, in fact,
they appear to show that certain sensory impulses, e.g., touch, the
muscular sense and localisation in space, pass chie<U+FB02>y up the same side,
painful impressions up both sides. A peculiar condition known as
“ allochiria ” occurs after hemisection.

    3.   The vase-motor disturbances are on the same side as the lesion,
and consist of vase-dilation,         swelling of the foot, and redness with
rise of temperature of the skin of the foot, but, as compared with the
opposite side, fall of temperature in the popliteal space on the side of
the lesion, due, no doubt, to        paralysis of the muscles.
    4.  The degenerations above and below the lesion are limited to the
same side when the injury is perfectly unilateral.           There are certain
facts connected with the degenerations which serve to show the origin
and course of certain long and short tract <U+FB01>bres.
    5.  Stimulation of the cortex cerebri on both sides some weeks or
months       after the hemisection had been performed gave, as a rule,
results which showed that the block in the spinal cord produced by the
hemisection        still existed, although there had been a very complete
return of associated movements.
    6.  In one     case ablation of the leg area on the same side as the
lesion    in the spinal cord was performed many months afterwards.

 after heating the alloys are not magnetisable, have a higher electric
  resistance, a lower breaking stress, and greater elongation.          l have

  cent.  less dense when       in the magnetisable than when in the non

IV. “An Apparatus for testing the Sensitiveness of Safety
       lamps.” By FRANK CLOWEs, D.Sc., Lond, Professor of
       Chemistry, University College, Nottingham. Communicated
       by Professor ARMSTRONG, F.R.S. Received June 4, 1891.
    It  is generally acknowledged that the Davy safety-lamp cannot
with certainty detect less than 3 per cent. of <U+FB01>redamp in the air of
the mine.     Gas-indicators of much greater sensitiveness have been
invented; amongt these the electrical apparatus of Liveing and the
spirit safety-lamp of Pieler take <U+FB01>rst rank. The objection to these
special forms is, however, a serious one.           They do not serve for
illuminating purposes,   and  therefore it  becomes    necessary to carry an
ordinary safety-lamp,     together with the testing apparatus.           Many
attempts have been made to obviate this inconvenience by producing
a safety-lamp which shall serve the double purpose of illumination
and of detecting minute percentages of <U+FB01>redamp.              The discovery of
such a lamp would be of great value to the miner, in view of the fact
that very low percentages of <U+FB01>redamp have been provad to be dan
gerous in the presence of coal-dust.
    The following apparatus has been devised to render easy the process
of testing the sensitiveness of different forms of safety-lamps when
used for detecting <U+FB01>redamp.       To enable satisfactory tests to be made
in the laboratory, it was necessary to insure (l) the easy and rapid
production of mixtures of <U+FB01>redamp and air in known proportions;
 (2) to insure economy of the arti<U+FB01>cially prepared methane, which
represented <U+FB01>redamp; and (3) to examine the <U+FB02>ame of the lamp
under conditions as satisfactory as those existing in the mine.
    A wooden cubical box of about 100 litres capacity was constructed
so as to be as nearly gas-tight as possible.         It was then made abso
lutely gas-tight by painting it over with melted paraf<U+FB01>n wax, which
was afterwards caused to penetrate more perfectly by passing an
ordinary hot <U+FB02>at-iron over the surface. This testing chamber was
furnished with a small inlet tube at the top, and with a similar outlet

                     a
lamp in the interior, and a <U+FB02>anged opening below for introducing the
safety-lamp.   This opening was closed by water-seal consisting of a
                                                a
small zine tray upported by buttons, and containing about       2inches
depth of water, into which the <U+FB02>ange dipped.    A mixer was arranged,
which consisted of a light <U+FB02>at board, nearly equal in dimensions to the

124              Prof. F. Clowes,     An Apparatus for        [June  18,
section of the chamber. and suspended by an axis from the upper
corner of the chamber. The mixer was moved rapidly backwards and
forwards from the side to the top of the interior of the chamber, by
grasping a handle projecting through the front of the chamber.
   When a mixture of air with a certain de<U+FB01>nite percentage of <U+FB01>re
damp was required, the methane, prepared and puri<U+FB01>ed by ordinary
chemical methods, was introduced into the chamber in the requisite
quantity by the top inlet. It displaced an equal volume of air, which
escaped   through the lower outlet, the exit end of which was sealed by
being immersed just beneath a water surface.       A vigorous use of the
mixer secured a uniform mixture of gas and air throughout the interior
of the chamber in the course of a few seconds.      The lamp was then
introduced into the chamber, and placed in position behind the glass
window.      The simplicity of arrangement of the water-seal rendered
the necessary opening of the chamber very brief, and the introduction
and removal of the lamp many times in succession was not found to
produce any appreciable effect upon the composition of the atmosphere
                                                                        ”
inside the chamber.     The appearance and dimensions of the “ cap
over the <U+FB02>ame were noted as soon as the cap underwent no further
change.     A lamp was left burning in the chamber for a considerable
length of time, and its indications underwent no change, owing to the
large capacity of the chamber and the very limited amount of air
required to support the combustion of the small <U+FB02>ame always used in
gas-testing.    The whole interior of the chamber and mixer were
painted   dead-black, so as to render visible pale and small caps against
a black ground.
   The methane was introduced from an ordinary gas-holder.             A
volume of water, equal to that of the methane to be displaced, was
poured into the top of the gas-holder.     The gas-tap of the holder was
then momentarily opened, so as to produce equilibrium of pressure
between the methane and the atmosphere.        The gas-tap having then
 been placed in connexion with the upper inlet of the chamber, the
water-tap was opened, and the measured volume of water was allowed
to <U+FB02>ow down and drive the methane into the chamber.           As soon as
 bubbles of air ceased to appear through the water at the outlet, the
 chamber was closed; the mixer was then vigorously worked for a few
 seconds, and the mixture of gas and air was ready for the introduction
 of the lamp. Before introducing the methane for a fresh mixture, the
 atmosphere of the chamber was replaced by fresh air by removing the
 water-tray from beneath the Opening at the bottom of the chamber,
 and blowing in a powerful stream of air from a bellows to the top of
 the chamber.
    The chamber was supported on legs, which were arranged so as to
 place it at a convenient height for observations through the window,
 and also for the introduction and removal of the safety-lamp.

 1891.]         testing the Sensiti'veness of Safety-lamps.          125
    The accuracy of this method was tested by introducing the Pieler
lamp into the chamber, which was charged successively with a series
of mixtures containing proportions of methane varying from 0'5 to
4 per cent.    The height and appearance of the cap over the <U+FB02>ame
absolutely corresponded with a series of standard tests already pub
lished, and made by a different method, in which <U+FB01>redamp was used
instead of methane.
    The observations were usually made in a darkened room, but the
<U+FB02>ame-caps were easily seen in a lighted room, provided direct light
falling on the eye or chamber was avoided.
    The capacity of the chamber was 95,220 0.0.; accordingly the follow
ing volumes of methane were introduced: for 15 per cent. mixture
476 0.0., for 1 per cent. 952 0.0., for 2 per cent. 1904: 0.0., for 3 per
cent. 2856 0.0., for 4 per cent. .3808 0.0., and for 5 per cent. 4760 0.0.
lt will be seen that a. series of tests, in which the above-mentioned
percentage mixtures were employed, involves an expenditure of only
15 litres of methane, a quantity far smaller than that required by any
other method of testing as yet described.
    Of many forms of safety-lamp tested in the above apparatus, the
one which most satisfactorily ful<U+FB01>lled the two purposes of ef<U+FB01>cient
illumination and delicacy in gas-testing was Ashworth’s improved
Hepplewhite-Gray lamp. This lamp is of special construction, burns
benzoline from a sponge reservoir, and its <U+FB02>ame is surrounded with a
glass cylinder, which is ground rough at the hinder part; this latter
device prevents the numerous re<U+FB02>ected images of the <U+FB02>ame, and the
generally diffused re<U+FB02>ections which are seen from a smooth glass
surface, and which render the observation of a small pale <U+FB02>ame-cap
very dif<U+FB01>cult, if not impossible.
    The wick of this lamp, when at a normal height, furnishes a
 <U+FB02>ame of great illuminating power.         When lowered by a <U+FB01>ne screw
 adjustment the <U+FB02>ame becomes blue and non-luminous,              and does
not interfere therefore with the easy observation of a pale cap.
 The following heights of <U+FB02>ame-cap were observed, which fully bear
 out the unusual sensitiveness of this <U+FB02>ame. With 0'5 per cent.
 of methane 7 mm.; with        l   per cent. 10 mm.; with 2 per cent.
 14: mm. ; with 3 per cent. 20 mm.;         with 4 per cent. 25 mm.; and
 with 5 per cent. 30 mm. The cap, which with the lower proportions
 was somewhat ill-de<U+FB01>ned, became remarkably sharp and de<U+FB01>nite
 when 3 per cent. and upwards of methane was present.            But even
 the lowest percentage gave a cap easily seen by an inexperienced
 observer.
    It appears from the above record of tests that the problem of pro
 ducing a lamp which shall serve both for ef<U+FB01>cient illuminating and
 for delicate gas-testing purposes has been solved. The solution is in
  some measure due to the substitution of benzoline for oil, since the

  126    Mr. O. Heaviside.       On the Forces, Stresses, and    [June 18,
  <U+FB02>ame of an oil-<U+FB02>ame cannot be altogether deprived of its yellow
  luminous tip, without serious risk of total extinction; and this faint
  luminosity is suf<U+FB01>cient to prevent pale caps from being seen.
     From further experiments made in the above testing chamber with
  <U+FB02>ames produced by alcohol and by hydrogen, it was found to be true in
  practice, as might be inferred from theory, that, if the <U+FB02>ame was pale
  and practically non-luminous, the size and de<U+FB01>nition of the <U+FB02>ame-cap
  was augmented by increasing either the size or the temperature of
  the <U+FB02>ame. It is quite possible by attending to these conditionsto
  obtain a <U+FB02>ame which, although it is very sensitive for low percentages
  of gas, becomes unsuitable for the measurement of any proportion of
  gas exceeding 3 per cent. This must, for the general purposes of the
  miner, be looked upon as a defect; but it is not a fault of the lamp
 already referred to. It is of interest to note that with the Pieler
 spirit-lamp a <U+FB02>ame-cap an inch in height was seen in air containing
 only 0'5 per cent. of methane.
  V.  “On the Forces, Stresses, and Fluxes of Energy in the
       Electromagnetic       Field.”    By OLIVER Hmvxsms, F.R.S.
       Received June 9, 1891.
                                  (Abs tract.)
     The abstract nature of this paper renders its adequate abstraction
 dif<U+FB01>cult.   The principle of conservation of energy, when applied to
 a theory such as Maxwell’s, which postulates the de<U+FB01>nite localisation
 of energy, takes a more special form, viz., that of the continuity of
 energy.    Its general nature is discussed. The relativity of motion
 forbids us to go so far as to assume the objectivity of energy, and to
 identify energy, like matter; hence the expression of the principle is
 less precise than that of the continuity of matter (as in hydrodynamics),
 for all we can say in general is that the convergence of the <U+FB02>ux of
energy equals the rate of increase of the density of the energy; the
<U+FB02>ux of the energy being made up partly of the mere convection of
energy by motion of the matter (or other medium) with which it is asso
ciated localisably, and partly of energy which is transferred through
the medium in other ways, as by the activity of a stress, for example,
not obviously (if at all) representable as the convection of energy.
Gravitational energy is the chief dif<U+FB01>culty in the way of the carrying
out of the principle. It must come from the ether (for where else
can it come from ?), when it goes to matter; but we are entirely
ignorant of the manner of its distribution and transference.         But,
whenever energy can be localised, the principle of continuity of
energy is (in spite of certain drawbacks connected with the circuital
<U+FB02>ow of energy) a valuable principle which should be utilised to the

 1891.]       Fluxes of Energy in   the Electromagnetic   Field.      , 127
uttermost.      Practical forms are considered.     In the electromagnetic
application    the <U+FB02>ux of energy has a four-fold make-up, viz., the
Poynting <U+FB02>ux of energy, which occurs whether the medium be
stationary or moving; the <U+FB02>ux of energy due to the activity of the
electromagnetic stress when the medium is moving; the convection
of electric and magnetic energy; and the convection of other energy
associated with the working of the translational force due to the
stress.
    As Electro-magnetism swarms with vectors, the proper language
for its expression and investigation is the Algebra of Vectors. An
account is therefore given of the method employed by the author for
some years past.         The quaternionio     basis is rejected, and the
algebra is based upon a few de<U+FB01>nitions of notation merely.        It may be
regarded as Quaternions without quaternions, and simpli<U+FB01>ed to the
uttermost; or else as being merely a conveniently condensed expres
sion of the Cartesian mathematics, understandable          by all who are
acquainted with Cartesian methods, and with which the vectorial
algebra. is made to harmonise.         It is con<U+FB01>dently recommended as a
practical working system.
    In continuation thereof, and preliminary to the examination of
electromagnetic stresses, the theory of stresses of the general type,
that is, rotational, is considered; and also the stress activity, and
flux of energy, and its convergence and division into translational,
rotational,   and distortional parts; all of which, it is pointed out, may
be associated     with stored potential, kinetic, and wasted energy, at
least so far as the mathematics is concerned.
    The electromagnetic equations are then introduced, using them in
the     author’s general forms, 'l.e., an extended form of Maxwell’s
 circuital law, de<U+FB01>ning electric current in terms of magnetic force,
and a companion equation expressing the second circuital law; this
 method replacing Maxwell’s in terms of the vector potential and the
 electrostatic potential, Maxwell’s equations of propagation          being
 found impossible to work and not suf<U+FB01>ciently general.        The equation
 of activity is then derived in as general a form as possible, including
 the effects of impressed forces and intrinsic magnetisation, for a
 stationary medium which may be eolotropic or not. Application of
 the principle of continuity of energy then immediately indicates that
 the <U+FB02>ux of energy in -the <U+FB01>eld is represented by the formula <U+FB01>rst
 discovered by Poynting.       Next, the equation of activity for a moving
  medium is considered.      It does not immediately indicate the <U+FB02>ux of
  energy, and, in fact, several transformations        are required before
  it is brought to a fully signi<U+FB01>cant form, indicating (1) the Poynting
  <U+FB02>ux, the form of which is settled ; (2) the convection of electric and
  magnetic energy; (3) a <U+FB02>ux of energy which, from the form in which
  the velocity of the medium enters, represents the <U+FB02>ux of energy due

              '
  128            On Energy in the Electromagnetic     Field.      [June  18,
  to a working stress.     Like the Poynting <U+FB02>ux, it contains vector pro
  ducts.   From this <U+FB01>ux the stress itself is derived, and the form of
 translational force. previously tentatively developed, is veri<U+FB01>ed. It is
 assumed that the medium in its motion carries its properties with it
  unchanged.
    A side matter which is discussed is the proper measure of “ true”
 electric current, in accordance with the continuity of energy.       It has
 a four-fold make-up, viz., the conduction current, displacement cur
 rent, convection current (or moving electri<U+FB01>cation), and the curl of
 the motional magnetic force.
    The stress is divisible into an electric and a magnetic stress. These
 are of the rotational type in eolotropic media.      They do not agree
 with Maxwell’s general stresses, though they work down to them in
 an isotropic homogeneous stationary medium not intrinsically mag
 netised or electrised, being then the well-known tensions in certain
 lines with equal lateral pressures.
    Another and shorter derivation of the stress is then given, guided
 by the previous, without developing the expression for the <U+FB02>ux of
 energy.    Variations of the properties permittivity and inductivity
 with the strain can be allowed for. An investigation by Professor
 H. Hertz is referred to. His stress is not agreed with, and it is
 pointed out that the assumption by which it is obtained is equivalent
 to the existence of isotropy, so that its generality is destroyed.     The
obvious validity of the assumption on which the distortional activity
 of the stress is calculated is also questioned.
    Another form of the stress vector is examined, showing its relation
to the <U+FB01>ctitious electri<U+FB01>cation and magnetic current, magneti<U+FB01>catiou
and electric current, produced on the boundary of a region by termi
nating the stress thereupon; and its relation to the theory of action
at a distance between the respective matters and currents.
    The stress subject is then considered statically. The problem is
now perfectly indeterminate, in the absence of a complete experi-_
mental knowledge of the strains set up in bodies under electric and
magnetic in<U+FB02>uence.       Only the stress in the air outside magnets and
conductors can be considered known.         Any stress within them may
be superadded, without any difference being made in the resultant
forces and torques.       Several stress formulae are given, showing a
transition from one extreme form to another.        A simple example is
worked out to illustrate the different ways in which Maxwell’s stress
and others explain the mechanical actions.       Maxwell’s stress, which
involves a translational force on magnetised matter (even when only
inductively magnetised), merely because it is magnetised, leads to a
very complicated and unnatural way of explanation.           It is argued,
independently, that no stress formula should be allowed which indi
cates a translational force of the kind just mentioned.

1891.]       Comparison   of Simultaneous Magnetic Disturbances.         129
    Still the matter is left indeterminate     from the statical standpoint.
From the dynamical standpoint, however, we are led to a certain
de<U+FB01>nite stress distribution, which is also, fortunately, free from the
above objection, and is harmonised with the <U+FB02>ux of energy.           A pecu
liarity is the way the force on an intrinsic magnet is represented. It
is not   by force on its poles, nor on its interior, but on its sides, refer
ring to a simple case of uniform longitudinal magnetisation; i.e., it
is done by a quasi-electromagnetic         force on the <U+FB01>ctitious electric
current which would produce the same distribution of induction as
the magnet does.       There is also a force where the inductivity varies.
This force on <U+FB01>ctitious current harmonises with the conclusion pre
viously arrived at by the author that, when impressed forces set up
disturbances, such disturbanCPs are determined by the curl of the
impressed forces, and proceed from their localities.
    In conclusion it is pointed out that the determinateness of the
stress rests upon the assumed localisation of the energy and the
two laws of circuitation, so that with other distributions of the
energy (of the same proper total amounts) other results would follow ;
 but the author has been unable to produce full harmony in any other
 way than that followed.

    After drawing attention to previous investigations on this subject,
 and   pointing out the importance of adopting the same scale values for
 similar instruments at diiferent Observatories, especially at new
 Observatories which have been recently established, the discussion
 of special   magnetic disturbances is undertaken, especially the dis
 turbances of a great magnetic storm which occurred on June 24 and
 ‘25, 1885, for which photographic     records have been obtained from 17
 di<U+FB01>erent    Observatories:  11 in  Europe,   1 in Canada, 1 in India, 1 in
 China, 1 in Java, 1 at Mauritius, and     1  at Melbourne.
     The records are discussed and compared, tables are formed of the
 simultaneous disturbances, and the traces are reduced to Greenwich
  mean time and brought together on the same plates arranged on the
  same time-scale.    Plates  I and   II  show the remarkable agreement
  between the disturbances      at  the  di<U+FB01>erent   Observatories, and the
                                                                    i;

Tables show that the amount of disturbance, especially of horizontal
magnetic force, is nearly the same at widely distant stations.
    An attempt has also been made to apply the Gaussian analysis to
sudden magnetic disturbances, and, with a view to their application
in future work, the values of the Gaussian functions have been ob
tained for 20 different Observatories, and the numerical equations
formed for the elements of magnetic force in three directions
mutually at right angles, and also' the equation for the magnetic
potential in terms of the Gaussian coef<U+FB01>cients to the fourth order.
    The Tables give the numerical values to be multiplied by the 2t
Gaussian coefficients to give the values of the forces X, Y, and Z in
the geographical meridian towards the north, perpendicular to the
meridian towards the west, and vertically downwards respectively.
The equations are also formed and the values obtained in terms of
the 24 Gaussian coef<U+FB01>cients for X2, Y2, and Z2, X, being the horizontal
force in the magnetic meridian, Y, the horizontal force perpendicular
to the magnetic meridian, and Z, the vertical force.        If then X2, Y2,
and Z, be the observed values of any simultaneous disturbances, they
may be at once substituted in the equations, the equations giving the
24 Gaussian coefficients may be solved, and the corresponding       change
of magnetic potential may be determined.

    In  the year 1885 Messrs. Creelman and Crocket (‘Edinburgh Roy.
 Sec.  Proc.,’  vol. 13, p. 311), under Professor Tait’s supervision, per
 formed a series of experiments on the heat produced by the compres
 sion of various substances.       Their method was brie<U+FB02>y as follows :—
 For the application of the pressure, the same apparatus which we
 describe and <U+FB01>gure later was used.         A thermo-electric junction of
 insulated nickel and iron wires was <U+FB01>xed between the leather washers
 and a suf<U+FB01>cient length of wire coiled away inside the gun to allow the
 junction to be drawn out at the top and a specimen attached to it.
 Among the substances examined were glass, cork, vulcanite, glue,
 bees’-wax, and paraf<U+FB01>n oil, the only pure chemical compounds being
 chloroform and ether. The following are some of the results obtained.

   Owing     to the unfortunate choice of substances, these results,
although    of interest as illustrating the application of the method, can
have little, if any, general signi<U+FB01>cance.         In the year 1888 Mr. Burton
performed a similar series of experiments, with the view of gaining
some light on the physical constitution of allotropic forms of elemen
tary substances.       As the results have not hitherto been published,
they are here shortly recorded.            The following table gives a 'résumé
oi the results obtained with the two forms of phosphorus and with
several metals.      The method was in nearly all particulars the same
as that of Messrs. Creelman          and Crocket.     The powdered substances
were strongly compressed in short glass tubes, and the sharp-pointed
nickel-iron junction pressed into the powder.             The metals were made
into little cylinders, and a hole drilled in each, very little larger than
the junction.      The sample was <U+FB01>xed on the wires and then <U+FB01>nely
powdered metal packed in, so as to leave the least possible air space.
This method proved fairly satisfactory for such metals as could be
obtained in ingots, and for very heavy and coherent powders, such as
graphite, arsenic, and amorphous phosphorus;               but it was, of course,
inapplicable to liquids, except water, and almost equally so to            '
                                                                             light
powders, like charcoal.
   The <U+FB01>gures in column 2, showing the amount of heat produced by
a uniform pressure of about 300 atmospheres, or 2 tons, on the square
inch, seemed to indicate that in metals the heat produced by compres
sion varied inversely as the atomic weight.               The difference in the
heat given out by the two kinds of phosphorus is remarkable, and
may possibly      be held to indicate a wide di<U+FB01>erence in molecular
weight.
   The results were      not suf<U+FB01>cient, either in number or accuracy, to
Warrant the statement of any such law as that above mentioned, but
they were of quite su<U+FB02>icient interest to induce us to take up the
Subject   once more, using a larger number             of substances and more
 accurate  methods.

1891.]       JIeat produced by compressing Liquids and Solids.
             Description of Apparatus and Experimental          Methods.
    The compression        apparatus    used in    all   these  various    series of
experiments was one originally constructed for testing               the eifect of
pressure on thermometers;           Its construction is shown in <U+FB01>g. 1. The
cylinder, called “the gun,” is of wrought iron, about 16 inches
long and 4 inches diameter, with a bore of 1 inch.                       It is <U+FB01>xed
vertically,    and  the  lower   end  is  <U+FB02>anged    and   closed  by a   very thick
<U+FB02>ange plate, bolted upon soft leather washers, and drilled to admit
water from the pump.            The pump-barrel consists of a steel ingot,
1%"   x 6", drilled with   a hole} inch diameter; in this works a plunger,
with a steel cup at the lower end, through a stuf<U+FB01>ng-box and cup
leather.      The stroke of the pump is about 2% inches, and it is moved
by a handle nearly 3 feet long, with a leverage of about 10 to 1.
The upper end of the gun is closed by a solid plunger, turned to <U+FB01>t
very accurately, and rendered water-tight by means of a steel cup,
turned to a very thin, knife-like edge, slightly belled out, so as to
press against the sides of the gun.           When pressure comes upon the
cup,   the   sides expand suf<U+FB01>ciently      to  form an almost perfectly tight
joint.    The plunger is held in position by a key <U+FB01>tting into a hole cut
through the sides of the gun and through the plunger or ram. The
cup is <U+FB01>lled with tallow or lard to' avoid leaving an air space inside
the gun.        The connexion to the pump is formed by a solid-drawn
copper     tube  with a steel connecting piece, which is screwed upon a
washer of soft copper.
    For measuring the pressure, a compression gauge, designed by Pro
fessor Tait, and used by him in his         experiments     on the “ Challenger ”
thermometers,       was employed.       It is represented in <U+FB01>g; 2. Essen
 tially it consists of a steel tube, about 5 inches long, % inch in
 diameter, and {6 inch thick, <U+FB01>lled with mercury, and bearing a glass
 capillary, A. This tube is enclosed in a steel vessel communicating
 with the      pump by a solid-drawn copper tube.                The pressure is
 measured      by the rise of the mercury in the- tube A. The gauge in
 the <U+FB01>rst instance was graduated by means of air manometers, and was
 afterwards compared with an Amagat mercury gauge. Its indications
 have been found extremely constant.               The long bulb contains an
 inner bulb, which nearly      <U+FB01>lls  up  the  whole space, leaving only a thin
 shell  of mercury, which is very little affected by temperature.                This
 gauge   marked    2235   mm.   per ton   pressure.    The   amount   is  small,  and
 the reading cannot be said to be very accurate, but no other gauge
  could be obtained equally trustworthy and which required so very
  small a bulk of water—a matter of great importance, as will be per
  ceived on referring to the description            of the experiments given
  below.
     The wires of the thermo-electric      junction    are introduced    by placing

them between two broad washers of thick soft leather, and screwing
these as tightly as possible between the <U+FB02>anges at the lower end of
the gun.    The leathers were prepared by soaking in warm lard in
came, as recommended by Professor Andrews. The arrangement was
found to hold pressure extremely well, if the bolts were tightened up
each day before beginning the experiments.           As it was necessary that
many of the liquids used should be completely protected from water,
we were obliged to choose wires .for the junction which could be sealed
through glass. After experiments with a large number of di<U+FB01>erent
pairs of metals, beginning with pure platinum and going up to 33 per
cent. of iridium, spehimens of commercial platinum and an alloy of
platinum with 10 per cent. of iridium were selected. Strange to say.
nearly the same current was obtained from a junction of two different
samples of 10 per cent. iridium.
   The platinum wire was of about No. 24 B.W.G., the alloy wire of
O"'029 diameter.     The latter resembled steel in its properties, being
very hard and elastic. Its thickness was a disadvantage, because it
increased the mass of the junction and caused a sensible time to elapse
before the wires attained the temperature of the liquid during the
experiments.     The wires were welded to form the junction and
hammered thin and <U+FB02>at in order that the contact with the substance
under trial might be as perfect as possible.       A length of about 3 feet
of the double wires was coiled into a spiral spring inside the gun, so
that the junction end could be drawn out at the top either for

1891.]     Heat produced by compressing Liquids and Solids.             135
graduation or to allow the substance to be changed.         The wires were
insulated by drawing them through line india-rubber tubing of the
kind known as vein tubing.        This arrangement proved very objection—
able  in practice, as the oil and grease o<U+FB01>f the inside of the gun attacked
the rubber and ultimately perforated it, permitting contact with the
metal sides of the gun.                                             _
    Naturally, after this occurred, the results became perfectly irregular
and worthless, and the whole apparatus had to be taken to pieces in
order to renew the insulation. This was done by stripping off the
bad pieces of india-rubber and then covering the whole length of each
wire with a double thickness of narrow silk ribbon wound on and
whipped over with thread.        After the renewal of the insulation there
was not a single defective result, and the readings vary within re
markably narrow limits, as will be seen by reference to the tables.
The outer or cold junction of the thermo-electric       apparatus was im
mersed in a large wooden tub of cold water, the temperature of which
changed but little from day to day, and might be regarded as perfectly
uniform during the performance of any experiments.
    The apparatus for containing the liquids which were subjected to
compression is represented in <U+FB01>g. 3. The wires of the junction are
                           FIG. 3.—Section of Tube.
<U+FB01>xed   into a hollow glass stopper, B, which was ground to <U+FB01>t the tube
 C.   This tube carried a slight <U+FB02>ange at D, to which a disc of soft
 black rubber could be tightly wired.       This rubber disc served to close
 the end of the   tube and   at the same  time  allowed perfectly free com
 munication of pressure from the outside to the inside of the apparatus.
 A loop of thick copper wire was twisted round the neck of the tube
 to furnish a handle by which it could be drawn out of the gun.           1n

136             Prof. C. 1. Burton and Mr. W. Marshall.       [June   18,
order    to prevent liquids like chloroform or bisulphide of carbon
coming in contact with the india-rubber, the tube was <U+FB01>lled up to
the neck F with clean dry mercury.      Twelve tubes were provided, all
of which <U+FB01>tted to the same stopper, in order to prevent loss of time
in changing substances. The mercury was poured away and a fresh
rubber cap wired on for each experiment.
    The galvanometer used was of the dead-heat pattern, by White, of
Glasgow, of 642 turns and 1'242 ohms resistance.       It was placed on
a slate shelf about 20 feet distant from the compression apparatus,
and it was not at all affected by the movements of the pump handle
or by any other part of the mechanism.       The scale of the galvano
meter was graduated in arbitrary divisions of nearly 2 cm. in length,
these being divided into tenths; these small divisions could again be
read to quarters.     As one large division on the scale corresponded
very nearly to 1 degree centigrade, the temperature readings are
very accurate.    In order to have all substances as nearly as possible
at the same temperature, a large covered vessel was sunk in the
water-tub which contained also the cold junctions, and in this vessel
the bottles of substances were placed the day before, along with mer
cury and clean tubes ready for use.       The suction tube of the pump
also drew its supply from the same source.
    After the gun had been <U+FB01>lled with water taken from the tub, a tube
tilled with clean mercury to the neck E,and with the substance to be
compressed up to C, was then brought up to the stopper and well
pressed home, care being taken that no air bubble should be left in
inserting the stopper. The wires were arranged on opposite sides of
the tube, which was then pressed down on the spiral spring formed
by the-coiled wire inside the gun, and the ram inserted.        The dis
charge valve at <U+FB01>g. 1 was opened, the ram pressed home and secured
 by its key.   Pressure was usually applied and blown off two or three
 times to prove that everything was in good condition.       As little or
 no air space was left in any part of the apparatus, the pressure rose
 very rapidly, two strokes of the pump usually su<U+FB02>icing.
     “Then the galvanometer was steady, its zero point was noted and
 pressure immediately applied, an operation which took about two
seconds.     As the apparatus could never be made perfectly tight, it,
 was always necessary to continue pumping slowly, watching the
 gauge so as to maintain the pressure as nearly as possible constant till
 the galvanometer became steady, when the reading was taken and
 pressure immediately relaxed.
    As soon as the galvanometer was again steady a new zero was
 taken, pressure applied again, and so on, usually ten times.      If the
 results appeared to agree satisfactorily the ram was removed from
 the gun, and the tube drawn up and carefully examined to see that
 no leakage    had taken place.   It was then set aside, a clean tube

taken, and the cycle of operations repeated.                    In this way three to
four substances per hour could be <U+FB01>nished, from ten to <U+FB01>fteen ob
servations being taken for each.             The limits of accuracy are found in
the measurement of pressure, which cannot be said to be quite satis
factory, and in the impossibility of maintaining the pressure perfectly
constant till the galvanometer can be read.                   The error due to the
last-named cause is less than might be expected, because the pressure
varies rapidly about the point at which it should be maintained, and
the galvanometer         does not follow the small          and quick rises and falls
of pressure.        In comparing      the results among themselves the actual
amount of pressure is not of so great importance as the fact that, as
nearly as the gauge would read, it was the same in every case, viz.,
                                                                                        '

     When the individual <U+FB01>gures vary so little among themselves it will
 easily be seen that the average of ten such observations must differ
 extremely little from the truth.                7              _
     At the end of each day’s work the junction was graduated to
 ascertain what de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer corresponded to a degree
 centigrade.          The graduation was performed                    in the following
 manner :——The junction was drawn out of the gun and dipped in a
 beaker of cold water from the tub to <U+FB01>nd its zero.                      As soon as the
 galvanometer had been read the junction was transferred to a beaker
 of warm water which was kept rapidly moving by means of a stream
 of air, and the temperature         and the galvanometer were read as nearly
  as  possible at the same      moment;      the junction was then again placed

in cold water to give a zero and re-transferred to warm water at a
different temperature.                     Care was taken that the greatest temperature
di<U+FB01>erence between the cold and hot water should cause a de<U+FB02>ection
slightly in excess of the largest caused by compression.                             The average
of four or <U+FB01>ve such observations is taken as the de<U+FB02>ection correspond
ing to 1° C. The same thermometer was used throughout for all
these temperature readings.                           It was a “ <U+FB01>xed zero " by Hicks,
graduated in 0°‘l C., and could be read accurately to 0°‘Ol.
   To secure the greatest possible uniformity of conditions in all these
experiments, every preparation was completed and all substances
collected before a single compression was made. The whole of the
<U+FB01>nal observations were thus compressed into a few days, and it was
possible to maintain every part of the apparatus practically unchanged
during that time.

crystallising of the substance.      The crystals melted rapidly at the
temperature     of the room.
   Monochlorethane.—-The whole apparatus was cooled to 0° C. for this
series of observations.
                                                                   ” of
   Propyl Bromide and Isobutyl Bromide—A slight “kick                   the
galvanometer image in the opposite direction to that indicating a rise
of temperature was observed on the <U+FB01>rst stroke of the pump.
   Iodides.—The free iodine was extracted by shaking with mercury.
   Carbon Disulphide.-—The       temperature rose slowly to within a
degree   of   maximum;     then  there was a sudden rise to maximum,
succeeded by a rapid fall.
   Looking merely at the rise of- temperature produced by pressure,
it is impossible to deduce any general laws from these <U+FB01>gures.          \Ve
<U+FB01>nd that, as a rule, in comparable series, the higher the molecular
weight, the less the rise of temperature.         This is best seen in the
cases of the series of acetates and the halogen substances; but there
are several perfectly distinct exceptions—such as the fatty acids—
which come in the inverse order to that stated.           It is worthy of
note that these exceptional series all contain large proportions of
oxygen.
   We would draw special attention to the e<U+FB01>ect of pressure on par
aldehyde and tertiary butyl alcohol, both of which are caused to
solidify at temperatures above their normal melting point. We think
it probable that all substances which follow the ordinary law of ex
pansion by heat could be solidi<U+FB01>ed by pressure if tried at tempera
tures not far from their melting point.          The apparatus which we
used serves extremely well for observing the course of events in such
cases.
   When    a liquid which   does not solidify is compressed, the image on
the galvanometer scale travels almost steadily and rapidly to a point
at which it remains <U+FB01>xed for a few seconds; it then begins to move
back towards zero, as the substance is cooled by the water outside
the compression tube. In the two cases mentioned above (paralde
liyde and tertiary butyl alcohol) the behaviour of the galvanometer
was entirely different, indicating a rapid rise of temperature on
application of the pressure, and then a continuous slow increase as
long as the pressure was maintained          constant.    The method of
010sing the gun by means of a ram renders it easy to remove and
inspect a substance within half a minute after letting off the pressure,
so  that there is not time for the crystals to melt.
                          Experiments with Solids.
   A number of specimens of metals were prepared and tested, with

1891.]      Heat produced        by compressing   Liquids and Solids.   141
ingots were prepared and <U+FB01>led <U+FB02>at on one face, so that they could be
tied one on each side of the <U+FB02>at junction, which was used without
any tube.   It is di<U+FB02>icult in this way to secure at all a satisfactory
contact between the sample and junction, and we are of opinion that
the method  originally used as described in the beginning of the paper
will prove more trustworthy. The rise of temperature in metals is
so small that, to obtain a readable de<U+FB02>ection, it would be necessary to
use a more sensitive junction than can be made of platinum-iridium
                                                                                  '
alloys, as the galvanometer cannot be made much more sensitive
without becoming too slow to permit of true readings.   Considerable
care was taken to secure specimens of metals in a state of approxim
ate purity, but, the results having proved of so little value, the
methods used need not be here described.

  Several other metals were tried, but the de<U+FB02>ection was too slight
to allow of accurate observation.
  Notwithstanding the large amount of work involved in these ex
periments, study of the results shows but too clearly that this research
can only be regarded as preliminary.       Many interesting problems
present themselves for solution, of which we think the following are
worthy of mention :—                 _
   1. The e<U+FB01>ect of pressure in causing solidi<U+FB01>cation should       be fol
lowed np and tested with different substances at temperatures little
removed from their melting point.       In the case of tertiary butyl         -
alcohol it may be noted that, though the crystals formed were too
small to be' clearly distinguished, they appeared to be of a di<U+FB01>erent
habit from those formed under ordinary circumstances.
      The effect of temperature in causing differences in the amount

of heat developed.    It might be necessary to compare the substances
at different temperatures so as to have them all in the same physical
state.
      The relation of compressibility to heat of “compression.

   This    but an indication of the few out of the many lines of
           is
research suggested by the work we have done.       Some of these seem
to anrd good hope of yielding new knowledge of the constitution of

      tion by Electrical Excitation of the Floor of the 4th Ven
      tricle."    By W. G. SPENOER, M.S., AssistaMSurgeon to
      the Westminster Hospital. Communicated by Professor
      HORSLEY, F.R.S.         Received June 15, 1891.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The object of the research was to connect more closely clinical
signs with pathological changes in the medulla by localising in the
                                    “ centres ” which in<U+FB02>uence the circula
<U+FB02>oor of the 4th ventricle the
tion and respirition.
   The author commences his paper with a full account of the work
of previous observers upon the medulla in relation to the circulation
and respiration.
   The research differs from preceding ones in the use of the electric
current to excite without injury the <U+FB02>oor of the ventricle, in avoiding
puncture     and incision of the medulla, in employing                complete
anaesthesia   with ether  without    at the same  time   impeding respiration.
   The <U+FB02>oor of the 4th ventricle was accurately             measured in each
experiment,    so that the distance      from   the  calamus   seriptorius and
from the middle     line of  each  point  was   known   before  it was excited.
The experiments were performed on cats, dogs, and monkeys, the
records of the changes which took place being divided into those
affecting respiration, the rate of the heart, and the blood-pressure
respectively.
   By adding together the results obtained for each point in all the
experiments on animals of the same species, conclusions have been
arrived at for each species, and a comparison is then made of the
three species of animals.
   The conclusions drawn from the experiments, aided by the facts
detailed in the historical retrospect, are as follows :—
   (l.)   Implmtion.——The part of the <U+FB02>oor of the 4th ventricle which,
         when excited. caused an increase in the normal inspiratory
         impulses descending to the thorax lies along the middle line,
         extending for 2 mm. on either side.
   (2.) Expiration.—The part of the <U+FB02>oor of the 41th ventricle which,
         when excited, caused an increase in the normal expiratory
         impulses descending to the thorax lies along the lateral part
         of the ventricle, 2 to 3 mm. from the middle line.

    (3.)    Slowing of the Respiratory Rhythm—The area which, when
          excited, caused slowing of the respiratory rhythm lies over
          the continuation of the postero-median column, as it separates
          from the column of the opposite side, and the part of the <U+FB02>oor
          of the ventricle close to the inner border of the column.        The
          central point of this small area lies between 1 and 2 mm. from
          the calamus, and between 2 and 3 mm. from the middle line.
    (lardio-inhibition.--Whilst cardio-inhibition may be produced all
over the      <U+FB02>oor of the 4th ventricle, as well as just behind the calamus,
yet   it is  best  marked both in the frequency of occurrence and in the
amount of slowing over the posterior third'of the 4th ventricle, and
over the inner margin of the continuation forwards of the postero
median column.
   Blood-pressure.      (1) Fall—The chief depressor area is in the binder
part   of  the  <U+FB02>oor,  between   1 and 4! mm. in front of the calamus.
    (2) Rise (cat only).—A rise was produced most frequently and
most largely from 4 mm. from the calamus forwards to the anterior
end of the ventricle.
   These conclusions          are exhibited graphically by maps of the
ventricle, shaded       in various degrees to indicate the intensity of the
result;     and a number of tracings are appended as illustrations of the
actual    changes which were produced by excitation.             I

of   this research, as well as of the previous one on “Intracranial
Pressure,”       which forms the subject of a paper in this year’s      ‘Phil.

         By EDW. SCHUNCK, F.R.S. Received June 16, 1891.
                                     ( Abstract.)
    This paper      is a continuation      of the previous  ones on the same
 subject.      After describing the action of caustic alkali in     a state of
 fusion on phyllocyanin and the products thereby formed, the author
 proceeds to give an account of phylloxanthin, the substance formed
 along with phyllocyanin by the action of acids on chlorophyll.           This
 is followed by a description         of the change which chlorophyll under
 goes by the action of alkalis, and of the chief product thereby formed,
 which the author names alkachlorophyll.

                 Year   ending December 31, 1890.
        MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL              OBSERVATIONS,
Made at the Kew Observatory, Richmond, Lat. 51° 28' -6”
    N. and Long. 0)1 1111 155'1 W., height 34 feet above mean
    sea-level, for the year 1890.
   The results given in the following tables are deduced from the
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of de<U+FB02>ection and vibration.      These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. 1. and the Declinometer Magnets marked NE. and
KC.   90 in'the 9-inch Uni<U+FB01>lar Magnetometer by Jones.
  The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
N0. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3% inches in length.
  The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VI are pre
pared in accordance with the suggestions made in the <U+FB01>fth report of
the Committee of the British Association on comparing and reducing
Magnetic Observations.
  The following is a list of the days during the year 1890 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination Of the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
employed   in the preparation of the magnetic tables.

1.
    “ The Thermal Emissivity of Thin Wires in Air.” By W. E.
   Ava'ron, F.R.S., and H. KILGOUR. Received July 2, 1891.
                                (Abstract.)
   In 1884  it was observed experimentally      that whereas the electric
current required to maintain a thick wire of given material, under
given conditions, at a given temperature was approximately pro
portional to the diameter of the wire raised to the power three halves,
the current was more nearly proportional to the <U+FB01>rst power of the
diameter if the Wire were thin. When this di<U+FB01>erence in the behaviour
of a thick and thin wire was <U+FB01>rst noticed it was regarded as being
quite unexpected.     But, as pointed out by one of us in the course of
a discussion at a meeting of the Royal Society, the unexpected charac
ter of the result was due to people having assumed that the loss of
heat from radiation and convection per square centimetre of surface
per 1° excess temperature was a constant, and independent of the size
and shape of the cooling body.
   The very valuable investigations that have been made on emissivity
by Mr. Macfarlane, Professor Tait, Mr. Crookes, Mr. J. T. Bottomley,
and by Mr. Schleiermacher had for their object the determination of
the variation of the emissivity with changes of the surface and with
change in the density of the gas surrounding the cooling body, but it
was not part of these investigations to determine the change in the

emissivity that is produced by change in the shape and size of the
cooling body.     Indeed, so little has been the attention devoted to the
very large change that can be brought about in the value of the
emissivity by simply changing the dimensions Of the cooling body,
that in Professor Everett’s very valuable book of Units and Physical
Constants the absolute results Obtained by Mr. Macfarlane are given
         “
as the results of experiments on the loss of heat from blackened and
polished copper in air at atmospheric pressure,” and no reference is
made either to the shape or to the size of the cooling body.

Society, a new edition of this book has appeared, and, in consequence

    “According to Professor Ayrton, who quotes a table in ‘Box on
Heat,’ the coef<U+FB01>cient of emission increases as the size of the emitting
body diminishes, and for a. blackened sphere of radius r em. may be
stated as

    The laws which govern the loss of heat from thin cylindrical con
ductors have not only considerable scienti<U+FB01>c interest in showing how
the shape of a body aifects the convection currents, but they are of
especial importance to the electrical engineer in connexion with glow
lamps, hot-wire voltmeters, fuses, &c.           We, therefore, thought it
desirable to ascertain the way in which the law of cooling for thick
wires, which involved the diameter raised to the power three halves,
 passed into the law for the cooling Of thin wires, involving only the
 <U+FB01>rst power of the diameter. For this object, the investigation described
 in the paper was commenced at the beginning of 1888, and the
 emissivity was measured of nine platinum wires, having the diameters
 0f1'2, 2‘0, 2'9, 4'0, 6'0, 8'1, 9'3, 11'1, and 14 mils, or thousandths of
 an inch.
    Suspecting that some of the published results concerning the currents
required to fuse wires had been much in<U+FB02>uenced by the cooling action
of the blocks to which the ends Of the wires were attached, we started
by   making a calculation of the length necessary to give to our Wires,
 so  that the loss of heat by conduction should not introduce any im
portant error into the determination of the emissivity.        To do this it
 was necessary to calculate the distribution of temperature along a
                                                                  N 2

wire through which      a steady current was <U+FB02>owing and from which heat
was lost by   radiation,  convection, and conduction, and it was further
necessary to improve on the calculation one of us had published on
this subject in the ‘ Electrician ’ for 1879, by taking into account the
fact that the emissivity, as well as the thermal and electric conducting
power, of the wire differed at di<U+FB01>ereut points in consequence of the
diiference of temperature.
    Until we had completed the experiments described in this paper
we could, of course, only employ in this calculation values that we
had guessed at as being something near the truth for the emissivity
of platinum wire for diiferent diameters and at different temperatures.
Hence, after the completion of the experiments, we took up the
mathematical investigation again, substituting for the emissivity such
a   function of the diameter of the wire and the temperature of the
 point as we had experimentally found it to be. Section IV of the
paper contains the investigation by which we <U+FB01>nally arrived at the
 calculated distribution of temperature along the wire, and we have to
 express our sincere thanks to Professor Henrici (whom we consulted
 as to the best method of practically solving the rather complex
 diiferential equation arrived at) for the warm interest that he has
 taken in the mathematical treatment of the subject, and for the many
 suggestions which he has made, and which have enabled us to arrive
 at themathematical solution given in the paper.
     Each wire to be tested was stretched along the axis of a water
 jacketed cylinder 325 cm. long, the inner surface of which was
 blackened and kept at a constant temperature by a stream of water
 <U+FB02>owing through the jacket.        The rate at which heat was lost by any
 one of the wires was measured by the product of the current passing
 through it into the RD. (potential difference) maintained between its
 ends, while the ratio of the RD. to the current gave the resistance of
 the wire and, therefore, its temperature.       Experiments were in this
 way made with various currents <U+FB02>owing through each of the nine
                                               ‘
 wires.
    As the variation of resistance with temperature is known to vary
 with different specimens of platinum, experiments were separately
 made to determine the actual law of variation of resistance with
 temperature up to 300° C. for each piece of wire that had been
 employed in the emissivity experiments.
    In this later determination various thermometers were used, and
 the subsequent comparison of these thermometers with a Kew standard
 thermometer involved a vast amount of labour, from the fact that ii
 is, or at any rate was not possible three years ago, to purchase from
 the Kew Observatory a standard thermometer reading from, say, 200‘
 to 300° C., with a short, wide chamber at the base in which the
 mercury expanded below 200° C. All that could be obtained was a

  1891.]          The Thermal Emissivity       of Thin Wires in Air.         169
  long thermometer which had been carefully tested between 0° and
  100° 0., and the remainder of whose tube had been simply calibrated
  for uniformity of bore. The consequence was that when we desired
  to compare one of our thermometers reading, say, from 200° to 300° C.,'
  with the Kew standard, their bulbs were very far apart when both
  were immersed in the oil-bath, and with the tops of the mercury
  columns just above the surface of the oil.              A short description is
  given     in  the paper  of the  devices  employed  to overcome this dif<U+FB01>culty
. and which enable an accurate comparison to be made between the
  thermometers.
      On examining the curves accompanying the complete paper which
  show the emissivity for each temperature for each of the nine wires,
  we see     that :—
      1.  For any given temperature the emissivity is the higher the <U+FB01>ner
  the    wire.
      2.   For each wire the emissivity increases with the temperature,
  and the rate of increase is the greater the <U+FB01>ner the wire.            For the
  <U+FB01>nest     wire the rate of increase of emissivity with temperature is very
  striking.
      3.  Hence the effect of surface on the total loss of heat (by radiation

  when at 300° C. with that from the wire of 6 mils diameter when at

   number of calories (gramme C.°) lost per second per square centimetre
   of surface per 1° C. excess temperature of the 1‘2-mil wire at 300° C.,
   is 60 times as great as that of the 6-mil wire at 15°, the latter varying
   very rapidly with the temperature near 15° C.

   The emissivities          have been calculated in calories lost per second
per square centimetre         per 1° C. excess temperature, in order that they
may be compared with the emissivities obtained by other experi
menters, but we prefer to speak of the diameters of the wires in mils,
since a wire of 1 mil is about the <U+FB01>nest that is drawn commercially.
Hence the statement that the diameters of wires are 1, 2, or 3 mils is
more suggestive to an engineer than saying that they are 00254,
00508, or 0'0 762 millimetres.
   The statement, not unfrequently made, that the current required to
maintain a wire of a given material at a given temperature above
that of the surrounding envelope is proportional to the diameter of
the wire raised to the power three halves, is equivalent to stating
that the emissivity is independent of the diameter.              Now from the
three formulae        (1), (2), (3), given above for  e, we may conclude—
   That for      a temperature     of 100° C. the value of d in the formula
                           6  = 00010360   +0'012O776'Jt—l
must be something like 220 mils, or 5'6 mm., in order that the neglect
of the second-term may not make an error in e of more than 5 per
cent., and something like 1'15 inch, or 293 mm., if the error is not
to exceed 1 per cent. ;
   That for a. temperature of 200° C. the value of d in the formula
                           0  = 00011113 +0'0143028d‘1
must be something          like 244 mils, or 6'2 mm., in order that the neglect
of the second term may not make an error in e of more than 5 per
cent., and something like 1'28 inches, or 325 mm. if the error is not
to exceed 1 per cent. ;
   And that for a temperature of 300° C. the value of d in the
formula
                           9  = 00011353 +0'016084d"
must be       something like 267 mils, or 68 mm., in order that the
neglect    of  the second term may not make an error in e of more than
5 per cent., and something like 1'39 inches, or 353 mm., if the error
is not to exceed 1 per cent.
   Generally, then, we may conclude that to assume that the emissivity
is a constant for wires whose diameters vary from a small value up to
1 inch is to make a large error          in the ease of the greater number of

 them.
    Using the formula (3) which we have arrived at for determining
 the emissivity of platinum wires of di<U+FB01>erent diameters at 300° C., it
 follows that to maintain a platinum wire 075 mil in diameter at
 300° C.    would require a current density of 331,000 amperes per
 square    inch,  and, if the emissivity of a copper wire of the same
 diameter and at the same temperature may be taken as being the
 same, it follows that to maintain a copper wire 075 mil in diameter
 at 300°C. would require       a current density of 790,000     amperes per
 square inch.

    This paper is in continuation of the author’s preliminary note “On
 a Method of determining the Value of Rapid Variations of a Di<U+FB02>‘er
 ence of Potential by means of the Capillary Electrometer,” and
 describes a further simpli<U+FB01>cation of the method then brought forward,
 consequent on a change in the mode of producing the photographic
 record of an excursion.
    The rapidity of the movement of the meniscus was found to be
 affected by (1) the degree of concentration of the acid, (2) the length
 of the capillary beyond the end of the mercury column,            the shape
 of the tube where it tapers to form    the  capillary, (4) the shape of the
 ori<U+FB01>ce. -These things might be taken as indicating the action of both
 mechanical friction and electrical resistance in determining the rate
 of movement. As was announced in the preliminary note, under
 ordinary circumstances the instrument is perfectly dead-beat; the
 meniscus commences to move the instant a di<U+FB01>erence of potential is
communicated to the instrument, and stops directly it is withdrawn.
The conditions under which overshooting may occur, and the possible
extent of it, are discussed.      It was found that, in general, the time
relations of the movement might be expressed by the equation

    Change of Resistance.—The shorter the length of dilute acid, the

ance of an electrometer may be written
                                 R = r(L+l),
where    l = the length of the capillary beyond         the meniscus at any
moment,      and   L =  a constant   many times larger than l, and repre
senting the sum total of the mechanical and the remaining electrical
resistances.      The effect of the change of resistance is so much smaller
that it may be completely masked and neutralised by the calibration

    In order to bring out the details of the electrical phenomena of
 muscle,   it was necessary to make the plates move faster than was
 possible   with the apparatus hitherto employed. To do this they were
 attached to a    kind Of balanced pendulum and caused to describe an
 arc of a circle.    With this arrangement the normal excursion is best
 expressed in polar coordinates.         Time being recorded on a circular
 arc, t becomes 6.       Instead of the rectilinear asymptote there is an
 asymptotic circle of radius = R. The expression for the radius vector
 is r = Rig, the equation connecting y and 0 being y = tie-09.            With
 such a curve the method of analysis <U+FB01>rst put forward is no longer
 applicable.     In place of it however there is a still simpler one. The
 equation to the polar sub-normal, rcoty» = dr/dG, is in this case
 independent      Of R, being simply cy.      In other words, the polar sub

III. “On              the Collision of Elastic Bodies.” By S. H. BURBURY,
                          F .R.S. Received October 24, 1891.
                                       (Abstract)
     In this paper I discuss, <U+FB01>rstly, a case suggested by Sir W.
    1.
Thomson on June 11 as a test of the truth of the Maxwell-Boltzmann
doctrine concerning the distribution of energy.   Sir W. Thomson
supposes a number of hollow elastic spheres, each                 containing       a smaller
sphere  free to move within it. This pair he calls a doublet.
   If V  be the velocity of the centre of inertia of a doublet, R the
relative velocity of the two spheres, then, under the distribution in
question, for given direction of R, all directions of V are equally prob
able, and the 'converse is also true.                  If a
                                             collision occurs, the change                           -
of direction of R  due to it is independent of the direction of V, as well
as of the magnitudes of V and R.       Therefore, after collisions, as well
as before, for given direction of R all directions      of V are equally
probable. Whence it follows that the distribution of velocities is
unaffected by collisions.    This aPpears to me to be sound as well for
internal as for external collisions.
   2. The characteristic of collisions of conventional    elastic bodies is
the discontinuous   change in the velocities without alteration of the
kinetic energy. If that occurs for any material system of n degrees of
freedom, there are n—l independent linear functions of the velocities
          which remain unaltered, call them S, . . . . Sn_,, and one, R,
v, . . . . 12,.
which is unaltered in magnitude but reversed in sign.
   3. The kinetic energy cannot contain any of the products RS, but
must be of the form 2E = XR’+f(S1 . . . . SL1), where f(S; . . . . Sn_1)
is a quadratic function of these quantities.
   4. If after collision the velocities 12'1" . .v'n were all reversed in
sign, R and S1 . . . . S,_, would be reversed in sign.        The system
would retrace its course, undergoing      collision, changing      into n.      '0'
R  would be positive before and negative after collision.        .   Sn_1     S,.     .

would be throughout negative, i.e,, of opposite signs to the signs they
had in the <U+FB01>rst case.
    5.To de<U+FB01>ne a collision, we assume that a certain function      of the          it
coordinates and constants cannot become positive, and when           =                  31,    0,

systems, having coordinates p, . . . p, for the one, and 10,“ . . . .'p,,

                                    Introduction.
   In a paper “ On the c- and p-Discriminants of Ordinary Integrable
 Differential Equations of the First Order,” published in vol. 19 of
the ‘Proceedings        of the London Mathematical Society,’ the factors
which occur in the c-discriminant              of an equation of the form
f(z,   y, c) = 0, where      f(:c, y, c) is a rational integral function of
x, y, c, are determined       analytically.
   It  is shown’Ill  that  if E =  0 be the equation of the envelope locus of
the curves     f (m, y, c) = 0;     if N = 0 be the equation of their node
locus; if C = 0 be the equation of their cusp locus; then the factors
of the discriminant are E, N2, C”.
   The singularities considered are those whose forms depend on the
terms of the second degree Only, when the origin of coordinates is at
the singular point.
   The object of this paper is to extend these results to surfaces.
   It is well known that if the equation of a system of surfaces con
tain arbitrary parameters, and if a locus of ultimate intersections
exist, then there cannot be more than two independent parameters.
   Hence the investigation falls naturally into two parts: the <U+FB01>rst is
the case where there is only one independent parameter, and the
second is the case where there are two.
    The investigation given in this paper is limited to the case in
which the equation is rational and integral both              as  regards   the
coordinates and the parameters.
                                       PART  I.
The Equation of the Surfaces is a Rational Integral Function of the
                    Coordinates and one Arbitrary Parameter.
   In the dase in which there is only one arbitrary parameter each
 surface of the system intersects the consecutive surface in a curve
   "  The theorem was originally given by Professor Cayley, in the ‘Messeuger of
Mathemtics,’ vol. 2, 1872, pp. 6—12.

  1891.]          Ultimate Intersections  of a System of Smfaces.          181
  whose equations are the equation of the surface and the equation
 obtained by di<U+FB01>erentiating it with regard to the parameter.             These
 equations will be called the fundamental equations in this part. Hence
 each surface touches the envelope along a curve, which is called a
 characteristic.        It is known that the equation of the envelope may
 be obtained         by eliminating the parameter from the fundamental
equations and equating afactor of the result to zero. But it frequently
happens that there are other factors of the result (or discriminant as
it will in future be called) which when equated to zero do not give
the equation of the envelope.
    Following out the same line of argument as that used in reference
toa system of plane curves, it will be shown that these factors are
connected with loci of singular points.           Now if each surface have
one singular point, then its coordinates may in general be expressed
as functions of the parameter            of the surface to which it belongs.
Hence the locus of all the singular points of the surfaces of the
system is a curve.           Its equations, therefore, cannot be found by
equating a factor of the discriminant to zero.            But if each surface
of the system have. upon it a nodal line, then the locus of the nodal
lines of all the surfaces is a surface, and it will be shown that its
equation may be found by equating to zero a factor of the discrimi
nant.
    The singular points in space, the form of which depends only on
the terms of the second order, when the origin of coordinates is
taken at the singular point, are :
    (i.) The conic node, where all the tangent lines to the surface lie
on a cone of the second order.
             The biplanar node or binode. This is the particular case of
the preceding, in which the tangent cone to the surface breaks up
into two non-coincident planes.          These planes are called the biplanes,
and     their intersection is called the edge of the binode.
     (iii.) The uniplanar node or unode. This is the particular case of
 the conic node, in which the tangent cone breaks up into two co
incident planes.          The plane with which these planes coincide is
called the uniplane.
    It    is shown     that   a surface cannot have upon it a curve at
 every point of which there is a conic node.            Hence there are two
 varieties of nodal lines to be considered; the <U+FB01>rst, being such that
 every point is a binode, may be called a binodal line; and the second,
 being such      that every point on it is a unode, may be called a unodal
 line.
   .It will    be   proved that if E = 0 be the equation of the envelope
  locus, B = O the equation of the locus of binodal lines, U = O the
 equation of the locus of unodal lines, then the factors of the discrimi
  nant are in general E, B’, U“.

    This is the general theorem, but it is assumed in the course of the
investigation, when the discriminant is being formed, that the fun
damental equations are satis<U+FB01>ed by only one value of the parameter at
each point on the envelope locus or on a locus of binodal or unodal
lines.
   The investigation is accordingly carried a step further, and it is
shown that if the fundamental equations are satis<U+FB01>ed by two equal
values of the parameter at points on an envelope locus, or on a
locus of binodal or unodal lines, the factors of the discriminant are
E’, B", U‘.
   The geometrical meaning of the condition that the fundamental
equations are satis<U+FB01>ed by two equal values of the parameter in the case
of the envelope is that the line of contact of the envelope with each
surface of the system counts three times over as a curve of intersec
tion, instead of twice as in the ordinary case, or that two consecutive
characteristics coincide.             The meaning of the condition in the case
of the loci of singular lines is that each of these loci is also an
envelope.

mate intersections is found by eliminating the parameters between
this equation and the two equations obtained by differentiating it
with regard to the parameters.         These equations will in this part of
the investigation he called the fundamental equations.
    In general the locus of ultimate intersections is a surface, for the
coordinates of each point on it can be expressed as functions of the
two arbitrary parameters.        The exceptional cases in which it is not
a surface are enumerated at the end of the paper.           These include the
case where the equation of the system of surfaces is of the <U+FB01>rst degree
in the parameters.      Hence it will be Supposed that the degree of the
equation of the system of surfaces in the parameters is above the
<U+FB01>rst.
    In general also the locus of ultimate intersections possesses the
envelope property, and the equation of the envelope is determined by
equating the discriminant, or a factor of it, to zero.
    If factors of the discriminant exist which, when equated to zero,
give surfaces not possessing the envelope property, then, as in Part I,
it is shown that these surfaces are connected with loci of singular
points.
    Now the locus of singular points of a system of surfaces whose
equation contains two arbitrary parameters is in general a curve
(not a surface), whose equations can be obtained by eliminating the
two parameters from the equation of the system of surfaces and the
three equations obtained by differentiating it with regard to the
coordinates.     Hence its equations cannot be determined by equating
to zero a factor of the discriminant.
    But if every surface of the system have a singular point, then in
 general its coordinates may be expressed as functions of the two
 parameters of the surface to which it belongs.          Hence the locus of
 the singular points is a. surface.      It will be proved that it is a part
 of the locus of ultimate intersections.        Hence its equations can be
 obtained by equating to zero a factor of the discriminant.

              B = O the equation of the biplanar node locus,

    Now at any point on the locus of ultimate intersections—
    (I.) There may   be one system  of  values  of  the parameters      satisfying
 the fundamental   equations.
    In this  case there may be envelope, conic       node, or biplanar node
 loci; and the results are given   in the following table    2—

    The   case (/3) always falls under the next case.
    (IV.) The values of the parameters satisfying the fundamental        equa
tions may become indeterminate.
    If the equation of the system of surfaces be of the second degree
in the parameters, and the analytical condition hold which expresses
that the fundamental equations are satis<U+FB01>ed by two coinciding
systems of values, then this condition requires to be specially inter
preted.      For now the second and third fundamental equations are of
the <U+FB01>rst degree in the parameters, so that if they are satis<U+FB01>ed by ‘two
coinciding systems of values, they must         be indeterminate.
    It is, however, possible      to determine   a single system of values of
the parameters satisfying them.         In this case the three surfaces repre
sented by      the   fundamental    equations intersect in a common curve
(which is <U+FB01>xed for <U+FB01>xed values of the parameters) lying on the locus
of  ultimate intersections; whereas in the previous cases they intersect
in a <U+FB01>nite number of points lying on the locus of ultimate inter
sections.
    The surface       of the system, corresponding to the <U+FB01>xed values of
the parameters, touches the locus of ultimate intersections along the
above-mentioned curve.                                               .
    In general there are two conic nodes of the system at every point of
the locus of ultimate intersections.        The parameters of the surfaces
having the conic nodes are determined by two quadratic equations,
called the parametric quadratics; and in general the roots of each
parametric      quadratic are unequal. If the roots of both parametric
quadratics    are   equal, the two surfaces having conic nodes are replaced
by one surface having a biplanar or uniplanar node.
    If the parameters of one of the surfaces having a conic node become
in<U+FB01>nite, this surface may be considered to disappear, and there is but
one conic node at each point of the locus of ultimate intersections.
    If  the parameters of both surfaces having conic nodes become
 in<U+FB01>nite, both these surfaces may be considered to disappear, and the
 locus of ultimate intersections is an envelope locus (touching each
 surface of the system along a curve).
    If the parameters of both surfaces having conic nodes become
 indeterminate,    then there are at each point an in<U+FB01>nite number of
 biplanar    nodes,    and each surface of the system has a binodal line
 lying on the locus of ultimate intersections.
    The results are given in the following table :—

    It will be noticed that when the equation of the system of surfaces
is of the second degree in the parameters, and the condition holds
which expresses that the fundamental equations are satis<U+FB01>ed by two
coinciding values of the parameters, there is a reduction in the
number of factors of the discriminant corresponding to the singular
point loci, the factors 0“, B4, U“ becoming C’, B“, U‘ respectively.
    The explanation is as follows :—~
    The discriminant is formed by solving the second and third funda
mental equations for the parameters, substituting each pair of values
in the left-hand side of the <U+FB01>rst fundamental equation, multiplying
the results together, and also multiplying by a rationalising factor.
Now in the case where the degree of the equation in the parameters
is the second, there is only one system of roots corresponding                       to
the loci under consideration, whereas there are two when the degree
in the parameters is above the second. Hence this accounts for a
diminution in the number of factors when the degree in the para
meters is the second.
    But this diminution is partly counterbalanced by an increase due
to the fact that the rationalising factor vanishes at every point on
the locus of ultimate intersections, and consequently increases the
number of factors corresponding to the singular point loci.                       The
result of the two causes is what has been stated above.

     The subject of periodic motion and its stability has been treated
with great power by M. Poincaré in a paper, “ Sur le Probleme des
Trois Corps et les Equations de la Dynamique,” for which the prize
of His Majesty the King of Sweden was awarded on the 21st January,
1889.         This paper, which has been published in M ittag-Let<U+FB02>er's ‘ Acta
Mathematica,’ 13, 1 and 2 (270 lto pp.), Stockholm, 1890, only
became known to me recently through                           Professor Cayley.          I am
greatly        interested     to  <U+FB01>nd   in    it   much     that  bears     upon  the   subject

Test Cases for the Maxwell-Boltzmann Doctrine regarding Distribu

“On peut démontrer que dans le voisinage d’une trajectoire fermée
représentant           une solution périodique, ‘soit stable, soit instable, il
passe une in<U+FB01>nité d’autres trajectoires fermées.                       Cela ne su<U+FB01>it pas, en

qu’elle soit, est traversée par une in<U+FB01>nité des trajectoires fermées,

nexion       with Maxwell’s fundamental                  supposition quoted in § 10 of
                  “ that the system, if left to itself in its actual state of motion,

siderable con<U+FB01>dence assert, . . . . except for particular forms of the
surface of the <U+FB01>xed obstacle.”                 It will be seen that Poincaré's “ hypo
thesis, having a high character of probability,” does not go so far as
Maxwell’s, which asserts that every portion of space is traversed in
all directions by every trajectory. The conclusion which I gave in
§ 13, as seeming to me quite                      certain, “that every mode diifers
in<U+FB01>nitely        little  from    being   a  fundamental        mode,” is clearly a neces
sary consequence of Maxwell’s fundamental supposition; the truth
of which still seems to me highly probable, provided exceptional cases
                                                                          >

II. “A      new   Mode     of Respiration       in the Myriapoda.”          By
       F. G.   Smch        (formerly F. G. HEATncorE), M.A., Fellow
       of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.              Received August
       12, 1891.
                                   (Abstract)
   The Scutigeridae respire by means of a series of organs arranged in
the middle dorsal line at the posterior edge of every dorsal scale
except the last.
   Each organ consists of a slit bounded by four curved ridges, two at
the edges of the slit, and two external to the latter.           The slit leads
into an air sac.     From the sac a number of tubes are given o<U+FB01> ; these
tubes are arranged in two semicircular masses.               The ends of the
tubes project into the pericardium in such a manner that the ends
are bathed in the blood and aerate it just before it is returned into
the heart by means of the ostia. In the living animal the blood can
be seen through the transparent chitin of the dorsal surface surround
ing the ends of the tubes; and in the organ and surrounding tissues
out out of a Scutigera directly it is killed, the blood corpuscles can be
seen clustering round the tube ends.             If the mass of tubes of a
freshly   killed specimen    are teased  out  under   the microscope in gly
cerine, they can be seen to be <U+FB01>lled with air.         The tubes  each branch
several times.     Each tube is lined with chitin, which is        a continua
tion of the chitin of the exo-skeleton.       Each tube is also   clothed with
 cells, which are a continuation of the hypodermis.          The  tubes end in
 a blunt point of very delicate chitin.
            Reasons  for supposing  these Organs to be Respiratory.
    1.  There are no other organs which could be supposed to be respi
 ratory in function.
    2. The tubes are chitinous, and the chitin grows thin and mem

 branous     towards    the end, affording a good opportunity for inter
change     of  gases.
    3.  The tube ends project into the pericardium, so that they are
                                                                           ‘
bathed with the blood.                        -
   4. The tubes are <U+FB01>lled with air.
    5. The organ is so placed as to aérate the blood just before it
returns to the heart.                                                         _
    6. In Scutigera the dorsal scales do not agree in number with the
legs,     The organs are arranged on the dorsal scales; that is they are
not arranged in correspondence with the mesoblastic or primitive
segmentation (see a former paper before this Society, “The Post
Embryonic Development of Julns terrestris,” 1888). This renders it
probable that they are not a primitive development, but a recent
modi<U+FB01>cation, agreeing with the fact that all other Myriapods breathe
by the more primitive method of tracheee.
    This mode of respiration diifers from that in other Myriapods in
the   following particulars :—
    1. The tubes are collected into     one de<U+FB01>nite organ, instead of being
distributed about the body.
   2. The tubes have no spiral thread.
   3. In acting on the blood just before it returns to the heart, so that
aérated blood is distributed instead of unaérated.
   It resembles the tracheae of other Myriapods in the following par
ticulars   :—
    1.  In the air sac into which the tubes open.
    2.  In the cylindrical form of the tubes.
    3.  In the branching of the tubes.
    The organs resemble the tracheal lungs of Spiders—
    1. In the large air sac.
    2. In the number of tubes opening into an air sac.
                                                              :
    3. In the arrangement for bathing the tubes with blood in a blood
 sinus.
    4.  In  the supply of aerated blood by the heart.
    They differ from them in—
    l. The form of the tubes, which in Scutigera are cylindrical.
    2. In the absence of the membrane which in Spiders              surrounds
 the   organ.
    I   therefore hold that the respiratory organ in Scutigera holds a
 position intermediate between the tracheaa of Myriapods and the lungs
 of Spiders.       I  hold with A. Leuckart (‘ Zeitsch. <U+FB01>ir Wiss. Zool.,’

  bei den Araehniden”) that the tracheee have developed into the lungs of
  Spiders and Scorpions,      and I think that the organs in question form
  a series of which the lowest      term is the tracheee, the next the organ
  of Scutigera, then the lungs of Spiders, and then of Scorpions.

             On the 24th of February of this year we communicated the results
          of some observations on the uterine villiform papillae, or tropho
          nemata, of Pteroplatoea micrm'a (Bl. Schn.) and their relation to the
          embryo, and also incidentally referred to the structure and probable
          functions of similar uterine papillae in Trygon bleekem' and Myliobatt's
          nieuhn<U+FB01>i.
             \Ve were able to show that in the pregnant females of these
          Batoids the mucous membrane of the uterus         extended in the form
                                                                           is
          of elongate papillae, the entire surface of which, again,    beset with      is
          tubular glands, and we were able to bring forward evidence in favour
          of the view—more especially in the case of Pteroplataza mic'r-ura—
          that the function of these glands     to secrete  nutritive <U+FB02>uid which
                                                            is             a

          (Bl. Schn.), numerous pregnant females of Pteroplatma mic-rum
          (B1. Schn.), and an unimpregnated uterus of Narcine, the examina
          tion of which appears to corroborate the view advanced by us as to
          the function of the uterine papillae and their relation to the embryo.
             In the case of Pteroplatoea micmm, of which species we have ex
          amined over a score of pregnant females, we <U+FB01>nd that the oviduct
          is dilated into an uterus on both sides of the body equally, and that
          each uterus may contain from one to three embryos, the usual number
          being two.    In the early stages of gestation the entire surface of the

mucous membrane of the uterus is beset      with trophonemata, but with
the    growth of the foetus    the trophonemata    become atrophied by
pressure, except opposite the spiracles of the foetus, where they re
main as large bunches which penetrate through the spiracles deep
into the foetal pharynx.      We <U+FB01>nd that where, as appears to be the
most common condition, two embryos occupy the uterus, the one is
rolled up within the other—head to head and tail to tail—but in such a
way as to leave the spiracles of the inner one exposed for the troph0~
uemata to enter.      In one remarkable instance, where one spiracle of
the inner embryo was overlapped and concealed, that spiracle was
of diminutive size, while its fellow of the opposite side was much
enlarged.     On microscopic examination we <U+FB01>nd the nutrient secre
tion of the trophonemata     to contain numerous small granular bodies,
and a few large granular corpuscles which resemble leucocytes.             _
    In the pregnant female of Myliobatis nieuho<U+FB01>i we found three
young ones, two males and a female, of diiferent sizes, in an uterine
enlargement which exists on the left side only.       In the two smallest
there are   very delicate external gills; but of such structures there is
no trace whatever in the largest embryo.
    The spiracles in all are singularly large and patent, being kept
open by an cave-like extension of the cranial cartilage.       The mucous
 membrane of the uterus, which is thickly beset with long branched
glandular villi, was intensely vascular, had an odour, not of <U+FB01>sh, but
 like that of raw beef, and was covered with a creamy yellowish
                                                        ”
 coloured <U+FB02>uid somewhat resembling “laudable pus            in appearance.
 It may be mentioned that the spiral gut of one of the embryos was
 found to be full of the same creamy <U+FB02>uid, unchanged.           Apparently
 loose in the body cavity, in the largest foetus, were found strings of
 bead-like concretions      held   together by inspissated albuminous
 material: and on examination under the microscope these concre
 tions were found to contain numerous crystals of oxalate of lime and
 dumb-bell-shaped bodies exactly resembling the dumb-bell concre
 tions of urate of ammonia found in human urine.
     As one of us has already described (‘ Journal Asiatic Society
  Bengal,’ vol. 59, Part II, pp. 54! and 55) the general structure of the
  uterus and uterine glands in the stage preparatory to pregnancy in
  Myliobatis nieuho<U+FB01>i, we are deferring a report on this species in the
  hope of obtaining ampler material to make the report more [com
  plete.
     We devote this paper to some account of the phenomena of gesta
  tion in Trygon   walga, in which we have been able to make fuller

           Two females of Trygon walga, Miiller and Henle, were taken at
         Cocanada, in the Godzivari Delta, on the 8th of April of this year.
         The abdomen, in one of them, was so much distended that the
         normal <U+FB02>at shape of the <U+FB01>sh was obscured.       On transfer of this
         specimen to a bucket of seawater, two young ones were seen to he
         suddenly extruded from the cloacal ori<U+FB01>ce—one        few minutes after
                                                                           a
         the other.   The young ones swam about vigorously in the bucket.
         Relatively to the size of the abdominal cavity of the mother, which in
         this species    much contracted, the young ones are enormous; and
                        is
         on seeing   the two of them beside the open maternal abdomen                                  it

            Before going on to describe the visceral anatomy of the young, and
         the structure of the uterus and its trophonemata in the adult, there
         are certain interesting external characters, distinguishing the young
         from the mature female, which are important enough to be men
         tioned.
            (1.) In the young, the dorsal surface of the body     quite smooth    is
         and devoid of the dermal tubercles which, in this situation, charac
         terise the adult.   (2.) The young have only one tail spine, whereas
         the adult has two, and in front of them long series of <U+FB01>xed spinelets.
                                                                 a

         and the tip of the tail   occupied in the young one by a median fold

of the dorsal integument   15 mm. long and about 0'75 mm. in height ;
this    no doubt, a vestige of the vertical system of <U+FB01>ns, of which no
        is,
trace exists in the adult.    (4.) The ventral <U+FB01>ns in the young are
placed relatively farther back than they are in the adult, projecting
considerably beyond the hinder margin of the disk, while in the
adult they barely reach this limit.    (5.) The tail   relatively a good is
deal longer in the young.
  The young are pigmented in all respects like the adult.
  In the young one, immediately after          has left the uterus, the

abdomen     very
              is  tumid,  its anterior wall being stretched so thin that
the abdominal and intestinal contents can be seen through it.         On
opening   the abdomen, its cavity    found to be almost completely

stomach, and duodenum being displaced forward beneath the pectoral
girdle; the rectum is very sharply marked off from the colon, and
appears       narrow cord; the oesophagus and stomach are empty,
              as a
but the           <U+FB01>lled with bile-stained granular material, which,
              colon      is
under the action of spirit, has become      a hard, yellowish-brown
cake, of which the weight is no less than one-sixth to one-seventh of
that of the entire body.
  The large relative size of the rectal gland   remarkable, not onlyis
in this species, but also, we may mention, in the foetus of llIylz'obatis
nieuho<U+FB01>i and .Pternplataza              micrura.

                                             of   Pregnancy.
   The abdomen of the mother was laid open immediately after the
birth of the   young ones.    The right ovary and oviduct are un
developed;   the left ovary  large, and the distal end of its oviduct
                                         is                                                   is
dilated into a pyriform uterine swelling, the aperture of which
projects into the cloaoa as    conspicuous 0s uteri.

uterus, which     much contracted when empty, we <U+FB01>nd a moderately
                      is
thick <U+FB01>brous and muscular wall, lined internally with a mucous
membrane            everywhere produced into long papilla; (tropho

nemata)   these are brittle and friable.
              ;
  The trophonemata, which are cylindrical, unbranched, and taper
slightly from base to apex, are about 10 mm. in length and about
1mm. in breadth; and, on examination with a, low magnifying
power, their surface    seen'to be granular and much <U+FB01>ssured.

           Sections, both transverse and longitudinal, through a trophonema
       display a central     core of <U+FB01>ne connective tissue, in which, besides
       arteries, veins, and a dense capillary plexus, are cells and very numer
       ous free leucocytes; and surrounding or external to this a series of
       solid <U+FB01>nger-shaped coagula formed of con<U+FB02>uent cells in various stages
       of degeneration.     At  the one extreme, these <U+FB01>nger-shaped masses are
       seen to be made up of       desquamated cells the protoplasm of which
       has simply become con<U+FB02>uent into a solid mass wherein the nuclei,
       with the nuclear network very clear and conspicuous, stand out
        distinct and unchanged; while, at the other extreme, are found
        nothing but solid granular coagula in which neither nuclei nor
       structure of any kind can      be distinguished,  with leucocytes scattered
        between them.
           We may anticipate events by stating that these solid masses of
       cells and granular coagula appear to be “epithelial casts” of the
        glands which, as we shall show, invest the surface of the tropho
        nemata in the earlier stages of pregnancy, but which, at the close of
        pregnancy,     are undergoing     coagulative    degeneration, while the
        leucocytes present appear to be exercising a resorptive function.

                                 Beginning of Pregnancy.
           The second female specimen is about the       same size as the  <U+FB01>rst, but
       had not the      same convexity of the abdomen.       It also has the right
        ovary and oviduct undeveloped, while the left ovary is enlarged and
        distended with ova, and the distal end of its oviduct is dilated into a
        pyriform uterine chamber, which, however, is smaller than in the <U+FB01>rst
        specimen—measuring        only 32 mm. from the fundus to the 0s. An
        egg which had recently descended into the uterus was ruptured

        accidentally in dissection.
'
  1‘»      The uterus has at this stage in all respects the same form as it has
. I‘m   at the end of pregnancy; but the trophonemata, on the contrary, are
        as strongly contrasted as possible in the two stages.     For while in the
        late stage they have the form of an elongated cone      and  are in process
        of disintegration, in the early stage they are strap-shaped and are in
        process of integration. That the trophonemata were not functioning,
        their incompletely evolved condition proves, apart from the considera
        tion that in the well-<U+FB01>lled yolk-sac there would be abundant sustenance

        for the embryo for some time.
           The trophonemata are somewhat wavy, rather thick and <U+FB02>eshy,
        strap-shaped bodies, measuring about 10'5 mm. in length by about
        1   mm. in greatest breadth.       Narrow at their origin, they almost
        immediately widen out to their greatest breadth, which is maintained
        to about the seventh tenth of their length, whence they taper to their

rounded extremity.        They are with dif<U+FB01>culty straightened out from
their wavy curl. In stained preparations a dark unbranched line is
seen following the sinuosities of the trophonema, nearer to one margin
than to the other, and tapering away to nothing at the apex; it is the
rounded thickening formed by the (developing) axial vein which is so
conspicuous in the trophonemata of Pteroplatwa.
    A trophonema, lightly stained with borax carmine, mounted in
spirit and glycerine, and viewed under a Zeiss D ocular 2 by trans
mitted light, shows a darker and broader median band and two lighter
and much      narrower marginal bands. In the former the axial vein
presents   itself as a streak with a pale axis, which transverse sections
prove to be the optic expression of the commencing lumen.           In each
of the latter a large vessel, which in transverse section is seen to be
an artery, can readily be made out.       By careful focussing, the surface
of the broad median band is seen to be covered with a coarse polygonal
network, with paler meshes, which correspond to the simple or com
pound duct-openings of subjacent glands; the network, like the
surface of the pale marginal bands, is covered continuously with
minute <U+FB01>at glassy cells having sharply de<U+FB01>ned nuclei and distinct
limiting membranes.         Some preparations suggest that, in tropho
nemata which are less advanced in development than the one under
description, this layer of pavement cells may form a continuous
investment over the whole trophonema.
    Transverse sections of a trophonema show that the meshes of the
polygonal network above referred to coincide with bulb-shaped nests
of cells which are the still solid foundations of glands.
    These glands are arranged, as in Pteroplataza (tide ‘Roy. Soc. Pr'oc.,’
vol. 49,  Pl. VIII, <U+FB01>g. 5), perpendicular to the surface, side by side, in
the substance of the mucosa, but not quite so close together.         They
are squat bulb-shaped      organs, and are often compound, with two,
three, or, perhaps,     four acini.    In consequence of the absence of
                                                                            ‘
limiting cell-membranes, the exact arrangement of the gland cells
cannot be made out, but the nuclei, which are elongate, are arranged
somewhat irregularly in two strata—the nuclei of the two strata and
of the same stratum overlapping one another; whence it may be
inferred, though no cell-boundaries        are traceable, that the gland
 tissue forms a two-layered     strati<U+FB01>ed columnar epithelium similar to
 that which is found in many parts of the Mammalian respiratory
 tract.
    The  glands, which, as above stated, are quite solid without any
 trace  of lumen, appear to have originated as ingrowths of the in
 different layers of the epithelium alone, the outer layer of <U+FB02>at glassy
 pavement cells which invests the surface of the trophonema between
 the glands and at its sides not having been involved in the process.
 And, from appearances presented by less developed trophonemata,

  208         Observations   on the Gestation   of Indian Rays.      [New  26,
  we infer that, in early stages, the pavement layer forms a cOntinuous
  investment over the whole trophonema; and that subsequently, by
  the separation from one another at de<U+FB01>nite spots of the pavement
  cells, stomata are formed, which, when the lumina of the glands are
  established, become the mouths of the glands.         Be this as it may, the
  outer (pavement) layer is not traceable into the mouths of the glands
  at any point in any of our sections.
     The trophonemata possess an exceedingly rich vascular supply.
  All the sections show two large, but not very thick-walled, arteries,
  one in each non-glandular margin; minute arterioles here and there
  between adjacent glands immediately beneath the epithelium; and,
  between the layers of glands of opposite faces, a plexus of sinuous
  cavities or capillaries.
     The capillary plexus in transverse sections of a trophonema is seen
  to extend deeply between the glands right up to the super<U+FB01>cial
  arterioles; and, in the part corresponding to the position of the great
  axial   vein  of Pteroplatwa, it presents a solid or spongy circular
  expansion, in the centre of which the future lumen of the vessel is
  commencing to be formed.         In transverse section of a group of glands
  the capillary plexus     is seen   to form a polygonal network, in the
   meshes of which the glands lie.
     In   comparison with Pteroplatiea micrm'a, the trophonemata of
   Trygon walga are characterised by the possession of an epithelium
   which is several cells thick instead of one cell thick, and by the
  richer vascular supply of their glands, each of which is embedded
  in a little capillary cup of its own, like a <U+FB01>lbert in its husk.
                                  § 5. Conclusions.
      1. Comparison     of the trophonemata       in the two stages above
   described, showing, on the one hand, at the onset of pregnancy, a
-  mucous membrane of large nucleated indifferent cells and of solid
   unformed glands, and, on the other hand, when the term of pregnancy
  is ful<U+FB01>lled, a surface layer of gland-casts of epithelium in various
  stages of degeneration, appears to be conclusive proof that the glands
  are developed   for the special requirements of the pregnant state.
     2.  As regards the function of these glands, the presence in every
   case where a fresh pregnant uterus has been examined of a viscid
  turbid or actually milky albuminous <U+FB02>uid, and further the <U+FB01>nding in
  the case of Myliobatis nieuho<U+FB01>i of one and the same secretion in the
   uterus of the mother and in the intestine of the foetus, seem to fully
   con<U+FB01>rm our original conclusion that they are in all cases milk-glands
   furnishing a secretion for the nourishment of the embryo.
      3. Regarding the channel through which the milk is carried into
   the foetus, we think it to be in every species that we have examined,

 1891.]
                Variations  observed in the Rabbit's   Liver.            209
 Pteroplatma micru'ra, Myliobatis nieuho<U+FB01>i, Trygon walga, and Trygon
 bleekeri, the large wide-open spiracles.      In Pteroplatoca we know that
the trophonemata pass into the spiracles ; but the singular distension
of these ori<U+FB01>ces in the other species, in contrast to the smallness of
the other apertures of the body, points to the conclusion stated.
    4. The stomach in all cases that we have hitherto observed (except
in Trygon bleeke'r'i, where the observation was lost) is empty, small,
and displaced; while the colon (spiral gut) is full, large, and dis
tended at the expense of other organs.            And this leads us to the
conclusion    that the  foetal stomach   is simply a channel through which
the easily assimilable food passes to be absorbed by the spiral gut.
And of this conclusion the presence of the unchanged “ milk ” in the
spiral gut of Myliobatis is corroborative.
    5. Finally, as to the method of respiration of the foetus, no conclu
sion can as yetbe arrived at.        It is probably safe to assume that the
consumption of oxygen and the production of carbonic acid by the
fcetus are comparatively        small, and that the respiratory exchanges
are su<U+FB01>iciently    carried   out  through the soft foetal skin where this
comes in contact with the vascular trophonemata and uterine wall.
   Hitherto, we have not found any special distribution of blood
vessels to the skin, in the foetus.      And in Pteroplatoea the manner in
which, when two foetuses are present, the one is rolled up within the
other, prevents contact of the inner foetus with the uterine wall,
except at the snout, and where the trophonemata enter the spiracles.
   We are indebted to Professor G. B. Howes for calling our atten
tion to a short note by Dr. W. A. Haswell (‘Proceedings Linuean
Society, New South Wales,’ vol. 3, 1889, pp. 1713 to 1716) on
Uroliwhus, in which it is suggested that the extraordinarily long
external gills of the foetus are concerned in absorbing matter which
is supposed to exude from the blood-vessels of the uterine villi.
IV. “ On some of the Variations observed in the Rabbit’s Liver
       under certain Physiological and Pathological Circum
       stances.” By T. LAUDER BRUNTON, M.D., B.Sc., F.R.S.,
       and SHERIDAN DELEPINE, M.B., B.Sc.               Received October
       22, 1891.
                                  (Abstract)
   Under the in<U+FB02>uence of the natural stimulus of digestion, numerous
 changes are observable in-liver cells.         In this we partly con<U+FB01>rm
 and    partly complete    (and   add to) the     observations  of previous
 investigators.

            '
210                        Variations observed in    the   Rabbit’s Liver.   [Nov   26,
   1. Some of them indicate the existence of a peculiar kinetic state,
manifested by irritability and contractility, giving rise to variations in
the distribution of the mitoma of the cells.
   The alternate enlargement and shrinking of the nuclei seem to
point in the same direction.
   The correlation between these phenomena and certain alternations
in the contractility of the sphincter pupillae still further strengthens
this view.
   2. During digestion, in addition to the dynamic state just alluded
to, glycogen accumulates in the cells, and gradually <U+FB01>lls up all the
meshes of the mitoma.     This begins in the hepatic zone almost im
mediately  after the beginning of a meal, attains its maximum from
the third to the eighth hour, and gradually diminishes, till at the
twelfth hour only a few granules are left in the hepatic zone, which isl
thus the <U+FB01>rst and the last to be in<U+FB01>ltrated with glycogen.
  Another evidence of chemical activity is given by the accumulation
of a ferruginous pigment in the cells of the liver.    This begins to be
well marked <U+FB01>ve hours after a meal; it gradually increases, until at
the twelfth hour it has attained its maximum,* after which it rapidly
diminishes.     It is to be noted that the <U+FB01>rst e<U+FB02>'ect of taking a meal is
to cause a diminution of this iron-containing       pigment in the liver
cells.
   There      therefore, evidence that the signs of activity of liver cells
                     is,
occur in the following order :—
   (a.) Alterations in the Size     the Meshes and in the Distribution
                                           of                                        of
the   Mitoma.—This occur's very early, and continues till the eighth
hour at least.
                                                                       ‘
   (1).) Accumulation of some products       which have been separated
from the food and absorbed, but yet not assimilated‘l’ (or utilised in the
production of energy) (glycogen). This becomes marked also early
after the taking of a meal, and attains its maximum between the
third and eighth hours.
    (0.) Accumulation of some products which have been separated in
the cell as a result of its special functional activity, but as yet not
expelled from     (iron-containing pigment).
                           it                  This attains its maximum
at the twelfth hour.
   It evident that the <U+FB01>rst and the last of these signs are not neces

sarily under the dependence of the absorption of food. On the
contrary, the second       apparently one of the results of absorption.
                                  is
It is, therefore, probable that, whilst the <U+FB01>rst and the third may be
brought about by various stimulating agents, the second, being con

part of the iron compounds set free by the splitting up of haemoglobin may not be

the results of stimulation of starving cells.
   In studying the e<U+FB01>ects of drugs it will be useful to consider the
relation of these various effects in order to understand the special
mode of action of the agent employed.
   By these observations we have also obtained indications of the
ways in which cells can be placed in di<U+FB01>erent states of activity, so
that, by the administration of drugs at various times after a meal, we
can study more accurately what accelerating, restraining, or other
wise modifying, in<U+FB02>uences the drug may have.
   We have been driven to consider, incidentally, some other problems,
such as the relations which exist between contractility and secretory
activity, but such things cannot be considered fully in this com

      SCHKFER,     F.R.S. Received October          23, 1891.
                                 (Abstract)
   Methods    of Research—The heart being exposed, two points of its
surface were     connected by means of non-polarisable electrodes with
the terminals of a Capillary electrometer.        An image of the meniscus
was thrown. on to a moving photographic           plate, on which were also
recorded the contractions of      the  ventricle,  a time tracing (8 or 100
per second), and in many cases the time of stimulation (when
arti<U+FB01>cial stimuli were used), or the period of excitation of the vagus
 (when it was desired to slow the heart).         In nearly all experiments
we used    dogs.
   We have also made experiments on the excised heart.             In these,
 the heart, immediately after the chest was opened, was placed in a
 warm moist chamber.         The wires of the electrodes and the tube
 going tothe tambour recording the heartbeats passed through holesv
 in the sides of the chamber.
    Resulta—As’ to the wave of negativity in the ventricle, we <U+FB01>nd
 that in animals whose hearts are in as normal a condition as possible
 the variation is always diphasic, the negativity at the base preceding
 that at the apex.     The result is the. same whether the pericardium be
 intact or opened, or whatever points of the ventricular surface are
 led off.

  212             Mr. W. M. Bayliss and Dr. E. H. Starling.            [Nov. 26,
     The character and direction of this variation, however, is exceed
  ingly sensitive to slight changes in the temperature of the various
  parts of the heart, so that in order to obtain a constant result in
  animals with opened chest it is necessary to use warmed air for
  arti<U+FB01>cial respiration.
     The following experiment illustrates the sensitiveness of the direc
  tion of the electrical variation to changes in the temperature of the
  respired air :—
     June 27, l890.—Dog: Operation as already described; arti<U+FB01>cial
 respiration with warmed air.             Base of right ventricle (anterior
 surface)     to  acid, apex of left ventricle to capillary.
     Direction of variation——
        (a.) Before opening pericardium : diphasic—base, apex.
        (12.) After opening pericardium: diphasic—base,          apex.
     The hot water was now poured out of the vessel surrounding the
 spiral, and this was <U+FB01>lled with ice. After <U+FB01>ve minutes another
 photograph was taken of the variation—
        (c.) Triphasic—base, apex, base.
        (d.) (After another <U+FB01>ve minutes.)         Diphasic—apex base.
        (e.) The ice was now replaced by hot water.
     After ten minutes more, the variation was found to be once again
 diphasic, the base becoming negative <U+FB01>rst.
     Cold air was then used again, with the same result as before.
     The same reversal of the variation can be obtained in the tortoisc’s
 heart by warming the apex and cooling the base simultaneously.
    If  we may regard      the electrometer    tracings  as reliable, that is to
say, if the variation—apex,        base—~with   cooled  base is the real varia
tion, and it is not really a triphasic one with a <U+FB01>rst phase too small
 to be read on an electrometer, the only conclusion we can draw from
 our experiments is that the excitatory wave in the ventricle is a
di<U+FB01>erent thing from the wave of negativity, and precedes it (since in
the hearts with cooled base, although the ventricles were beating in
normal sequence to the auricles, the negativity began at the apex
 before the base).
    Possibly, in the ventricles,      the excitatory state is not transmitted
directly from one muscle cell to another, but by the intervention of
the intermuscular network of nerves shown by Dogiel, Openchowski,
and others, to be universally present in the ventricular walls.
    Time Measurements.—Some point of the auricles or ventricles was
stimulated       three times a second by means of an induction shock.        In
this way an arti<U+FB01>cial rhythm is induced, the heart contracting to
every stimulation. This is the only method by which it is possible
to get time measurements in the mammalian heart, since we cannot
put this organ into a prolonged standstill, as we can the frog’s heart
by means of the Stannius ligature.

 1891.]      Electromotive    Phenomena      of the Mammalian Heart.        213
    The latent period of electrical response of auricular and ventricular
muscle to     direct electrical stimulation is so short that we could not
measure it accurately with the means at our disposal.            It is certainly
less than 0'01".
    We have sought to measure the rapidity of propagation of the wave
in the mammalian ventricle in the same way as Engelmann and
Sanderson       and Page estimated it in the frog’s heart, namely
measuring the time interval between the beginning and the culmina
tion of the initial phase.
    In the exposed heart of a dog, breathing warmed air, the rate is
generally about 30 mm. in 0'01”, i.e., about 3 metres per second.
But the sensitiveness of the form and direction of the variation to
slight changes in temperature of diiferent parts of the heart surface
must make us hesitate in taking these <U+FB01>gures as the correct ones.
    There is a long period of delay in the passage across the auriculo
ventricular groove.       A mean of eight observations gave 0'15” as the
time elapsed after stimulation        of the auricles before the development
of   negativity   at the  base  of  the ventricles.   Nearly the whole of this
time is taken up in the passage from auricles to ventricles, since it
makes very little difference to the time interval, whether the stimuli
be applied to an auricular appendage, or the auricles close to the
auriculo-ventricular      groove.
   Lastly,   we  have   obtained   no evidence of the supposed tetanic nature
of a cardiac contraction (Fredericq), all our results pointing eon
clusively to the contraction being a single .wave, starting at the base
and passing thence to the apex of the heart.
    The conclusions arrived at by Sanderson and Page in their work on
the    heart of the frog and tortoise hold good also for the mammalian
heart.
                                      APPENDIX.
   0n the Electrical Variation of the Heart of Man and the Intact Dog.
    We have also photographed the electrical change of the heart of
man and of the dog, with chest unopened, and, in opposition                   to
Waller, we <U+FB01>nd that the variation is of such a nature as to show
negativity always commencing at the base.              The greatest eifect was
obtained by leading o<U+FB01> from the apex beat and the right hand, but
we found the same character of variation from whatever points on the
surface of the body we led oif, i.e., the electrode nearest the base
 became   negative <U+FB01>rst.
    The photographs show what the eye could not distinguish clearly,
 viz., that each beat is accompanied by a triphasic variation, consisting
 of lst, a “spike ”
                       (basal negativity) ; 2nd, a more prolonged excursion
 in the opposite direction (apical negativity) ; and 3rd, a large and pro
longed movement in the same direction as the “spike” (basal nega

tivity).   Hence we conclude that the base becomes negative before the
apex, and that its negativity overlasts that of the apex.
  We do not feel able as yet to explain the triphasic nature of the
variation ; it shows, however, that normally the excitatory state at the
base lasts longer than at the apex.

   The Report of the Auditors of the Treasurer's Accounts, on the part
of the Society, was presented, by which it appears that the total
receipts on the General Account during the past year, including
balances carried from the preceding year and repayment of a mortgage
loan of £15,000, amount to £22,433 7s. 3d. on the General Account,
and that the total receipts on account of Trust Funds, including
balances carried from the preceding year, amount to £6,096 12s. 10d.
The total expenditure for the same period, including investments,
amounts to £21,391 9s. 9d. on the_General Account, and £2,340 9s. 11d.
on account of Trust Funds, leaving a balance on the General Account
of £1,022 5s. 8d. at the bankers’, and £19 11s. 1011. in the hands of the
Treasurer, and, on account of Trust Funds, a balance at the bankers’
of £3,756 2s. 11d.
   The thanks of the Society were voted to the Treasurer and Auditors.

   The President then addressed the Society as follows :—
   Since the last Anniversary Meeting the Royal Society            have lost
<U+FB01>fteen of   their Fellows and three Foreign Members.
   James    Croll, who died on the 15th of December, at the age of
 sixty-nine,  presented in his life a rare case of inborn passion for

220                        Anniversary llfeeting.                  [Nov.   30,
philosophy and science conquering all obstacles and attaining to the
object of life-long devotion to scienti<U+FB01>c research and philosophical
speculation.     Dependent wholly on his own work for his support, he
commenced earning a livelihood as a. beginner in a merchant’s o<U+FB01>ice;
and with his ability he might, no doubt, have earned promotion and
become      a  successful   merchant.     But the superior attraction of
philosophy prevailed,     and he wrote    a book on the ‘ The Philosophy of
Theism,’ which was published in a large octavo volume,              I believe
while he was still working in the merchant’s o<U+FB02>ice. After being one
out of about seventy unsuccessful candidates for the post of Under
Keeper of the Hunterian Museum of the University of Glasgow, he
was appointed in 1859 to the post of Janitor of Anderson’s College,
Glasgow.      About this time the Geological Society of Glasgow was
founded, and became the centre of an active company of geologists,
who took up the study of the traces of the Glacial period, so striking
and abundant in the West of Scotland.          Croll and his successful com
petitor for    the  University post,     John   Young, both of them with
characteristic ardour, threw themselves into the work of geology.
Croll, according to his peculiar bent of mind, was drawn chie<U+FB02>y into
the more speculative lines of geological inquiry, and in 1864 pub
lished his essay on ‘ The Physical Cause of the Changes of Climate
during the Glacial Epoch,’ which deservedly gained the careful con
sideration both of geologists and of astronomers.           This speculation
undoubtedly     presented  a new  eausa.  for some of the changes  of climate
which have occurred       in geological history, although we can scarcely
consider it adequate to be so powerful and exclusive a factor as
Croll endeavoured to make it. His vigorgus dispute with Carpenter
regarding oceanic circulation rightly enforced attention to the
importance of wind as the prime mover of some of the great ocean
currents, but did not overthrow Carpenter's very-important views
regarding the effects of heat, according to which diiferences of tem
 perature in the water itself in di<U+FB01>erent regions and at di<U+FB01>'erent depths
 have paramount e<U+FB02>icacy in producing some of the great oceanic cir
 culations.    After serving for eight years as Janitor in Anderson’s
 College, Glasgow, Croll was selected by Sir Archibald Geikie to take
 charge of the maps and correspondence of the Geological Survey in
 Edinburgh. But, according to rule, he must be examined, and the
 Civil Service examiners plucked him in arithmetic and English com
position.     On the strong urgency of Sir Roderick Murchison (who
 asked me, from my personal knowledge of Croll, to write a statement
 of my opinion regarding his quali<U+FB01>cations), the Civil Service Com
missioners, with a wisely liberal relaxation of their rules, accepted
his great calculations regarding the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit
 and the precession of the equinoxes during the last ten million years
as suf<U+FB01>cient evidence of his arithmetical capacity, and his book on

    The Philosophy of Theism            and numerous papers published in
scienti<U+FB01>c journals as proof of his ability to write good English. He was,
therefore, allowed to receive the appointment in the Geological Survey
in Edinburgh, though he had failed to pass the qualifying examina
tion. During the rest of his life he was thus kept in relation with
the great practical work of the Geological Survey in Scotland, and
was allowed time to devote himself to speculative study and writing
in geological physics, astronomy, and philosophy.            During the last
year of his life he sent to press his last work, published a few weeks
before     his death, entitled ‘ The Philosophical Basis of Evolution.’
      The bitter winter of 1891 severely tried the health of many dis
tinguished men.           During the <U+FB01>rst seventeen days of January the
Royal Society       10st four Fellows.
  ‘
      John Marshall was Professor of Anatomy to the Royal Academy,
and, as representative of the Royal College of Surgeons, President of
the General Medical Council.            His contributions to surgical litera
ture, though not numerous, were considered of high value by those
able to judge.       He died, on the 1st January, at the age of seventy-two.
      Dr. Casey, Fellow of the Royal University of Ireland, distinguished
as a mathematician,        was corresponding member of several scienti<U+FB01>c
 societies,   and  author  of historical and elementary works on various
 branches of mathematics.           He was in vigorous health until a short
 time before his death, when he was seized with bronchitis.          He died,
 on January 3rd, at the age of seventy.
      Dr. Brady’s scienti<U+FB01>c reputation was mainly connected with his
 researches on the Rhizopoda and other minute forms of Invertebrate
  life.    On these he published many memoirs of great value, by which
  knowledge was largely advanced.             He was a Fellow of the Royal
  Society,   the  Linnean   Society,   and the Geological Society; and corre
  sponding member of several foreign scienti<U+FB01>c bodies.           He died, on
  January 10th, at the age of <U+FB01>fty-six. He bequeathed to the Royal
   Society all his books and papers relating to the Protozoa, with an
  additional benefaction to which I shall refer later.
       Dr. Graham Balfour was Surgeon-General to the Army and
   Honorary Physician to the Queen, and President of the Royal Statis
   tical Society.    He died, on January 17th, at the age of sixty-eight.
       Dr. Peter Martin Duncan, Professor of Geology in King’s College,
   was well known, not only as a geologist who devoted himself especi
   ally to the study of fossil Corals and Echinoderms, and added greatly
    to knowledge by his valuable       published memoirs on that subject, but
    also as a popular exponent of geology and zoology and an author and
   editor of works extending         through the whole range of natural
    history.   One great result of his work was a popular ‘ Natural
    History,’ in six quarto volumes, brought out between the years 1878
    and 1883, written by able specialists, on a comprehensive      plan under

222                      Anniversary Meeting.                [N ov.  30,
his Own direction, and containing many articles written by himself.
He died, on May 29th, at the age of sixty-seven.
   Sir John Hawkshaw was undoubtedly one of_ the greatest engineers
of this century.     At the age of twenty-one he was appointed to
take charge of important mining works in Venezuela,          where he
remained   for three  years, chie<U+FB02>y occupied in improving  the  naviga
tion of the River Area for <U+FB01>at-bottomed boats employed to carry
away the produce of the St. Felipe copper mines.     Repeated attacks
of fever and ague compelled him to return to England, but not until
after many of the English miners employed under him, chie<U+FB02>y picked
men from Cornwall, and several of the medical attendant-s of the
station, had died from the e<U+FB01>ects of the unhealthy climate.         The
house in which he lived at the mines still exists, and bears his name.
 Soon after he left, all its inhabitants were murdered; and it has
remained uninhabited ever since. From his return to England in
1834 until a few years before his death Hawkshaw was successfully
occupied in the design, and in superintendence of the execution, of
great engineering works; and in advising the Government, muni
cipal corporations, .and other public bodies, upon every variety of
engineering questions.      He early made his mark in engineering
 science and practice in respect to two important questions.   In 1838
he reported to the Great Western Railway Company strongly against
maintaining their bread gauge, and advocated a uniform gauge
throughout the country; a few years later, in a keen contest of
opinion against Robert Stephenson, he urged the practicability and
advantageousness of introducing steeper gradients.      The soundness
of his views on both these questions is now generally admitted: and
the introduction of steeper gradients, in consequence of his advocacy,
led to a rapid extension of railways in all parts of the world. He
was President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, 1862—63, and
President of the British Association at Bristol in 1875. He died, on
June 2nd, at the age of eighty.                    _
    Sir Prescott Gardner Hewett was Professor of Human Anatomy
and Surgery in the College of Surgeons; and became President of the
 College as successor to Sir James Paget in 1883.        He won high
reputation, also, as an artist. Even while most occupied in his
 arduous profession as a surgeon, he took recreation in painting and
 drawing with a persevering zeal and a high degree of success rare
among amateurs. He died on the 19th of June, at the age of seventy
nine.
   Dr. Philip Herbert Carpenter was a member of the scienti<U+FB01>c staff
of the deep-sea exploring expeditions of Her Majesty’s steamships
“ Lightning”                 “
                (1868) and     Porcupine” (1869—70); and in 1875 he
was appointed Assistant Naturalist to Her Majesty’s ship “ Valor

 and the North Atlantic.          He devoted himself continuously, from
 1875, to studying the morphology of the Echinoderms, more par
 ticularly of the Crinoids, both recent and fossil. He wrote numerous
 papers, which were published in the Transactions of the Royal
 Society and of the Linnean and Geological Societies.               In 1883 he
 was awarded    the Lyell Fund by the Geological Society of London, in
recognition of the value of his work, and in 188-5 was elected a Fellow
of the Royal Society.        In 1877 he was appointed Assistant-Master at
Eton, especially charged with the teaching of biology, and held this
post till his death, on the let October, at the age of thirty-nine.
    Dr. Henry Moseley, Linacre Professor of Human and Comparative
Anatomy in the University of Oxford, one of the eminent naturalists
0f the “Challenger” expedition, who served on board the “Chal
lenger” during the entire voyage round the world, from 1872 till
1876, died on the 10th of this month, at the age of forty-six.         He was
author of many important papers in various branches of natural
history, chie<U+FB02>y comparative anatomy and marine zoology.
    Henry Martyn Jeffery, after taking high places in the Mathematical
and Classical Triposes at Cambridge in 18419, commenced professional
life as Lecturer in the College of Civil Engineers in Putney; and
in later years continued it as Headmaster of Pate’s Grammar School,
 Cheltenham, until he retired in 1882.           As a teacher he was largely
 occupied  with    classics, but  his  favourite  study was mathematics, and
he is well   known     as  the  author of   a  long and continuous series of
papers on subjects of pure mathematics which have been published
in the ‘ Quarterly Journal of Mathematics,’              the ‘Journal of the
                                                     ‘
 London Mathematical Society,’ and the                 Reports of the British
Association.’      He was actively occupied to the last with mathematical
work and in the preparation of a text-book on his favourite mathe
matical subjects.       He died, on the 3rd of November, at the age of
sixty-six.
    Thomas Wharton Jones, a distinguished physiologist, died on the
 7th of this month, at nearly eighty years of age.           Professor Huxley
 was one of    his  pupils forty years ago      and  gives bright and pleasant

 Gower, K.G., Earl of Granville; and the Right Honourable William

 t'wo, seventy-six, and sixty-six.
    The career of Carl Wilhelm von Nageli, of Munich, during <U+FB01>fty
 years of most active and fertile scienti<U+FB01>c work, is of special interest
in the history of botany and of biological speculation. He was elected

Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1881, and died on the 10th
of May, 1891, at the age of seventy-four.
    The name of Becquerel has been famous in science since the days
of Biot, Davy, De La Rive, Faraday, Ampere, and Arago.             I well
remember going to the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, in January
1845, with an introduction from Professor James Forbes to Antoine
César Becquerel, who, even at that remote time, was a veteran in
physical   science;  and <U+FB01>nding him in his laboratory there, assisted
in   work    regarding electrolytically deposited <U+FB01>lms on polished
metallic surfaces and their colours, by his son Edmond, a bright
young man who had already commenced following his father’s
example as an active worker in experimental physics.        He had been
associated in 1839 with his father and the still older veteran, Biot, in
experiments on phosphorescence produced by electric currents, a
subject the profound importance of which is more appreciated now
than it was then. Through <U+FB01>fty years of active and fruitful work in
many departments of physical science, that subject of phosphor
escence remained a speciality with Edmond Becquercl ; and his son
 Henri, who survives him, has, in his turn, taken it up and given im
 portant contributions to knowledge regarding it. Edmond Becquerel
 was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society in'1888, and died
 on the 11th of May, 1891, at the age of seventy-one.
    Wilhelm Eduard Weber, of Gdttingen, the second of three sons of
 Michael Weber (Professor of Positive Divinity at the beginning of
 this century in Wittenberg), of whom two were Foreign Members of
 the Royal Society and all three active workers for the advancement
 of natural knowledge, was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society
 in 1850, and died on the 24th of June, 1891, at the age of eighty-seven.
 He was colleague of Gauss in the great work on magnetic measure
 ment and on terrestrial magnetism of which they gave fruits to the
 world in the ‘Resultate ans den Beobachtungeu des Magnetischen
 Vereins.’ The system of absolute measurement which Gauss intro
 duced for magnetism in general, and applied practically to terrestrial
 magnetism, was nobly followed up by Weber, in extending it to
 electromagnetism and electrostatics, a truly epoch-making work in
 physical science. On it is founded the splendidly valuable system of
 practical measurement, in absolute units, of electric resistance, of
  electromotive-force, and of electric current, which, after a <U+FB01>rst intro
 duction into this country in the year 1851, and a forty years’
 struggle, has, since the last Anniversary Meeting of the Royal
  Society, become de<U+FB01>nitively legalised for England through the _action
  of the Board of Trade, advised by a Committee to which the Royal
  Society, the British Association, and the Institution of Electrical
  Engineers were invited to send, and sent, representatives.

which have been full of scienti<U+FB01>c interest, and in the conduct of the
important a<U+FB01>airs committed to their Council. During the past year
nineteen memoirs have been published in the ‘ Philosophical Trans
actions,’ containing a total of 1020 pages and 60 plates.              Of the
‘
    Proceedings,’ six numbers have been issued, containing 893 pages.
Of the large number of papers which have been published in the
‘Proceedings’ two-thirds are on the physics and dynamics of dead
matter and one-third on biological subjects.
     As stated by Sir George Stokes in his Presidential Address at the
last Anniversary Meeting, a revision of the whole body of the Statutes
of the      Royal Society had been entered upon, a Committee              had
recently reported     to the Council,  and  their report had  been left to the
new Council then entering on of<U+FB01>ce to take such action in the matter
as might be judged proper.        The Council now concluding their term of
o<U+FB01>ice have accordingly given much time to the subject, and have com
pleted     the work of re-enacting the Statutes with such amendments
as     have seemed desirable.      The only questions upon which there was
e<U+FB01>ective diiierence of opinion were those connected with the election
 of Fellows, which were referred to by Sir George Stokes as having
elicited considerable difference of opinion in the reporting Committee.
The     Council, after much anxious consideration, resolved to make no
 change of the existing Statutes in this respect.
      There have been no changes during the past session in the constitu
 tion of the staff employed in the Of<U+FB01>ces and Library; but in the
  Catalogue Department, two lady assistants and two copyists have
 been engaged to work under the superintendence of Miss Chambers,
  who succeeded in July of last year_to the post rendered vacant by the
  death of the late Mr. Holt, and who continues to give every satisfac
  tion in the discharge of her duties.
      In January of the present year a communication was received from
  our Fellow Professor G. S. Brady, intimating that his brother, the
  late Mr. Henry Bowman Brady, whose decease I have already men
  tioned, had bequeathed to the Society all his books and papers relating
   to the Protozoa, with the recommendation         that they should be kept
   together as a. distinct collection.   In case this recommendation should
   be adopted, a further bequest of £300 was made, the interest of
   principal or both to he applied, at the discretion of the Council, to the
   purchase of works on the same or kindred subjects, to be added to the
   collection.   The Council have accepted both these bequests, and a
    case marked with an engraved plate has been set aside in the Library
    for the accommodation of the Brady collection.

   Society a sum of £1000, to be ultimately invested in such manner
  as the     President and Council, in their absolute and uncontrolled
   discretion, may think <U+FB01>t, and to be held in trust always for the
  purpose of forming a fund the annual income of which shall be
  applied trienniully towards the promotion of physical science and
  biology in such manner as to the President and Council of the Royal

      A Committee of the British Association appointed for the purpose
  of reporting on the best means of comparing and reducing observa
  tions on terrestrial magnetism has strongly recommended the re
  establishment of a magnetic observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.
  A conference on the subject was held between the Committee and Dr.
  Gill, the Astronomer Royal of the Cape of Good Hope, last. June,
  during his recent visit to England, which has resulted in an application
  to the Admiralty to carry this recommendation into practical e<U+FB01>ect
  in connection with the astronomical observatory of the Cape of Good
  Hope (belonging to the Admiralty).        This application is at present
  under the consideration of the Admiralty.
     A fundamental investigation in astronomy, of great importance in
  respect to the primary observational work of astronomical observa
  tories, and of exceeding interest in connection with tidal, meteo
  rological,    and geological observations and speculations, has been
  de<U+FB01>nitively entered upon during the past year, and has already given
  substantial results of a most promising character.    The International

Geodetic Union, at its last meeting in the autumn of 1890, on the
motion of Professor Foerster, of Berlin, resolved to send an astro
nomical expedition to Honolulu, which is within 9° of the opposite
meridian to Berlin (171° west from Berlin), for the purpose of making
a twelve months’       series of observations on latitude corresponding to
twelve months’ analogous observations to be made in the Royal
Observatory, Berlin.         Accordingly Dr. Marcuse went from Berlin,
and, along with Mr. Preston sent by the Coast and Geodetic Survey
Department of the United States, began making latitude observations
in Honolulu about the beginning of June. In a letter from Professor
Foerster, received a few weeks ago, he tells me that he has already
received from Honolulu a <U+FB01>rst instalment of several hundred deter
minations of latitude, made during a <U+FB01>rst three months of the pro
posed ycar of observations;          and that, in comparing these results
with the corresponding        results of the Berlin Observatory, he <U+FB01>nds
beyond doubt that in these three months the latitude increased in
Berlin by one-third of a second and decreased in Honolulu by almost
exactly the same amount.            Thus, we have decisive demonstration
that motion, relatively to the Earth, of the Earth’s instantaneous axis
of rotation, is the cause of variations of latitude which had been
observed in Berlin, Greenwich, and other great observatories, and
 which could not be wholly attributed to errors of observation.       This,
 Professor Foerster remarks, gives observational proof of a dynamical
conclusion contained in my Presidential Address to Section A of the
 British Association, at Glangw, in 1876, to the effect that irregular
 movements of the Earth’s axis to the extent of half a second may be
 produced by the temporary changes of sea-level due to meteorological
 causes.
    It is proposed that four permanent stations for regular and con
 tinued observation of latitude, at places of approximately equal lati
 tude and on meridians approximately 90° apart, should be established
 under the auspices of the International Geodetic Union.        The reason
 for this is that a change in the instantaneous axis of rotation in the
 direction perpendicular to the meridian of any one place would not
 alter  its latitude, but would alter the latitude of a place 90° from it in
 longitude by an amount equal to the angular change of the position
 of the axis.      Thus two stations in meridians di<U+FB01>ering by 90° would
 theoretically suf<U+FB01>ce, by observations of latitude, to determine the
 changes in the position of the instantaneous axis; but di<U+FB01>erential
 results, such as those already obtained between Berlin and Honolulu,
 differing by approximately 180° in longitude, are necessary for elimin
  ating errors of observation su<U+FB01>‘iciently to giVe satisfactory and useful
  results.   It is to be hoped that England, and all other great nations
  in which science is cultivated, will co-operate with the International
  Geodetic Union in this important work.

   Among the most interesting scienti<U+FB01>c events of the past year was
the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Faraday by
the two Faraday Lectures in the Royal Institution last June.     In the
<U+FB01>rst of these, which was delivered by Lord Rayleigh, under the
presidency of the Prince of Wales, an old pupil of Faraday’s and now
Vice-Patron of the Royal Institution, a general survey of Faraday’s
work during his <U+FB01>fty-four years' connection with the Royal Institu
tion was given. Naturally, a large part of the lecture was devoted to
magnetism and electricity and to electro-magnetic induction; but it
contained also much that must have been surprising to the audience,
scarcely prepared to be told, as they were told by Lord Rayleigh, that
“
  Faraday’s mind was essentially mathematical in its qualities,” and
that, particularly in his acoustical work, he had made many very
acute observations of physical phenomena, of a kind to help in guiding
the mathematician to the solution of dif<U+FB01>cult and highly interesting
problems of mathematical dynamics, and in some cases actually to
give him the solution surprisingly different from what might have
been expected even by highly quali<U+FB01>ed mathematical investigators.
   The other Faraday Lecture, given by Professor Dewar, was a
splendid realisation of Faraday’s anticipations regarding the liquefac
tion of the “permanent gases,” according to which no extreme of
pressure might be capable of liquefying hydrogen or oxygen at
ordinary temperature, while a very moderate pressure might suf<U+FB01>ce
to liquefy them if their temperatures could be su<U+FB01>iciently lowered.
Professor Dewar actually showed litluid oxygen in a glass tumbler,       ,
not boiling or in a state of commotion like a tumbler of soda-water,
but quietly and without any sensible motion keeping itself cool by its
own evaporation, while it rapidly formed a thick jacket of boar-frost
on the outside of the vessel by condensation of watery vapour from the
surrounding atmosphere. The surprise and delight of the audience
reached a climax when liquid oxygen was poured from one open
vessel to another before their eyes.
   A matter of great importance in respect to the health of the com
munity was submitted to the Royal Society by the London County
Council, in a letter of date May 1, 1891, asking for information and
suggesting investigation regarding the vitality of microscopic patho
genic organisms in large bodies of water, such as rivers which are
sources of water-supply and which are exposed to contamination.
After some correspondence it was agreed, between the County Council
and the Council of the Royal Society, to enter upon an investigation,
the expense of which was to be defrayed partly by the London County
Council and partly by the Royal Society out of the Government Grant
for Scienti<U+FB01>c Research.     When we consider how much of disease
and death is due to contaminated water, we must feel that it is
scarcely possible to overestimate the vital importance of the pro

London     County Council and the Royal Society, for this great work,
may be successful in bringing out practically useful results.
   The President then presented the Medals       awarded by the Society,
as  follows :—
               Professor Stanislao Cannizzaro (Copley Medal).
   Stanislao Cannizzaro, Senator of Italy, and Professor of Chemistry
in the University of Rome, has rendered invaluable service to the
philosophy of modern chemical science. The work of Avogadro, in
1811, and afterwards that of Ampere, had already thrown much light
on the relative weights of the molecules of elementary bodies, and on
the proportions in which those weights enter into chemical combina
tion. But it is to Cannizzaro that we owe the completion of what
they had left un<U+FB01>nished.      He pointed out the all-important difference,
hitherto overlooked, between molecular and atomic weights, and
showed—(1) How the atomic weights of the elements contained in a
volatile   compound can be deduced from the molecular weights of
such    compounds; (2) how the atomic weights of the elements the
vapour-densities of whose compounds were unknown can be ascer
tained by help of their speci<U+FB01>c heats. By these investigations the
series of atomic weights of the elements, the most important of all
chemical constants, and the relation which these weights bear to the
molecular weights of the elements, have been placed on the <U+FB01>rm basis
on which they have ever since rested.           It is to Cannizzaro that
science is indebted for this fundamental        discovery, and it is this
which it is proposed to recognise by the award of the Copley Medal.
             Professor Charles Lapwo'rth, F.R.S. (Royal Medal).
   Professor Lapworth is the author of some of the most original and
 suggestive papers which have appeared in the geological literature of
 this country for the last twenty years.        Special reference may be
 made to his researches on graptolites, and to his patient investigation
 by these means of the exceedingly complicated           structure of the
 Silurian uplands of the South of Scotland.         He has been able not
 only to supply the key which has given the solution of the strati
 graphical dif<U+FB01>culties of that region, but also to furnish theoretical
 geology with an array of new facts from which to philosophise as to
 the mechanism of mountain-making.          Of not less importance are his
 detailed studies of the structure of the N orth-west Highlands and his
  demonstration of the true order of stratigraphical sequence in that
 region of complex disturbance.       As a stratigraphist he has attained
 the highest rank, and he has likewise made himself a chief palaeonto

  logical authority on the structure and distribution of the Graptolitidae.
  For some years past he has been engaged in a laborious study of the
.
   Silurian and Cambrian rocks of the middle of England, the detailed
  publication of which is awaited with much interest by geologists.
                     Professor Riiclrer,  F.R.S. (Royal Medal).
       In  conjunction with Professor Reinold, Professor Riicker carried
   out an important series of researches (extending over ten years) on
   thev electric resistance
                              and other physical properties of liquid <U+FB01>lms, in
   the course of which      the  fact was established that the black part of
   a soap <U+FB01>lm in equilibrium has a uniform or nearly uniform thick
   ness of    ll  or 12 micromillimetres, and that there is an abrupt
   augmentation      across its border to a thickness of about 30 or 40 micro
   millimetres in passing to the coloured portions._ This, considered in
   connection with the well-known sudden opening out of the little black
   areas in an ordinary soap-bubble, proves a minimum of surface-tension
   for some thickness between 10 and 50 micromillimetres, which, in the
   ordinary soap-bubble unmodi<U+FB01>ed by Reinold and Riicker's electric
   current, is temporarily balanced in virtue of the abrupt change of
   thickness, a proposition of fundamental importance in the molecular
   theory, implying the existence of molecular heterogeneousness.
       In theoretical calculations connected with the compounding of
   dynamos and motors to produce constant potential difference, constant
   current, or constant speed, electricians did not see their way to obtain
   results of a suf<U+FB01>ciently simple character to be of use in practice, it
   they employed a function of the current which fairly represented the
    magnetism.       They were, therefore, compelled to assume in such
    calculations that the magnetism was a linear function of the current,
    although it was well known that this was very far from being true
    when the current was large.          Professor Riicker, however, developed
    a simple    method   of  attacking such problems, and showed how the
    magnetic saturation of 'the iron might be taken into account, and
    a comprehensive      solution of the general problem of compounding
    dynamos and motors obtained in a workable form.          Professor Riicker’s
    paper containing his investigation,        and which will be found in the
    ‘
      Proceedings of the Physical Society,’ is a most valuable contribution
    to the theory of direct-current dynamos and motors.
        Professor Riicker    has,  with the co-operation of Professor Thorpe,
    completed a Magnetic       Survey of the British Isles (1884—89), which,
    independently of its great value in investigations of the distribution
     of the earth’s magnetism, and the changes to which it is subject, is
     specially remarkable for the exhaustive discussion of the observations
     in reference to regions of local magnetic disturbance, and their rela~
     tion to the geological constitution of the earth’s crust in the neigh

bourhood.    Professor Riicker has followed up this discussion by a
          “ The Relation between the
paper  on                            Magnetic Permeability of Rocks
and Regional Magnetic Disturbances,” read before the Royal Society.
The high estimate that has been formed of the value of this
Magnetic Survey is perhaps most easily appreciated from the very
large sums that the Government       Grant Committee have recom
mended should be contributed to aid in the completion of this work
of international importance.
                   Professor Victor Meyer (Dewy J/Iedal).
  Professor Victor Meyer, formerly the successor of Wo'hler at
Gdttingen, and who now occupies the chair of Bunsen at Heidel
berg, is eminent as an original worker and discoverer in almost every
branch of chemical science. His methods of determining the vapour
densities of substances have been of the greatest service to chemists,
not only as convenient and generally applicable modes of ascertain
ing atomic and molecular weights, but also as serving. to throw light
on the molecular constitution of elements and compounds          under
varying conditions of temperature and pressure.     A striking example
of the value of these methods is seen in their application by their
author to the study of the molecular dissociation of the element
iodine—one of the most masterly investigations of recent years, and
which is universally recognised as of the very highest signi<U+FB01>cance
and importance.    Not less noteworthy are Victor Meyer’s services to
organic chemistry.   His work on the nitroso-bodies, and his brilliant
discovery of thiophene, the initial member of a class of substances
hitherto unknown, his subsequent synthetical formation of       it,and
the remarkable series of researches on its derivatives, in part carried
out with the aid of his pupils, stamp him as an investigator of
exceptional power and distinction.

DEAR Sm WILLIAM THOMSON,
                                            I
   The following Observation, which have just made, may interest
the members of the Royal Society, and if you think it of suf<U+FB01>cient
importance you may announce it at this day’s meeting.
                              I
   At 3 P.M. this afternoon placed a quantity of liquid oxygen in the
state of rapid ebullition in air (and therefore at a temperature of
——181° C.) between the poles of the historic Faraday magnet, in a
cup-shaped piece of rock salt (which           I have found is not moistened
by liquid oxygen, and therefore keeps it in the spheroidal state), and
to my surprise   I have witnessed the liquid oxygen, as soon as the
magnet was stimulated, suddenly leap up to the poles and remain there
permanently attached until it evaporated.             To see liquid oxygen
suddenly attracted by    the  magnet    is a  very   beautiful  con<U+FB01>rmation of
our knowledge of the properties of gaseous oxygen.

   VOL. L.                                                             s

248                          Mr. H.     L. Callendar.                  [Dec. 10,
ture,"  "‘ I described in detail a somewhat elaborate form of air ther
mometer with which it was found possible to attain an accuracy of
the order of 001° C.         I  have since succeeded in overcoming some of
the dif<U+FB01>culties   encountered      in that investigation, and in evolving on
similar lines a form of instrument which is capable of a much higher
order of accuracy, and which has the further advantage that both the
observations and the calculations are immensely simpli<U+FB01>ed.
    The standard instrument for measuring temperature selected by
 Regnault in his classical researches was the constant-volume air
thermometer.        In my earlier experiments            I employed air thermo
 meters of this type, but modi<U+FB01>ed them by the introduction of a
sulphuric acid gauge of small bore between the thermometric bulb
and the mercury manometer.                 I was thus enabled to reduce the
correction to be applied for the small volume of air which was not
exposed to the temperature to be measured, and at the same time to
observe small variations of temperature with greater accuracy.
    The constant-volume type of air thermometer, however, has
several disadvantages.         The degree of accuracy attainable depends
primarily on the exact measurement of pressure by means of a
mercury manometer.             The observations involved are slow and
 laborious, and     it is  dif<U+FB01>cult,    unless the temperature is absolutely
steady, to secure an accuracy of the order of a tenth of a degree C.
 At high temperatures this method has the further disadvantage that
 the bulb is exposed to variations of pressure, the eifect of which in
altering its volume cannot        be accurately     estimated.
    For  these and other reasons       I  soon abandoned the constant-volume
 air thermometer in favour of the constant-pressure type. The bulb
 may thus be entirely freed from stress at high temperatures, and the
 mercury manometer may be dispensed with. The auxiliary reservoir

    With the form of instrument described in the previous paper, it

 found to be by far the greatest source of uncertainty.            I was so much
 impressed with this      in the course of some experiments on the boiling
 point of sulphurf that I determined to construct an instrument
  which should be altogether independent of the measurement of
 mercury columns.

standard constant pressure, the trouble of reading the barometer will
be saved, and the calculations will be considerably simpli<U+FB01>ed.     The
simplest, and at the same time the most accurate, method of securing a
standard constant pressure is to connect the outer limb of the
sulphuric acid gauge to a glass bulb <U+FB01>lled with air of suitable
density, and kept in melting ice, preferably in the same receptacle
as the mercury bulb in which the dilatation of the air is measured.
The pressure in the thermometric bulb can easily be adjusted to
equality with the standard pressure to within 1 or 2Imm. of sulphuric
acid, and the small outstanding difference of pressure can be read
quickly and accurately by means of a kathetometer microscope.
   I set up an experimental instrument of this kind in October, 1890,
and satis<U+FB01>ed myself that it was quite possible to read its indications
to the thousandth     part of       C. at ordinary temperatures. This,
                                a degree
I believe, to be  a very much higher order of accuracy than has
hitherto been thought attainable with an air thermometer.      My only
remaining   di<U+FB02>iculty was the  slight  uncertainty  as to the mean tem
perature of the connecting tubes. By the use of the sulphuric acid
gauge   it is possible to make this correction comparatively small, but
it still remains uncertain, and varies slightly with the extent of
immersion of the stem of the thermometer.          It is also a rather
troublesome correction to apply, and complicates all the calculations
very considerably.
   It has since occurred to me that this troublesome and uncertain
correction may be entirely eliminated, both from the observations and
from the calculations, with this particular form of instrument, by
making the standard pressure bulb communicate with a set of con
necting tubes equal in volume and similarly situated to those of the
thermometric bulb itself.
   The method of determining the correction to be applied for that
part of the stem of which the temperature is variable, by means of
a  similar compensating tube placed in close proximity to       has it,
occasionally been applied by previous observers.   It was <U+FB01>rst em
ployed by Deville and Troost in 1864!, in their experiments on the
expansion of porcelain at high temperatures.    They connected the
compensating   tube  to a separate manometer,  and by observing the
pressure or the amount of the air       contained were enabled to
                                             it
eliminate the term representing the e<U+FB02>‘ect of the connecting tubes
from their equations.
    Other observers     have used a similar device, but, so far as  I  am
aware, no one has     hitherto noticed that, in the case of the di<U+FB01>erential
air thermometer, the compensation can be rendered automatic, so that
changes of temperature of the connecting tubes have no eiiect on the
readings, and need not be taken into account in the calculations.
   The conditions under which the compensation is perfect with the

form of instrument above described are very simple.                   They are, (1)
that the two sets of connecting tubes should be of equal volume and
at the same mean temperature; (2) that the mass of air enclosed in
the standard pressure bulb should be equal to that in the thermo
metric and mercury bulbs ; (3) that the pressures should be adjusted
to equality.
   Let   m" be   the mass of air in the standard pressure bulb and its
connecting    tubes, and let 100 be its pressure.             Let V0 he the volume
of the bulb, and do its temperature measured on the scale of the
air thermometer.      Let 1: be the volume of the connecting tubes, and
9' their mean temperature ; then we have
                              p0  {Vt/00+v/e'} =      'm'uki
where k is a constant.
   Let ml be the mass of air in the thermometric and mercury bulbs
and their connecting tubes, and let p, be its pressure.               Let V1, V"l be
the volumes of the air in these bulbs respectively at the tempera
tures 01 and 6,"; then we have as before
                      )1,  {V1/01+V,./0.+v/0’}          =    er.
   It now we make     mo   =     m,, and p0   =  191, we have the equation
                                      = V|/01+Vm/0m+v/0I.
   The term 11/0' disappears from the equation, and if we also make
00 = 0,, by keeping both the mercury and standard pressure bulbs in
melting    ice, the value of       01 is accurately giVen by the very simple
expression
                               0,  = V.e,/(Vo-V,,.).
   It is convenient, and at the same time more symmetrical, to make
the volume of the standard pressure bulb adjustable with mercury.
It is then possible to take observations with the same thermometer at
different pressures. By this means, as explained in a previous paper,*
we can investigate with some accuracy the behaviour of gases at high
temperatures, and thus reduce the indications of the air thermometer
to the true scale of absolute temperature.
   The form of instrument above described is designed for the most
accurate work. For rough purposes, and especially for small ranges
of temperature, very much simpler instruments may be constructed
on  similar principles.
   It  is evident, from an inspection of the equations already given,
that the compensation is still sut<U+FB01>ciently accurate for rough work,
provided that the difference of pressure is small, and that the volume

   of the connecting       tubes is not too large compared with that of the
   bulb.   It is often a matter     of great convenience to have the thermo-          _
  metric   bulb    at  some distance from the indicating apparatus, and not
  rigidly connected to it. Since the connecting tubes are compensated,
  they may be made of considerable length and of <U+FB02>exible material,
  such as compo. or even rubber tubing, without much loss of
  accuracy.
      For moderate ranges of temperature, an auxiliary bulb for             meaSur
  ing the dilatation of the air and adjusting the pressures to              equality
. may be dispensed with.             The sulphuric acid gauge itself         may be
  graduated     to   indicate  the difference of temperature between        the two
  bulbs.    In ordinary work, however, it would be inconvenient either
  to keep the standard bulb always at the same temperature, or to take
  its temperature and do an addition sum at each observation.                   The
  simplest way of avoiding this is to adjust the volume of the sulphuric
  acid in the pressure gauge so that its expansion may compensate for
  the dilatation of the air in the standard pressure bulb.               This com
  pensation may readily be made suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate over the small
  range of temperature of the air of a workshop or laboratory.
      When the instrument is thus compensated for changes of tempera
  ture in the standard bulb, one tube of the pressure gauge can be
  graduated directly in degrees to indicate the temperature of the
  thermometric bulb.            The indications are then as easy to read as
  those   of a mercury thermometer.           They are not a<U+FB01>ected by changes
  of temperature in the surrounding air or by variations in the height
  of the barometer, and they are independent of the length of stem
  immersed. The range covered by a single instrument may be 100° C.
  or more, and may be made to correspond to any part of the scale by
  suitably adjusting the volumes of the air bulbs and tubes of the
  pressure gauge.
     I have found         such   thermometers*     exceedingly    convenient     and
  satisfactory for rough work at temperatures beyond the range of
                                                                                        ‘

  tenth of a degree at 450° 0., and if properly compensated their
  indications are very reliable.          Such a degree of accuracy is amply
  su<U+FB02>icient for most purposes, and the absence of all necessity for cal
  culation or correction of the readings is a very great advantage.

       geneous Glass for the Mirrors of Telescopes."         By A. A.
       COMMON, LL.D., F.R.S.      Received November 18, 1891.
    In 1880  I ordered of the St. Gobain Glassworks, through their
London agent, M. de Grand Ry, a disk of glass for the mirror of a
5-foot telescope. The limit of weight imposed by the manufacturers
permitted a disk of about 61 inches diameter and 5 inches thickness;
this was made with a hole through the middle of 10 inches, in order to
enable the telescope to be used as a Cassegrain telescope if required.
    Not being in a position to begin work at that time, the disk of
glass was left in its case, standing against a wall, at a slight angle,
till 1886, when it was put upon a grinding machine to be worked into
a mirror.     With the intention of acquiring the necessary skill to
make a good mirror, I intended to make many mirrors of this one
disk by successive re-grinding and re-<U+FB01>guring.
    The <U+FB01>rst polishing was done before the whole surface of the glass
was brought down to a uniform face.
    On inspection by Foucault’s method of testing at the centre of
curvature, the image of a round hole was found to be very elliptical;
very little attention was paid to this at the time, as it was thought
that subsequent work would bring all right. After many re-grind
ings, in each of which a practically new mirror was made, this
elliptic appearance of the image persisted. Local polishing was tried,
to improve the <U+FB01>gure of revolution, without success, in fact it made
matters worse.      The telescope mounting being ready in 1888, the
mirror was <U+FB01>nished as well as possible, and put into the telescope,
where a star could be examined, this not being possible when the
mirror was on the machine ; for photographic purposes the mirror was
fair, giving good stellar images, but for visual work, with moderate
powers, the de<U+FB01>nition did not come up to the required standard.
    It was of interest to <U+FB01>nd the cause of this bad image; at <U+FB01>rst it
was thought that the long time the disk had stood on edge, at an
angle, had caused it; in this case it might in time become less; but,
after being re-made in 1889, and again in 1890, the mirror was, if
anything, worse than before. When polished, in certain lights broad
bands of colour, red and blue, could be seen in the body of the glass
about a foot from the edge all round, indicating in my opinion
much internal tension, probably due to imperfect annealing.
    Another disk was ordered in December, 1888, as soon as the <U+FB01>rst
had been tried in the telescope.    This second 'disk was delivered in
1890 and made into a mirror, without showing in the slightest
                                                  '
manner any of the defects of the <U+FB01>rst.
    In the course of the work on this last disk, a discovery was ma

1891.]     Well-Annealed Glass    for the Alirrors of Telescopes.     253
that most probably explains the cause of failure of the <U+FB01>rst; in the
process of polishing a certain amount of heat is produced, and it was
always the custom to allow the mirror to cool down for some hours
before testing ; it was also always considered that some slight change
of focal length was caused by the heat, but I was quite unprepared,
on testing the mirror directly after polishing, in order to determine
what this change amounted to, to <U+FB01>nd the enormous amount thus
produced.    After two hours <U+FB01>guring with a 15-inch polisher, with
the face of harder resin than usual, so that the friction and heat
were below the average amount in one polishing, the change of focal
length was found to be 4 inches, that is to say, the image was made
4 inches further from the mirror than the usual place, or the mirror
had at that time a radius of curvature 2 inches greater than the
normal; in the course of three hours this had disappeared, and the
image was produced at the normal place. As the whole trouble of
the <U+FB01>rst mirror was caused by opposite diameters of the same zone
coming to a focus in planes differing by about {6 of an inch, it can
easily be seen that this may have been caused by the failure of the
glass to contract in a perfect and regular manner; in <U+FB01>guring, a
large amount of the work would necessarily be done on the expanded
glass, and it is reasonable to suppose that the <U+FB01>gure thus given
 would be correct while the glass was in this state, but that on
cooling, unless the glass contracted regularly, this correct <U+FB01>gure
would be lost.
   After the second mirror was <U+FB01>nished the <U+FB01>rst mirror was re-ground,
 and the polishing was done very slowly, half-an-hour in the morning,
 and the same time in the evening, with manifest improvement in the
 <U+FB01>gure, but still without getting rid of all the defects.
   That the fault was in the glass there is no doubt; the method of
 working adopted shows, in the case of the second 5-foot, and in other
 mirrors of 20-, 30-, and 36-inch mirrors, that a perfect surface of
 revolution can always be obtained if the glass is good; unless this
 perfect surface of revolution is obtained, it is quite hopeless to expect
 a good mirror.
   The makers could not re-anneal the <U+FB01>rst disk, but they have under
 taken, in a very handsome manner, to replace it by a new one; this
 i hope will be as good as the second one made by them, which is as
 nearly as possible perfect.

   In the ‘Electrical World,’ May, 1887, p. 258, or the ‘Electrical
Engineer’ (New York), June, 1887, p. 211, “Novel Phenomena of

   In the case of a ring of metal in the presence of an electromagnet,
in the coils of which an alternating current is passing, a force of
repulsion is experienced by the ring, which may be explained as

against an attraction due to the summative effects of weak currents
of the same direction during a shortened period, the resultant e<U+FB01>ect

 to the line joining their centres, repel one another when an alternating
 current traverses one of them, and that if they be placed with their
 centres coincident and planes making an acute angle, there will be a
 couple tending to increase that angle.
    As these results have been used as means of measuring alternating

currents,     I
            have calculated in § 1 expressions for the intensities of the
force and couple respectively.
   Another experiment is the following :—A sheet of copper is placed
so as to half cover an alternating magnetic pole.    Upon this, near the
pole, is laid a hollow sphere of copper.    The electromagnetic action
produces a couple so powerful that the friction of rotation is over
come, and the sphere spun round.
   In order to throw light on this, after a theorem in § 2 as to the
kind of currents set up in a conductor,                     I
                                             have considered a number
of cases.   A thin circular in<U+FB01>nite cylindrical shell lies in an alter
nating <U+FB01>eld of currents parallel to its axis, and the couple upon it is
found.    The result is applied to give the couples on two such shells
in the presence of a parallel current and of a pair of currents forming
                            ‘
an electromagnet,
  The couple in action upon a thin spherical shell in a general
periodic <U+FB01>eld, has next been found, and is applied to give the couples
on two thin shells under the in<U+FB02>uence of—
      (i.) An alternating current in a straight in<U+FB01>nite wire.
     (it) A pair of such currents forming an electromagnet.
     (iii.) An alternating magnetic pole.
     (iv.) An alternating electromagnet of very short length.
     It transpires
                that, whatever the <U+FB01>eld in action upon the cylinder and
sphere (the former   consisting of currents parallel to the axis), there
will be no couple if the <U+FB01>eld be completely in one phase. Thus, the
sphere of Professor Thomson is made to spin because the currents
induced in the copper plate do not coincide in phase with those of the
magnet, and not (as has been stated) because it acts as a screen and
renders the <U+FB01>eld unsymmetrical.     Were the plate a perfect conductor,
it would be a perfect              screen,   but there would be no couple.

communication with regard to the magnetic and other properties of
liquid oxygen, but     I  am con<U+FB01>ned to the Laboratory, owing to di<U+FB02>i

   The following Papers were read       :——
I. “The ‘Ginger-beer Plant,’ and the Organisms composing
      it: a Contribution to the Study of F ermentation-yeasts
      and Bacteria.”        By H. MARSHALL WARD, M.A., F.R.S.,
      F.L.S., Professor of Botany at the Forestry School, Royal
      Indian Engineering College, Cooper’s Hill.                     Received
      November 19, 1891.
   The author has been engaged for some time in the investigation of
 aremarkable compound organism found in home-made ginger-beer
 fermentations.

262          Prof. H. M. Ward.        The “ Ginger-beer Plant,”           [Dec    17,
   Itoccurs as jelly-like, semi-transparent,  yellowish-white masses,
aggregated into brain-like clumps,  or forming deposits at the bottom
of the fermentations, and presents resemblances to the so-called
Kephir grains of the Caucasus, with which, however, it is by no
means identical.
  He <U+FB01>nds that        it consists essentially of
                                            a. symbiotic association of a
speci<U+FB01>c Saccharomycete  and a Schizomycete, morphologically comparable
to a Lichen, but, as met with naturally, invariably has other species
of yeasts, bacteria, and mould-fungi casually associated with these.
  He has successfully undertaken the separation of the various forms,
and groups them as follows :—
  1. The essential organisms are a yeast, which turns out to bea
new species allied to Saacharomyces ellipsoideus (Reess and Hansen),
and which he proposes to call 5'. pynformis; and a bacterium, also
new and of a new type, and named by him Bacterium vermiforme.
  2. Two other forms were met with in all the specimens (from
various parts of the country and from America) examined—Mycoderma
cez'evisice (Desm.) and Bacterium aceti (Kiitzing and Zopf).
   3. As foreign intruders, more or less commonly occurring in the
various specimens examined, were the following :—
  1.      A pink or rosy yeast-like form—Cryptococcus glutimis (Fresenius.)?
   )8.A small white a'érobian top-yeast, with peculiar characters, and
not identi<U+FB01>ed with any known form.                      v
  q. The ordinary beer-yeast— Saccharomyces     cerem'sz'w (Mcyen and
Hansen).
   5.     Three, or probably four, unknown yeasts of rare occurrence.
  s.      A bacillus which forms spores, and lique<U+FB01>es gelatine with                   a
greenish tinge.
  §.   A large spore-forming bacillus, which also lique<U+FB01>es gelatine.
  1;  and 0. Two—perhaps three—other Schizomycetes not identi<U+FB01>ed.
   L. A large yeast-like form which grows into a mycelium,   and turns
out to be Oid'ium  lactis (Fresenius).
  x. A common blue monld—Penicillium glaucum (Link).
  A. A brown
                “ Torula”-like form, which turns out to be Demat'iam
pullulans (De Bary).
      One, or perhaps several,
  '11..                                species     of   “
                                                            Torula ” of   unknown
origin and fates.
   Of these forms, the author          has succeeded           in cultivating    and
examining       very thoroughly all but those under           0 and ,u in the   fore
                                                                                  -
going list.
  Saccharomyces  pyriformis (n.sp.)  a remarkably anaérobian bottom~
                                        is
yeast,  forming spores,  and  developing  large, quantities of carbon
dioxide, but forming little alcohol.  It has also an aerobian form—
veil form of Hansen—in which the rounded cells grow out into club
shaped or pyriform cells, whence the proposed speci<U+FB01>c name. It inverts

1891.]                  and  the Organisms     composing it.                263
cane sugar, and fermeuts the products        ; but it is unable to ferment milk
sugar.      It forms  rounded,   morula-like,   white colonies in gelatine, and
the author has separated pure cultures from these.                 He has also
studied the development and germination of the spores, which are
formed in 24—48 hours at suitable temperatures on porous earthen
ware blocks.       They also develop on gelatine.‘
    The technological characters have been kindly determined and
con<U+FB01>rmed for the author by Mr. Horace Brown, F.R.S., and Dr.
Morris, of Burton-on-Trent.
    The speci<U+FB01>c Schizomycete (Bacterium vermtforme, n.sp.) has been
very fully studied by the author.          It occurs in the fermentations as
rodlets or <U+FB01>laments, curved or straight, encased in a remarkably thick,
<U+FB01>rm, gelatinous sheath, and is pronouncedly ana'érobic, so much so,
that the best results are got by cultivating it in carbon dioxide under
                                 ‘
pressure.
    The sheathed <U+FB01>laments are so likeworms, that the name proposed
for the species is appropriately derived from this character.
    It will not grow on gelatine, and separation cultures had to be
made     in saccharine liquids by the dilution methods.
    It grows     best in solutions of beet-root, or of cane sugar, with re
 latively large quantities of nitrogenous organic matter—e.g., bouillon,
 asparagin—‘and tartaric acid.           Good results were obtained with
 mixtures of Pasteur’s solution and bouillon.
    The author found that the bacterium into which the <U+FB01>laments sub
 sequently break up can escape from its sheath and become free, in
 which state it divides rapidly like ordinary bacteria.          Eventually, all
 the forms—<U+FB01>laments,        long rods, short rodlets—break up into cocci.
 No spores have been observed.           These changes are dependent espe
 cially on the nutritive medium, but are also affected by the gaseous
  environment and the temperature.            The jelly-like clumps of the so
          “                      ” are
  called    ginger-beer plant          essentially composed of these sheathed
  and coiled     Schizomycetes, entangling the cells of Saccharomyces
 pyriform'is. But the action of the Schizomycete alone on the sac
  charine medium di<U+FB02>'ers from that exerted when it is associated with
  the yeast, and from that exerted by the latter alone.
     This was proved by cultivating each separately, and also by culti
  vations in which, while each organism was submerged in the same
  fermentable medium, they were separated by permeable porcelain
   (Chamberland <U+FB01>lters), through which neither could pass.
     The author has also reconstructed the “ginger-beer plant ” by
   mixing pure cultures of the above two organisms ; the SchiZomycete
   entangled the yeast-cells in its gelatinous coils, and the synthesised
   compound organism behaved as the specimens not analysed into their
   constituents.
      Some   very curious phenomena in connexion with the formation of
     YQL. L.                                                            T

                                           Ginger-beer                                 [Dec   17.
the gelatinous sheaths and the escape of the bacteria from them were
observed in hanging-drop cultures, and are <U+FB01>gured and described by
the author.   The conditions for the development of the gelatinous
sheaths—and     therefore of the coherent brain-like masses of the
Schizomycete—are a saccharine acid medium and absence of oxygen.
The process occurs best in carbon dioxide : it is suppressed in bouillon,
and in neutral solutions in hydrogen, though the organism grows in
the free, non-sheathed, motile form under these conditions.
  The behaviour of pure cultures of the bacteria in as complete a
vacuum as could be produced by a good mercury pump, worked daily,
and even several times a day for several weeks, is also noteworthy.
The author records his thanks to his friend and colleague Professor
McLeod for much assistance in regard to this apparatus. The develop
ment of the sheaths is apparently inde<U+FB01>nitely postponed in vacuo, but
the organism increased, and each time the pump was set going an
appreciable quantity of carbon dioxide was obtained.      In vacuum
tubes the same gas was evolved, and eventually attained a pressure
suf<U+FB01>cient to burst some of the tubes. The quantity of carbon dioxide
evolved daily by the action of the bacterium alone, however, is small
compared with that disengaged when the organism is working in
concert with the symbiotic yeast ; in the latter case the pressure of the
gas became so dangerous that the author had to abandon the use of
scaled tubes.
  The products of the fermentation due to the Schizomycete have not
yet been fully determined in detail; lactic acid, or some allied com
pound, seems to be the chief result, but there are probably other
bodies as well.
  The author owes acknowledgment                          to Dr. Matthews,           of Cooper’s
Hill, for advice and assistance in examining the products of                               these
fermentations.                                  ,
  The pink yeast-like form proved to be very interesting.          It has
nothing to do with the   “  ginger-beer plant   proper, though it was
                                                                   ’-’
invariably met with as a foreign intruder in the specimens.           The
author identi<U+FB01>es     with a form described by Hansen, in 1879
                           it                                                                   ;*
unfortunately the original     in Danish, but the <U+FB01>gures are so good
                                           is
that little doubt  entertained as to the identity. It
                       is                                 also probably       is
the same as Fresenius’ Cryptococcus glutinis in one of its forms.    It
not a Saccharomycete, and does not ferment like                                                     is is

   The chief discovery of interest was that in hanging drops the
author traced the evolution of this “rose-yeast” into a large com
plex mycelinm, bearing conidia, and so like some of the Basidio~
mycetes that     it    may almost certainly be regarded as                     a     degraded or

 “torula” stage of one of these higher fungi. Full descriptions and
<U+FB01>gures are given by the author.
   The form Mycoderma cereris'laa was thoroughly examined.             The
author’s results con<U+FB01>rm what is known as to its aérobian characters.
Statements as to its identity with O'iclium lactis were not only not
con<U+FB01>rmed,     but the author    grew  these two forms side by side, and
maintains their distinctness.       Nor could he obtain spores in this
fungus, thus failing to con<U+FB01>rm earlier statements to the contrary.
He regards it as probable that oil-drops have been mistaken for
Spores; he also <U+FB01>nds that in later stages of fermentation by this
Organism a strong oily-smelling body is produced.
   With regard to Bacterium aceti, the author has nothing new to add.
A point of some interest was the repeated production of acetic ether,
Which scented the laboratory when this Schizomycete was growing
in company with the small white aerobian top-yeast referred to
under          As this phenomenon was found to have nothing to do
with the question being investigated, the author did not pursue it
further.    It seemed probable, however, that the yeast produced alcohol,
which the_ Schizomycete, in presence of oxygen, partially oxidised,
and that the fragrant ether was produced by interaction of the pro
ducts.
   With   regard   to the other forms found. the author was chie<U+FB02>y con
cerned with testing their relations to the important and essential
organisms.      It need only be remarked here that hanging-drop
cultures of Dematinm pullulans were very successful, and that some
of the moulds, and at least one bacillus (of which the spore-forma
tion, &c., were traced also), were traced to the ginger used in the
manufacture of the well-known beverage.
   The author hopes very shortly to have the honour to lay before the
 Society a full account of his research, of which the above is only a
brief notice.    The fuller account will contain detailed descriptions, as
well as <U+FB01>gures of the apparatus, mode of culture, &0.

      Preliminary Statement on the Lycopodinse and Ophio
      glossaceee.”     By F. O. BOWER, F.R.S. Received Novem—
      ber 27, 1891.
   It is currently held that the sporophyte, or neutral generation in
archegoniate plants, is the result of elaboration of the zygote : that
 while in certain Algae the zygote simply divides to form a number of
 spores (carpospores), in the lower Bryophyta there has been a differ
 entiation of an external, sterile, and protective wall, distinct from the
                                                                'r 2

     266                 Prof. F. O. Bower.      Studies in the        [Dec  17,
     internal mass of spores. The higher Bryophyta show a larger pro
     portion of sterile tissue, which in them composes the seta, columella,
     and wall, while the sporogenous tissue is comparatively reduced in
     bulk, though still forming one united band.          In the vascular plants
     the proportion of sterile tissue to the sporogenous tissue is larger
     still; elaboration of form has in them resulted in the production of
     appendicular organs, while the sporogenous tissue is partitioned o<U+FB01>
      into small, isolated masses, or even single cells, these being situated
     in members which are commonly called sporangia. The series from
      the lowest to the highest of these types probably illustrates the
      essential points in the actual process of evolution of the higher from
      the lower forms; from it we recognise that the ascending series
       shows a progressive sterilisation of the tissues of the neutral genera
      tion, and also an increasing elaboration of external form and internal
      structure, the two lines of progress going, in a measure, hand in hand.
          It is obvious that, if the progression were as above stated, the
      function of the spore-production preceded the vegetative functions
      of the sporophyte in point of time; spore-producing         members may,
      in this sense, he termed primary from the point of view of descent, and
       the vegetative members, secondary,- the morphology of spore-pro
      ducing members should accordingly take precedence of the morpho
      logy of vegetative members, and an exhaustive study of the former
      is therefore specially necessary.
          The widest gap in the series of those plants which show antithetic
      alternation is believed to be that between the Bryophyta and the Vas
      cular Cryptogams; to bridge over this gap between plants with
       simple form and united archesporium, and those with ccmplex form
      and separate small archesporia, is the most clearly outstanding prob
       lem of morphology.     Of intermediate forms there are practically none
 "on   known; but it is believed by the author that a careful examination
 v-
.7.,   of the spore-producing members of the lower vascular plants, with
 ,+
       special regard to their development, will best lead to some clear
       opinion  as to the way   in which the transition may have taken place.
       A   comparison of such plants as form natural series may demonstrate
       progressions of elaboration and sterilisation, which may be regarded
       as analogous to the progression from the Bryophyta to the Vascular
       Cryptogams.     Such an analogous progression is believed to be found
       in the Lycopodinaa and Ophioglossaceee. Even if this analogy be not
        admitted, the further investigation of the sporangia of certain rarer
       and less known Vascular Cryptogams, to be described below, will be
       of sn<U+FB02>icient interest to justify the work.
           The present preliminary statement will refer to the Lycopodinm
       and Ophioglossaceee only.
           The simplest known type of the former is Phylloglossum, which I
       agree   with Dr. Treub in regarding      as a   truly rudimentary form.

1891.]         Morphology of Spore-producing Members.                  267
The sporophyte consists of two parts :—(i) the protacorm, with its
protophylls and roots, and (ii) the strobilus, with sporophylls and
sporangia.    The transition from        to (ii) is usually sudden, and
without intermediate steps.
   The sporangium of Phylloglossum, as regards its external form, is inter
mediate in character between that of Lycapodiu'm Selago and L. alpinum ;
the archesporium consists of a single row of about six cells, only one
of which appears in each radial section; in this, Phylloglossum is like
L. selago. The whole strobilus also, when mature, is closely similar
to that of a simple 1'4/cop0d'ium, and the development of the spor
anginm corresponds also in all essential points.
   Several species of Lycopodium have been examined as regards the
structure and development of the sporangium; previous investigators
have <U+FB01>gured only radial sections; it is obvious that radial, transverse,
and tangential sections in various stages will be necessary for the
complete description of the development of so large and complex a
body ; the result of comparison of such sections has been—(i). to acquire
a. clear   knowledge of the form and composition of the arche
sporium, and (ii) to show that this varies in different species of the
genus.
   Two cases will  be brie<U+FB02>y described, viz., L.. Selago and.L.. clavatum.
   In the former  the sporangium appears as a rather narrow, sharply
convex outgrowth from the upper surface of the sporophyll ; the
archesporium consists of a single row of cells, of which one only
appears in the radial section; the smallest number seen in the tan
gential sections is seven, which may possibly be referable in origin
to three parent cells.  While the archesporium increases largely with
age, neither the stalk of the sporangium nor the sub-archesporial tissue
increases greatly in bulk, so that the mature sporanginm assumes the
form of a slightly curved sausage, attached by a comparatively slender
and long stalk.
   In L. olaoatum (to which also L. alpinum closely corresponds),
the sporangium appears as a broad, only slightly convex outgrowth;
the archesporium does not consist of a single row of cells, but usually
of three rows : thus three cells would appear in each radial section:
both radial and transverse sections show that these are not readily
referable inv origin to. a single parent cell.    In tangential section it
appears that ten or    more  cells may be  present in each row.     As the
archesporium grows, the stalk remains short and bulky, while the
sub-archesporial mass develops as a large pad of sterile tissue, which
arches the sporogenous tissue convexly upwards.          The whole spor
angium when mature is thus strongly curved, and is inserted on the
 sporophyll by a short and massive stalk. These characters are im
 portant for comparison with Opht'oglossum.
   It may be added that, so far as observations have yet been made on

 Selaginella, its sporanginm appears to be comparable to the Selago
t ype of I/yeopodium, though with differences of detail, which need
not now be speci<U+FB01>ed.
    The results obtained by observation of the Lycopodinw have been
used for purposes of comparison with the Ophioglossaceae, and the
result is a view as to the real nature of the so-called “fertile frond.”
This structure has long been a morphological crux, and various
opinions have been held with regard to it, which severally make
demands upon morphological faith. The theory now to be put forward
                            ”
is, that the “ fertile frond is an elaborated and partitioned sporangi'wm,
homologous with the smaller and non-partitioned sporangium of the
Lycopodinie.    Developmental evidence will now be adduced in support
of this theory.
   The “fertile frond” of Ophioglossum vulgatum arises as an out
                                        “ sterile lea ”: not, it is true, at
growth of the upper surface of the
the base, but rather below the middle : the cell-divisions do not cor
respond in detail to those in the young sporangium of Lycopodium,
but I do not think that, at the present day, this will be reckoned as a
material ground for rejecting an homology.         There is in fact, at <U+FB01>rst,
a single initial cell, with rather irregular segmentation, but the apical
                                                     “ fertile frond ”
growth of the elongated and upward directed                            passes
over shortly to the type with, apparently, four initials.
   The origin of the archesporium and sporogenous tissue has been
traced in Ophiode'rma pendulum by the help of material supplied
through the kindness of Dr. M. Trenb. In this plant, as in Oph-io
glossum, the sporangia are deeply sunk in the “fertile frond,” and
form a longitudinal series running along each lateral margin of             it,
and extending to the extreme apex. Transverse sections in the
young state Would thus show the archesporia at the most curved
points of the elliptical section. In the youngest transverse sections
which were observed, the archesporial tissue appears composed of
many cells, and     it    doubtful whether all be referable to a single
                         is
parent  cell;  but, seeing  that this section would correspond to what is
seen in a radial or a transverse section of the sporangium of Lycopodium,
and that there  is  a difference (e.g., between L. selago and L. elavatum)
as to the reference of the archesporium to a single cell in such sections
in di<U+FB02>’erent species of that genus, this question cannot be considered
as   vital one.
     a
   The archesporial tissue thus seen in transverse sections of the young
“ fertile frond,”  found in tangential and radial sections to be a con
                    is
tinuous band, which extends along each margin to the apex;             it   is
believed to correspond to the curved band of archesporial tissue in
Lycopodium, and may, therefore, be styled the potential archesporium.
But whereas in Lycopodium the whole of this tissue forms spores,
only parts of  develop as sporogenous tissue in Ophioderma: for, as
               it

 1891.]         Morphology    of Spore-producing    Members.            269
it grows older, the archesporial        band becomes differentiated into
 (a) sporogenoas masses,  which   soon  are densely <U+FB01>lled with protoplasm,
and develop further into spores, as already known, and (b) sterile
tissues, which intervene between these, and develop into the septa
between the sporangia, together with part of the tapetum.
    A similar continuous band of hypodermal tissue has been found in
 Ophioglossam also, and is believed to be the continuous potential
                                        ‘
archesporium.
    If the tissue thus recognised in Ophioderma, and, with less certainty,
in Ophioglossum, be the potential archesporium, and correspond to the
curved band of archesporium in Lycopodium, then the whole “ fertile
frond” of Ophioglossum and Ophioolerma must be homologous with
the sporangium of Lyoopodiam: the central tissue of the “fertile
frond” will be the counterpart of the sub-a-rchesporial mass of
Lycopodium, and the whole will illustrate the result of elaboration,
partial sterilisation, and consequent partitioning of the sporangiam.
    But it will further be pointed out that the Ophioglossaceae. which
are a natural family with obviously close a<U+FB01>inities, illustrate the pro
gress of elaboration of the sporangium by still further steps within
their own circle of af<U+FB01>nity.        This will appear on comparison of
Helininthostachys,   of which  I have  received well-preserved specimens,
collected in Ceylon by Mr. J. Bretland Farmer. Here the “fertile
        ”
frond     is not so simple as in Ophioglossum; its homology is, however,
demonstrated by its position, and by the fact that its main features of
early development are similar. The spore-producing parts are borne
along the two lateral margins; but, instead of the large sporangia
deeply sunk in the tissue, as in Ophioglossum, their place is taken in Hel
minthostaohys by branched outgrowths, each of which may bear a num
ber of smaller sporangia; these branched outgrowths may be styled
provisionally the sporangiophores. They are not disposed with strict
                                                           “
regularity, but are restricted to the margins of the fertile frond,”
and thus topographically they replace the sporangia of Ophioglossum .
functionally they do the same, for part at least of their tissue becomes
sporogenous.      The development of them has been traced, but it need
not now be described in detail; it will suf<U+FB01>ce to make the general
statement that it shows nothing incompatible with the theory above
put forward.      The sporangia correspond in their development and
 main features to those of Botrychium. A comparison of Helmintho
stachys with Ophioglossam would point to the conclusion that in the
 former is seen a further phase of elaboration, partial sterilisation, and
partitioning. If the archesporium of Ophioglossmn were further sub
 divided by sterilised partitions, aud the several parts raised by vege.
tative outgrowth of tissue, so as to project beyond the general
surface, the result would be something like that which is actually
 seen  in Helminthostachys.

270                Prof. F. O. Bower.      Studies in the       [Dec     17,
   A   somewhat similar view, though different in some details, may be
held also in the case of Botrychium.
   There are, however, other facts relating to both the Ophioglossaceae
and Lycopodinaa which are obvious externally, and which are,      I  think,
most readily explained on an hypothesis of elaboration and partial
sterilisation: these will now be brie<U+FB02>y alluded to. In certain species
of Lycopodium (e.g., L. Selago) there is no marked di<U+FB01>erence between
the foliage leaves and the sporophylls: in many other species the
difference is only slight.    It may be noted that in certain species
(e.g., L. alpinum)     towards the base of the strobilus the young
sporangia show gradual reduction in size, these leading on to cases of
complete abortion.      At the apex of the strobilus also there is often a
similar reduction    of the sporangia (Phylloglossum, L. clavatum, &c.),
the uppermost     leaves  being thus sterile.   Again in L. Selago and
some tropical species, sporangia are home on certain zones of the
plant, while on alternating zones there are only sterile leaves.    In the
Ophioglossaceaa also the leaves of weak plants are frequently sterile,
and bear no matured “fertile fronds”: examination of these, how
                                                                   ”
ever, frequently discloses a small and abortive “ fertile frond       occu
pying the position of the normal one. How are these organs in the
Lycopods and Ophioglossum to be explained unless they be regarded
as   the- reduced   and abortive remains of parts which under other
circumstances    might   have come to functional maturity?      They are,
in fact, evidence of further sterilisation, though in this case it is not
partial, but extends even to the whole sporogenous tissue of certain
sporangia.
   Putting together these last facts, and the developmental data pre
viously stated, the following seems to me to be a reasonable theory,
which will, I think, throw some light upon the probable relations of
the Lycopodinaa and Ophioglossacew from the point of view of
descent :—
   The primeval strobilus consisted of axis, sporophylls, and sporangia:
any of these parts was capable of further elaboration, and the balance
of them inter se might thus have been modi<U+FB01>ed.
   In Phylloglossum there is a small strobilus which springs directly
from the protocorm.       This whole strobilus is probably of a primitive
type,   and may correspond to an elaborated sporogonial head (see below).
   In the various species of Lycopodium the whole plant (exclusive of
the protocorm, &c.) represents an extended and branched form of
such a strobilus, of which many of the sporophylls have been steril
ised, and appear as the foliage leaves, having no sporangia.            The
whole plant shows a prevalence of development of the axis over the
leaves or sporangia.
    In the Ophioglossaceee the converse is the case; the axis remains
 relatively small (except in Helminthostachys, where it is seen as the

1891.]              Morphology   of Spore-producing   Members.        2 71
horizontal rhizome), while the sporophylls (= “ sterile fronds ”) and
sporangia (= “fertile fronds ”) are largely extended, the elaboration
of the two showing a remarkable parallelism.     In Oph'loglossum vul
gatu/m, where the sporophyll is simple though much larger than in
Lycopod'iwm,  the sporangium     (“fertile frond ”) is elongated and
partitioned by the sterilisation of transverse bands of the potential
archesporium.     In Ophioderma (as also in some species of Ophr'oglos
swm)    the sporophyll is irregularly lobed, while the sporangium
(“fertile frond”) is occasionally branched. In Helminthostaohys the
sporophyll is branched, and the whole sporangium (“ fertile frond ”)
is also branched occasionally; but in addition it shows that elabora
tion above described, and it may be looked upon as the result of
further partitioning of the archesporium, and outgrowth of separate
parts of the super<U+FB01>cial tissues as the “ sporangiophores.”  Finally, in
some species of Botrychium the sporophyll and sporangium (“ fertile
frond ”) are both repeatedly branched, and show the furthest diver
gence of the whole series from their simpler prototypes, which are the
sporophyll and sporangium of the Lycopods.
   In this view thus stated there is nothing incompatible with what
might be expected on a. priori grounds; on the contrary, there is
good reason to look upon such a progression as one of the natural
ways in which the number of spores produced might be increased,
such increase in number being obviously bene<U+FB01>cial.            Taking the
simple strobilus    as  the starting point“, one method would be the
elongation of the strobilus, and increase in the number of sporangia
produced upon         it,
                       they remaining individually of relatively small
size; this     the type seen in the Lycopods.
               is                                    A converse method
would be to increase the individual size of the sporangium, while the
number of sporangia might remain small and be matured at intervals      ;
this is exempli<U+FB01>ed by the Ophioglossaceae.    But     if
                                                     simple enlargement
of the sporangium took place, without subdivision of the archesporium,
the rapid supply of nourishment to the enlarged mass of growing
spores would be dif<U+FB01>cult, while at the period when the sporogenous
mass  is semi-<U+FB02>uid, owing to the cells separating from one another, and
<U+FB02>oating freely in <U+FB02>uid, the sporangium would run great risk of
mechanical injury from without, and a single puncture of the wall of
the large sporangium would ruin the whole.          These difficulties are
all avoided by partitioning of the sporangia; the sterile tissue of the
partitions, while strengthening the whole, would, together with the
increased sub-archesporial    mass, serve the more readily to bring
nourishment to the developing sporogenous tissue; the transfer          is
further provided for by the vascular system which extends upwards
through the centre of the “fertile frond,” and even into the
sporangiophores of Helmi-nthostaehys.
  The effect of this theory would be to bring the Ophioglossaceae

         systematically nearer to the Lycopodinaa; this relationship has been
         recognised by various writers on other grounds, and the characters of
         the sexual generation will even help to support this nearer affinity.
            A special interest will now centre round a small and very rare
         plant, viz., Ophioglossum Bergianum, one dried specimen of which
         I  received from Professor MacOwan.       It appears to show points of
         af<U+FB01>nity both to Phylloglossum and Ophioglossum.     While   it   is
                                                                         obviously

         (3) in the low point of insertion of the “fertile frond,” and (4) in
         the small number of partitions in     it (sporangia, 8—12), characters
         which suggest that its further investigation would probably disclose
         facts of the greatest importance.
            The relation of Isoetes to our series will naturally be a close one;
         just as the plant of Ophioglossu/m may be looked upon as a vertical
         strobilus, of which the large sporophylls are developed in slow suc
         cession, so also may Iaoetes be regarded as a simple vertical strobilus,
         but the leaves are more numerous; the leaf (sporophyll) is relatively
         large, though simple.     The sporangium is, in form, like      <U+FB02>attened

         is partitioned, more  or less completely,  and Goebel  has shown   clearly
  .      in his drawings how the hypodermal tissue, which may here also be
         styled the potential archesporium, becomes differentiated into sterile
         trabeculw and sporogenous cells.         To this di<U+FB01>erentiation   Ishould
4.5‘.»
         assign a similar interpretation to that in the Ophioglossaceaa; the
         sporangium is, however, less elaborated, and its size and prominence are
         not such as to have led to its sporangial character being lost sight of.
            Quite recently, on examining the <U+FB01>ne series of sections of Lepz'do
         strobus in the British Museum, I    have found processes of sterile tissue
         which spring    from  the  base of the  sporangium, and project far into
         the mass of spores; these appear to be comparable to the trabeculae
         of Isoetes, though di<U+FB01>ering in points of detail.
         I     do not think   itdesirable as yet to express opinions as to the
         bearing of this work upon the other Ferns. At present     am disposed
                                                                     I
         to think that the Ophioglossaceae and Isoetes are in an intermediate
         position between the Lycopods and other Ferns, and that their af<U+FB01>nity
         to the former  is certainly quite as close as to the latter.
            The Psilotaceie are probably a separate series, remote from both;
         they'will be dealt with on a later occasion.
            We have seen how the Ophioglossaceaa illustrate, according to our
         theory, the elaboration and partitioning of a sporangium, which in the
         Lycopods  is  relatively small and simple, and has an undivided arche
         sporium.    It is suggested that in this series there may be seen               a
         progression analogous to that by which the vascular plants originated
         from some Bryophytic forms with simple sporogonial head. Take,

  1891.]          Mmjuhology    of Spore-producing      illembers.           273
 for example, the strobilus of Lycopodium, or of Equisetum; it is not
  dif<U+FB01>cult to see how, from a Bryophyte with an archesporium such as
 that of Anthooeros, the strobilus might originate from the sporogonial
 head, by partitioning o<U+FB01> the archesporium (such as that seen in Ophio
 derma), and outgrowth of new members-from the surface (such as are
 seen in Helminthostachys).      The details of the process might doubtless
 be different; it is not even contended at present that this may have
 been the mode of origin of all the stocks of Vascular Cryptogams.
 But the point is that an elaboration similar to that which may be traced
'in  the spore-bearing members     of the Lycopodinw and Ophioglossacew of
 the present day might,        carried out in a worogom'um such as that of
 Anthoceros, result in a strobilus not unlike those of Equisetum or
 Lycopodium. The gap between the Bryophytes and Vascular Crypto
 gams would thus be bridged over by a hypothesis based upon
 analogy. I am fully aware how open uch a hypothesis is to criti
 cism, but    I think that it is better, after careful and widely extended
 comparative observation, to put out the hypothesis than to be content
 with no clear hypothesis at all. More especially is this so in the
 present case, where no intermediate types are at present known to
 exist, and where we have no special reason to expect that such types
 will be discovered.
    The above description      make    it evident that a revision of termino
 logy of spore-bearing members will be necessary; if the spore-bear
 ing member      of the Ophioglossaceaa be homologous with the sporan
 gium of Lycopodium, it is obviously undesirable to call it a “fertile
 frond.”      It could not, however, be termed a sporangium without
 violence to the meaning of this word.          I have not yet arrived at a.
 conclusion on such points as these, and shall defer the de<U+FB01>nition of
 the terms to be used until the memoir, of the contents of which this
 is a short and partial preliminary statement, shall be ready for pre
 sentation to the Society.
    In conclusion, no reference has been made in this statement to the
 higher plants.      Clearly the enunciation of new views with regard to
 the lower vascular plants must a<U+FB02>'ect opinions as to the morphology of
 the higher.      The interpretation of these will ultimately have to
 depend upon conclusions drawn from the study of the lower types.
 Hitherto it has been the practice to read the morphology of the lower
 forms in terms of the morphology of the higher; the converse will
 have to be ultimately adopted.           Nevertheless,     I have abstained at
 present   from   touching upon such questions as          these, partly because
 such discussions would obscure the present issues, partly because the
 time has hardly yet come for any general statement.

        Ph.D., Lecturer in Physiology in the University of Toronto.
        Communicated by Dr. H. NEWELL MARTIN, F.R.S.                              Re
        ceived April 23,—Read April 30, 1891'. . Revised August,

    The investigation, some of the results of which are to be given in
the present paper, was stimulated              by the conclusions of studies
which      I  carried on during the last <U+FB01>Ve years, and by the observa
tions of Bunge“ and Zaleskif on the occurrence of iron-holding
proteids in the food and in the liver. The conclusions which I drew
from my studies were :—
    (1.) That in Amphibia the haemoglobin is derived from the very
abundant chromatin of the hmmatoblastsi
    (2.) That in the maturing ova of Amphibia the abundant chromatin
of the nucleus di<U+FB01>uses out from the latter, and, as the diffusion com
mences and progresses, the yolk spherules appear and increase in
size.     In other words, chromatin constitutes a large part of each yolk
spherule.
           That there is a transference of chromatin from the maternal
tissues to the foetal villi in the placenta of the Cat, and that this
 chromatin is carried from the central portions of the villi by the
amoeboid cells of the latter onwards towards the foetus.
    From the <U+FB01>rst conclusion it follows that the chromatin of haemato
 blasts contains iron. A consideration of the remaining conclusions
points, however, to a wider distribution of iron.                Bunge found in
the yolk of the hen's egg an iron-holding nuclein, which, from its
   ‘  “Ueber die Assimilation   des Eisens,” ‘Zeit. f. Physiol. Chemie,’ v01. 9, p. 49.

 Chemie,’ vol. 10, p. 453.
   I  The observations on this subject are described in a paper which is to appear in
 the forthcoming number of the ‘ Transactions of the Canadian Institute.’

278            Dr. A. B. Macallum.          On the Demonstration
supposed connexion with inmatopoiesis in the developing
named hwmatogen.           In he amphibian ova also the irc
with a proteid <U+FB01>xed in the yolk spherules, and as this
all the characters of a nuclein, it is, therefore, in all prob
same compound as that described by Bunge.                  This nucle
rently, none other than the chromatin di<U+FB02>’used from the
the maturing ovum.          If so, it is possible that the original
nuclear chromatin of the ovum contains iron. Again, the
the 10wer Vertebrata receive the iron which is present in t]
larval life in combination with a nuclein, points to the
during the embryonic period in Mammalia of the same 0'
endowment with an iron-holding nuclein.                There is, in 1
stated already, a transference of chromatin from the mate
faetal tissues.     Judging from all the aspects of these quest
inferred also that, in the transference of chromatin to t
the latter receives all the iron which it requires.
    These points, taken in connexion with the fact that Zalei
from the liver cells of various animals a nuclein in wt
<U+FB01>rmly bound, led me to the generalisation that the ob
every cell contains iron as a necessary constituent of itsel:
mined to test the accuracy of this generalisation.               Under
tions, Mr. R. R. Bensley isolated, from lamb’s testicles and
thymus, quantities of nuclein, which, when carefully pui
not the slightest iron reaction, but in the ash of which

    Although care was taken to obtain the nuclein
haematin, yet     I  was not certain that we did obtain it absi
pure condition.        It is well known that <U+FB01>xed or dead
readily     absorbs  dyes, and, as it is extremely probable that
is exercised on other substances, it may well be be]
    * In the preparation of nuclein from these sources we proceeded
The organs, freed from connective tissue structures, were <U+FB01>nely mince
up in a glass mortar with a small quantity of a 2 per cent. solution of
acid. To this <U+FB02>uid, after having been strained through moderately
to remove small portions of <U+FB01>brous tissue, more of the weak solutim
was added, with a small quantity of a glycerine extract of the mucosa 1
portion of the pig’s stomach.    The <U+FB02>uid so prepared was kept at a te
35° C. To the undigested residue left each day fresh quantities of the
acid solution and of the glycerine extract were added, until the pep
was no longer obtainable from it.    It was next washed with alcohol, t
with ether, to remove all the fat, and submitted to the action of str<
for twenty-four hours. A portion was thus dissolved, and the solutio:
the insoluble part by <U+FB01>ltration through iron-free paper, was next treat
times its volume of alcohol. The precipitate from this was remove
solved in ammonia, and reprecipitated with alcohol. The nuclein so <

  hiematin is as readily absorbed and as tenaciously held by chromatin
  as are some dyes.       Indeed, the accuracy of Zaleski’s observations on
  hepatin,  the   iron-holding nuclein of the liver cells, may be open also
  to objection on this score. It is, to a certain extent, accepted that
  the liver is the organ which converts the hwmatin of disintegrated
  haemoglobin into the bile and urine pigments.            Now, the liver cells
 are probably the agents in this conversion, and the haematin which is
 held by them and their nuclei cannot, presumably, be,rem0ved by the
 washing out of the lobular capillaries with saline solutions.
     Such being the dif<U+FB01>culty, the solution appeared, at <U+FB01>rst sight,
 to lie in the preparation of nuclein from an animal from which
haemoglobin is absent. No opportunity presented itself for making
 such preparations of the substance in desired quantities, and it
 appeared to me that nuclein from such a source could not be free
 from the histo-haematins found by MacMunn to be present in all
tissues, except those of the nervous system. With this dif<U+FB01>culty
 before me,     I  felt compelled to relinquish that line of investigation,
and to attempt another.
    It occurred to me that it might be possible to demonstrate under
the microscope the presence of iron in the chromatin of the cellular
elements of such tissues as are almost wholly free from haematins,
and in those tissues which are hardened so rapidly, as to prevent a
transference from without of haemoglobin or haematin into the cells.
Such tissues are the cutaneous epithelium in Amphibia and Fishes,
the cornea and cartilage in all Vertebrates.             This demonstration    I
had often attempted without success, and            I was forced to adopt the
conclusion that, if iron is present in the intact nucleus, it is either
so   <U+FB01>rmly bound in the molecules of chromatin               that the ordinary
reagents      cannot    attack  it, or so  small  in  quantity   that its colour
reactions are absent, even under the microscope. Bunge, however, in
the case of haematogen, had shown that ammonium sulphide has the
power of separating the iron; and Mr. Bensley and myself ascer
tained that this reagent has the same effect on isolated chromatin,
when kept in a warm condition for a long time in contact with the
substance, the iron separating as sulphide.            I tried the e<U+FB01>‘ect of the
reagent on tissues, and took, for example, pieces of the mesentery of
Necturus, put them in a ground-stoppered               bottle with ammonium
sulphide, and kept the bottle in a warm oven for several days. At
the end of that time, the pieces of tissue showed along the line of the
 blood-vessels a greenish-blue colour, while the remaining portions had
a diffuse   light-green colour. Under the microscope, the iron reaction
 appeared in the red blood cells and their nuclei, while the remaining
cellular elements showed nothing further than a di<U+FB01>use light-green
colour in both cell and nucleus.           I found, moreover, that the same
results were obtained         when,  the  preparations were immersed. in an

alooholic solution of ammonium       sulphide for twenty-foil]
kept at the temperature of the laboratory.           The piecr
remained for two weeks or more in the warm ammouiu
but no colour reactions appeared in the chromatin of the
satis<U+FB01>ed with the conditions        under which the experi:
carried on,  I adopted other methods. It occurred to me tt
a few cells for a long time completely separated from one at
a cover-glass, on a slide and surrounded with ammoniu
the reaction might come out.          To prevent the evapor.
ammonium sulphide,       I luted the edges of the cover to th
various luting compounds, only to <U+FB01>nd that, in some W
the preparation spoiled after a day or two. The luting m
useless, I employed    another device.    Glycerine, when ke;
with ammonium sulphide at a moderately high temperatu
time, does not affect the latter reagent, and is itself un
teased out with clean goose-quill points on a slide a small
testicle of Nect'urus, hardened in 70 per cent. alcohol, ad
of freshly-prepared ammonium sulphide, put on a cover-g]
a drop of glycerine to run in from its edge, and then plac
in a warm oven with a constant temperature of 60° C.
allowed to lie for three days, at the end of which time I 1
under the microscope, and found that, in addition to tl
distinctly present in the cell body and nucleus of each re
there was one apparent in the nuclei of a group of testic
one spot in the preparation.        The slide was replaced i:
even, and the daily examination of it showed that, accom
increase in the number of cells presenting the iron res
was an increase in the depth of the colour in those
affected, until, at the end of twenty days, the great maj
testicular nuclei under a cover-glass, 16 mm. square, 11
colour varying from light green or greenish-blue to da
black.    Under a high-power objective the colour was fou
to the chromatin nodules and nuclear network.          After
the nuclei adjacent to the edges of the cover-glass began
 stained appearance, until, <U+FB01>nally, the chromatin possessed
appearance due to the formation of ferric oxide, for, when 1
 hydrochloric acid and potassic ferrocyanide was allowed 1
 the cover, the rust-coloured nuclei immediately assumed a
 blue colour.    That it was the chromatin alone in such
 presented the reaction with ammonium sulphide was
 shown in the karyokinetic <U+FB01>gures present in the same
 The achromatin and cell substance were unaffected.
    Encouraged by the success of this experiment, I made
 preparations from the other organs of Nectums, hardenef
 per cent. alcohol.    Nearly all of these were successful, 11

                     of  the Presence     of Iron in Chromatin.                   281
required for the production of the reaction varied greatly.                A number
of conditions seem to assist in, or retard, and even prevent the success
of the experiment; but what are all the favourable conditions I do
not know as yet. It is certain, however, that there is a proper pro
portion of glycerine and ammonium sulphide in the mixture to be
added, and I am at present endeavouring to determine what that pro
portion is. It is also ascertained that the nucleus must be sur
rounded on all sides by the mixture, otherwise it very rarely shows
the reaction.       Where the cell body is large, as, for example, in the
semi-matured        ovarian ova of Necturus, the reaction has not yet
appeared;       while   in those very small ova, in which the nucleus, rich
in chromatin, forms by far the greater part of the cell, the reaction
appears as readily as in the testicular nuclei. Again, the preparation
 may advance in the reaction up to a certain point, showing the
 majority of its nuclei possessing a light-green, greenish- blue, or
 slate colour; when a change occurs, the rusttint replacing these
 colours in the chromatin.          So far as my experience goes, this happens
 when too little sulphide has been mixed with the glyceriue, or when
 the sulphide used is beginning to turn deep yellow, or is old.
     The deep-yellow sulphide gives no reaction with nuclei, even after
 eight weeks, While the most active is the freshly prepared reagent.
 This seems to indicate that the process, by which the iron is set free
 from the chromatin, is essentially a reducing one, the yellow sulphide
 having much less reducing power than the colourless, or nearly colour
 less, reagent.       In this way we can explain why the nucleus must be
 completely surrounded by the reagent, for the reducing capacity of
  the latter is limited, and a large quantity of it must be concentrated
  in its action on some particularly small object. When, however, the
  cellular elements are in a mass, not even the peripherally placed
  nuclei are a<U+FB01>ected in the manner described, but they react when they
  are teased out and separated.
      In some tissues there is more or less of albuminate iron or of a
  deposit of inorganic iron compounds.             In such a case the addition of
   ammonium sulphide gives           a reaction   immediately.       The presence of
   such compounds sometimes oifers a di<U+FB02>iculty. especially if they happen
   to occur in the nuclei.        I guarded against confusion in all such cases
   by submitting      thin  sections of such tissues made with the free hand
   to the action of a large quantity of Bunge’s <U+FB02>uid for eight to ten
   hours!       Such sections also, if made from alcohol-hardened tissues
   with a clean steel knife, covered with absolute alcohol, are not in the

    hydrochloric acid, 25 per cent. strength. It, according to Bunge, extracts all inor
    ganic iron compounds and albuminate iron from egg-yolk, and I have found that it
    removes all traces of such from sections of the spleen, liver, and kidney, which
    "sent immediately on the application of acid ferrocyanide solutions.

       in this respect.

sence of iron isnot indicated by hydrochloric acid and potassic ferro
cyanide.   In the older placentae, the acid and ferrocyanide mixture
gives the iron reaction with the chromatin masses at once, as does
also the ammonium sulphide.       Now, the chromatin granules in the
débm's of the glands at  the base of the placentee do not in any case
give a reaction with the acid mixture, while with warm ammonium
sulphide they show the presence of iron after two days.   From this
it   to be concluded that the chromatin of disintegrated cells mani
     is
fests more and more readily as time goes on the reaction with
ammonium sulphide, and my experiments with this reagent on de
generating cells in other organs con<U+FB01>rm this conclusion.

     I  have repeatedly     employed the hydrochloric acid a
ferricyanide mixture to show that the green or greenish
pound resulting in the nuclei from the action of ammonii
 is ferrous sulphide.      For this purpose, the nuclei, which
 chromatin, e.g., those of the testicular cells and of th
 ovarian ova in Necturus, are the best.           Usually I wasl

   with ammonium sulphide.           In no case was it found tha
   diate application of the acid reagent mentioned, or 01
   cyanide solution, gave the slightest reaction with the!
   nuclei which required a more or less lengthy contact wit
   sulphide in order to develop the iron reaction.          In eve
   instance referred to, the latter reagent     had  to be  employ
   pose the chromatin, and set free its iron as sulphide,l
   mixtures then, and then only, gave a deep azure-blue co?
       Now it might be urged that this iron reaction is due
    or an allied iron compound.         The observations which I
    to detail  will, I think, completely meet this objection.
       Believing that if iron enters into the composition of t
    of the animal cell, it must be also present in that of
    cell, I asked Mr. Bensley to employ my method in st'ud
    tribution of iron in the=latter.        His investigations, so
    have gone, have con<U+FB01>rmed mine, since he has found t
    matin of the pollen cells of Dianthus, Cucurbita, Narcissu

                     of  the Presence   of Iron in   Chromatin.                   285
cells of pollen sacs of Hyacinthus, all <U+FB01>xed in alcohol, give, with
several days’ application of warm ammonium sulphide, under the
cover-glass, a greenish-blue or a dark green reaction.
    We have observed that the chromatin of the karyokinetic <U+FB01>gures
in the pollen grains of Oucurbita shows an intense coloration with
ammonium sulphide. It has, moreover, been found that there is here,
as shown by the application of staining reagents (Ehrlich’s haema
toxylin and Czokor’s alum cochineal), a di<U+FB01>usion of the chromatin
from one of the two nuclei of the maturing pollen grain into the
pollen cell, and this di<U+FB02>'usion continues till, <U+FB01>nally, there is, com
paratively, little chromatin left in the shrunken nucleus?“ While
the diffusion is taking place, the chromatin is more abundant in the
immediate neighbourth of the nucleus. Now in such maturing
pollen grains, hardened in alcohol, there is produced by ammonium
sulphide after several days’ stay in the warm oven, an iron reaction,
corresponding in intensity and distribution with the colour produced
by the staining reagents, di<U+FB01>use in the nucleus, strongly marked in
its neighbourhood, and slightly at the periphery of the cell. As the
maturation of the pollen grain progresses, the iron reaction is more
readily obtainable, and, when the maturation is apparently complete,
the pollen cell gives, with freshly prepared ammonium sulphide, in a
few hours a light green reaction which becomes but a shade deeper
after several days’ stay in the warm oven.
    Mr. Bensley has also been able to determine with the ferrocyanide
mixture the passage of iron salt along the best portion of the <U+FB01>bro
vascular bundles in the ovary after the opening of the <U+FB02>ower, and he
has traced these iron salts in sections of the ovary- through the raphe
of the Ovules up to the boundary line of the latter. Beyond this point
the iron salts, if they advance, become hidden or disposed of in such
a way that they no longer give reactions with acid solutions of potassic
ferrocyanide or ferricyanide.           Nor do sections of the ovules show any
reaction with warm ammonium sulphide, either under a cover-glass
 or in the bottle. Taught by the experiments on animal cells, I teased
 out with goose-quill points sections of the ovules in ammonium sul
 phide and glycerine 0n the slide, so far as to isolate the various parts
 of the ovule, and, after keeping the preparation in the warm oven
 for three days, the nuclei of nearly all the separate and individual
 cells showed a dark green reaction, which was due to the presence of
 iron, as the application of a mixture of dilute hydrochloric acid and
 potassic ferricyanide proved.          I have been able in this way to deter

mine the presence of iron in the chromatin of a large
vegetable cells.
   I asked Mr. J. J. MacKenzie to undertake the study 01
bution of iron in fungi and algae, and very encouraging
so far, the results of his examination.      He has found, i
that in the gonidia     of Cystopus  candidus,  hardened in :
application of warm ammonium sulphide and glycerine i
for eight days brings out the presence of four or more
round bodies, measuring 1'6 ,4 in diameter, and correspol
nuclei of the zoogonidia, the rest of the protoplasm of
remaining absolutely uncoloured.       The coloured parts g:
impression as if the gonidia had been given a purely n
with iodine-green.     Mr. MacKenzie has also observed
results following the employment of ammonium sulphi
blue-green algae, which indicate that here also there is 1
like chromatin in <U+FB01>rm combination with iron.
    I think that enough has been advanced to show that m;
the chromatin of every cell, animal and vegetable, is an 1'
compound, is one which is now capable of proof.           I Ci
that it is proved as yet, since I am aware that that can c
 after an extensive series of observations made and c:
 performed.    Mr. MacKenzie, Mr. Bensley, and myself an
 the investigations outlined, and we hope before long
 position to bring forward an abundance of interesting
 are now accumulating, and of which those given here are
    I forego any speculation as to the bearings which my 1
 may have on our knowledge of animal and vegetable me
 content myself here with referring brie<U+FB02>y to the conditi<
 the iron is present in the chromatin.         As stated alre:
 found that the haemoglobin of Amphibia is formed from th
 of the haamatoblasts.     This would seem to indicate tha‘
 attached in the chromatin molecule to. an atom-group so
 that of haematin.    As the oxygen-carrying property of
 is generally attributed to the presence of the iron in. it,
 ourselves whether the chemical processes in the chron
 living cell are due to a constant alternation of the 0
 reduced conditions of the iron in the chromatin molecule.
 globin results from degeneration or disintegration of ch
 would naturally expect to <U+FB01>nd in it one or other condit:
 prominent.    The more stable condition is that of oxid;
 possible that in living chromatin the conditions are r
 interchangeable, and that therein lies a basis for a the
 chemical processes of the cell which are groupedund
 “vital.”

   The object which I have kept in view in' the research, the <U+FB01>rst
results of which are described in this paper, has been to ascertain as
far as possible What substances are really present in the watery
extract of fresh muscle, and which of the substances commonly
described as being present in it are really due to changes taking
place in the <U+FB02>esh during the processes of analysis—in short which
of the substances obtained from <U+FB02>esh are educts, and which are mere
products therefrom.
   And, in this investigation, I have been on my guard against two
great sources of error, viz. :—
   1st. Changes produced in the ingredients of the muscle-substance
by chemical agents and chemical or physical forces generally; and
   2nd] y. Changes brought about by bacterial action.
   This latter source of error seems to me of extreme importance, since
it is now well known that profound changes are effected in the com-     '
position of such susceptible bodies as <U+FB02>esh through the agency of
bacteria, long before those grosser effects are produced which lead to
the development of foetid gases, &c., and which are commonly de
scribed as “ putretaction.”
   Accordingly, I shall describe my experiments in the order in which
they are carried out, via. :——

exclude the <U+FB01>rst source of error ;- and                   _

   It is well known that when kreatinin is kept in a watery solution,
whose reaction is alkaline, at the boiling temperature for a length of
time, the base is gradually converted into kreatine by assimilating to
itself the elements of water.
   Now, in Liebig’s process for preparing kreatine from <U+FB02>esh, the
radical of phosphoric acid is precipitated from the watery extract of
the muscle-substance by addition of baryta-water, so long as any
precipitate  occurs; one result of which treatment is that the liquid
 becomes   strongly alkaline.   It has, therefore, been suggested that
 during  the concentration of the alkaline solution any kreatinin origi

nally present in the          <U+FB02>esh extract would undergo conv4
kreatine, and consequently that the kreatine which is
obtained may have resulted either partly or entirely fron
sion of kreatinin into kreatine, in short that the kreatine
product from the <U+FB02>esh, not a true educt.            My <U+FB01>rst GXPGI
designed to test this theory.                   ,
     Experiment I.—7O       lb. of fresh  butcher’s beef was <U+FB01>nely

By means of a specially designed screw-press, which wax
 me by Messrs. Farrow and Jackson, the aqueous extract w
 from the <U+FB01>bre. This process was repeated with fresh a
 water, until four extracts were obtained, each extract 1
 rately examined.
     The albuminoid substances were separated from all the
 heat (about 80°C.), most of the colouring matter being cs
 by the coagulated albumen.            The <U+FB01>ltrates were then cone
 evaporation      over steam,   until a  scum began to form upon
 after which the further concentration was effected in
 sulphuric acid, by means of a Carré’s freezing machine. I
 agent was added to any of the extracts at any time, unt
  centration was complete.
      In each case the residue obtained by concentrating the
  was partly crystalline and partly gelatinous.
      Complete separation of the crystalline from the amorpl
  was readily effected by means of dilute alcohol, which left
  line matter undissolved.
      Finally, by fractional crystallisation from water, the
  matter was resolved into an organic and an inorganic subs
       The organic crystals were kreatine.
       The inorganic salt was acid potassium phosphate, KH-zl
       The results of this experiment prove—
       lst, that kreatine may be obtained from the watery ext
   whose natural acidity has not been. chemically neutrali
   hydrolytic conversion of kreatinin into kreatine is most
   and,
       2ndly, that the presence of phosphates in solution do!

        Inasmuch as    I am not aware that acid potassium ph
   been actually obtained in crystals from the watery extra
   hitherto,    I have thought it advisable to give analytical r
    prove   the  identity of the substance.
         The salt is much more soluble in water than the l'
    which it is associated, so that the separation of the two E

easy.    It occurs in hard glistening anhydrous prisms usually radiat
ing from a common centre. The aqueous solution of these crystals is
acid to litmus and gives a yellow precipitate on addition of silver
nitrate solution.    This precipitate (Ag3PO4) is much increased on
carefully neutralising the liquid with ammonia.
   When heated the crystals lose water and fuse. The fused mass
                                                                            '
dissolves slowly in water to a neutral solution, which gives a white
flocculent precipitate with silver nitrate (AgPOs).
   1349 grams of the crystals lost 0'1835 gram of H20 on ignition,
         corresponding with 13'602 per cent of the original weight.
   According to the equation KH2P04 = KPOa + H20, the crystals
would theoretically lose 13'22 per cent.
                                                                           v.
   0'985    gram of the crystals gave 2'999 grams of Ag3P04, corre-
         sponding with 0680 gram P04, i.e., 6903 per cent. P04.
    The <U+FB01>ltrate from the Ag3PO4 was freed from silver by H01, and
the   K in the <U+FB01>ltrate converted into KQSO.‘ by H2804, evaporation, &c.
    The weight of K2SO4, obtained from 0985 gram of the KHQPOh
was 0'6652 gram, which corresponds with 029% gram of potassium,

or 3031 per cent. K.
    The hydrogen in the salt was determined by titration with lime
 water of known strength.      0'112 gram of the salt was neutralised by
 005739285 gram of Ca(HO)2.
    According to the equation 3KH2P04+3Ca(HO), = Ca3(PO4)2+
 K3P0‘+ 61120, this result indicates 0'00155 gram of hydrogen, or
 1'38 per cent. of hydrogen.
    These results agree with the formula KH2P04.

    The preparation of pure acid potassium phosphate from the
 watery extract of <U+FB02>esh is especially interesting as showing how a
 mere product may be taken for an educt.
    It is well known that Liebig has described potassium chloride as a
 constituent of fresh muscle substance; and no doubt many observers
  who have followed out his process for the preparation of kreatine
  have obtained cubical crystals of potassium chloride on treating the
  mother liquors from the kreatine with alcohol.       I have myself never

  failed to obtain this salt after the use of baryta~water, as     (
  Liebig.
     But the action of baryta-water on the watery solution         (
  would be represented thus—
            2KH,PO,+3Ba(HO)2 = Ba,(P0,).+2KH0                 +4.11
- And the potassic hydrate thus produced would of course
  the hydrochlorides of any organic bases present in thr
  forming potassium chloride and liberating the bases.
  therefore, would   be aproduct, not an educt, from the<U+FB02>esh.

    The following is a brief summary of the advantages possessed by
the mercuric chloride method, which render it peculiarly applicable
to the case of such an easily changed substance as fresh muscle :—
    l. The germicidal action of mercuric chloride is so powerful that,
          if added in suf<U+FB01>cient quantity, bacterial action is rendered
           impossible.
   2.   It removes from solution at                 once the more putrescible consti
          tuents of the liquid (albuminoid matters).
   3.   It precipitates kreatinin gradually, so as to allow of separation
          of that base as mercury salt, and of subsequent isolation of the
          base itself, without any application of heat.
   4-   By removing from solution the putrescible substances, it favours
           the isolation of any bases, &c., which it does not precipitate,
          inasmuch as these substances are protected by it from any
          danger of alteration by bacterial action.
   Having thus indicated               my     reasons       for    adopting     the mercuric

  The two experiments described above were made Wil

from these 30 lbs. of beef were free from all danger of change by
bacterial action; and the source from which the extract was made had
been exposed to bacterial action for only seven hours.   This extract
will be spoken of as “ portion A."
   The muscle <U+FB01>bre from which the above extract was taken was
left in a porcelain bath all night (the weather was very cold at the
time), and no more water was added to it.
   On Friday, January 4, this <U+FB01>bre was again put through the press,
and, although as much as possible had been squeezed out of it on the
previous day, and no        more water had been    added, an additional
3750 0.0. of a red liquid   was obtained.
  The total volume of                     from these 30 lbs. of <U+FB02>esh
                            liquid obtained
amounted, therefore, to 6250 c.c., whilst the volume of water added
was 5000 0.0. Therefore, 1250 cc of actual juice must have been
expressed from 13132 kilograms of <U+FB02>esh, i.e., the juice obtained was
about {7th of the weight of the <U+FB02>esh taken.
  This second portion of juice was not mixed with portion A, but
2250 0.0. of the mercuric chloride solution was added to it at 1 PAL
on Friday afternoon, and it was <U+FB01>ltered at once. The precipitate and
<U+FB01>ltrate were preserved and labelled       “ Portion B.”   ll‘he utmost
                                                                                I
exposure to bacterial actihn undergone by portion B was twenty-six
hours.
   So far there is evidence that one result of bacterial action is to
render the muscle substance more <U+FB02>uid.
   The following four portions of <U+FB02>esh from the same cow were
extracted with water, and the extracts mixed together in one large
Vessel with mercuric chloride solution :—
   (1.) 22 lb. 8 oz. + 4! litres of water at 4 P.M. on Thursday
January 3, and left all night.
   Expressed 52200.0. of red liquid (of which 1220 c.c., 0r about 716th
of the <U+FB02>esh, must have been juice) at 3 P.M. on Friday, and added
2000 c.c. of HgOl ,solution.
   (2.) 18 lb. 12 oz. (= 8576 kilograms) of <U+FB02>esh + 3 litres of water
at 1.30 RM. on Friday, January 4.
   Expressed 3700 0.0. of red liquid (of which 700 c.c., or {ith of
weight of the <U+FB02>esh, must have been juice) at 6 P.M. on Friday,
 January 4, and added 2000 cc. of HgCl; solution.
    (3.) 22 lb. 8 oz. (= 10215 kilograms of <U+FB02>esh) + 3 litres of water
at 4 1am. Friday.
   3000 0.0. of red liquid squeezed out at 8 P.M. Friday, and 2000 0.0.
of HgCl, added.

    amounted to 86 lb. 4 oz. (= 39'22 kilograms), and the durat
    sure to bacterial action varied from 26 to 34 hours. Afte1

    the cow.
        In this paper    I  shall describe only the results Dbl-$11181
    examination of the three <U+FB01>ltrates after addition of mercur
    viz., portions A (exposed 7 hours to air), B (eXposed ‘2
    air), and C (exposed 34 hours 'at most).
       My endeavour has been to 'treat these three <U+FB01>ltrates in
    same way as far as possible, so as toyavoid introducing any
   one of them by an agency to whose in<U+FB02>uence the other
   exposed. By these means           I should feel justi<U+FB01>ed in attri
   di<U+FB01>erence between the products obtained to bacterial a
   the <U+FB02>esh before the addition of the antiseptic mercuri
   solution.      One change took place in all the three solutior
,  very gradual separation of a white precipitate, which
   granular macroscopically, and which consisted of minute
   perfect transparency when examined microscopically.              In
   the <U+FB01>ltrates gradually deposited a spherical mercury salt is
   with the mercury salt of the kreatinin of urine.
       These precipitates were not <U+FB01>nally separated by <U+FB01>ltr:
   the liquid had in each case ceased to deposit the spherical 1
       The spherical precipitate was separated from portion 1
   1890, washed, dried at the ordinary temperature, and wei
   weight was 4416 grams.
      The spherical compound was separated from portion B in
   1891.     Its weight was     28'01 grams.
      The spherical compound was separated from portion C             i]
   1890.     Its weight was    76"5 grams.
      The three <U+FB01>ltrates from these precipitates all remained
  clear on standing for not less than a week in each case
  that the mercuric chloride still in solution had no furt
  to cause formation of insoluble compounds.
      It  is remarkable that the precipitates from A and B, i
  tain the extracts from 30 lb. of <U+FB02>esh, weigh together
  much as the entire precipitate from portion, C, which
  from 86 lb. 4! oz. of <U+FB02>esh.          This lesser proportional weig
  precipitate     from  the  portion C cannot be accounted for by
  of a week in the <U+FB01>ltration of the <U+FB01>rst precipitate by the
  chloride, because the separation of the spherical precipi
  extremely slow in the case of the watery extract of <U+FB02>esh.

               On the Bases (Organic) in the     Juice of Flesh.         295
 planation of this diminution in the weight of spherical mercury salt
 obtained from portion C must therefore be sought in the more pro
 longed exposure of the <U+FB02>esh from which this extract was obtained
 to bacterial in<U+FB02>uences.
    The spherical mercury       salts obtained as above were decomposed
 by H2S under water, and the acid <U+FB01>ltrates evaporated in vacuo over
 H2S04 at the ordinary temperature.          In each case crystals were ob
 tained isomorphous with the hydrochloride of urinary kreatinin.
 These crystals when dissolved in water yielded acid solutions which
became     strongly alkaline when digested with pure lead hydrate at
the ordinary temperature.         On evaporating the alkaline <U+FB01>ltrates in
came over sulphuric acid, the sarcous kreatinin formed in each case
anhydrous crystals isomorphous with the tabular kreatinin of urine.
    This sarcous kreatinin, therefore, differs from the urinary kreat
inin in yielding anhydrous tables instead of e<U+FB02>iorescent prisms when
prepared without application of heat.
   It appears, however, that the sarcous kreatinin may be rendered
e<U+FB02>iorescent by similar treatment to that which changes tabular
urinary kreatinin into the e<U+FB02>ioresceut base, for the washings from the
precipitate by lead hydrate in solution of hydrochloride of kreatinin
from portion C were evaporated at 60° 0., instead of at the ordinary
temperature,      and the acid solution was treated with Pb(HO)2,
<U+FB01>ltered, and the alkaline <U+FB01>ltrate also evaporatedat 60° C. A number
of long transparent needles formed, isomorphous with the e<U+FB02>lorescent
kreatinin of urine, and these needles became opaque when dry. On
redissolving the ef<U+FB02>orescent base in water and again evaporating,
tabular kreatinin separated out.
   A further comparison of the properties of this sarcous kreatinin
reveals additional differences between this base and the kreatinin of
urine.
   In the table on p. 528, vol. 43, of the ‘Proceedings,’ I have laid
stress upon the following points in comparing different kreatinins :—
    Solubility in water and alcohol, properties of platinum and gold
salts, and reduction of CuO, compared with glucose.                    ,
   Accordingly      I have  especially   examined    the sarcous  kreatinin,
obtained as above described, with relation to these particulars.

   4'1995 grams of solution of sarcous kreatinin in water, saturated

   Therefore,     3‘8420 grams     of  water   dissolved  0'3575   gram   of
      kreatinin.
    Hence,   1 part by weight of kreatinin is dissolved by 10'74 parts by

employed :—

   The gold salt of sarcous kreatinin            di<U+FB02>'ers from the gold salts of      all
the urinary kreatinins, described by              me   in June,     1887,  in that it is
completely dissolved by ether.
   However, during evaporation of its ethereal solution, even at the
ordinary temperature, the salt undergoes decomposition, and a
mixture of auric chloride and the hydrochloride of sarcous kreatinin
                                                                                         '

  Besides the differences apparent in the above table, it will be
cmembered that sarcous kreatinin appears in the e<U+FB01>iorescent form
nly after its solution has been kept at 60° C. for some time ; whereas
he natural kreatinin of urine, when prepared most carefully without
eat, is always e<U+FB01>'lorescent           (CiH-IN302HZO).
  Also the tabular crystals formed by sarcous kreatinin are not so
lrge as those formed by the tabular kreatinin of urine.
  Having thus isolated and examined a sarcous kreatinin by the
iercuric chloride method, my attention was turned in the next place
) the
        examination of the <U+FB01>ltered solutions from which the spherical
iercury salts of the sarcous kreatinin had been separated. These
ltrates were three in number, viz., from portions A, B, and C.                               In
tCh case, the <U+FB01>ltrate was allowed to stand for at least a week, in
rder to ensure that it remained perfectly clear.                       This having been
icertained, my next endeavour was to separate the mercuric chloride
*om the solutions, if possible, without adding any reagent to them
hich would be likely to alter the organic constituents during subse
uent evaporation.
 Finally,    I  e<U+FB01>ected this separation by means of pure lead hydrate,

  ingly  added  to  all three <U+FB01>ltrates.
     In portion A more time was required to remove all mercuric
  chloride from the solution than in the case of portions 13 and 0.
     Lead hydrate was <U+FB01>rst added to portion A in April, 1890; and,
  although more lead hydrate was stirred in from time to time, the
  solution was not free from mercury until March 23rd, 1891.                It was
  then <U+FB01>ltered and evaporated.
     The <U+FB01>ltrate (portion A was that which was extracted within seven
  hours of the death of the animal) was evaporated <U+FB01>rst over steam,
  then on a hot copper plate at 60° C. No brown colour was developed
  in the solution during the concentration by heat, but it remained
  colourless, even when reduced to a syrup.            This concentrated liquor
  was left standing over sulphuric acid.
     No kreatine crystals were formed in portion A, but a number of
  octahedral crystals separated out.         These crystals contain potassium,
  chlorine, and much nitrogenous organic matter.              Their solution does
  not respond to Engel’s test for kreatine with mercuric chloride and
  potassium hydrate.
'
     The aqueous solution of these crystals is neutral to litmus.            When
  heated, the crystals      lost  14‘? per cent.    of  their  weight, leaving a
  black ash consisting of potassium chloride, entangling carbon.                  I
  have a large quantity of these octahedral crystals, and          I  hope soon to
  submit them to complete analysis and investigation.                 N0 P0,, was
  found in this part of portion A.
     In the case of portion B, the separation of the mercuric chloride
  from the solution by lead hydrate was completed in three weeks.
     The_<U+FB01>ltrate was evaporated over steam.            Only slight darkening of
  colour took place during concentration.            The yellow syrupy liquid
  deposited crystals on standing.          The syrup was mixed with alcohol
  (in  which  the  crystals   did not  dissolve) and <U+FB01>ltered.      The crystalline
  matter    was  washed      with  dilute  alcohol,   dried,   and   weighed; its
  weight was 2'24 grams.           Having been weighed, the crystals were
  redissolved   and recrystallised,      when they were found to be pure
  KHZPO4. No kreatine crystals could be detected. The alcoholic
  liquor was, of course, preserved for further examination.
     In the case of portion C, six weeks’ digestion with lead hydrate
  removed the mercuric chloride from the <U+FB01>ltrate from the spherical
  mercury salt of the sarcous kreatinin.          The liquid was <U+FB01>ltered from
  the mixed lead and mercury precipitate, and concentrated by eva
  poration over steam and then at 60° C.
     Unlike portions A and B, portion C became extremely dark
   coloured during evaporation, and the product was a brown jelly,
   entangling much crystalline matter.                                              _

   The deductions which         I am inclined to draw from these results
are   :—
    1. That krgtine is not present in fresh muscle substance, but that
         it is a product of bacterial action upon some constituent of
         the <U+FB02>esh.
   2. That the source of kreatine obtained from <U+FB02>esh is either the
         sarcous kreatinin or some closely-allied substance.
    3. That sarcous kreatinin is probably a true
                                                              “ educt,” 'i.e., is
                                                                                   really
         present   in the  fresh  muscle-substance;           but, having regard to
         the extremely slow separation of its mercury salt, it is just
         possible that it may result from gradual changes effected in
         some closely allied substance by the prolonged action                  of solu
         tion of mercuric chloride.
    In conclusion, I will brie<U+FB02>y record some experiments which I have
made to ascertain whether kreatine may be converted into other bases
by the prolonged action of mercuric chloride in aqueous solution at
the ordinary temperature.          It is commonly asserted that aqueous
solution of kreatine is not acted upon by me'rcuric chloride.                       This
statement, however, requires modi<U+FB01>cation.                   It is true that there is
no instantaneous action, but, after standing for 24: hours, a slight
cloud forms in a mixed aqueous solution of kreatine and mercuric
chloride. This precipitate increases week after week, and month
after m0nth, and is the mercury salt of kreatinin (spherical).
    0'5 gram of pure kreatine, dissolved in 70 0.0. of water and mixed
         with 20 0.0. of cold saturated solution of mercuric chloride,
         deposited in the course of <U+FB01>ve months 0'7591 gram of spheri
         cal mercury salt of kreatinin, from which a tabular kreatinin
         was obtained in well-formed crystals.                This tabular kreatinin
         formed a beautiful gold salt, which left, on ignition, 43'63 per
         cent. of gold.                                                          .
    Required for C,H1N,,O.HC1.AuC]3,           4346 per cent. Au.
    This gold salt resembled that of the tabular kreatinin obtained
 from urinary kreatine by Liebig’s process, in being decomposed                        by
 ether, AuCl, being dissolved and the kreatinin hydrochloride left.

   It  is certain that this conversion of kreatine into kreatinin does
not take place when mercuric chloride is added to the watery extract
of <U+FB02>esh—
   1. Because abundance           of kreatine is obtained after this treatment,
         as in portion C.
   2. Because the kreatinin obtained from <U+FB02>esh differs in properties
         from the one obtained by action of HgCl2 upon pure kreatine.

         and decomposed only during evaporation; whilst the gold salt
         of the latter is insoluble in ether, but is at once decomposed
         thereby.

   Action of Alkalis on Phyllocyanin (oontinuation).—In Parts and             I    III
of this memoir I gave an account of the action of aqueous alkalis
on phyllocyanin, and of the products thereby formed.‘ By the action
of caustic alkali in a state of fusion phyllocyanin undergoes a more
profound decomposition, leading to the formation of several products,
one of which      I shall now describe.
   When caustic potash lye to which phyllocyanin has been added is
boiled down nearly to dryness a green mass is left which still contains
phyllocyanin, for on dissolving a little of it in water, adding an excess
of acetic acid, and shaking up with ether, a solution is obtained
which shows the spectrum of phyllocyanin. On heating the green
mass to near the point of fusion its colour suddenly changes to
brown, and the phyllocyanin is now completely altered.                     In order to
ensure complete decomposition water is added, and the solution is
then boiled down, and the residual mass again heated to near the
point of fusion. The mass is then dissolved in water, and to the
reddish-brown        solution there is added an excess of acetic acid, which
gives a voluminous brown precipitate.                The whole is now shaken up
with ether without any previous <U+FB01>ltration. The ether dissolves a
portion of the precipitate, acquiring a red colour, and, having been
separated in the usual manner, is slowly evaporated.                    During evapo
ration the solution deposits a dark-brown mass, which is <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>
and treated with boiling alcohol.                The latter acquires a red colour,
leaving behind a good deal of impurity, which is <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>. On
adding zinc acetate to the <U+FB01>ltrate a brown precipitate falls, while the
liquid acquires a bright purple colour. The latter after <U+FB01>ltration is

evaporated.   During evaporation it deposits an amorphous red powder,
which is <U+FB01>ltered off and washed with a little cold alcohol.               This red
powder is a zinc compound ; when burnt          it leaves a residue  of zinc oxide.
On being treated with hot alcohol to which a little hydrochloric
acid is added the powder dissolves, yielding a crimson solution, which
after adding water and shaking up with ether divides into two layers,
an upper brown ethereal one and a lower one which is acid and has a
bright crimson colour. The two liquids having been separated, the
upper one is found to leave on evaporation a brown amorphous
residue, while the lower one, after partial evaporation, gives with
water a brown precipitate.          The latter, having been <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB02>’, is
dissolved in boiling alcohol; the alcoholic solution deposits on stand
ing <U+FB01>ne lustrous crystalline needles.
   The properties of the substance prepared as just described are as
follows :—In mass it appears plum-coloured, and shows much lustre.
Under the microscope it is seen to consist of small, regular, prismatic
crystals, which are reddish-brown by transmitted light. Heated on
platinum it melts to a brown mass, which on being further heated
burns, leaving much charcoal.            When heated in a tube it gives off
fumes, but yields no crystalline sublimate.              It is soluble in boiling
alcohol and ether, the solution having a red colour inclining to
crimson.    It is also soluble in chloroform, but insoluble in carbon di
sulphide even on boiling. It dissolves in glacial acetic acid and in
concentrated hydrochloric acid, the solutions exhibiting a <U+FB01>ne crimson
colour. The solutions show well-de<U+FB01>ned absorption bands, but their
spectra differ inter so; those of the alcoholic and ethereal solutions
are nearly alike, but that of the solution in hydrochloric acid is very
different. The spectra are remarkable for the entire absence of bands
at the red end, but they need not be further described, as they are
represented on the plate accompanying this paper.
   I give no name to this substance, as it may possibly turn out to be
identical with one or other of the bodies obtained by Hoppe-Seyler
as products of the action of caustic potash on his chlorophyllan,* one
of which he has named “ dichromatic acid,” while to another he
applies the term
                   “
                     phylloporphyrin.”         I   may state that the spectrum
of the hydrochloric acid solution of my substance corresponds exactly
with that of a purple-coloured solution (containing unfortunately
very little substance) labelled
                                    “                                I
                                       phylloporphyrin,” which owe to the
kindness of Dr. Schuchardt, of Goerlitz. The yield of my substance in
relation to the quantity of phyllocyanin employed is exceedingly small,
as the account of my method of preparing and purifying it would,
indeed, lead one to conclude.        Large quantities of one or more other
substances are formed at the same time, but, being brown, amorphous,
and humus-like, they do not invite examination.

   This may,    I think,   be a suitable    place for a few remarks on the‘
somewhat altered sense in which I use the terms phyllocyanin and
phylloxanthin, names bestowed by Fremy on what he supposed to be
constituents of chlorophyll. In his <U+FB01>rst memoir on the green colour
ing matter of leaves Fremy' maintained that by acting on chlorophyll
with a mixture of ether and hydrochloric acid he had caused it to
split up into two colouring matters, one of which passes into the
acid, imparting to it a bright blue colour, while the other dissolves in
the ether, which it colours yellow, the two together causing by their
combined presence the ordinary green colour of leaves and other
organs.   I need not here refer to the fact, suf<U+FB01>ciently manifest to any
one who has paid attention to the subject, that Fremy was in error
in supposing that his two colouring matters pre-existed as such in
the cells of plants, and was not aware that they were, in part at least,
products of the decomposition of chlorophyll.                I merely wish to
remark that the author’s two colouring matters must have been,
considering the mode of preparation employed, mixtures of several
substances, some of which, so far as we know, are not in any way
connected with chlorophyll, using the latter term in the stricter sense
as being the substance to which the green colour of leaves, &c., is due.
At the same time I think it right to say a few words to justify myself
in retaining Fremy’s names, and at the same time applying them in
a somewhat different sense.          Returning to Fremy’s <U+FB01>rst experiment
with ether and hydrochloric acid, I think I have proved, by what is
stated in the <U+FB01>rst part of this memoir, that the author’s blue liquid
is in fact a solution in hydrochloric acid of a substance which is a
product of decomposition of chlorophyll. This substance I call phyllo
cyanin.    It is a weak base, forming with acids unstable compounds
of a blue colour, Fremy’s phyllocyanin being in fact such a compound.
It also combines with bases, though not without at the same time
 undergoing a change, a description of which is contained in the third
part of this memoird"         To have given it another name would prob
ably have led to misunderstanding on the part of those not specially
conversant with the subject, and to confusion in its terminology. A
                                                                              '
similar instance of the retention of name presents itself in the case of
the alkaloid berberin.        The berberin of the original discoverer was
subsequently found to be the hydrochloride of a base which then
retained the name berberin, though not identical with the original
substance so called.         In his second memoiri Fremy takes quite
 another view of the constitution of chlorophyll.             Having acted on
chlorophyll in alcoholic solution with caustic baryta he obtained an
insoluble compound, which he called phyllocyanate of baryta, and
                      "’ ‘

 which by decomposition with acid yielded phyllocyanic acid, while
his phylloxanthin remained dissolved in the alcoholic liquid, and was
left behind on evaporation in yellow or red crystals resembling bi
chromate of potash. This process the author considers to be one of
saponi<U+FB01>cation, chlorophyll itself being a species of fat, which by the
action of bases splits up, the process being described by him as
follows :—-“ La chlorophylle, espece particuliére de corps gras coloré,
éprouve done par l’action des bases énergiques une sorte de saponi<U+FB01>ca
tion dont la phylloxanthine, corps neutre jaune, serait 1a glycérine, et
l’acide phyllocyanique serait l’acide gras coloré en vert bleuatre.”
 The process may, however, be explained in a simpler manner. On
 coming into contact with caustic baryta chlorophyll simply combines
with the latter forming an insoluble compound, and is again set at
liberty by a strong acid, but is at the same time decomposed by the
acid yielding phyllocyanin, the so-called phyllocyanic acid being
 simply identical with the latter.         The properties of his acid, as de
scribed by the author, are just those of phyllocyanin in my sense of
the term. It is hardly necessary to refer here to Fremy’s third
memoirf" in which he endeavours to prove that the colouring matter
of leaves is a mixture of phylloxanthin and phyllocyanate potash, of a
 conclusion even less probable than those previously arrived at.
     As regards Fremy’s phylloxanthin, it is evident that it must, con
 sidering the method of preparation employed, have consisted of
 several more or less yellow substances, some of which may have been
 present as such in the solution of chlorophyll taken, while others were
 formed by the action of the hydrochloric acid on the chlorophyll in
 solution. In his <U+FB01>rst memoir Fremy states that his phylloxanthin is,
 in his opinion, identical with the yellow colouring matter of leaves
 developed in the dark as well as that of yellow autumnal leaves.
 Whether the colour of etiolated and that of faded leaves is due to the
  same substance, and whether the latter is identical with the yellow
  colouring matter which always accompanies chlorophyll in healthy
  green leaves is uncertain, but there can be no doubt that the latter,
  the constant companion of chlorophyll, was present in Fremy’s phyllo.
  xanthin solution.      Though still an imperfectly known substance,
  its general properties have been ascertained, and it is now usually
  called xanthophyll.      In his second memoir Fremy gives a description
  of his phylloxanthin, from which it is evident that the substance
  obtained by his new process was identical with Hartsen’s chrysophyll
  and Bougarel’s erythrophyll, a body yielding beautiful red crystals,
  giving solutions of a deep yellow colour, and apparently present in
  all green leaves.     This then is the second constituent of Fremy’s
  phylloxanthin, but there is yet a third, which, though overlooked by
  that chemist, must have been present along with the two others, at

least when the process <U+FB01>rst described, using ether and hydrochloric
acid, was employed; and it is this, following the example of Tschirch,
that I propose to call phylloxanthin in the stricter sense, inappropriate
as the term is in some respects.
   Phylloxanthin is a product formed along with phyllocyanin by the
action of strong acids on chlorophyll, and is left dissolved in ether
when to an ethereal solution of the two concentrated hydrochloric
acid is added, the phyllocyanin passing into the acid.       When the
process described    in the <U+FB01>rst part of this memoir, the <U+FB01>rst stage of
which consists in passing hydrochloric acid gas into an alcoholic
extract of leaves, is employed, the xanthophyll, chrysophyll, and any
other colouring matter that may be present remain in solution, while
the phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin formed by the action of the acid
are deposited along with some fatty matter.
   Having thus explained the sense in which the terms phyllocyanin
and phylloxanthin are employed in this memoir, I will now proceed
to give an account of the mode of preparation and properties of
                               Phyllomanth'in.
   Although the quantity of this substance formed by the decompoai
tion of chlor0phyll with acids is much larger than that of the
phyllocyanin accompanying        it,
                                   its preparation in a state of purity is
much more di<U+FB02>icult, and the product even at the best           never free
                                                                 is
from impurities of fatty nature.
                     a
   The olive-green ethereal solution containing phylloxanthin, after
being separated from the lower acid one containing phyllocyanin, and
shaken up with concentrated hydrochloric acid, so as to remove any
of the latter substance that may be present,       left exposed to the air
                                                           is
in shallow vessels, so as to allow the greater part of the ether to
evaporate, when     itleaves a quantity of matter in dark brown cakes
<U+FB02>oating in an acid liquid.        The latter having been removed, the
cakes are washed with water, and then left to drain on paper.        That
the mass thus obtained contains, besides colouring matter, a large
quantity of fat is  evident, for on rubbing a small portion between the
<U+FB01>ngers it  softens, and  itmelts completely in boiling water.   The fatty
matter may, to a great extent, be removed by treating the mixture
with concentrated hydrochloric acid, in which the colouring matter
after a time dissolves leaving the fatty matter behind; but the former
undergoes a change by this treatment, and            no longer unaltered
                                                            is
phylloxanthin,  as  Ishall show  further  on.   By  the action of alkalis,
too, a change  iseffected, so that     itnecessary to use other solvents
                                            is
for the puri<U+FB01>cation of phylloxanthin. For this purpose the crude
substance from the ethereal solution          <U+FB01>rst dissolved in a small
                                                 is
quantity of chloroform, and the solution        then mixed with several
                                                      is

 times its volume of alcohol and left to stand, when it deposits a great
 part of “the phylloxanthin, much of the fatty matter being left in
 solution.
    The deposit is then <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with alcohol, dried, and
 dissolved in boiling glacial acetic acid. This solution on cooling
 and standing yields a copious deposit of phylloxanthin, which is
 <U+FB01>ltered off and may again be dissolved in boiling glacial acetic acid.
 The second deposit is <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>, washed with alcohol, and dissolved
in hot ether. The ethereal solution is then slowly evaporated in
beakers.     During evaporation a dark mass is deposited, which after
about    three-fourths   of the ether have evaporated is <U+FB01>ltered off and
redissolved in ether. The ethereal solution is evaporated, and the
                                                             '
portion which <U+FB01>rst separates out is <U+FB01>ltered oif as before. This process
may be repeated several times if it is thought necessary. The quantity
<U+FB01>nally obtained after this lengthy process is, of course, relatively
small.     Unfortunately, too, it is after all not absolutely pure; it
contains fatty matter, as may be easily ascertained by treating a little
of it with moderately strong boiling nitric acid, when the colouring
matter is decomposed and dissolved, leaving the fatty matter, which
<U+FB02>oats about in the boiling liquid in oily drops.       There is no reason,
however, to suppose that this contamination with fatty matter inter
feres with the reactions of the substance, so far at least as its behaviour
to various solvents and the colour or changes of colour which it
presents are concerned.       The properties of phylloxanthin resemble
those of phyllocyanin so closely as to lead to the conclusion that
the two substances must be closely related, that they are perhaps
isomeric, and that possibly one of them might be converted into the
other by some process still to be discovered. In the following descrip
tion, therefore, I shall refer only slightly to those properties which
the two substances possess in common.
   When prepared in the way above described and then dried phyllo
xanthin appears dark green, almost black, thus differing from phyllo
cyanin, which always         hows a dark indigo-blue colour.          It is
amorphous, even under the microscope, though it may occasionally be
obtained by very slow evaporation of its ethereal solution in small
rosettes, which are rust-coloured by transmitted light. When a very
minute portion is placed on a glass slide, then moistened with ether
under a cover-glass, it is seen to resolve itself under the microscope
into a. number of long whip-like <U+FB01>laments and pseudo-crystalline
needles, much curved and twisted, which are brown by transmitted
light. Chlorophyllan, according to Hoppe—Seyler, shows the same
behaviour under the microscope.
    Phylloxanthin is soluble in boiling absolute alcohol, but a great
 part separates out again on the solution cooling as a granular
 amorphous deposit.      It is more soluble in ether, carbon disulphide,

      benzol, and aniline than in alcohol ; it also dissolves in
      the best solvent is chloroform.       These solutions are l¢
      green, and more brown, than those of phyllocyanin; th
      escent, and when dilute exhibit a marked reddish ting
      nothing is seen in the case of phyllocyanin. The ethe
      shows <U+FB01>ve bands closely resembling those of phyllocyanil
      both position and relative intensity, with this di<U+FB01>erence, h
      the <U+FB01>rst and second bands lie further away from the N
      with the latter, while the space between the fourth and
      is so much darkened that when the solution is concentra
      bands appear as one.      When the ethereal solution is sha
      concentrated hydrochloric acid, the latter remains colon
      phyllocyauin is present, when it acquires a blue colour.
      however, be a mistake to suppose that if, on standing, a
      tion makes its appearance in the lower liquid, the presenc
      cyanin is indicated, for by the action of hydrochloric acid ph
      undergoes a change whereby it becomes soluble in the at
      the ether in which it was previously dissolved. That this
      is evident from the fact that the blue coloration COHHIH
      the ether and the acid are in contact, and extends from a
      wards.
          Phylloxanthin, like phyllocyanin, may be heated for se
       at 130° without undergoing any change, but at 160“ de
       commences, and at 180° the substance is completely d
       yielding a charred mass, which is entirely insoluble in
       When heated on platinum phylloxanthin burns with :
       <U+FB02>ame yielding a bulky charcoal, which burns away wit]
       leaving a little dark- coloured ash ; this ash consists of ferr
          Since all the specimens of phylloxanthin     I have prepar
       burning more or less ferric oxide, the presence of the 1:
  u.“  be altogether accidental.    Those who maintain that iron ii
.-"    or other is an essential constituent of chlorophyll may
       prised at its being found in one of the products of the de
       of chlorophyll; but it is di<U+FB02>icult to understand why the in
       nally present, should not have been removed during th<
       with hydrochloric acid and acetic acid to which the produ
       mitted, and should still be present after repeated solution
       stance in ether.
          On adding a little nitric acid to a saturated solutioi
        xanthin in glacial acetic acid the colour of the solution (1

        washing dissolves in alcohol, giving a yellow solution v
        absorption bands, and leaves on evaporation a yellow brit‘

ous residue.     Chromic acid acts in a similar manner.      Treated with
boiling concentrated      nitric  acid, phylloxanthin is decomposed, a
quantity of yellow semi-fused fatty matter being left behind; the
<U+FB01>ltrate leaves on evaporation a crystalline residue, consisting mainly
of oxalic acid.
    A chloroformic solution of phylloxanthin when exposed to sunlight
in a loosely stoppered bottle gradually becomes paler, and at last
almost colourless. No difference in the rapidity of bleaching could
he observed when a solution of phylloeyanin of as nearly as possible
the same strength was exposed to the- action of light along with the
solution of phylloxauthin. The process is doubtless one of slow oxi~
dation under the in<U+FB02>uence of light.
    On adding a little bromine to a chloroformic solution of phyllo
xanthiu the colour of the latter changes to a bright grass-green,
resembling that of chlorophyll solutions, but its spectrum differs
from that of chlorophyll, as well as from that of phylloxantliin; it
shows one very broad band, extending over a great part of the red
and the whole of the orange, with a faint band in the green, and an
indication of one nearer the blue, together with much obscuration at
the blue end. The solution leaves on evaporation a little amorphous
residue, which is purple by re<U+FB02>ected, and dark green by transmitted,
light, and contains bromine.        On adding an excess of bromine to a
chloroformic solution of phylloxanthin the colour of the solution
changes to a deep yellow, but it still shows a band in the red.
    On treating phylloxanthin with concentrated hydrochloric acid in
the cold no change takes place at <U+FB01>rst, but after some time a great
part of the substance dissolves, yielding a dark greenish-blue solu
 tion, while part remains undissolved as a green fatty mass, which
 may be separated by <U+FB01>ltration through asbestos.       The <U+FB01>ltrate appears
 slightly more green than a solution of phyllocyanin in hydrochloric
 acid, but it shows nearly the same spectrum as the latter, though the
 bands of which it consists are far less distinct and well marked. The
 solution, when shaken up with ether, imparts no colour to the latter,
 behaving in this respect like a solution of phyllocyanin, which shows
 that phylloxanthin by treatment with hydrochloric acid undergoes
 some change.      Nevertheless, when the product of the action is pre
 cipitated from the acid solution by water the precipitate, after <U+FB01>lter
 ing off and washing, dissolves in ether, yielding a solution which
 shows the colour and absorption spectrum of a solution of phyllo
 xanthin.     The precipitated product dissolves also in glacial acetic
  acid boiling, and the solution on cooling deposits a portion which,
  when <U+FB01>ltered OE and dried, appears dark blue, like phyllocyanin, and
  when viewed under the microscope shows the same indistinctly
  crystalline form as the latter. In all other respects, however, it gives
  the same reactions as phylloxanthin, so that it is certain no trans

 iormation into phyllocyanin is e<U+FB01>ected by the action of acid.             The
 vehaviour of phylloxanthin to concentrated sulphuric acid closely
 resembles that just described.
    When cupric acetate is added to a solution of phylloxanthin in
  ioiling glacial acetic acid the solution becomes dark green, and a
 rompouud is formed very similar to that which phyllocyanin yields
 when treated in the same way.           The solution, on cooling and stand
 ing,  gives  a dark-coloured   deposit,  which, after <U+FB01>ltering 011' and treat
 ment with dilute hydrochloric acid, so as to remove any excess of
 :upric acetate that may be present, is redissolved in boiling glacial
\CGtiC acid.      From this solution the compound crystallises out in
small scales, which are purple and lustrous by re<U+FB02>ected light and
pale green by transmitted light.             It closely resembles the cbrre
spending phyllocyanin compound;           its  solutions show the same absorp
tion spectrum as those of the latter, though they have less of a blue
tint, and appear more green. When the same experiment is made
using zinc acetate instead of cupric acetate no change of colour
:akes place, and the acetic acid solution' on cooling deposits unaltered
phylloxanthin; in this respect the two substances show a marked dif
Eerence, since phyllocyanin yields a double compound with zinc and
icetic acid, as described in Part I of this memoir.
    When ferrous oxide and argentic oxide are employed along with
phylloxauthin and acetic acid compounds are formed similar to those
yielded by phyllocyanin,        but their properties are not of suf<U+FB01>cient
,nterest to merit detailed description.           Towards lead acetate phyllo
(anthin, like phyllocyanin, behaves with complete indi<U+FB01>erence.
    \Vhen metallic tin is added to a solution of phylloxanthin in con
:entrated hydrochloric acid the phenomena are similar to those
)bserved in the case of phyllocyanin.            After standing some time the
)right bluish-green colour of the solution changes to olive, and it
10w gives with water a brown precipitate.              On allowing the hydro
:hloric acid solution to stand in contact with metallic tin for some
,ime longer, it becomes red, and now gives with water a red <U+FB02>occu
ent precipitate, which on being <U+FB01>ltered OE and washed turns brown,
bud then dissolves in alcohol with a brown colour ; thealcoholic solu
ion shows only a faint band in the green, but on the addition of a
ittle caustic alkali it turns yellow, and now shows three bands,
vhich are not, however, very distinct.
   Phylloxanthin does not dissolve readily in aqueous alkali, but it
loes so with ease when alcoholic potash or soda is employed.            When
reated with boiling alcohol to which a little alcoholic potash is
tdded phylloxanthin dissolves at once and entirely, yielding a red
iolution, which on continuing to boil turns green. On standing for
.ome    time the solution gives a dark-coloured             deposit, which is
iltered   o<U+FB01>,  washed  with  alcohol, and    dissolved  in water. The watery

               Contributions  to the Chemistry of Chlorophyll.           311
 solution gives with acid a greenish-brown precipitate, which is <U+FB01>ltered
 off and dissolved in a little boiling glacial acetic acid. The solution
 on being left to stand for some days yields a deposit, which is <U+FB01>ltered
 o<U+FB01>, washed with a little alcohol, and dried. This product corresponds
 to the phyllotaonin obtained by the action of alkalis ou phyllocyanin,
 but its properties, though similar, are less characteristic.    When dry
 it appears almost black and amorphous; under the microscope, how
 ever, it is seen to consist in part of prismatic crystals.    It is soluble
 in alcohol, ether, chloroform, and glacial acetic acid, but is insoluble
 in petroleum ether. The solution in ether has a pink colour, and
 shows a spectrum consisting of four bands, of which two, viz., one in
 the red and the other in the green, are very dark. On diluting the
 solution until only a slight tinge of colour is left, the band in the
green becomes very faint, while that in the red splits up into two
nearly equal narrow bands; the band in the green remains single,
however much the solution may be diluted, whereas the analogous
derivative of phyllocyanin, after its solution has stood for some time,
shows a characteristic double band in this part of the spectrum.
    The description of phylloxanthin just given shows that the pro
perties of the substance closely resemble those of its companion
phyllocyanin.     Until the composition of the two substances has been
ascertained, it is impossible to say in what relation they stand to
one another; it is probably a case of isomerism. All attempts to
transform phylloxanthin into phyllocyanin, or mice versd, failed.         It
is certain, however, that the two substances are not formed simul
taneously,   unless strong   acids, such as hydrochloric,   are employed.
When, for instance, a little acetic acid is added to an ethereal solu
tion of chlorophyll there is an immediate change of colour in the
solution accompanied by the formation of phylloxanthin; it is only
after some time that phyllocyanin makes its appearance ; at least, such
is the conclusion derived from spectroscopic examination of the solu
tion.
   This phenomenon may be explained by supposing that the two
substances phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin are formed by the de
composition of two distinct bodies. The researches of Stokes, Sorby,
and others have led to the conclusion that ordinary chlorophyll is a
mixture of several colouring matters, two of which Mr. Sorby has
                              ”
named “blue chlorophyll          and “yellow chlorophyll” respectively.
In a written communication which Sir G. Stokes has kindly addressed
to me, he informs me thatlhe has satis<U+FB01>ed himself that by decomposi
tion with acids blue chlorophyll yields phyllocyanin, whereas yellow
chlorophyll gives phylloxanthin.        This interesting fact affords a
striking con<U+FB01>rmation of the views held by him regarding the complex
nature of chlorophyll.
   The literature of chlorophyll contains descriptions of several sub

stances the properties of which closely resemble those of phylln;
xanthin. One of these is Pringsheim's “hypochloriu.”                       After im
mersing    tissues     containing    chlomphyll      in  dilute  hydrochloric    acid,
Pringsheim observed the formation, after some time, of peculiar
brown crystalloid, sometimes even crystallised, bodies, attached to,
and prooeeding from, the chlorophyll corpuscles of the cells, and
which he supposed to pre-exist in the latter, the acid merely serving
to eliminate them. They constitute his hypochlori-n.                     I  have re
peated Pringsheim’s          experiments with the leaves of various plants,
and found the phenomena under the microscope exactly such as he
describes.     On examining the properties of the hypochlorin obtained,
more especially the absorption spectrum of its solution,                 I arrived at
the conclusion that they do not differ from those 'of phylloxanthin,
and that the two substances are, in fact, identical.
                        Action of Alkalis on Chlorophyll.
    The action of alkalis on chlorophyll has been less frequently and
less minutely studied than that of acids. This may be easily ac
counted for, seeing that, by the prolonged action of alkalis-on solutions
of chlorophyll, no marked changes as regards colour or other outward
properties take place in the latter, some authors going so far as to
 say that no change whatever is effected by the action, the chlorophyll
 merely combining with the alkali to form a saline compound.                     That
 alkalis do not effect so profound an alteration in chlorophyll as acids
 do is true; still, there can be no doubt that the former do lead to
 the formation of a substance having quite distinct properties, as I
 think I shall succeed in showing.
    Chautard,’w who was, I believe, the <U+FB01>rst to study the action of
 alkalis on chlorophyll, states that when caustic potash is added to an
 alcoholic solution of chlorophyll, which is then heated, a change takes
 place in the spectrum, which consists in the splitting into two of the
                                        “ bande
 band in the red, called by him                     spéci<U+FB01>que,” the addition of an
 excess of acid causing it to appear single again, the doubling re
 appearing with alkalis, and so on. The fainter bands of the chloro
 phyll spectrum disappeared almost entirely in Chautard’s experiment.
    On adding potash or soda to a chlorophyll solution Russell and
 Lapraikf observed a change in the spectrum, which consisted in the
 fading out of all except the least refrangihle or dominant hand, the
 latter at the same time spreading towards the blue. With a con
 siderable excess of alkali the dominant baud divided into two distinct
  bands, in accordance with the observation of Chautard.

  account of the action of alkalis on chlorophyll.               The conclusion he
  arrives at is that the action induces a complete change in the chloro
  phyll, leading to the formation of a distinct substance which he calls
  “
    chlorophyllic acid.” The compounds of this substance with alkalis
  show, when in solution, two bands in the red, one of them being very
  thin.   By the action of hydrochloric acid chlorophyllic acid under
  goes decomposition;        the ethereal solution of the product of decom
  position shows a spectrum which is, apparently, that of phyllocyanin.
     Hansen in his memoir, entitled “ Der Chlorophylltarbsto<U+FB01>,” *
  assumes that chlorophyll undergoes no change by the action of alkalis,
  and even submits the crude colouring matter to a process of saponi
  <U+FB01>cation in order to obtain it in a state of purity.               The <U+FB01>nal product
  obtained by Hansen appeared in sphaero-crystals, and consisted,
                                                                             “
  according to him, of chlorophyll, or, as he prefers to call it, chloro
  phyll-green,” in the highest possible state of purity. The fact that
  its solutions show the ordinary chlorophyll spectrum would seem to
  prove the accuracy of _this view;           Nevertheless, it is evident from the
  description of its mode of preparation and properties that chlorophyll
  green must have been a sodium compound ; and this, indeed, is
  acknowledged by the author himself who, in a subsequent me-moir,'l‘
  describes a process for obtaining the colouring matter free from
  sodium, which, from the fact of the substance being very sensitive to
  the in<U+FB02>uence of acids, must be conducted with care.
     In a memoir, entitled “Extraction de la Matiere Verte des Feuilles,"x
  Guignet describes a method for obtaining the sodium compound of
  chlorophyll in dark green, crystalline           needles, of which he says that
  its solutions    show exactly the same absorption bands as those of
  ordinary chlorophyll.         I have repeated the experiments of Hansen
  and Guignet, but have not succeeded in obtaining a crystalline com
  pound as they did, probably from want of manipulative skill on my
  part. The product prepared by Guignet’s process, though amorphous,
  did, however, on decomposition with acid yield a result which plainly
  showed that the body acted on was by no means unchanged ch-loro
  phyll; the product of decomposition gave the reactions not of phyllo
  cyanin or phylloxanthin, but of phyllotaonin.
     In order to con<U+FB01>rm or otherwise the results arrived at by my pre
   decessors, I  devised a new and comparatively simple method of pre
   paring  what    has been called “alkaline chlorophyll.”               The process I
‘
   adopt may be described as            follows   :—Fresh leaves, preferably of
   grass, are treated with boiling spirits of wine containing about 80 per
   cent. of alcohol.     The green extract is <U+FB01>ltered hot and, after standing
   for a day or two, yields a dark green voluminous deposit containing

particles of sodium bicarbonate, together with the product
of alkali on chlorophyll combined with soda. The mass or
now washed with cold alcohol as long as the latter takes 11}
is then treated with water, in which the greater part dism
nicely crystallised chrysophyll being generally left undiss

The <U+FB01>ltered alcoholic solution leaves on evaporation a
residue along with a quantity of salt.      The latter may
removed by treatment with a small quantity of cold wat

compound is soluble, is added.      The solution in absolute :
a pure dark green, and leaves on evaporation an amorphor
 residue, which is purple and lustrous by re<U+FB02>ected andk
 by transmitted light; it may be easily pulverised, yield
 green powder.
    The product thus obtained is a sodium compound, and
 water.    The aqueous solution gives green precipitates v
 chloride, lead acetate, cupric acetate, and silver nitrate
 precipitate blackens at once on boiling the liquid. In 0rd
 the substance with which the sodium is combined, the pri

a better name can be found, alkachlorophyll, a name pointing at the
same time to the agent by which         formed and to its resemblance
                                         it   is
to the mother substance.    It shows no signs whatever of crystalline
structure,  is quite insoluble in boiling water, but easily soluble in
alcohol, ether, chloroform, benzol, aniline, and carbon disulphide, but
insoluble in petroleum ether.     Its solutions have a brilliant green
colour with a pronounced bluish tinge, by which they may be easily
distinguished  from ordinary chlorophyll solutions, and    marked red
                                                                    a
<U+FB02>uorescence.   The ethereal solution shows no less than six absorption
bands.   Of these, the two in the red probably correspond with those
<U+FB01>rst observed by Chautard, while the one in the blue is in a part of
the spectrum in which total absorption takes place with ordinary
chlorophyll solutions.
     Alknchlorophyll   in solution shows     remarkable degree of per
                                                   a
manence when exposed to the combined action of air and light as
compared with chlorophyll.      Having prepared an ethereal solution of
alkachlorophyll, and. also, an ethereal solution of ordinary chlorophyll,
from fern fronds, as nearly as possible of the same depth of‘colour as
the diiference of tint would permit,     exposed the two solutions in
                                          I
loosely stoppered bottles to. the action of alternate sunlight and
diffused daylight in a window facing the south.       The experiment
commenced on the 21st February. On the 27th of the same month
the chlorophyll solution had lost its green colour and become yellow,
the chlorophyll bands having disappeared, those still remaining being
due to phyllocyanin, the formation of which was doubtless due to de
composition of part of the chlorophylL       The solution of alkachloro
phyll, on  the other  hand,  was  still green, and still showed the six
original bands, though    itwas found to have lost in intensity of colour
when compared with another portion of the same solution that had
been kept in the dark.    On the 11th March the solution had become
pale green, and now only showed four bands.           On the 25th March
the solution still showed the bands in the red and blue, though they
appeared very faint.    On the 8th May        slight green tinge was still
                                                   a
visible, but the bands had nearly disappeared.        The relatively great
stability of alkachlorophyll  when    exposed to  air and light   of itself
                                                                         is
suf<U+FB01>cient to prove that by the action of alkali chlorophyll undergoes a
thorough change.
  The action of acids on alkachlorophyll is especially interesting, be
cause the products to which     gives rise differ entirely from those
                                    it
derived from the decomposition of chlorophyll with acids.         When
acetic acid   added to an alcoholic solution of alkachlorophyll the
              is
solution on heating loses its green colour, which changes to a dirty
 purple.   The substance     is   now completely decomposed, but no phyllo

   l6                         Mr. E. Schunck.
  yanin  is found    among the products of decomposition, the chief
 iroduct nearly resembling phyllotaonin, with which it is indeed prob
ably identical.    The solution, on being evaporath nearly to dryness,
gives a dark coloured deposit, which being <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01> may be dis
solved in boiling glacial acetic acid. The solution left to stand yields
a semi-crystalline   deposit, which, <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>, washed with cold alcohol,
and dried, appears purple by re<U+FB02>ected light; it dissolves, though not
readily, in ether, giving a purplish solution which shows the same
absorption bands as phyllotaonin acetate or ethylphyllot-aonin.        On
treatment with alcoholic potash it      dissolves, giving a bright green
solution which on boiling turns brown, and on now adding acetic acid
and shaking up with ether a solution is obtained which has the
colour and shows the same bands as a solution of phylloeyanin.
    These reactions would seem. to indicate the presence of phyllotaoniu
among the products of decomposition of alkachlorophyll; the simul
taneous presence of other products, especially fatty acid, renders its
puri<U+FB01>cation dif<U+FB01>cult.     The method of preparing alkachlorophyll as
above described does not of course preclude the possibility of its con
taining an admixture of fatty acid; still I cannot help thinking that
a portion at least of the fatty acid found is actually formed during
the process of decomposition with acids.
    In order to see whether, in addition to the one just described,
some other product or products possibly soluble in water were formed
by the action of acids on alkachlorophyll, a quantity of the substance
was treated with boiling dilute sulphuric acid.          The acid liquid
<U+FB01>ltered from the undissol'ved matter was coloured blue.         On being
neutralised with barium carbonate the blue colour disappeared, and
the liquid having been <U+FB01>ltered and evaporated left a slightly coloured
residue which was treated with absolute alcohol.         This dissolved a
 portion, and left after <U+FB01>ltration and evaporation a pale yellow
 glutinous residue.    This residue was soluble in water, but insoluble
in ether. The watery solution had an alkaline reaction; it did not
react with Fehling’s solution.       The alcoholic solution gave with
platinum chloride a pale yellow crystalline deposit. The quantity of
the substance obtained in this experiment was too. small to allow of
its identi<U+FB01>cation.    Should it turn out to be an organic base, as its re
 actions would seem to indicate, the fact would tend to con<U+FB01>rm the
 view taken by Hoppe-Seyler, who obtained cholin as a product of de
 composition of his chlorophyllan, and hence concluded that chloro
 phyll itself might have a constitution similar to that of lecithin.

   When investigating the sounds produced by skeletal muscle when
caused to contract at varying rates by electric stimulation, we were

thoroughly convinced that a single contraction produced by a single
induction shock gave rise to an audible sound of somewhat the same
character as the <U+FB01>rst sound of the heart?“
     But it was urged by some physical friends that if the contraction
 were really a single one, causing a single vibration, it could not be
 heard, because a series of vibrations was necessary to produce a sound,
and therefore, unless secondary oscillations succeeded the contraction,
 the latter would be inaudible.
     Now muscular tissue, especially when surrounded by fascia,
fat, &c., seemed to be particularly ill suited for sustaining any such
series of vibrations, and no such oscillations can be detected on the
graphic record of the muscular movement.
    When the muscle was stimulated at regular intervals with increasing
frequencies the short thuds due to each contraction could be heard
separately up to a rate of about forty per second, when these thuds
became gradually fused into a dull tone, only clear at somewhat
above the rate now accepted as the lower limit of audibility of true
tones, viz., forty-one vibrations per second.                We adopt this rate,
given by Helmholtz<U+FB01> and neglect the rates of Savart and Preyer,I
as we believe the tones they heard were probably due to harmonic
additions to the rumble of single sound waves caused by 8 or
 15 V.D. per second.            That the droning sound produced by the
lowest organ pipes is not really heard as a true tone seems satis
factorily proved by the well-known fact that they cannot be tuned
by the ear alone even of the greatest expert, but only indirectly by
the beats which they make with the tones of the upper octaves. The
value of such sounds as those produced by a body vibrating slower
than forty times per second, and having no true tone capable of
differentiation of pitch, can only be to modify and soften the tones of
higher octaves, which so occupy the auditory apparatus as to make
the separation of the slow single vibrations no longer perceptible.
    But the question of the vibrations becoming fused into a musical
tone is distinct from that of the audibility of each vibration separately,
except in so far as the admission of imperfect union distinctly
implies the audibility of the separate vibrations.

 the belief that a single wave could be transmitted, so as to excite
 the terminals of the auditory nerve.
    On the other hand, if one complete vibration does not stimulate
 the hearing apparatus, a distinct logical dif<U+FB01>culty presents itself
 when we attempt to explain how multiples of no stimulation can give
 rise to such an immense variety of de<U+FB01>nite effects onv the cochlea and
 the brain.       If expressed as a formula, the inaudibility of single
 vibrations appears absurd, 1 V.D. = 0 but 528 V.D. = C”.
    Being satis<U+FB01>ed that a single contraction of muscle could be heard
 as a thud, and that the single thuds could be heard separately until a
 rate was attained that fused them into a tone, it was thought
 advisable to examine some physical instruments for the production of
 sound, which admit of adjustment to various rates above and below
the lower limit of appreciation of tone.
    It is well known that, with organ pipes 32 feet long, or witha
monochord, the string of which by weighting has been made to
vibrate below thirty times per second, sounds are heard having the
character of an imperfectly fused rumble, in which the ear can dis
tinctly detect the separate vibrations, but no distinctive tone.
    Some exception might be taken to the evidence furnished by the
use of pipes or strings as to the audibility of the separate waves on
account of the possibility of harmonic sub-division of the column of
air or string giving the octave as the chief harmonic. We, therefore,
preferred to use tuning forks, in the case of which this objection does
not obtain, as their vibrations are probably the most purely pendular,
and the <U+FB01>rst harmonic of the fork is so much higher in pitch (64l times
the vibration frequency of the fundamental tone), as to be always
readily recognisable if present. With a fork of 30 V.D. per second,
a sound is produced which is audible through the air, but much more
distinctly so by placing the base of the fork in contact with the head
or by <U+FB01>xing the fork <U+FB01>rmly in a block of wood which was auscultated
by a binaural stethescope. The character of the sound remained the
same when transmitted by these diiferent methods.              At this rate of
vibration (thirty per second), the impression is just becoming con
tinuous, but not su<U+FB02>iciently so as either to prevent the recognition of
the separate vibrations or to produce a distinctive tone. By the use of
brass weights, <U+FB01>rmly clamped at different heights on the prongs of
the fork, its rate of vibration was reduced to 28, 24, and 20 V.D. per
second respectively, the rate being estimated by being recorded on a
smoked surface moving at a known velocity.            The eifect of this reduc
tion of rate   is  that, while the intensity of the sound becomes enfeebled,
the separation of the constituent vibrations becomes more distinct and
unmistakable.        Thus the audibility of the fork becomes less and less
as the   rate is  lowered,   but the sound always preserves the same tone
less and interrupted character.        These effects of reducing the rate of

1892.]         On the Audibz'lity  of single Sound Waves,   (gr.       321
vibration ought not to take place if the audition depended upon
adventitious vibrations set up in bodies in contact with the fork. But,
if each vibration transmits a distinct movement to the ossicles of the
ear, both these effects should be expected, and are easily explained.
And the fact that, with the low rates of vibration, the waves in air
are so long and the changes of pressure so gradual that the sound
ceases to be appreciated through the air, while still distinctly audible
through the bones of the head, also becomes clear. We may then con
clude that when the rate of vibration is reduced to that at which the
individual waves are no longer heard, the fork has become absolutely
inaudible; while the power of diiferentiating tone is lost long before
this limit   has been reached.
    It might be alleged that, although the fork gives rise to a series of
pure pendular vibrations, these set up secondary vibrations of higher
frequency in the membrane of the tympanum, or some medium through
 which the waves pass.
    To test this point, we constructed a kind of phonautograph in
 imitation of the tympanic membrane. It consisted of a circular metal
 frame, over which a thin india-rubber membrane was stretched with
 very slight and adjustable tension.       An extremely light lever, armed
 with a <U+FB01>ne writing point, and poised on jewelled bearings, similar to
 the escapement of a watch, was brought into connexion with the
 centre of this membrane, so as to record its slightest movement on a
 smooth, lightly-smoked, moving surface.          With this apparatus we
 were able to record the vibration of forks at the rate of 25 and 30
 VD. per second, when the fork was held about 2 or 3 cm. from
 the membrane, and the vibrations thus transmitted through the
 medium of the air.      The tracing was made up of a series of regular
 undulations, entirely free from any indication either of over-tones or
              ” of the membrane.        It appears, then, exceedingly im
 “self-tone
 probable,   if such   a comparatively    rough mechanism can transmit
 these slow toneless waves without exhibiting any tendency to per
 sistent vibration of its own, that this should occur with the membrana
 tympani, the structure of which is adaptively modi<U+FB01>ed so as to check,
 in particular, any such effect, and which is capable of di<U+FB01>erentiating
 such a wide range of tones with equal precision.
    From the foregoing it would appear that not only is there no
  di<U+FB02>iculty in understanding how these waves, which are too slow to
 produce a tone, are carried to the nerve, but also that the pure
  pendular vibrations of the tuning fork furnish conclusive evidence of
  the audibility of each single wave when reduced to a rate at which
  tone can no longer be discriminated.
     In order to obtain single vibrations of the more rapid rate of higher
  notes (i.e., vibrations of short durations isolated from the series
  causing the note) we employed a disk siren in which any number of

 322         On   the   Audiln'lity    of single Sound   Waves,   (5'0.   [Jam   21,
 holes could be left open or closed at will. The wheel was turned by
 hand, about twenty-<U+FB01>ve rotations of the disk being the maximum
 attainable with the required regularity.
   By leaving only one hole open, only one pn<U+FB02>f was made at each
 revolution.    By varying the rate of rotation, waves of different dura
 tion, i.e., corresponding to vibrations of different pitch, could be
 produced.     No matter how the rate of revolution was increased, up
 to the  maximum,   twenty-<U+FB01>ve per second, only the single puffs could be
 heard; at <U+FB01>rst quite separate, then as a soft purr, and at the quickest
 rate like a kind of rapid patter.
    With this siren, the sound caused by the single impulse is most
 distinct and clear, and its invariability in character with varying rate
 and varying blast of air particularly noticeable.     The single puffs of
 a duration not exceeding <U+FB01>l<U+FB01> second were thus perfectly audible.
    As the rates just referred to were estimated from the number of
 revolutions made by the driving wheel, we thought it advisable to
 control this method of measuring the length of the waves by ascer
 taining the note produced by the siren when all the holes were open
 while the disk revolved at the same rates. It was thus found that
 clear tones could be heard varying with the rate up to the maximal
 attainable limit, somewhat above the note 0’”, i.e., 1056 per second.
                                         II.
   No doubt adventitious    secondary oscillations followed the single
puffs for a short period, and probably gave them character as well as
making them more distinctly audible. Hence we wished to hear
what character the tones would have if caused by a short series of
these vibrations.   We commenced with a number of holes open
which, at our maximal rate, would have a duration of “1,0 second.
 This gave a tone similar to, and quite as distinct as, that produced
 when all the holes were open.        We then gradually reduced the
number of holes used, and we found a fact which, as far as we know,
has not been previously observed, and for which we were not prepared
by the importance given by our physical friends to the necessity of a,
series of waves in the production of sounds.       When only two holes
remained open, the variation in tone following changes in rate was
perfectly distinct, and a note even higher than 0'”, corresponding to
1056 VD. could be heard perfectly.      That is to say, a series made up
of two pu<U+FB01>'s which lasted 1     01,,
                               6th of a second each, or less than 5—5—oth
of a second for the series, was capable of stimulating the terminals of
the auditory nerve in such a way as to make the tone 0’” readin
recognisable.
   When the single hole and the double hole were tried alternately,
the result was striking.  The pitch of the note caused by the short
series of two puffs rose and fell with the increase or decrease of the

rate of rotation, while with the single hole the puff, though distinctly
audible, remained the same monotonous sound, independent of
sudden variations of the speed of the disk. The only change in
character was that the intensity diminished with the lower rates of
vibration.
    From the foregoing, we have been led to the following conclusions :—
    1. When sound is produced by a vibrating body, each individual
wave of the series causing the tone stimulates the terminals of the
auditory nerve. If the single vibrations are of such a nature as to be
inaudible, no tone can be heard.
    2. The individual vibrations can be heard when the rate of vibra
tion is too slow for a distinctive tone to be appreciated.
    3. The immediate succession of two waves, at rates of vibration
above <U+FB01>fty per second, gives rise to a sensation of tone having the
same pitch as that yielded by,a prolonged series at the same rate.
    That is to say, one can distinguish the tone produced when only
two vibrations of a series reach the terminals of the auditory nerve.
    4. Having worked for some time with rates of vibration near the
limit of the lowest tones, we are forced to admit that we have not
attained the skill (said to be attained by practice) of distinguishing
 small changes in pitch with rates of vibration below <U+FB01>fty per second;
at least, in the case of pendular vibration, such as is produced by
tuning forks or muscular contraction.

        SCHiiFER, F.R.S. Received December 10, 1891.
    By a series of papers ending with that by myself with Dr. A.
McCormick (‘Journ. Anat. Physiol.,’ January, 1892), it has been
 <U+FB01>nally determined that the time-honoured doctrine of the closure of
 the larynx by a lid-like action of the epiglottis is quite untenable;
 but, so far as I am aware, no satisfactory account of how after all the
 larynx is closed voluntarily and re<U+FB02>exly has as yet been given.           The
 determination of the positive side of the question was nevertheless
 the necessary sequel of the determination             of the negative side;
 having   settled  how it is not  closed, one  naturally  proceeded to enquire
 how the larynx is closed,     since  closed  it at times  must be, and that at
 its very entrance.
    In the literature of the subject        I  <U+FB01>nd that there is considerable
 looseness of diction.       “Closure of the larynx” may mean either
                                “                                   “

the superior aperture of the hrynx.” These are manifestly three
 very di<U+FB01>erent things, and it is that of the superior aperture which
 was e<U+FB01>ected by the epiglottis according to the old doctrine.            On
 account of this looseness of diction, the experiments of John Reid
 lose most of their value in this connexion.
    Now when one re<U+FB02>ects that closure of the glottis merely would
still leave patent all that portion of the laryngeal cavity above the
level of the glottis, the vestibule, a region exquisitely sensitive to
mechanical irritation, one immediately perceives that if the epiglottis
does not e<U+FB01>ect the closure, then some other agency must exist where
by the superior aperture of the larynx, its very entrance, is closed
against the entrance of food particles during deglutition.       It is quite
immaterial where the closure takes place so far as closure of the
larynx during forced e<U+FB02>orts is concerned, but it is not immaterial
where it is effected in deglutition, for the superior aperture, at least,
must be closed, however much farther downwards the closure takes
place. Were it to remain open, the vestibule of the larynx would be
a regular funnel specially adapted, as it were, to take up particles of
food.    Such particles after the act of deglutition is over would need
to be expelled by a violent expiration, a cough, or they would by their
weight fall into, or by the force of the inspiratory air blast they would
be drawn into, the lower passages.     Now these things do not happen,
so that a priori even, we may assume that the actual entrance to
the larynx is closed, and experimentally      I have seen that it is closed,
while, on the other hand, Longet kept the margins of the glottis_ so
apart that that aperture could not be closed, and yet the act of
swallowing was carried out normally.
   It may be well to give a straightforward account of how have      I
observed the larynx to be closed, and I shall then give details of
experimental observations.
    The observations were made on—
    1. A man who had a large part of the side wall of the pharynx
removed for carcinoma, without in any way interfering with the
larynx.     The man made a good recovery, and when feeding by the
use of the stomach-tube was discontinued, he immediately swallowed
as   perfectly as he ever afterwards    did, so that no education of the
parts seemed    necessary, and   he continues   to swallow about as well
as he ever did, so that in function the parts are practically unim
paired.    This man usually wears a rubber pad over the hole, but
upon   the removal of the same, that is, even with the hole open, one
0911 watch with the unaided eye many of the phenomena of voluntary
closure of the larynx, swallowing, coughing, singing, and so on.
With the hole open a bolus of solid food is successfully swallowed,
perhaps once out of three attempts; the other two times it will escape
by the open hole.

    2. A  series of healthy persons examined laryngoscopically.
    3. Frogs, Tortoises, Lizards, Birds, examined by simply opening the
mouth and observing the top of the larynx, and the effects of stimu
lating certain of its muscles.
    4. The Opossum, Cat, Dog, and Goat, anaesthetised with chloroform,
and the laryngeal aperture examined through an incision in the
middle line above the level of the epiglottis.              Swallowing was
observed as it occurred spontaneously or was evoked by irritating the
pharyngeal mucous membrane.                The relation of the tip of the
epiglottis to the lower end of the incision formed an excellent guide
as to whether or not the epiglottis moved.         The complete closure of
the larynx was tested by the stoppage of a current of air sucked
down through the larynx;
    In Man, and presumably in other animals with larynges of a like
build, during respiration the arytenoid cartilages stand backwards
and are rotated outwards.           They, surmounted by the Santorinian
cartilages   and  enveloped     in the  mucous membrane, are continually
but somewhat irregularly advancing and retiring synchronously with
the movements of expiration and inspiration. When they are back
wards as in inspiration, the arytenoids, the posterior margin of the
superior aperture of the larynx, lie against, and may indent, the pos
terior wall of the pharynx. In forced respiration these movements are
exaggerated.      The upward and backward direction continues more
or less the direction of the plane of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage.
    When the laryngeal entrance is to be closed, the arytenoid carti
lages leave the posterior wall of the pharynx, are rotated and are
moved bodily inwards, so as to bring their internal faces into contact,
are inclined forwards, and glide forwards.
    By the apposition of the arytenoids a mesial <U+FB01>ssure makes its
appearance, bounded posteriorly by the fold of mucosa containing
the transverse arytenoid muscle and laterally by the arytenoids.
 The plane in which this <U+FB01>ssure lies is, in Man in the erect posture,
obliquely from before downwards and backwards.              This <U+FB01>ssure ends
 anteriorly in another <U+FB01>ssure, which, however, is transverse; the two
together constitute a triradiate <U+FB01>ssure having the form of a squat T,
 the vertical limb being somewhat short, and the transverse limb
 rounded, owing to the pulling inwards, towards the middle line, of
 the margins of the epiglottis, so that the epiglottis thus forms a more
 marked hollow to receive the tips of the arytenoids.
    The transverse <U+FB01>ssure constituting the head of the         T  is bounded
 anteriorly by  the epiglottis,  and  posteriorly by the  ary-epiglottic folds.
 The ends of this <U+FB01>ssure are closed by the junction of the ary
 epiglottic folds with the margin of the epiglottis, and in the middle
 line posteriorly it receives the posterior or inter-arytenoid limb of
 the triradiate <U+FB01>ssure.

     Around the central point of this triradiate <U+FB01>ssure are to be noted
 three prominences or thicknesses, viz., in front, and in the mesial
 plane, the cushion of the epiglottis more or less <U+FB01>lling up the slight
 hollow left between the two prominences next to be mentioned, viz.,
  slight thickenings at the point of <U+FB02>exion of the ary-epiglottic folds,
  where the lateral boundary of the antero-posterior limb of the <U+FB01>ssure
 becomes continuous with the posterior boundary of the transverse
  portion ; these are the tubercles of Wrisberg.
     Having observed the appearances in the case of Dyason (‘ Jl.
  Anat. Physiol.,’ ut sup-d),         I thought  it advisable to get independent
 observations      made by professed laryngologists, whom             I   had made
  acquainted with my observations.               At my request, therefore, Dr.
  Barrett and Mr. Iredell, of Melbourne, kindly undertook to look into
 the matter, and here is what they say :—
     Dr. Barrett.——“ The appearances of the larynx as seen from above
 with the laryngoscope when closed during forcible expulsive efforts.
 A laryngoscopic examination was made in the cases of two young
 men with normal throats.               They were directed to make expulsive
 efforts, as in defaecation.         In both cases the appearances were similar.
 A view     was <U+FB01>rst obtained during ordinary expiration, and then forcible
  expulsive efforts were made.              The following changes occurred :—
 The cords and arytenoids approximated, and then the arytenoids
 moved forward until the mucous membrane and cornicula over them
 were <U+FB01>rmly pressed against the epiglottis, at a point much higher
 than the attachment of the vocal cords.                  The epiglottis did not
 during the closure in any way alter its inclination, remaining vertical
 throughout.       In one case, however, it became very much more curved
 round a vertical axis. It did not participate actively in the closure.
 The closed larynx may be said to show a triradiate <U+FB01>gure like a
 shortened T, the vertical limb being much shortened, and representing
 the <U+FB01>ssure between the arytenoids, and the crossed limb being some
 what curved.”
     Mr. Iredell.——“ Undoubtedly during straining the posterior carti
 lages of the rim of the larynx come forward and appear to be about
 to form the <U+FB01>gure you draw, but long before anything of the kind is
perfect the muscular parts of the pharynx prevent all view.                   This is
much more so during             the    act of swallowing.    This much     is clear:
there is no sign of the epiglottis folding backwards and downwards,
and. as the act of swallowing proceeds this would appear to become
more and more impossible.               Yet there is an appearance—it may be
only an appearance—of a tendency to move back the whole body of
the tongue, carrying with it the epiglottis.”‘“=
    * I believe that the difference in the amount seen by the two observers is due to
the fact that Dr. Barrett probably used the cocaine spray, while Mr. Iredell did not.
I  remember that the former did use it in one case in my presence, while with the
latter  I did not speak of it.

 1892J       On the Mechanism     of the Closure of the Laryna'.       327'
    If it be a simple   voluntary closure of the laryngeal entrance, with
 or without expiratory eifort, that is under observation, nothing further
is to be noted. When the entrance is opened the arytenoids leave
the epiglottis and then each other, are rotated outwards and back
wards, move bodily outwards, glide backwards, and thus again assume
the position they occupy in respiration.
   If, however, the entrance is to be closed as a part of the act of
swallowing, then, of course, the well known movement of the entire
 larynx upwards and forwards ensues, and the tips of the arytenoids
are seen to be jammed <U+FB01>rmly against the epiglottis.           This is due
partly to the thyro~arytenoid vigorously rotating the arytenoids
inwards, and pulling them downwards and forwards, so that their
tips come into contact with the base of the epiglottis; partly, how
ever, it is due to the elevators of the larynx pulling the larynx
upwards and forwards against the base of the tongue. In this
position of the larynx the epiglottis lies between the rest of the larynx
and the tongue and is <U+FB01>rmly applied to both, is in fact compressed
between them.      It is, however, clear that if the epiglottis were not    v
there the laryngeal entrance would still be closed, partly by the
gathering up of its margins as above described, and partly by its
direct contact with the base of the tongue, there being new no epi
glottis to intervene.
   The behaviour of the distal or apical portion of the epiglottis at
this stage is not the same in all animals. In the Dog, for instance, the
epiglottis is extremely <U+FB02>exible, and comparatively short, and is thus
easily engaged between the tongue and the larynx. In the Dog, there
fore, the distal portion of the epiglottis has the appearance of closing
the laryngeal ori<U+FB01>ce in the lid-like way usually described as general
in its application; but how little this is essential is at once evident
when we remember the little or no inconvenience following its com
plete removal.    In animals such as the Goat, which, like Man, has the
distal portion of the epiglottis long and stiff, quite another picture is
presented during this stage of the act of swallowing.       It is only the
base of the epiglottis which is engaged between the base of the tongue
and the larynx ; the distal portion does not fold down as a lid, but is
applied to the most posterior part of the back of the tongue, so that
the hollow laryngeal surface of the epiglottis continues backwards
the surface over which the bolus glides from the tongue.
   This,  I  think, may indicate the function of the hyo-epiglottic‘
muscle about which there has been so much doubt.              May it not
serve to pull the epiglottis towards the hyoid bone during the act
of deglutition, so that the epiglottis       would be drawn upwards
and forwards with the larynx ? The bye-epiglottic muscle would
then stand in the same relation to the epiglottic cartilage as the
bye-thyroid muscle     does  to the thyroid cartilage.   In this  way the

epiglottis     would   lie   on the tongue’s     and be <U+FB01>rmly pulled
                                               surface,
against  it,
           so that the bolus would have less chance of getting between
the epiglottis and the tongue in its passage downwards.         Not all
animals have this  muscle, but then di<U+FB01>erences in the arrangements of
the other parts may account for this. My experiments show that
writers have hitherto taken too little notice of the differences in the
anatomy of the larynx in different animals.     These differences are
very considerable.
I    think we can generalise by saying that the closure of the larynx
is invariably e<U+FB01>ected by contact of the arytenoids with each other
and then contact of the two together with some part of the anterior
wall of the laryngeal cavity, but how this latter contact is e<U+FB01>’ected
varies with the anatomical arrangements of the parts.
   The extent of the contact of arytenoid with arytenoid varies.      It
may be (1) by the entire internal faces of the cartilages, (2) byan
area along the anterior margin only, in which case the mucosa over
it may be very thin and the whitish cartilage may show through, as
in the Koala, or (3) the cartilages, though brought together, cannot,
owing to their form, close the respiratory glottis (Milne Edwards).
   We may,      Ithink, divide" arytenoids into relatively large and
relatively small. Then the former into relatively narrow and rela
tively broad. Thus we get three groups of arytenoid cartilages, via,
(1) high and narrow, (2) high and broad, (3) small.
   In the high and narrow group the arytenoids fold over into contact
with the front wall of the laryngeal cavity: the base of the epiglottis
as
 I   have described in Man and the Goat.
   In the high and broad group, including many of the Marsupials              I
have examined, the arytenoids move more bodily forwards into
contact with the base of the epiglottis, or at least the front of the
vestibule.
  In the group    of small arytenoids, neither folding nor movement
bodily forwards  would   suffice to e<U+FB01>ect the contact, and here the lower
part of the epiglottis       permanently
                               is            bent backwards, so that the
wall of the upper and front part of the laryngeal cavity forms a little
hood over the vocal cords, about the posterior margin of which hood
the arytenoid contact takes place.          In this case, therefore, the
epiglottic base  has,  as       were
                                it    (permanently), gone to meet the
(small) arytenoids, which thus are able to effect the contact with a
minimum of movement.1'
   In all cases   Iattach the greatest importance in effecting the
laryngeal closure to the contact of the larynx as         whole with the

 base of the tongue, with or without the intervention of the epiglottic
 base.   The movements of the arytenoids constitute a gathering up
of the back and side boundaries, while its front boundary is virtually
gathered up by its remaining stationary against the base of the
tongue while the whole larynx moves forward. This is why swallow
ing is so often but little aifected by the loss of the epiglottis by
disease, accident, or experiment.       Even less of the arytenoids by
disease does not seem to necessarily cause dif<U+FB01>culties in deglutition.
   I  think it more than probable that there are differences between
various species, and even between individuals of the same species, as
to the importance of the part played by the tongue in closing the
larynx.    This seems to follow from the very various anatomical dis
positions of the parts, and may account for much of the difference in
the symptoms and signs of a particular laryngeal lesion in di<U+FB01>erent
individuals.   In one case a lesion of the arytenoids or ary-epiglottic
folds is not followed by dif<U+FB01>culties of swallowing, while apparently
the same, or even a less, degree of the same lesion in another case
is followed by almost total inability to swallow, at all events, liquid
food. For instance, in John Reid’s experiments of cutting all the
four laryngeal nerves in four Rabbits, two continued to take milk and
two refused it. Two Dogs similarly treated continued to take both
solids and liquids. In none of these cases was food found in the air
passages after death. Reid therefore concludes that “the epiglottis
.         can prevent the ingress of food into the larynx when the
movements of all the muscles which diminish the size of the glottis
(sic) have been suspended by section of the laryngeal nerves.”     (“An
Experimental Enquiry into the Function of the Eighth Pair of
Nerves,” ‘Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal,’ January, 1838.)
   This same forward and upward movement of the larynx brings
the lamina of the cricoid cartilage away from the back wall of the
pharynx, and so provides the room necessary for the passage of the
bolus. When the arytenoids are in position forwards, their highest
points are their margins bounding the mesial <U+FB01>ssure. This <U+FB01>ssure
thus traverses, as it were, a little ridge from before backwards, and
from this ridge the top of the closed larynx slopes downwards at the
sides and posteriorly, but especially at the sides.
   Thus, when the laryngeal entrance is closed as for deglutition there
is a fairly even surface for the bolus to glide over, from the laryngeal
face of the epiglottis to the posterior surface of the arytenoids and
lamina of the cricoid, and so into the gullet.
   According to this account of the closure of the laryngeal entrance,
the arytenoids enclosed in their mucosa—an arytenoid valve or <U+FB02>ap——
take the place of the epiglottis according to the old account, which is
now all but universally discredited.
   I have no doubt that the apparent <U+FB01>tness of the epiglottis as a lid

 to cover the voice-box has given a longer life to the time-honoured
 doctrine of the functions of the epiglottis than it would otherwise
 have had; it seemed so beautifully <U+FB01>tted for its of<U+FB01>ce that until
 recently it did not occur to any one to question it. Upon considera
 tion, however, of the part played by the arytenoid valve according to
 my account, it appears to be much more beautiful than the part
 played by the epiglottis in the old account of the closure of the
 larynx, for, in addition to the merit of being demonstrably true, it
 co-ordinates and explains many observations hitherto without any
 connecting link or explanation, as will be set forth later on. In the
 meantime, however,     I may point out how this arytenoid valve stands
 at the parting of the ways downwards out of the pharynx: when it
 stands backwards the food-passage is closed and the air-passage is
 open, when it lies forwards the air-passage is closed and the food
 passage is open. Thus it can make, as it were, a funnel forwards
 into the air-tube or a funnel backwards into the food-tube.      In short,
 and to use a particularly Australian illustration, it stands like the
little movable gate by which sheep are drafted out of the common
 yard into separate pens—it drafts the air forwards and the food back
 wards.
    This use of the term funnel is fully justi<U+FB01>able.   In ordinary respira
 tion, especially during inspiration, since the top of the arytenoid <U+FB02>ap
 lies against—may even indent—the posterior pharyngeal wall, the way
to the gullet is stopped, while the vestibule of the larynx is wide and
patent, and, of course, is wide at the entrance and narrows downwards
to the glottis. In this condition the shape of the entrance is appa
rently <U+FB01>ve-sided, though really there is a sixth, but comparatively
 small, side in the middle line posteriorly, where the transverse aryte
 noid muscle is. The anterior side is formed by the epiglottis.        The
lateral margins consist each of an anterior moiety formed by the ary
epiglottic fold, and of a posterior moiety containing the arytenoid
tips and Santorinian cartilages.      When the larynx of the Goat is
exposed,   this  anterior funnel is peculiarly striking during forced in
spiration, and the superior margin of it is almost circular, the violent
outward and backward movement of the arytenoid tips pulling back
wards the margin of the epiglottis, and so rounding off the anterior
angles, and the <U+FB02>exible tips of the arytenoid and Santorinian cartil
ages yielding to the pull of the ary-epiglottic folds, and so rounding
off the lateral angles.
    The posterior funnel, though less striking, is hardly less real than
the anterior one. It really exists only during the act of swallowing,
and then also its anterior wall is composite and somewhat irregular.
The anterior wall is formed above by the epiglottis, in the middle
by the back of the arytenoid <U+FB02>ap, and below by the back of the
lamina of the cricoid.      Now, while the epiglottis is always more or

 1892.]        On the Mechanism   of the Closure of the Larynw.        331
less in position, the arytenoid portion is only there during closure of
the laryngeal aperture, and the lamina of the cricoid is heaved
forwards only during deglutition. Thus only during deglutition does
the lamina of the cricoid form the inferior part of the anterior wall
of a. funnel.
    Very much the same condition of parts is seen in Manatus (Wal
deyer,
          ‘
            Sitzungsb. der Konig. Preuss. Akad.,’ Berlin, 1886). “Here
one cannot speak of a bifurcation of the food channel as if it went to
the right and left of the epiglottis, for, in Manatus, even small quan
tities of <U+FB02>uids must reach the oesophagus by passing straight over
the larynx. Since, however, the laryngeal entrance is <U+FB01>rmly closed
in the way I have described, and so makes a surface gently inclined
backwards, the entrance of liquids and solid foods is ef<U+FB01>ciently
prevented.”
    The two funnels then, the air-funnel and the food-funnel, are
alternately conditioned, the former solely, the latter largely, by the
movement of the arytenoid <U+FB02>ap backwards and forwards respectively.
    In passing and in this connexion, one may point out a part played
 by the lamina of the cricoid.       When the arytenoids move forwards
their vocal processes move towards each other and at the same
time downwards,         so that the plane of the glottis; comes to lie
lower posteriorly. Anteriorly, of course, the plane is <U+FB01>xed by the
attachment of the true cords to the thyroid cartilage.           Thus the
special vocal apparatus during deglutition lies deep down within the
 laryngeal cavity, and by the lamina of the cricoid is protected from
 the pressure of the bolus, pulled forwards, as it is, by the muscular
 slings of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx.
    If we think of the old descriptions of the closure of the laryngeal
entrance by the folding back of the epiglottis, we see at once that
there would be a mot awkward angle round which the bolus would
have to travel just as it entered the gullet. This angle would be
formed above by the tip of the epiglottis, and below by the posterior
margin of the laryngeal entrance, i.e., the tip of the arytenoid <U+FB02>ap.
 A similar angle would exist in the case of all animals the plane of
the entrance to whose larynx crossed the axis of movement of the
descending bolus, the angle being the more marked the more nearly
 at a right angle this plane crossed this axis, and it is partly to get rid
of this angle that the folding forwards of this arytenoid <U+FB02>ap takes
 place.     In  animals, on the other hand, where the plane and the axis
 are  parallel there is no angle and there is no folding forward of the
arytenoid—~merely an outwards and inwards movement, an Opening
 and shutting of the lozenge-shaped entrance, as in the case of the
 Tortoise, Lizard, Frog, Snake, &o. In addition to the above angle, there
 would be also an inconvenient open angle between the tongue and the
 epiglottis, in which food particles would be most likely to lodge, and

upon the resilience of the epiglottis, being engaged between it and
the tongue, they would give rise to irritation.   As a matter of fact,
it does sometimes happen that food gets between epiglottis and
tongue, but it would surely often happen if the doctrine of the lid-like
action of the epiglottis were true.
   By my account of the normal closure of the larynx many further
points in the anatomy of the larynx and many observations as to its
physiology now receive an explanation.       Some writers have come
near to the truth, and of all Luschka has come nearest, many passages
in his writing showing that he has just failed to grasp the whole
meaning of what he describes.
    17w External Thyro-arytenoid Muscle.—The direction of its <U+FB01>bres is
in the main from before, backwards and upwards; this is clearly the
direction most suited to the folding forwards of the arytenoid car
tilage.   Thus the origin of the muscle is in front, at the thyroid
cartilage as the more <U+FB01>xed end. The insertion of the muscle extends
in the vertical direction, well nigh throughout the entire length of
the arytenoid cartilage, so that its superior <U+FB01>bres have a great
mechanical advantage in inclining the cartilage forwards, while its
inferior <U+FB01>bres especially pull it forwards at its base.     Owing to its
insertion into the outer surface of the arytenoid cartilage, it tends
powerfully to rotate the cartilage so inwards that the internal faces
of the cartilages come into apposition.   Thus the muscle brings about
three of the movements of the arytenoid cartilages that close the
larynx, viz., rotation inwards, inclination forwards, and gliding
forwards at the crico-arytenoid joint. These movements have been
seen experimentally upon electrical stimulation in Manf"      The fourth
movement     is the apposition  of the  arytenoids by   the  arytenoideus
transversus.
   The muscle thus with the transverse arytenoid forms a sphincter
for the larynx.1'
   Having this function of the muscle in mind, one at once under
stands why it is such a large muscle, why it extends vertically so far
beyond the level of the true cords, and in short why as viewed in a
vertical transverse section of the larynx it seems to have so little
relation to the true cords: the fact is  is (with the transverse ary

 anterior margins of the arytenoid cartilages, and thus brings together
the sides of the vestibule, and then it inclines the arytenoids so as to
encroach on the space from above downwards, and from behind for
wards—the three muscles, that is, the two thyro-arytenoids and the
transverse     arytenoid, now grasp the vestibule, so to speak, obliterate
its  space,  and  thus close the larynx. With them act the ary-epiglottici
so as to close the very entrance.
   In   certain animals there is no elastic tissue in what Would corre
spond to the true cord (Bland Sutton, ‘Journal of Anatomy and
                  “ Nature of                       which thus is
Physiology,’                        Ligaments”),                       entirely  of
muscle    enclosed in mucous membrane.              This seems to indicate the
primary importance of the muscle as a muscle rather than as a
vibrating cord, a view also expressed by Bland Sutton upon purely
anatomical grounds.           May it not be simply that the elastic property
is secured for the vibrating tissue at a physiologically cheaper rate
through <U+FB01>brous than through muscular tissue ?
   Nothing is said here of the feeble thyro-arytwnoideus internus:
this, probably, is the proper muscle of the vocal cords, and in any
case, from its feeble development and its attachments, it cannot have
much in<U+FB02>uence in closing the larynx.
   This description of the mode of closure of the larynx meets the
case during both inspiration and expiration.                  In closure during
inspiration the closure is absolute and, after the muscles have once
brought the parts into position, is entirely mechanical.             This one can
easily verify by sucking          air  down   through    either  the  dead or the
living larynx. The margins of the aperture come together and
remain pressed together by atmospheric pressure.                     Against ex
piration the resistance is entirely          muscular,  for  the  margins of the
aperture open outwards, and air can always be blown upwards so as
to force open the closed larynx. The thyro-arytenoid and transverse
arytenoid appear to me to be quite adequately developed to resist
pressure to a high degree, because, in the <U+FB01>rst place, these muscles
are really not so small as one is accustomed to think they are; and,
in the second place, the surface which has to bear pressure in the
closed larynx is not extensive.
   In such larynges as the Lizard’s, the muscle simply rotates the
cartilage to close the lozenge-shaped aperture which corresponds to
the glottis of Man.
   The Arytenoid Muscle—This muscle must be divided into (1) the
two oblique portions, which are really continuations of the ary
epiglottic muscle, and are dealt with under that heading; and (2)
the transverse portion. The transverse portion alone is now under
consideration.        Owing to the articular surface of the arytenoid car
straighten themselves, and so bring the side walls of the entrance  together. This,
of course, is quite a different thing from my account.

tilage being on the under surface of the muscular process, which is pro
jected backwards from the cartilage, the surfaces of attachment of
the muscle lie in front of the joint, i.e., in front of the fulcrum, so that
the muscle powerfully rotates the cartilages inwards, draws them
together, apposes their internal surfaces, and pulls them powerfully
together.       Thus the muscle acts with the thyro-arytenoids as a
 sphincter of the larynx. The muscle likewise forms an elastic liga
 ment betWeen the two cartilages, <U+FB01>brous tissues being clearly unsuit
 able. White <U+FB01>brous tissues would imply <U+FB01>xity of interval, and elastic
 tissues would need in certain positions to be stretched by considerable
 muscular force, while in other positions they would be lax.        The muscle
 likewise forms part of the surface over which the bolus glides in
 deglutition, but at this time it is in contraction, and therefore <U+FB01>rm;
 and, lastly, it closes in the triangular space which must always remain
 in front of the lamina of the cricoid, even when the arytenoids are
 applied to one another by their inner faces.
      The A'ry-epiglottic Muscle, including the Oblique Portion of the
  A'rytenoid Muscle.-—Its function, apparently, is to make tense the ary
  epiglottic folds of mucous membrane, part of the immediate bound
  aries of the entrance.      Thus the entrance is bounded during degluti
  tion either by cartilage or by tense muscle, so that the bolus has no
  chance of entering.       The tension is manifest from the more marked
  backward curvature       of   the lateral edge of the epiglottis; thus the
  concavity of the epiglottis becomes more marked, forms, indeed, a
  deeper groove to receive the tips of the arytenoids during deglutition.
  On this account the transverse limb of the <U+FB01>ssure, or head of the
  T, is markedly concave backwards.
      That the muscle is prolonged over the back of the upper part of
  the cartilage of its own side to the base of the cartilage of the
   opposite side is necessary.       It thus tends to brace together the two
   cartilages,   whereas, if it  only went to the cartilage of its own side, it
   would tend to separate the cartilages, and thus to destroy the effec
   tiveness of the closure of the ori<U+FB01>ce.
       A subsidiary effect is to help the thyro-arytenoid in rotating
   inwards and pulling forwards the arytenoids; to this extent there

       The Lateral Grico-arytenoid Muscle.—-—Besides rotating the arytenoid
   cartilage, this muscle must also help in tilting the whole cartilage
    forwards by pulling the base forwards so that the posterior part of
    the articular surface comes to rest on the cricoid.       Both this muscle
    and the posterior crico-arytenoid being       inserted  at  the base of the
    cartilage, therefore very close to the axis of rotation, secure a com
    paratively large movement with but little actual shortening of the
    muscles.

 1892.]      On  the iMec/zanism     of the  Closure of the Larynx.         335
    In most Mammals the larynx is usually open, and is only shut
when some temporary occasion arises. In some Mammals, such as
the Porpoise and Dugong (Owen), Grampus, White Whale, Dolphin,
 &c., the larynx, on the other hand, appears to be usually shut, and
here the T-shaped <U+FB01>ssure which             I have described is quite evident.
 Is not the usual condition in these Mammals an indication of what is
most likely to be the temporary mode of closure in the others ?
    Birds are extremely instructive in this connexion.           Here the vocal
function is entirely removed from the larynx, so that the larynx has
for its sole of<U+FB01>ce the guarding of the entrance to the trachea.
 Inspection and experiment show the entrance to be closed by the
arytenoid cartilages, or bones, and the thyro-arytenoid muscles.
Since this is their function in Birds (and the same applies to Tortoises,
 Lizards, Reptiles, Frogs, &c.), is it not all the more likely to be at least
a function in Mammals P Bland Sutton (loo. cit.) in this connexion,
and upon other grounds, believes that “ the original function of the
vocal cord is to protect the air passages, speech being a superadded
function.”     Closure of the larynx is the one never failing of<U+FB01>ce of the
larynx, and the arytenoid cartilages and their muscles are the only
never failing structures; epiglottis, false cords, true cords, as such,
and ventricles may all be absent. Does not this indicate some
connexion ?
    The T-shaped <U+FB01>ssure seems to depend upon the presence of an
epiglottis; where that is present, it keeps the anterior end of the
<U+FB01>ssure wide, makes, in short, the transverse head of the                 Where
there is no epiglottis and nothing to take its place, the <U+FB01>ssure is purely
antero-posterior, so that at the vertical limb of the           T  is the more
primitive, and by making a succession of transverse sections of the
closed larynx, the head of the        T  gradually narrows with the narrow
ing   of the epiglottis, so   that at the level of the glottis the vertical, i.e.,
 antero-posterior, limb alone remains even in Man. It will be observed
that in cutting away the higher parts of the larynx, one has removed
that part which is peculiar to Man and other animals having larynges
-of a similar build.     Only the bases of the arytenoid cartilages and.
 the attached true cords remain.          This latter level thus corresponds
to the opening of, say the Frog or Tortoise, and the shape of the open~
 ing is practically the same, a lozenge.
    The heightening of the arytenoids in Man appears to give these two
advantages: 1st, it permits of the entrance to the air passages having
 the funnel shape which favours the entrance of air; 2nd, it with
 draws the vocal apparatus from the vicinity of the very entrance, so
that it is the better protected.
    Closure of the entrance to ,the larynx by “ tight closing up of the
 arytenoid cartilages and ary-epiglottic folds” was observed by the

by ulceration, but Luschka concludes from a consideration of other
cases that this was a mere accommodation gradually effected by the
muscles “ by prolonged practice acquiring the necessary strength to

mutually approximate the side walls                     vestibule.    In the
case    reported by myself with McCormick            already referred to,
the patient, immedialely         upon the cessation of feeding by the
stomach-tube, could swallow as well as he did later on, and to all
intents and purposes as well as he could before the operation, and in
him we were able to see by merely looking through the hole in the
side of the neck, that the laryngeal closure was accompanied by the
T-shaped <U+FB01>ssure.          Here, therefore. there was no “ prolonged
            ”
practice      ; there was no practice at all, and the same remark applies
to the cases already quoted as having been examined for me by Barrett.
The <U+FB01>ssure is also shown in Czermak’s classical work, but the forma
tion of the head of the      T  is misinterpreted; it is said to be by the
backward movement of the epiglottis, instead of by the forward
movement of the arytenoids.
   Short of complete closure, the arytenoid <U+FB02>ap comes forward so that
it is approximated to the front wall of the laryngeal cavity, therefore,
in Man, to the epiglottis, and if air be now expired, the characteristic
sound of straining is produced by the vibration of the margins of the
entrance to the air passages, not of the vocal cords merely.
   Lister (Holmes ‘ Surgery,’ Article on “ Anaesthetics ”) ascertained
laryngosmpically that true chloroform stertor is produced by vibration
“ of the posterior part of the arytwno-epiglottidean           folds, which
are carried forwards to touch the base of the epiglottis during the
stertorous breathing, and are placed in still further apposition with
it when the obstruction becomes complete.” Thus, Lister saw “an
antero-posterior co-aptation of the structures of the laryngeal aperture
at a somewhat deeper level; without any change in the position 01"
form of the epiglottis, towards which the folds of the mucous mem
brane above the apices of the arytenoid cartilages are carried forwards
till they are in contact with its base. This is seen in coughing and
also in laryngeal stertor.”        Nevertheless, the closure by the .epi»
glottis  is  the mode  of closure Lister adopted for deglutition.
   In certain lesions of the true cords, the gru<U+FB01> voice is, as Sir Joseph
Lister communicated to me orally, to be ascribed to a vibration of
the ary-epiglottic folds, a suggestion with which         I  entirely agree,
I believe also that in gargling, the larynx is almost closed, and the
air issues under pressure from the narrow <U+FB01>ssure I have described.
   In the Kangaroo apparently a great extent of the arytenoids is ex
posed to the friction of the passing bolus, and along the ridge of the
apposed arytenoids, where the friction takes place, the cartilage shows
through, and the mucosa is not movable.         In the human     larynx this

 1892.]     ()n  the ZlIecliam'sm   0f the Closure  of the Larynx.        337
arytenoid ridge contains the antero-posterior limb of the T-<U+FB01>ssure.
but it is much shorter and less prominent than in the Kangaroo.
    The elastic nature of the tips of the arytenoids and the Santorinian
cartilages admirably <U+FB01>ts them for gliding into position down the
front of the laryngeal cavity. In this respect also, the form of the
Santorinian cartilages, convex forwards in the closed aperture, helps,
and the cushion of the epiglottis, when present, corresponds to the
interval between them. In the open aperture, the tips of the corni
cula are directed inwards and backwards, but this merely brings them
parallel when the arytenoids are in the closed position.         The elastic
nature of all these cartilages enables them to <U+FB01>t each other perfectly
when brought into apposition, and to recover their shape when the
pressure is removed, and the pad of fat in front of the epiglottis helps
in this connexion. Even in the dead subject, these phenomena can be
observed more or less by simply pressing the arytenoids forwards—
                                                                    '
the closure is perfect without the epiglottis ever moving.
    In animals with the cornicula more highly developed than they
are in Man and the Goat, this account does not apply.            In the Dog,
for instance, they are long and pointed, and are pushed aside out of
the mesial plane when the larynx is closed.
    The superior or false vocal cords, as the arytenoids are rotated
inwards, of course, come into apposition with each other, since
posteriorly they are attached to the anterior margins of the arytenoids
and anteriorly they are attached together to the re-entrant angle of
the thyroid cartilage.        As the arytenoid cartilages move forwards,
the superior cords are shortened from before backwards, and possibly
this may account for the large amount of elastic tissue in their struc
 ture, and   it may possibly      be the office  of  the bundles   of striped
muscular <U+FB01>bres, which have been described as radiating into the false
cords from various muscles of the region, to perform a similar func
tion, that of taldng up the slack of the shortened false cord. As the
action of the thyro-arytenoid is continued, the soft substance of these
cords will tend to be squeezed both upwards into contact with the
advancing arytenoids, and downwards to encroach on the ventricle.
At the same time, the sacculi will be compressed from the sides by
 the thyro-arytenoids and from behind by the arytenoid cartilages.
This may be the reason why the sacculus is over only the anterior
part of the ventricle, for here it is out of the way of the advancing
arytenoid, and any secretion which might be squeezed out of it
would immediately pervade the whole length of the ventricle, now
narrowed by the encroachment of the false cords, and so would lubri
cate the whole length of the true cord, although the sacculus is over
the anterior part only.        The fact that we often swallow when the
 cords are dry, as in hoarseness after much speaking, supports this
 idea, for the saliva swallowed cannot possibly affect the cords; the

     As the vocal process of the arytenoid with its attached true vocal
cord sinks into the larynx, it moves nearly in a circle, of which the

however, the tension of the cord in the sunk position is greater than
before, so that the mere gliding of the arytenoid does not wholly
compensate: the tilting forward of the whole cartilage is relatively
great, so that the vocal process is carried relatively far backwards
and so the cord is put upon the stretch.
     When the larynx is open the narrow end of the ovoid rests on the
cricoid, but in the closed larynx it is the broad end of the ovoid. In
the open larynx, stability is not of moment; rather is mobility im
portant, for there is no pressure to be resisted and in swallowing it is
of importance to get the eartilages quickly into position, and, more
over, we saw that the arytenoids are in continual movement even in
tranquil respiration.       In the closed larynx, on the other hand,
stability   is of the utmost   moment, and then, not only is the broad end
of the ovoid on the cricoid, but possibly the little intra-articular
<U+FB01>bro-cartilage attached to the capsular ligament of the articulation,
 and projecting into the joint cavity from the posterior blunt circum
 ference of the arytenoid articular surface (Luschka), comes into play
 to increase the surface upon which the arytenoid rests: only along
 a line can there be contact of the cricoid'cylinder with the arytenoid
 plane, but the <U+FB01>bro-cartilage probably increases this surface of con
 tact so that the arytenoid rests on the cricoid in front, and on the
 intra-articular cartilage behind.       The <U+FB01>bro-cartilage <U+FB01>lling up the
 angle of the joint posteriorly would play also the part of a sort of
 patella protecting this extremely important joint from any mechanical
 violence from the passing bolus.                  -
      A further advantage of the gliding forwards of the arytenoid is
 that, while in the open larynx the muscular process projects somewhat
  behind the plane of the cricoid lamina, in the closed larynx it does
  not, so that there is no impediment to the descending bolus, and less
  chance of damage to the cartilage and joint.
      The long axis of the arytenoid articular surface is from behind in
  wards and forwards, and. this is the direction in which the base
  glides.
      The arytenoid                                  laterally also, for the
  I,                    cartilages of course glide

1892.]      On the Mechanism     of the Closure of  the Larynx.      339
cricoid articular surface is about half as long again as the arytenoid
is broad—in the open larynx the arytenoids rest on the outer end of
the cricoid surface, in the closed larynx on the inner end, so that
they now lie closely apposed. Thus the action of the three true
sphincter or constrictor muscles brings the arytenoids exactly into
the position described in the closed larynx; the thym-arytenoidei
rotate the arytenoid cartilages inwards and pull them forwards, the
arytenoideus tramversus pulls them together.       The narrowing of the
lamina of the cricoid as we ascend has an important in<U+FB02>uence in per
mitting the arytenoids to approach each other bodily, though a trian
gular space, the base of which corresponds to the width of the cricoid
lamina, must always remain <U+FB01>lled by the arytenoideus.
    The epithelium on the inner faces of the arytenoid cartilages is
strati<U+FB01>ed squamous (Davis, quoted by Klein), and this is accounted
for by the pressure between the two comparatively hard and resistant
arytenoids.    Covering the greater part of the side walls of the vesti
bule it is ciliated columnar, but there being no rubbing of surface
 upon surface, the mucosa being soft, and the surface being covered
by a thick layer of mucus, the cilia are not damaged by the compres
 sion of the vestibule in deglutition. The epithelium for a little way
 within the margin is strati<U+FB01>ed squamous;        here, however, one can
imagine that some friction takes place during the movements of the
 parts.
    The shape of the epiglottis <U+FB01>ts in with my account, of the act of
 deglutition: it lies on the posterior part of the dorsum of the tongue,
 but it would certainly not <U+FB01>t the top of the larynx did it fold over
it as in the current description, for there is no relation either in
 size or form, nor is there any pattern on its laryngeal surface as if
 it were often applied to the laryngeal aperture.         And, as Howes
                                                “
 writes (‘ Jl.  Anat. Physiol.,’ 1889, p. 271),    In   many Quadrupedal
 Mammals the parts are so arranged that the posterior border of the
 velum appears to overlie the epiglottis, abutting against the ventral
 laryngeal wall. In such a case, did the epiglottis merely function,
 during deglutition, as a lid, the effects of its displacement would be
 simply that of forcing it back upon the velum palati. 'A <U+FB02>apping
 action in deglutition, as ordinarily understood, could manifestly
 only be possible in forms in which the velum stops short of the
 epiglottis.”

   The paper is founded upon the study of three embryos of Apte'ryw
australis obtained since the author's former communication on this
subject was written.
   The youngest (stage E') is intermediate between E and F of the
former paper, the next (F') between F and G, the most advanced
(G') between G and H.
   In E' the characteristic form of the beak has already appeared.
   In F' the pollex is unusually large, giving the fore-limb the normal
characteristics of an embryo wing.
   Several important additions and corrections are made to the former
account of the skull, especially with regard to the pre-sphenoid
region, the basi-cranial fontanelles, and the relations between the
trabecular and para-chordal regions.
   The account of the shoulder-girdle is amended. In Apterya: owem'
the coracoid region is solid, and no pro-coracoid appears ever to be
formed: in A. austmlis a ligamentous pro-coracoid is present at a
comparatively early period (stage I!" and perhaps E').
   An intermedium is present in the carpus in all three specimens in
 addition to the elements previously described.
   The brain in stage G' is interesting, as being at what may be called
the critical stage; the cerebellum is fully developed, and the optic
 lobes have attained the maximum proportional size and are lateral
in position.    In all essential respects the brain of this embryo is
typically avian.

       Received January      6, 1892.
    The following method has been found useful for determining the
relative value in insulating quality of small samples of materials, the
insulation resistance of short pieces of cable, and other very high
resistances.
    The arrangement is also suitable for continuously indicating the
 position on any electrical circuit, worked at a high pressure, of the

  resultant fault or point of zero potential; and for measuring the in
  sulation of the circuit while the pressure is on.
      Cmmections.——-The method consists in connecting the quadrants of
  an ordinary quadrant electrometer to the terminals of a source of
  fairly high E.M.F., while the aluminium vane or needle is connected
  to earth.
     The resistance to be determined is connected to one side of this
  arrangement, and a variable resistance of the same order of magnitude
  to the other side, the free ends of each being connected to earth.
     The centre of the battery, or other source of E.M.F., is then earthed
  for a short time, bringing the needle to the zero reading, and, after
  the removal of this earth connection, the needle will travel to one
  side or the other, unless the resistance to the passage of electricity
  from each pole to earth is exactly equal, in which case the needle will
  remain permanently at zero.
     By observing the motion and varying the comparison resistance
  accordingly, this balance is soon arrived at, if within the range of
  variation provided.
     The arrangement is shown in the <U+FB01>gure, where B is the battery or
  other source of E.M.F., Q the quadrants, N the needle, X the un
. known resistance, and R the variable resistance.              The earth contacts
  are shown by E.
     Diagram of connections for electrostatic balance for very high resistances. The
                   opposite quadrants of electrometer are not shown.
      Principle.—The      method depends upon the well-known fact that
   every   source of electricity produces equal quantities of what are

342         Major Cardew.           On a  szerential Electrostatic            [J an. 21,
commonly called the two kinds of electricity in any time, however
extended, and at any instant at an equal rate.
    I  have recently drawn attention to this law as determining the
potentials from earth of the two sides of any system of electric supply
(vide my paper read on the 23rd April, 1891, at the Institution of
Electrical Engineers).
    If we   conceive, therefore, a perfectly insulated voltaic battery, the
potentials of the terminals of this source from earth would be deter
mined by momentarily connecting any one of the metal plates with
the earth.         Under such conditions, the smallest leakage from either
pole to earth through a resistance amounting to many millions of
megohms, if unbalanced by any leakage from the other pole, must
rapidly reduce the potential of the imperfectly insulated pole to
zero.
    The only limit, therefore, to the sensibility of the method is the
imperfection of the insulation of the measuring apparatus, and this
insulation, with proper precautions, can be easily maintained at a value
exceeding 1,000,000 megohms.
    Sources of E.M.F.—A very convenient source of E.M.F. for the
purpose is the arrangement of small zinc-copper couples in series,
moistened by dipping the whole into a pan containing acidulated
water, which is in use at the Physical Laboratory at Glasgow
University.
    Four hundred         such couples are usually arranged on an ebonite
support, and the sensibility with this number is ample.*
    A still better source, when alternating currents are available, is a
special form of transformer, the secondary coil being suspended in
air by a silk cord.
    The highest insulation can thus            be secured.      But when the resist
ance to be balanced possesses appreciable capacity, the use of an
alternating E.M.F. is unsuitable, on account of the masking of the
 e<U+FB01>ect of the leakage current proper by the capacity current.
     Comparison Resistances.—The           variable     resistance   is, most conveni
ently, some       material of uniform cross section, so that its resistance
varies as the length put in circuit.                  Reels of white silk, cotton,
thread, and string are very suitable, and with a few such simple
 materials, balances can be obtained through a great range of value,
 although no multiplying 0r dividing power is possible.                         Thus, a
 white embroidery silk has been found to have aresistance of approxi
 mately 250,000 megohms per inch; a green thread, partly silk and
 partly cotton, 10,000 megohms per inch in a dry atmosphere;
    * The mahogany     legs supplied with   this battery should be replaced by grooved
 ebonite legs, to improve insulation, and    it is also of advantage to insert under each
 leg a piece of sealing-wax. The couples       require to be taken out and cleaned occa
  sionally;  if allowed to get dirty, the E.M.F. becomes low.

1892.]      Method of measuring High Electrical Resistances.          343
an ordinary measuring tape, 1400 megohms per inch, &c., down to a
piece of wet tape, which gave 64,000 ohms per inch.
    These resistances are, to some extent, affected by the degree of
humidity of the air, but, when necessary, they can be rapidly standard
ised with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy by determining one of the lowest by the
usual method]; or, as a check, when time allows, a highly insulated
condenser can be shunted by a length of silk, and the loss of charge,.
in a given time, measured.                                                .
     Unsymmetrical Insulation of Apparatus—If, from any cause which
cannot be discovered or removed, the insulation resistance of the
apparatus is unsymmetrical, indicated by the needle taking up a false
 zero when connection is made between the battery and quadrants,
 symmetry can be always secured by connecting a length of silk, found
by trial, between the more highly insulated pole and earth.
    Limits of Accuracy—The accuracy attainable by this method
 depends on the sensibility of the electrometer and the potential
 difference  employed.
    With    an ordinary suspension, however, it has been found that
 with a battery giving about 350 volts the difference in reading be
 tween that with the centre of the battery earthed and that with the
 earth connection made at 1 volt from the centre amounted to 12 scale
 divisions.
     This sensibility should, therefore, be ample to secure an accuracy
 within 1 per cent., which, for resistances of several thousand
 megohms, is generally suf<U+FB01>cient.
     Leakage Indication—The same principle of balance may be usefully
 adapted as a leakage indicator for electric supply circuits worked at
 high pressure.
     For this purpose a special pattern of electrometer is requisite.
     The quadrants are connected, respectively, to the two mains con
  stituting a circuit, and the needle to earth. If the insulation of the
  entire circuit is good, the potential from earth of the two mains will
  probably be nearly equal, and the needle will remain at zero; any
  leakage taking place will disturb the balance to one side or the
  other.
     By temporarily switching a small leak <U+FB01>rst on    one side   and then
  on the other, and noting the e<U+FB01>ect, the absolute value of the insula
  tion may be approximately assessed.                                       .
      The arrangement is not applicable, however, to a concentric system
  of mains with alternating currents, or in any case where the capacities
   are large and seriously unequal.

V. “On the Electrolysis of Silver Nitrate in Vacuo.”                           By

      B.Sc. Received January 5, 1892.
   The following investigation was undertaken in order to clear up
some minor irregularities which occur when the intensity of an
electric current is measured by means of a silver voltameter.
   The electrolysis of silver nitrate yields with moderate precautions
such very consistent results that it seemed of interest to follow up
the small apparent deviations from Faraday’s laws which are found
to exist. One of these irregularities has been noticed by Lord Ray
leigh, who found that the deposit of silver from a hot solution was
about one part in two thousand heavier than the deposit from a cold
solution.    A second anomaly lies in a small but regular discrepancy
in the deposits when these are taken simultaneously in platinum
bowls of different sizes ; the difference, according to our experiments,
seems to depend on the current density at the anode.                But the chief
part  of  this paper will   deal  with  the   fact     discovered  by us, that the
deposits are slightly larger when the electrolysis is conducted in
'vacuo than when, as usual, the voltameters              are exposed to air at the
ordinary pressure.     This   difference   we  trace to the eifects of dissolved

oxygen, for when the electrolysis is carried out in an atmosphere of
oxygen the deposits are smaller than those obtained in air.
   The apparatus we employed to obtain a deposit in vacuo is illus
trated in <U+FB01>g. 1.       An inverted bell-jar, closed at the bottom by an
india-rubber stopper and at the top by a plate of glass, contains a
tight-<U+FB01>tting cylindrical cage of wire gauze, which serves as support
to the electrodes.      The platinum basin is placed on “two stout copper
wires, F, which are soldered to the cage.          Metallic contact between
the wires and the bowl is secured by the help of tinfoil, which is
wrapped round the wires and forms a cushion on which the bowl
rests.    One of the wires leading to the battery is soldered to the
cage.   The anode is suspended from a glass rod, C, <U+FB01>xed to the cage
near its upper end, the current being conveyed to the anode by an
insulated wire passing through a glass tube, B, which is also secured
to the cage.     Three pieces of glass tubing pass through the india»
rubber stopper; one serves to exhaust the vessel, while the wires
leading to the battery pass through the remaining two.
   The stopper is rendered air-tight by means of Faraday cement, and
some grease has to be used to prevent leakage between the glass
plate and bell-jar.      To prevent particles of this grease contaminating
the  solution,  a  tightly-<U+FB01>tting piece of cardboard, not shown in the
<U+FB01>gure, was placed above the cage.           In the latter part of the investi
gation two nearly identical bell-jars were used.
   The same current always passed through two or three voltameters
in succession, and the deposits obtained simultaneously were com
pared with each other. One of the platinum bowls, to be referred to
as the large bowl, has a diameter of 5 inches, while the smaller I
                                                                         bowl
had a diameter of     3%  inches.
   The silver anodes had a thickness of about 2 mm., and generally
larger anodes were used in the large bowl than in the small one.
With respect to the contact between the anodes and the platinum
wires conveying the current, it seems worth while to draw attention
to a precaution, which, if neglected, may cause serious trouble.          We
placed at <U+FB01>rst, for the sake of convenience, the anodes simply into
two loops of platinum wire.        These loops crossed at right angles as
in <U+FB01>g. 2.     The current under these circumstances is apt to pass
partly  from   the platinum wires, and dark red crystals (probably
                                    FIG. 2.

Ag,0,) then shoot out rapidly and form a bridge across the electro
lyte.
    We have not observed similar elfects when the silver plates were
perforated, and the platinum wires which passed under the silver
plate were everywhere in metallic contact with it. We used <U+FB01>lter
paper to cover the anodes, and followed generally Lord Rayleigh’s
instructions rega'rding the conduct of the experiment.         The platinum
basins were in some experiments <U+FB01>rst cleaned out with sand, but
often this was not done.           They were then washed with (1) con
centrated nitric acid, (2) strong caustic soda,              tap water, (4)
distilled water.       They were dried roughly with a clean silk hand
kerchief and heated over a Bunsen <U+FB02>ame.               After an hour’s cooling
they were weighed.          The deposits of silver were washed three or
four times with distilled water, and allowed to stand under water
for a night; they were then again washed several times and dried in
an air-bath at <U+FB01>rst at 100° C. ; the temperature was <U+FB01>nally raised to
160° for ten minutes.         After an hour’s cooling, the <U+FB01>nal weighings
were taken.
    In a large number of experiments        it almost certainly happens that
some anomalous       results  are obtained, either through insuf<U+FB01>cient wash
ing or through loss of small quantities of silver.         We give, without
exception,   the  result   of each experiment,   and think that on the whole
 they show a remarkable consistency in the indications of the silver
 voltameters.      The e<U+FB01>ects we investigate are the di<U+FB01>erences in the
 deposit  of  less  than one part in a thousand, and the possibility of
 investigating these differences is a proof that the electrolysis of
 silver nitrate can safely be trusted to that degree of accuracy.
    The only serious source of error against which we had to guard was
 the prevention of leakage in the leads between the two voltameters.
    That our results can in no way be attributed to such leakage is
 shown by the fact that the voltameters were used in the same position
 with the bell-jar exhausted or full of air.         When the jar was full of
 air, the difference    in  the deposit disappeared, except for the small
anomaly due to the different sizes of the basins.
    When the jar is exhausted, it might be thought that a <U+FB01>lm of
 moisture could condense outside the platinum bowl, owing to the
 cooling due to evaporation in an atmosphere saturated with vapour.
 If such a <U+FB01>lm were to a certain extent to short-circuit the bowl, a
 smaller deposit would be formed in vacuo; but our effect is an
 increase, not a diminution, of the deposit.         Our leads were all care
 fully insulated, and      as  the resistance of the voltameters was never
 more than 1 ohm, there is no di<U+FB01>iculty in avoiding leakage to the
 extent required.
     For the sake of clearness, we do not give our results in the order

 experiment represent the order in which they were made.            We begin
 by comparing together the deposits obtained in bowls of diiferent
 sizes, both being in air.
    With the exception of the last three observations, the results give
 a consistent difference of about two parts in ten thousand in favour of
 the larger bowl. With respect to the last three observations, we have
 to offer the following explanation :—In order to trace, if possible, the
 difference between the results obtained with large and small bowls,
 we used in these experiments two anodes of the same size, while in all
 other cases the anodes were approximately proportional to the size of
 the bowl.      Experiment 12 is anomalous; we cannot account for the
 difference of 3 milligrams in favour of the small bowl, and simply
 record the observation; but do not think that this one experiment
 can render the results of the others doubtful, especially when taken
in conjunction with Lord Rayleigh’s observations, presently to be re
ferred to. Experiments l3 and 14 seem to show that when anodes
of the same size are used the discrepancy between the bowls dis
appears.       This con<U+FB01>rms an impression we have gained that the
e<U+FB01>ect is possibly due to secondary products formed at the anode
when the current density there exceeds a certain value.              It seems
 certain that too great a current density at the anode is accompanied
by a smaller deposit, but our experiments are not suf<U+FB01>cient to decide
whether the systematic difference in the two bowls is to be ascribed
to the same cause.

1892.]      On the Electrolysis        of Silver Nitrate in Vacuo.                  349
   Lord Rayleigh in his. experiments on the silver voltameter used
two bowls of approximately the same size as ours, and the foregoing
comparison will show that the diiference in the deposits pointed out
by us also appears in his results.
   In Table     II
                we have entered in two separate columns the deposits
obtained by Lord Rayleigh simultaneously from silver nitrate solu
tions in large and small bowls respectively.
   The mean deposit in the large bowls is therefore greater by ap
proximately the same amount as in our experiments.        In three cases
only were the deposits   in the small bowls heavier; and in two out of
these three cases the bowl showing these larger deposits contained
a 30 per cent. solution, while the other at the same time was <U+FB01>lled
with a 15 per cent. solution. It seems possible, therefore, that when
the strength of the solution is increased to 30 per cent. the difference
due to the size of the bowls will disappear.     We have recalculated
Lord Rayleigh’s value for the equivalent of silver, taking the de
posits in the large and small bowls separately, using the weight of
silver deposited before heating to verge of redness; we <U+FB01>nd for the
equivalent of silver:

   The heating to redness seems to a<U+FB01>ect the deposits equally, and
reduces the weight, on the average, by about one part in ten
thousand, which accounts for the di<U+FB02>erence between the above mean
and the equivalent as given by Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick.
   In some of our later experiments we used three voltameters in
series, two of them being kept in an exhausted receiver.
   This arrangement allowed us to judge whether the diiference in
the results obtained with large and small bowls persisted in vacuo.
The results are not very concordant, but the average deposits are
heavier in the large bowl, and hence we do not believe that the in
<U+FB02>uence of current density can be ascribed to the presence of air in
the solution.
  In Experiment                        differed, in so far as the bowls
                      27 the manipulation
were cleared out with sand before use: a proceeding adopted in the
<U+FB01>rst experiments as far as the eleventh, but abandoned afterwards.
We cannot, of course, draw any conclusions from a single experiment,
but  it does not seem impossible that the complete removal of the
old surface by washing with sand renders the e<U+FB01>ect of current density
more prominent.     There       is,

1892.]       On   the Electrolysis of Silver Nitrate in Vacuo.          ,351
the later stages, and after a number of experiments there may be a
thin layer of silver, possibly an alloy of silver and platinum, which
resists the action of acid, and can only be scraped out with sand. It
is to be noted that Kohlrausch took his silver deposits on platinum
which had previously been covered with a layer of silver; while in
Lord Rayleigh’s experiments the silver deposits were removed from
the dish before a new experiment was made. The diiference may
account for the somewhat greater equivalent found by Kohlrausch;
but the concordance of the results shows that there can be no
systematic di<U+FB01>'erence amounting to more than a few parts in ten
thousand.
   We turn now to the main part of the investigation, which is the
comparison of the deposits obtained in air and vacuo.          The solution
used   in  the  different voltameters  was  always  taken  out  of the same
bottle. We had intended in this way to make sure that any diiference
in the deposits was not due to some chemical difference in the solu
tions. It did not occur to us at the time that the solution in one
voltameter being freed of air, we should gradually diminish the
 amount of air also in the other voltameter, for the solutions were
kept in stoppered bottles, which did not allow of a ready re-absorption
of oxygen.      It will be seen that the differences in the deposits, when
these   were   taken   in air and vacuo, were larger and more regular in
the <U+FB01>rst experiments than later on, and this may have been due to
the gradual elimination of oxygen out of the solution.
    Our <U+FB01>rst experiments were made with the large bowl placed in
vacuo, and the small one in air.      The results, to which a later one is
added for the sake of completeness, are embodied in Table IV. Ex
periment 17 was not a satisfactory one, as will be explained later on,
and is therefore included in square brackets.
   The large diiference between the result obtained in air and in vacuo
<U+FB01>rst drew our attention to a possible in<U+FB02>uence of the size of the bowl.
The experiments made to clear up this point have already been
described.     A few deposits were taken with the small bowl in vacuo
 and the large bowl in air; although the two effects counteract each
 other, the deposits in vacuo are larger than those in air, as is shown
by Table V.
   On the supposition that the e<U+FB02>'ect due to the size of the bowl is the
same in air as it is in vacuo, we may combine the results of Tables
IV and V, and thus <U+FB01>nd that the deposits of silver in vacuo are about
one part in a thousand larger than those in air.            The next two
exPeriments (Table VI) were a surprise.

   We traced the cause of the anomalous results shown in this table.
The anode of the small bowl had by repeated use been gradually
dissolved; the current density was consequently increased.         Under
these circumstances the current becomes unsteady, polarisation effects
make themselves apparent, and the deposits are no longer trust
worthy. The deposits taken when the current density is too great
have generally a yellow colour.     We are reminded of some old expe
riments in which by increasing the current density black deposits
were obtained on the kathode, which at one time were supposed to
be a hydride of silver.      Poggendor<U+FB01> is generally stated to have
proved that the black deposit is not a compound, but silver in a
<U+FB01>nely divided state. On referring to Peggendor<U+FB01>’s paper, his experi
ments do not seem convincing, and he has expressed himself with
more caution than those who quoted him afterwards.             He states,
however, that the     black deposit often suddenly changes into a light
one.     Some observations made by Mr. Hoskins Abrahall in the
Owens College Laboratory, as well as our own experiments, lead us
to believe that it is the current density at the anode more than that
at the kathode, which introduces the anomalous results.         When the
deposits   are thus untrustworthy,  the  current, as far as we are able to
judge, is always unsteady, so that no danger arises when the silver
voltameter is used for the calibration of instruments.
    At this stage of the inquiry we introduced a second bell-jar and a
second voltameter of approximately the same size as the small one
previously used. The balance was also changed, and the weighings
were taken on a. new short-beam balance. This balance was unsteady
in its indications after <U+FB01>rst setting up, and a sudden change of zero
while one of the basins was being weighed renders the result of Experi
ment 17 doubtful.        The numbers obtained in this experiment are
therefore included in square brackets in our tables.      Table VII  gives
the comparison of the deposits in air and in vacuo taken in basins of
 nearly the same size. A glance at the numbers can leave no doubt
 as to the   reality of the increase in the deposit under reduced pres
 sure, although the amount of the increase is a little uncertain. There
is only one case (Experiment 23) in which the deposits are prac
tically identical, and in that case it was noticed that the deposit in
vacuo was yellow—an indication that the current density was probably
just a little too large. The average difference between the deposits
 is about one part in two or three thousand.

    In  the last three experiments, which gave comparatively large
 differences, the solutions used were kept separate between the expe
 riments, and this leads us to think that we had previously committed
 an error in mixing our solutions, which, as has already been stated,
 must gradually have become free of air.                  Experiment 29 shows, how
ever, too great a diiference; some of the silver in the bowl kept in air
                                                                             '
may have been lost in the washing.
    It seems remarkable that the electro-chemical                equivalent of silver
as   deduced  from      the  electrolysis   in   vacuo  is almost   identical with that
obtained in Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick’s deposits from hot
solutions.
    One point as        yet remains to be discussed.             It was reasonable to
assume that the        increased deposit in vacuo was due to the removal of
the oxygen out          of the solution.          In order to obtain more de<U+FB01>nite
information, we       took some deposits in an atmosphere of oxygen.                      In
the <U+FB01>rst experiment the two bell-jars were exhausted, and one of
them <U+FB01>lled with oxygen, which was allowed to stand for three hours
over the solution before electrolysis.
   The result was        as  follows :—
           Deposit in air            (small bowl)        ........      l '8618

                ,,             ,,    (large bowl)_       ........      l '8624
    There is here no difference except that due to the size of the bowl.
As it seemed doubtful whether the oxygen had in the course of three
hours been absorbed to its full extent by the solution,                '
                                                                               three more
experiments    were      made     and  conducted     as  follows—
   One small basin was kept in air as before; the other was kept
in vacuo, while the large basin was <U+FB01>lled with a solution which after
boiling had a stream of oxygen passed through until it was con
sidered that the liquid was saturated with the gas.                         The solution
thus prepared was kept in an atmosphere of oxygen. The com
parison between the deposits in air and vacuo have already been
given (Experiments 29, 30, 31, Table VII).
    The weight of the deposits in air and in oxygen was as follows :—

 1892.]      On the Electrolysis     of Silver Nitrate in Vacuo.           357
    In looking at the <U+FB01>gures it must be remembered that the large
 bowl would, if placed in air, have given a larger deposit than the
 small one, so that the difference between oxygen and air is really
greater than would appear from the numbers.                 There seems little
 doubt, therefore, that it is the removal of oxygen which is the cause
 of the increased deposits in vacuo.
    We have made a number of experiments on the polarisation of the
 electrodes in our silver voltameters.        It does not follow that because
there is as much silver dissolved as deposited, there is necessarily
complete absence of what is commonly called polarisation.               In the
<U+FB01>rst place, the silver is dissolved from a compact sheet which is in
a molecular condition different to the crystalline form in which it is
deposited.     Secondly, the silver is dissolved into a more concentrated
 solution than that out of which it is deposited, and, as Warburg has
pointed out, it is very dif<U+FB01>cult to distinguish polarisation effects from
 electromotive forces due to di<U+FB01>'erences of concentration.         Our experi
ments have shown          a  small but very consistent polarisation of
0007 volt, which was the same in vacuo and in air.
   If, after the polarising current has passed, the anode is taken out,
and replaced after the liquid has been thoroughly stirred, the polari~
sation is reduced, but still exists to the extent of about one-third the
original value. The electromotive force of polarisation does not seem
to be different when the platinum basin is partially or completely
covered with silver; but the greater the amount of silver the more
slowly does the polarisation die out. We cannot draw any very
de<U+FB01>nite conclusions from these observations, but it seemed worth
while to put them on record.
   We do not wish to enter into a full discussion of the explanation of
our results, but only draw attention to two phenomena investigated
by Helmholtz and Warburg respectively.                It was shown by Helm
holtz  that the  small   current   which    passes through water under the
action of electromotive forces insu<U+FB01>icient to decompose it is due to
the presence of dissolved oxygen.         If part of the current in a solution
of silver nitrate is conveyed by hydrogen atoms, no hydrogen could
separate out as gas, but a recombination with the dissolved oxygen
could take place. A small'fraction of the current might be conveyed
precisely in the way describedeby Helmholtz. In a subsequent paper,*
Helmholtz draws from thermodynamic principles the conclusion that
“in very dilute solutions or in acids containing no salts at all, metals,
which we otherwise consider unoxidisable in the acid, may dissolve
to a small extent with evolution of hydrogen.”
   Warburg<U+FB02>' in an important paper, shows that voltaic cells may be
formed by two pieces of the same metal, dipped into the same solu-

 tion, if the solution surrounding one of the electrodes contains oxygen
 in solution.    He establishes, further, the fact that in such cases the
 metal actually enters into solution, and explains thereby a variety of
 phenomena.       From his observations there seems little doubt that even
 in a solution of silver nitrate silver may dissolve to a slight extent.
 The amount so dissolved is possibly increased when the silver is in
 the nascent state, and may then become measurable<U+FB01>“
    We draw the general conclusion from our experiments that the
 true electrochemical equivalent of silver is probably not quite one
 part in a thousand greater than the value given by Lord Rayleigh,
 but that, if the experiments are conducted in air and under circum
 stances similar to those under which Lord Rayleigh’s measurements
 were made, the anomalies described by us do not interfere with the
use of the silver voltameter as a current measurer.               On the contrary,
the fact that we were able to show the existence of systematic
differences amounting to not more than two parts in ten thousand is
 a proof of its trustworthiness.

 I. “On the Melting Points of the Gold-Aluminium Series of
         Alloys.” By W. O. ROBERTS-AUSTEN, C.B., F.R.S. Re
         ceived January 25, 1892.
     The author has already described and exhibited to the Society a
 new alloy of gold and aluminium, AuAh, which is remarkable for its
 intense purple colour.
     The physical constants of the gold-aluminium alloys are being
 determined and the results will soon be ready for publication, but the
 series has been       found to have one interesting peculiarity which
 deserves special mention.       The author has shown (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
 vol. 49, 1891, p. 347) that the addition of 0'2 per cent. of aluminium to
 gold produces an appreciable fall in the freezing point, an addition of
 0'4 per cent. causing a fall of 14'28°, or an
                                                 “ atomic fall ” of 50° C.
    These facts indicated that it was desirable to ascertain what are
the melting points of the gold-aluminium series of alloys generally,
and this has now been done with the aid of the Le Chatelier thermo
couple used in the way which was previously described (loo.
    Ilihe results show that, although a white alloy, containing 10 per
cent. of aluminium, has a melting point which is no less than 417°
lower than that of gold; the purple alloy, on the other hand, melts
                                                                2 o 2

at a point which has yet to be de<U+FB01>nitely <U+FB01>xed, but which is several
degrees above gold.“ In fact, when workmen who are accustomed to
melt gold on a large scale, attempt to melt this purple substance, they
<U+FB01>nd it dif<U+FB01>cult to believe that they are dealing with a gold alloy, as
it is so infusible.
    The melting points of the rest of the series richer in aluminium
appear to fall continuously to 660°, a little below the melting point of
aluminium (665° C.).
    The purple alloy presents the only case, known to the author, of an
alloy, free from mercury, having a higher melting point than that of
the least fusible of its constituents, and he considers that this fact
a<U+FB01>‘ords strong evidence of its being a true compound of gold and
aluminium.
    It is generally admitted that there are true compounds in the
copper-tin series, for SnCua and SnCu, seem to be well de<U+FB01>ned, but
their melting points are much lower than that of copper.
    A. P. Laurie has just shown (‘ Phil. Mag.,’ January, 1892) that in
the gold-tin series, the alloy containing 63 per cent. of gold and
37 per cent. of tin has an electromotive force which distinguishes it
from the rest of the series and points conclusively to its being a true
compound, but the author <U+FB01>nds that it melts readily below redness.
    The melting points of ordinary chemical compounds are often
much higher than the melting point of the least fusible constituent.
Galena, for instance, melts at a strong red heat; it is di<U+FB02>icult to <U+FB01>x
the point accurately as the substance volatilizes, but it is close to
900°C. Its constituents, lead and sulphur, melt at 335° and 115°
respectively.       Stibm'te also, sulphide of antimony, melts at about
530°, according to Dr. Joly, while antimony fuses at 440°.
    The gold-aluminium series is of unusual interest, and well deserves
careful attention.
    *
       [Two very careful experiments were made, each with 40 grammes of the
alloy, the cooling curve being traced by the autographic recorder already
 described (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ loc. cit). These curves gave 1065° and 1070° respec
 tively as the melting point of the alloy AuAlQ, the mean of which is 325° higher
 than the melting point of gold. If, however, small quantities of the alloy be fused
 before the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, it is easy to obtain a lower result, as aluminium
 is readily burnt out from the little mass. The composition of the alloy is thereby
  changed to one of the series richer in gold, of which the melting points are lower
  than that of gold.—Feb. 9, 1892.]

     FESTING, R.E., F.R.S.       Received December 14, 1891.
                                (Abstract)
   The authors refer to their paper on Colour-Photometry (Bakerian
Lecture, 1886), in which a method was given of forming a curve of
luminosity of the spectrum, the source of light being the crater of the
positive pole of an electric arc lamp.
   They point out that in making the observations for forming this
curve no attention was paid to the part of the retina of the eye which
                                                     ” and
was used, and which embraced the “yellow spot                some of the
surrounding portion.
   In their further researches this point came to be of importance,
and they describe how, by modi<U+FB01>cations of the apparatus and of the
methods of observing, they were able to use either the yellow spot or
portions outside      it,
                       and they give the results of the observations,
showing how the curves become modi<U+FB01>ed in each case.
   The absorption by the yellow spot takes place in all rays more
refrangible than     Ebut to the less refrangible rays the outer part of
                      ;
the retina is less sensitive than the central part.
   The Limit    ofColour Vision—1t      well known that when light of
                                         is
any colour becomes enfeebled to    a certain degree, the eye fails to see
colour, though   itmay still recognise the existence of light.  Observa
tions were made to determine the point at which, for each part of the
spectrum, the sensation of colour         lost. The same apparatus as
                                         is
                                                      “ reference ” beam
before was used for forming the spectrum and the
of white light, and a supplementary apparatus was devised for reduc
ing the beam of light and for measuring the amount of reduction.
Each coloured beam was reduced until, in comparison with a feeble
white beam,     itappeared colourless.     The amount of reduction in
each case being measured, a curve was plotted showing the propor
tional reduction in part of the spectrum.      The absolute intensity of
the beam from D having been measured by comparison with an amyl
 acetate lamp, that of each other part of the spectrum was calculated
by aid of the luminosity curve above referred to. It then became
possible to plot a curve which shows the intensity of the original
source at which, in each part of the spectrum, colour <U+FB01>rst becomes
visible.
  The portion of the spectrum in which colour           visible from the
                                                        is
feeblest source  isbetween   about  X500  and  h615.   This  accounts for
the fact that in a feeble light, such as that of the moon, objects appear
to be of a greenish hue, and also that moonlight passing through
coloured windows does not give a coloured image in most cases.

     Extinction of  the Light of diferent Parts of the Spectrum.—A full
  description   is given of the apparatus used and of the method of
  observation for determining how much the light of each part of the
  spectrum must be reduced in order that it may be extinguished.
  Observations were made (1) with the central part of the eye only
  and (2) with the whole eye.
     From these observations curves were plotted, showing the propor
  tion of the beam from each part of the spectrum which was just not
  visible.   These are called extinction curves. They differ only in that
  part  of the  spectrum where the yellow spot absorption takes place.
 The minimum ordinate is at about 7t 5300, and represents 65/107, that
 being the proportion to which the beam had been reduced at extinc
 tion, the intensity of the unreduced beam from D in the same
 spectrum being that of an amyl acetate lamp at 6 feet. The intensity
 of other beams of the spectrum was calculated from this by the aid
 of the luminosity curve as before. A curve was then derived from
 each of the extinction curves by taking as ordinates the product of
 such ordinate of an extinction curve and the luminosity of the corre
 sponding beam; these derived curves then represent (on the supposition
 that all the beams were originally of the same luminosity as D), the
 proportion, and therefore the absolute intensity, of any beam which
 would be just not visible.     These two curves di<U+FB01>er slightly at the
 part affected by the yellow spot, but that for the whole eye is hori
zontal from the extreme violet end to about 1» 4800; it then rises rapidly
 to h6840, and again becomes horizontal.       This seems to con<U+FB01>rm the
view that a single sensation only is excited by each of the ends of the
spectrum.
    The reciprocals of the ordinates of either of' the <U+FB01>rst two extinc
tion curves being taken, what is called a “persistency” curve is
formed.      The curve for the whole eye and that for the central
portion are given. It is reasonable to expect that the “ persistency ”
curve should have relation to some colour sensation of the eye, which
may perhaps be looked upon as the dominant sensation, as it is ex
cited by the smallest quantities of light.
    An examination with the results of observations made by colour
blind people is then entered on.
    A gentleman, M., made a series of observations. He has two colour
sensations only, which he calls “red” and “black.”             Yellow he
describes as “white,” green as “bright black,” blue as “darker
black.”     His luminosity curve has been plotted on such a scale that
the red portion corresponds with that of the normal curve.       The rest,
however, falls below this, and it leaves off a little beyond F. The
curve formed by the di<U+FB01>erences of his and the normal ordinates may
be considered to be M.’s de<U+FB01>ciency curve.
    Two brothers, P. and Q., were also examined. They have the same

 vision, which is monochromatic.       Their luminosity curve, M.’s de<U+FB01>
 ciency curve, and the normal persistency curve correspond very
 nearly except in the part affected by the yellow spot. It therefore
 appears as if P. and Q. had only the sensation which is looked upon as
 the dominant sensation in the normal eye, and of which M.’s eye is
 devoid, and that P.’s and M.’s eyes together would make up a normal
 eye.
    The results are also given of the examination of the vision of a red
blind (H. R.) and of a green-blind person (V.              Their “ persis
tency” curves, as well as that of P., nearly correspond generally
with each other and with that of normal vision.           The “absolute
intensity” extinction curves of H. R. and V. H. also do not differ
notably from the normal; but in P.’s case the ordinates are larger,
from which it may be inferred that his sense of vision is less acute.
   Assuming blue, green, and red to be the three primary sensations,
P.’s and Q.’s luminosity curve or M.’s de<U+FB01>ciency curve would represent
the <U+FB01>rst, and V. H.’s de<U+FB01>ciency curve the second, but H. R.’s de<U+FB01>
ciency curve would not quite represent the third, as he is not entirely
devoid of appreciation of red.
   Luminosity Curve of Spectrum of Low Intensity—The normal per
sistency curve being apparently the same as the luminosity curve
of persons with but one colour sensation, experiments were made
to determine what would be the luminosity to the normal eye
of the di<U+FB01>erent parts of a spectrum of a very low intensity.            A
spectrum was formed of which the beam from D was equal in inten
sity to 1/132'5 of an amyl acetate lamp at 1 foot. The luminosity
curve of this was found to correspond very nearly to that of P., and
to the normal persistency curve.         By reducing the light in less
degrees, luminosity   curves  were  produced corresponding to those of
persons more or less red-blind.
   Experiments were then made to ascertain whether this change in
the relative luminosities of the different rays would continue to vary
with constantly increasing intensity of the light, or whether a point
would be reached after which the curve, when it had the same
maximum ordinate, would be constant.
   A beam being taken from one point in the spectrum, it was com
pared with the reference (White) beam.           Rotating sectors were
placed in both beams,     and  equality  of luminosity thereby produced.
The aperture of one set of sectors being varied, the alteration of the
other which was necessary to re-establish the equality of illumination
in each case was noted. Curves were then plotted for several rays,
of which the ordinates represent the apertures in the coloured beams
and the abscissae those in the white beam when the illumination is
equal.    Clearly, if these curves ever became straight lines for all
parts of the spectrum, the luminosity curve would become constant.

    This was found to be the case. The curve of the beam from scale
No. 463 of the spectrum (about X5613) was found to be straight
from the origin. Those of beams of greater refrangibility were at
<U+FB01>rst concave to the axis of abscissee, those of less refrangibility
convex; but all had become straight before an intensity of 1/60 of an
amyl acetate lamp at 1 foot had been reached.

    The triangular method of graphical representation suggested by Sir

mixture in given variable proportions of the other two constituents,
A, B; the variation being such that any given point on the curve
is related to some other point (“conjugate point ”) in a way given
by the consideration that all mixtures of the three constituents,

alloy, or mixture, not separating spontaneously into two di<U+FB01>erent
 <U+FB02>uids but existing as a stable homogeneous whole.
    The experiments described in Part IV unmistakably point to the
conclusion that whenever sn<U+FB01>ieiently intimate and prolonged intermis
tnre of the three constituents can be ejected, there is no variation what
ever in the position of the point experimentally determined             as
conjugate to some other given point on the curve, no matter what
may be the proportions subsisting between the three constituents
 employed; but that when metals are used, the practical dif<U+FB01>culty in
eifecting thorough intermixture by stirring when molten is occasion
ally so great as to lead to slight, but sensible, diiferences in the
 composition of the ternary alloys formed simultaneously with some
 one given alloy approximately    conjugate thereto, in diiferent cases
 where the relative pr0portions of the constituents are materially
 different.
    A  large number of additional experiments on this point have been
 made, the general result of which is completely to corroborate and

   1892.]                 On certain Ternary Alloys.                     373
  con<U+FB01>rm these conclusions;     when the proportions     of the constituents
  are such   that approximately equal quantities of the two di<U+FB01>erent
  ternary alloys are formed, the error due to incomplete intermixture
  is generally a minimum ;. this obviously happens when the con
  stituents are used in such proportions as to represent an “ideal”
  alloy corresponding approximately with the central point of the tie
  line uniting the two conjugate points.       When, however, the propor
  tions of the constituents differ materially from these, representing an
  “ideal” alloy considerably nearer to one conjugate point than to the
  other, so that one of the two ternary alloys is formed in much larger
  quantity than the other, the eifect of incomplete intermixture becomes
  more marked,     more especially    when the heavier of the two alloys
 largely preponderates.
     In  cases  where the critical curve is approximately symmetrical
  with respect to the central line of the triangle drawn from its apex
                                                               ”
  perpendicular to the base, so that the “limiting point lies near to
 the apex, the minimum error due to incomplete intermixture is
 accordingly observed when the two immiscible metals, A, B, are used
 in approximately equal quantities throughout.        If, on the other hand,
 the critical curve is unsymmetrical, in order to minimise the error
 due to imperfect intermixture (more especially as regards those parts
 of the curve where the proportion of the “ solvent,” 0, is greatest),
 the other two metals, A, B must not be used in equal quantity, but
 the one or the other must be in excess according as the “limiting
 point” lies on the right or the left-hand side of the central line.
 Thus, as shown below, in the case of mixtures of chloroform, acetic
 acid, and water, the limiting point lies considerably to the left
  (chloroform side) of the central line; similarly with mixtures of lead,
 silver, and zinc, the limiting point is also considerably to the left
 (lead side) of the central line.     In such cases the heavier of the two
 immiscible    constituents, A, B  (chloroform, lead) must be made to pre
 dominate considerably over the lighter one, (water, zinc), in order that
 approximately equal quantities of the two ternary mixtures may be
-formed.     On the other hand, with mixtures of lead (or bismuth), tin,
 and zinc, the limiting point lies sensibly to the right of the central line
 (zinc side) ; so that to determine as accurately as possible the positions
 of the conjugate points situated towards the limiting point, zinc must
 be made to predominate over lead (or bismuth) in the mixtures
 employed.
     The effect of this in practice is that in order to trace out the
 critical curve for a given trio of metals the most expeditious way is to
 begin by preparing two or three mixtures with small quantities of
 solvent C and approximately equal quantities of A and B; from the
 results obtained with these mixtures, represented graphically on
  Stokes’ triangular system, a fair idea can generally be formed as to

374                       Dr. C. R. Alder Wright.              [J an. 28,
what must     be the proportion between A and B, in order to yield with
                                               ”
a somewhat     larger quantity of C an “ideal alloy that will separate
into approximately equal quantities of the two ternary alloys formed
therefrom.      Similarly, from these further results, the proportions
requisite for the accurate determination of other pairs of conjugate
points higher up still can be inferred; and so on.       In this way the
critical curve is gradually traced out with a much smaller proportion
of wasted labour (owing to imperfect formation of truly conjugate
ternary alloys) than would otherwise be the case. This method of
procedure has accordingly been adopted in the investigation of
various critical curves of the kind which will be discussed in a future
paper.
    These considerations obviously suggest the possibility that, in
certain cases at any rate, the mean curve values deduced in the
earlier parts of this research may require some little degree of
revision, inasmuch as some of the pairs of alloys simultaneously
formed     were derived from mixtures yielding one alloy in much
larger quantity than the other; so that some small amount of experi
mental error, due to imperfect formation of truly conjugate alloys,
might exist. Accordingly, a considerable number of the experiments
that might possibly be faulty from this cause have been repeated,
using proportions of A and B better suited to the end in View, viz.,
formation of the two ternary alloys produced in not widely different
quantities relatively to one another.    Further, a variety of additional
experiments have been made with the object of deducing the situa
tions of pairs of conjugate points lying nearer to the limiting points
 than those previously determined.     These further experiments, how
ever, have demonstrated the existence of two other sources of error,
not noticeable to so great an extent at the other parts of the critical
curve.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, when an “ideal” alloy is used corresponding
 with a pair of conjugate points lying near to the limiting point, the
two alloys formed di<U+FB02>'er far less widely in composition than is the
case   with other pairs more removed from the limiting point; conse
quently, the densities of the two alloys do not greatly differ, which
circumstance appears greatly to impede their complete separation
from one another by gravitation whilst standing at rest molten.
 Secondly, such “ideal” alloys appear to be extremely sensitive to
 slight differences of temperature, at least as compared with mixtures
not so near the limiting point; so that whilst a difference of 10°, 20°,
or even 50° C. makes but little diiference in the compositions of the
two ternary alloys formed from a given “ideal” alloy not near the

 limiting point, it produces a marked effect on an “ ideal alloy near
 to that point; in some case, indeed, a rise of a few degrees in
 temperature will suf<U+FB01>ce to transform an “ideal” alloy separating into

  two  ternary alloys considerably di<U+FB01>erent from one another into a
  “real " alloy not separating at all, but remaining perfectly homo
  geneous at this slightly higher temperature.              Leaving out of sight
  the practical impossibility of maintaining a lead-bath at 600°—800° C.
 at an absolutely constant temperature (within, say, i10°) for eight
 or ten hours together, the lowering of the temperature taking place
 on removing the clay test-tube from the lead-bath sometimes appears
 to cause a measurable amount of separation of a diEerent heavier alloy
 from the lighter one formed in the bath, and vice versd, during the
 short time that elapses before the compound mass becomes solid.                    So
 that, in <U+FB01>ne, duplicate experiments with “ideal” mixtures situated
 near to the limiting point are apt to yield discordant results owing
 to one or other of these causes, or to the two combined;                     and in
 consequence     the  direct    determination    of  the  exact     position of the
 limiting point is impracticable, although of course its situation can
  be approximately deduced from the graphical representation of the
 results on the triangular system. Still nearer approximations can be
 obtained by the use of other methods kindly suggested by Sir G. G.
 Stokes, and more      fully described below.
     The present paper deals with the results of the further experiments
 made,    as above stated, with the mixtures partly described in the
 previous four Parts* (lead-tin-zinc, bismuth-tin-zinc, lead-silver-zinc,
 bismuth-silver-zinc, chloroform-acetic acid-water), for the purpose of
 more completely determining the exact positions of the critical curves
for certain de<U+FB01>nite temperatures, and the systems of tie-lines and their
limiting points pertaining to each curve respectively.                   In a subse
quent paper the analogous curves will be described, derived from the
combinations of lead or bismuth with zinc as A, B, and cadmium or
antimony as C, and with various analogous ternary mixtures where
aluminium takes the place of zinc.
              Mixtures of Chloroform, Water, and Acetic Acid.
     The experiments described in Part IV were continued, using
mixtures containing more chloroform than water (from 2 to 3 parts
chloroform to 1 of water), and nearly, but not quite, enough acetic
acid to form a homogeneous <U+FB02>uid, the composition required being
arrived at by adding enough acetic acid to form a single <U+FB02>uid, and
then dropping in a little water or chloroform, or both, until separa
tion ensued. With mixtures represented by points lying close to the
limiting point, it was found that comparatively slight variations in
temperature produced marked alterations in the composition of the
two <U+FB02>uids into which the mixture separated, more especially as

  But whether this is merely an accidental coincidence, or is really- due
  to a tendency to form a de<U+FB01>nite hydrate of chloroform in presence of
  acetic acid, cannot be decided by these experiments alone.                     The
  results with alloys subsequently described rather suggest that it is
  only a coincidence.
                          Alloys of Lead, Tin, and Zinc.
    In Parts    I  and II seven different series of observations are recorded,
 made with mixtures of lead, tin, and zinc, at temperatures varying
 from about 565° 0. up to near 800°, and containing lead and zinc in
 ratios varying from 2:1 to 1:2.             On plotting these diiferent series
 on the triangular system, it is evident that the critical curves deduced
 from those experiments where the temperature did not exceed
 689—750° are substantially identical, whereas that derived from
 experiments at a higher temperature, 7 50—850° averaging near 800°,
 lies perceptihly inside the others.             Again, but little discordance
 between the general directions and degrees of slope of the tie-lines
 is noticed in any of the series at temperatures not above 750° where
 the ratio of lead to zinc Was 1 : l or 1 :2; with the series where this
 ratio was 2 : 1, however, the upper ties do not closely coincide
 with those derived from the other series, but (as pointed out
by Sir G. G. Stokes, Part IV) are inclined to them at angles not
far from 5°, thus indicating the existence of some cause constantly at
work interfering with separation into truly conjugate alloys ; obviously
this cause is the large preponderance of heavier alloy formed over
lighter alloy, which, as above stated, produces a marked e<U+FB01>‘ect on the
result by preventing thorough intermixture by stirring.
    On plotting out in these seven cases the values of {A—A'— (B—B’)}2
as abscissaa, and of     A+A'   and B+B' as ordinates (Stokes’ 2nd method,
supra), similar differences are observed.              All the experiments at
565—750° concord fairly well when the series where the ratio of
lead to zinc was 1 :1 or 1 :2 are taken into account; whereas the
series where the ratio was 2:1 exhibit a much wider departure.
The experiments at 750—850°, and the concordant ones at 565—750°

The critical curve for the higher temperature consequently lies inside
that for the lower temperature, since it contains a limiting point
corresponding with a smaller tin percentage.
  In order to de<U+FB01>ne the upper portion of the critical curve still more
exactly, and thus to deduce a closer approximation        to the true
limiting point,  a number of additional experiments were made at a
temperature  close to 650°, with mixtures containing 31 to 34 per cent.

with the entire Series VI where excess of lead was used, on account
of showing less general concordance with the average than the others,
obviously on account of incomplete intermixture and consequent
formation of alloys not so truly conjugate as in the other cases.     In
all 88 compound ingots, and consequently 176 ternary alloys, were
used in the deduction of the 14 pairs of conjugate points thus
tabulated, so that each point represents the average of somewhat
more than six alloy analyses.
   Fig. 4 represents these values plotted on the triangular system.
   On comparing the <U+FB01>gures in the last column with the corresponding
ones obtained in the previous experiments (Part I), it is noticeable
that the tin distribution is such that the excess of tin percentage in
the lighter alloy over that in the heavier one now ShOWS two maxima,
the second of which was not indicated by the former less complete
series. The <U+FB01>rst is a + maximum, arrived at near the 5th tie-line;
the second a — maximum, situated near to the 13th.       Obviously the
existence of a maximum (+ or —) is a necessary result of a slope

   the limiting point, so that for each of these limiting ties the per
   centage of solvent metal is the same in both heavier and lighter
  alloy formed ; but it is noticeable that only in one other case out of a
   dozen ternary alloys now under examination is a second maximum
   noticeable, i.e., only in this one other case (lead-aluminium-tin alloys)
  are the upper and lower ties found to slope in opposite directions; in
  all other instances, whether the ties slope to the right or to the left,
  the direction of the slope is the same throughout the whole extent of
  the critical curve.
      It is further noticeable that both with lead-zinc-tin and lead
  aluminium-tin alloys the position of the <U+FB01>rst maximum is such that
  it occurs when the ratio of lead to tin in the heavier alloy is sensibly
  near to that indicated by the formula SnPba.        Thus in the ease of the
  lead-zinc-tin alloys above described—

  The parallel results obtained with lead-aluminium-tin alloys will be
  described in a future.paper; it may be noticed, however, that with
  neither series of alloys is any marked elevation or depression in the
 outline of the critical curve noticeable at the part corresponding with
 the compound SnPba, unlike the curve obtained with lead-zinc-silver
 and bismuth-sinc-silver alloys, where the formation of the de<U+FB01>nite
 compounds Aan, and Ag‘an, leads to marked alterations of outline
 (vide infra).
     It was found      impracticable to obtain any accurate valuations of
 tie-lines situated nearer to the limiting point than No. 14; several
 attempts were made, but the results exhibited too great an amount
 of discordance amongst themselves, and too wide departures from the
 curve indicated by the above experiments, to enable them to be re
 garded as trustworthy ; the causes of this being, as above stated, the
 slight difference in density between the two alloys formed, and the
 relatively large effect of temperature variation at this part of the
 curve as compared with other portions further removed from the
limiting point.       In  <U+FB01>g. 4 (representing the above table plotted on
 the triangular system) L is the limiting point deduced by Stokes’
 2nd Method from a carefully made large-scale plotting, giving as the

the curves marked 1 are closely in accordance with those deducible
by shifting the curves marked 2 upwards on the paper; so that it
may fairly be inferred that whilst the values of A+A' and B +B' at
the limiting point are close to 45 and 85 respectively, those for curves
No. 2 are not far from A+A' = 48, and B+B' = 88, as indicated by
the dotted prolongations:       whence, the compositions at this limiting

   A priori, it would seem not impossible that the position of the
limiting point might correspond with the formation of a de<U+FB01>nite
compound of the two immiscible metals, soluble in the “solvent”
metal to an extent varying with the temperature.                   On the other
hand, the experiments subsequently described show that when silver
replaces tin as solvent metal an entirely di<U+FB01>erent ratio between lead
and zinc subsists at the limiting point thus found, more nearly ap
proximating to Pan.            Experiments now in progress, moreover,
indicate that with antimony as solvent metal a third ratio, approxi
mately Pban, is deduced.
   It is further noticeable that the upper tie-lines, depicted in <U+FB01>g. 4
 (Nos. 9 to 14), visibly converge together in such fashion that the
point representing the composition Sn = 28, Pb = 11, Zn = 61 per
 cent. lies in the midst of them all. This con<U+FB01>guration obviously
 suggests that there is a tendency to the formation of some de<U+FB01>nite
 compound, such that whilst a considerable range in composition is
 shown by the heavier alloys, a much smaller one is observed in the
 case of the lighter alloys conjugate therewith; that this compound is
 indicated by the formula SnZn; is strongly suggested by the circum

    It will be shown  in a future paper, that analogous convergent dis
positions of the lines are observed with other ternary metallic
mixtures, also leading to the conclusion that de<U+FB01>nite compounds are
formed; a well marked case in point is noticed with alloys of lead,
zinc, and cadmium, where a marked convergence is observable to a
point where the cadmium and lead are in the ratio indicated by the
formula Cdeg.
                    Alloys of Bismuth, Tin, and Zinc.
    The experiments described in Part III, when plotted on the tri
angular system, indicate that the limiting point in the critical curve
for mixtures of bismuth, tin, and zinc is situated to the right (zinc
side) of the central line of the triangle ; so that in order to determine,
with the least amount of error through imperfect intermixture, the
conjugate points situated near the limiting point, the mixtures used
must contain more zinc than bismuth. Accordingly a number of
additional experiments were made with mixtures containing bismuth
                               l
and zinc in the proportion : 2'5 to 1 : 3'5, and from 12 to 21 per cent.
of tin. The <U+FB01>gures thus obtained showed that some of the compound
ingots previously examined (prepared with equal quantities of his
muth and zinc) were slightly but sensibly a<U+FB01>ected by the error due
to incomplete intermixture, owing to the preponderance of heavier
alloy formed over the lighter one. The following table exhibits the
average values <U+FB01>nally deduced from these further experiments, together
with those of the former series not materially affected by this source
of error, at temperatures aVeraging near to 650° C. It is noticeable
that these further experiments show that the numerical value of the
excess of tin percentage in the lighter alloy over that in the heavier
attains a maximum (of negative sign), and then diminishes again;

Part III.

 above described.    The point marked     A   represents a mixture not sepa

     Inasmuch, however, as an entirely different proportion is found
 when silver is the “solvent” metal (approximately                  Bian), this
 cannot be regarded as much evidence of the existence of an atomic
 compound of bismuth and zinc at the limiting point.
     On contrasting together the curves thus deduced for mixtures of
 lead-zinc-tin and bismuth-zinc-tin, it is obvious that in each case the
 curve for a higher temperature lies inside that for a lower tempera
 ture.    When bismuth is the heavier immiscible metal, the curve lies
inside that obtained with lead instead of bismuth; apparently the
                                                   bismuth

     The limiting points above deduced in each case lie to the right (zinc
  side) of the central line of the triangle, and the uppermost tie-lines
.in each case slope to the right.            With bismuth-zinc-tin alloys the
 same disposition is also observed with the lower tie-lines, but with
 lead-zinc-tin alloys the lower ties slope to the left, the reason for this
  difference probably being that lead and tin exhibit a tendency to
 combine together to form a de<U+FB01>nite compound, SnPbs, the formation

of which a<U+FB02>'ects the composition of certain of the heavier alloys,
whilst no similar compound appears to be formed between bismuth
and tin.    Owing to the critical curve for bismuth-zinc-tin being so
much lower down than that for lead-zinc-tin, the tendency towards
formation of the compound SnZnh which affects the direction of slope
of the ties in the latter curve, is almost invisible with the former
ones.    Some slight indication of an effect is, however, perceptible, the
slope of the ties to the right visibly ceasing to increase towards the
upper part of the curve in the same marked way as is noticeable at
the lower part thereof.     It is remarkable in this connexion that the
upper ties with alloys of lead and zinc, when tin is the solvent metal,
are the only ones sloping downwards to the right, those obtained
with lead and zinc when silver, cadmium, or antimony is the solvent
metal, uniformly sloping downwards to the left. Precisely the same
remarks apply to the corresponding alloys containing aluminium
instead of zinc so far as at present examined.
                      Alloys of Lead, Silver, and Zinc.
    The experiments detailed in Part .11 indicate that the position of
the limiting point with lead-silver-zinc alloys lies considerably to the
 left of the central line of the triangle, and not to the right as with
 the above-described alloys containing tin. Accordingly, a number of
 additional experiments were made with mixtures containing lead and
 zinc in proportions from 3 : 2 to 4! : 1 (according to the amount of
 silver present), with the object of correcting any possibly erroneous
 values due to imperfect intermixture owing to inequality between the
 quantities of heavier and lighter alloys formed; and also of obtain
 ing pairs of conjugate points situated nearer to the limiting point
 than those already deduced, and thus of enabling the position of the
 limiting point itself to be calculated. In all these further experiments
 the percentage of silver in the mixture exceeded 20, so that only those
 points were re-valued lying nearer to the limiting point than those
 where the effect of the formation of the compound Aan5 in produ
cing irregularity       became appreciable.       The temperature      was
 750°——850°   throughout, averaging near to 800° as before.
     The following table represents the average results obtained by
 taking into consideration these further experiments, together with
 those described in Series I and II, Part II, none of which were found
 to be aifected by the error due to incomplete intermixture to anything
 like so great an extent as was found with some few of the ingots pre-'
 pared with tin. The 14 pairs of conjugate points are deduced from
 the examination of 39 compound ingots in all, representing 78 ternary
 alloys.   Each point, therefore, nearly represents the average of three
  alloy analyses.

   The experiments described in Part           III    show that with bismuth
zinc-silver alloys, as with those of lead-ziuc-silver, the position of
the limiting point lies to the left (bismuth side) of the central line.
Accordingly, a number of additional experiments were made with
silver percentages upwards of twenty, and with zinc and bismuth in
the proportions 1 : 1'33 to 1 : 1'5, so as to deduce more accurately and
completely the upper portion of the critical curve, only those points
being re-valued where the in<U+FB02>uence of the formation of the compound

the corresponding results obtained with lead-zinc-silver alloys shown
in <U+FB01>g. 8, these lines clearly indicate the eEects due to the formation
of Aan5 and Ag4Zn5; the formation of the <U+FB01>rst leading to a marked
bulge inwards on both sides of the curve at the lowest part; and that
of the second to an outward bulge somewhat higher up in the left
hand branch, as compared with the dotted line ab connecting the
upper part of the curve with the point b on the base line, representing
the alloy of bismuth and zinc formed in the absence of “ solvent”
metal.
    The points marked A, B, and 0 represent certain mixtures ex
amined that did not separate into two diiferent alloys, i.e., that formed
“real” alloys at 750°.
    Leaving out of sight the lower bulges inwards and outwards, due
to formation of Aans and Ag4Zn5, it is evident that the critical curve
for bismuth-zinc-silver lies inside that for lead-zinc-silver, just as that
for bismuth-zinc-tin lies inside that for lead-zinc-tin. Further, the
curve for bismuth-zinc-silver lies outside that for bismuth-zinc-tin
just as the curve for lead-zinc-silver lies outside that for lead-zinc-tin.
With silver as “ solvent ” metal the limiting point lies to the left of
the central line of the triangle (bismuth or lead side); whilst with
tin as solvent metal it lies to the right (zinc side).        In the <U+FB01>rst case
the ties uniformly slope downwards to the left, and in the second, to the
right so far as the upper ones are concerned; although a slope to the
 left is observed with the lower ones for the lead-zinc-tin alloys, sug
 gesting the existence of a tendency to form a de<U+FB01>nite compound of
 lead and tin (possibly SnPba), no analogous tendency being notice
 able with bismuth and tin.

afforded him by Mr. Sydney Joyce in carrying out the further experi

    The e<U+FB01>ects of raising several varieties of rock to temperatures
 which, though high, in some cases were below those required to pro
duce fusion were described to the Royal Society by Mr. Rutley in
 1886* The following notes may be useful as a continuation of a
subject which is not without interest owing to its bearing on natural
processes.

 presented me with two                           specimens of the so-called quartz
 f'elsite of St. John’s Vale, together with some fragments                      of the
 ordinary rock.       All had been obtained from the quarry near Threl
 keld.     The vitri<U+FB01>ed specimens, as he informed me, “ had been thrown
 with some fuel into the <U+FB01>re of the engine which propels the machinery
 by which the felsite is crushed for road-metal.”               They had been picked
 out from amongst the engine-slag, and had been given to him by
 Mr. R. Humphreys, the late foreman of the quarry.                         Mr. Postle
 thwaite subsequently, on enquiry, at my request, was told that the
 temperature of the <U+FB01>re would. probably be not less than that of a
 large locomotive (the engine is 70-horse power), in the hottest part
 of which pig-iron melts. So that these specimens may have been
 raised to a temperature of about 2000" F.*
     The rock is intrusive in Skiddaw slate, fragments of which it
 includes, and which it slightly alters near the junction. It is so well
 known to geologists that we may refer for most particulars to the
 Survey map and the memoir,j' in which are given                   a brief description
 (p. 33) and a small <U+FB01>gure of the microscopic structure (Plate I, <U+FB01>g. 5).
 The rock is a somewhat porphyritic micro-granite; the matrix is
 holocrystalline,     consisting chie<U+FB02>y of small grains of felspar and
 quartz.     The former are usually rather too much decomposed to
 admit of the species being determined; as a rule, they appear to have
 consolidated      before    the quartz, since they are rectilinear (nearly
 square) in outline, the other mineral <U+FB01>lling the interspaces.                      The
 quartz contains several minute <U+FB02>uid cavities, with relatively small
 bubbles, and an occasional microlith or belonite, so small that any
 attempt to determine it would be a waste of time. A fair number of
 mica <U+FB02>akes, which sometimes run to a larger size, are also present.
 Of these, the smaller occasionally appear to be moulded to the felspars.
 Evidently they once belonged to the biotite group, but are now re
 placed, as is very commou, by a pale-greenish, slightly dichroic,
 secondary mineral—a hydrous mica, or possibly a chlorite.                       There
are sparse granules of iron oxide and of (P) impure sphene.
     In this ground-mass are scattered larger felspar crystals, also more
or less decomposed, in which sometimes the striping of plagioclase
can still be distinguished, but at others the crystal is occupied
entirely by a minute <U+FB01>brous or <U+FB01>lmy secondary product, affording

of these temperatures might be suf<U+FB01>cient.

  rather   brilliant   tints with the crossed nicols.            The crystals are
  occasionally composite, some are fairly idiomorphic, others appear to
  have   suifered    more or less external      corrosion.      There   are besides
  some   grains of quartz (also affected by the action of the magma)
  which contain <U+FB02>uid cavities with a rather stream-like arrangement.
  They are similar to, but generally larger than, those in the ground
  mass.    Both minerals occasionally enclose microliths, among them, I
  think, zircon.     Besides the mica, we <U+FB01>nd one or two rather tufted
  groups of a prismatic         mineral, which exhibits a fairly marked
  dichroism, pale-brown to bluish-green,            at <U+FB01>rst sight not unlike
  tourmaline.     As, however, the extinction certainly is oblique, though
  the angle is not large, this mineral is no doubt a hornblende, and
  probably of secondary origin.

The former are usually spherical, or nearly so, with well-de<U+FB01>ned,

some cases partly  <U+FB01>lled, with opacite, and are thus rendered more or
less opaque.   In some cases, very tiny clear crystallites are inter
spersed among the blackest dust. The ground-mass of the rock
consists of somewhat rounded, or sub-angular, grains of a clear
mineral   set   in         light-brown glass. Of these, the majority
                     a base of
unquestionably represent the quartz of the original ground-mass, but
I think that some are felspar. Most of the mica has also vanished,
though here and there a small remnant may be detected.               The
cavities  in these quartz grains appear  to me to be less  numerous but
a little larger than before. Often they are seemingly empty, but in
some the bubbles still remain apparently without any change.         The
larger quartzes    of the unaltered  rock  now appear   as  grains which
have a rather irregular outline, and are much cracked.          Here also
the cavities seem to be reduced in number, but not to have increased
in size. The larger felspars have disappeared; but their position, on
closer examination, can be identi<U+FB01>ed by irregular patches of dirty
glass, in which are very numerous vacuoles; these generally are
rather small in size, and coated with dark dust. In parts of the glass
minute <U+FB01>bres may be observed, which, however, do not act on polar
ised light; in others a tiny patch or spot is feebly donblymefracting.
In other parts (especially, I think, where the vacuoles are larger, but
less numerous) the glass is a deep-brown, barely translucent, or even
opaque.   Here and there, in the glass generally, and near the edges
of included grains, groups of minute vermicular cavities appear, and
a few microliths occur in the slide, which are so small that it would
not be safe to o<U+FB01>er an opinion as to their nature or age.
   Practically, the effect of the heating has been to melt down the
felspathic and the micaceous constituents, without very materially
 a<U+FB02>ecting the quartz, and to render the mass vesicular.
   At Les Talbots, in Guernsey, brick is made of a material which is
mainly, if not wholly, disintegrated granite. An over-burnt specimen
which I have examined is a brown slaggy glass, full of mineral frag
mentsrl    These, under the microscope, are seen to be chie<U+FB02>y quartz
and felspar.    The grains of the former are traversed by numerous
cracks, and the pieces appear to have been sometimes displaced, but
to be otherwise una<U+FB02>ected. Those of felspar also are cracked. N ume

with very minute and rather <U+FB01>lmy microliths or with pale-coloured
belonites and granules of opacite (the last being sometimes in more
considerable quantities than one would have expected) ; now and then
it is simply a brown glass. In one fragment with multiple twinning
the lines indicating the composition faces can be traced in parts which
have ceased to act on polarised light. In some fragments, mainly

doubly retracting, though rather feebly, appearing like faint white
clouds on a dark background.                   The ground-mass is studded with

       Nearly forty years since, an attempt was made by Messrs. Chance,
 of Birmingham, to utilise basalt for various purposes, by melting it
 and then running it into moulds, pouring it out in sheets, &c. Refer

 aware, no detailed account was published, nor has any connected
  study been made of the resultsil’             It may he, therefore, of interest to
 record the structure of some specimens which I have examined.                      Two.
  of these were given to me a short time since by J. T. Chance, Esq.

   generally compact, exhibiting slight traces of a crystalline structure
   in one part. In it are a fair number of small cavities, more or less
   spherical, and a few of rather large size, towards the exterior, very
   irregular in shape.         On microscopic examination the following con
   stituents are observed :—(1) magnetite, very abundant in minute
   grains, which, however, evidently are often cubes or- octahedra; (2)

    A third slide, out from a specimen given to me by Professor Judd,
 shows well-de<U+FB01>ned spherulitesi (deep-brown) in a glass (pale-brown,
 almost buif).       In the centre of some of these spherulites is a cruci
 form group consisting of aggregated granules of opacite or ferrite,
 from which radiate similar but thinner bands, interspersed with
 clearer <U+FB01>bres, which also have a tendency to group themselves cross
 wise, rather than to diverge in all directions.               These <U+FB01>bres seem to
 have a very faint depolarising in<U+FB02>uence, but they are so small and
 still so discoloured as to be un<U+FB01>t for examination.§                 These <U+FB01>brous
 structures can generally be traced to the edge of the spherulite, but
 the dark lines, by which alone it is to be recognised, become so thin
 that the outer part, with low powers, appears commonly to be struc
 tureless.
     A fourth   specimen in the museum at University College is labelled
 “ Melted
              Rowley Basalt, cooled in 13 days; from upper surface.
 Eagle Foundry, Birmingham, February, 1836"“ This is a black glass,
 with a slightly irregular, sub-conchoidal fracture, rather vesicular
 in one part, and opposite to this hearing apparently the impression
 of a mould.       Under the microscope, it is a clear glass of a warm
 brown colour, by no means dark. It contains a few minute cavities
 and granules of opacite; there are some larger vacuoles, circular in
 section, from 0'01 inch to 0'05 inch in diameter, and a few circular
 spots, about the same size, slightly grayer and more granular than
 the rest of the rock ; also one small portion of a deeper brown glass
    * Though occasionally one more “ stumpy ” may be seen.
    1- Mr. Butley observed that an opaque zone occurred in a specimen of vitri<U+FB01>ed
 basalt where it joined a fragment of unmelted basalt, which had been dropped into
 the crucible after this had been removed from the <U+FB02>ame.
    1: Mr. Rutley observed a rudely spherulitic structure in a slowly cooled specimen
 of melted basalt (Plate V,       4).
    § In the immediate neighbourhood of the central crosses they seem to enclose
 ferrite granules, arranged along lines with very short cross-pieces.
    || The date is as printed,
                                but, as each label bears the same signature, “ William
 Hawkes,“ it may be a clerical error for 1856.
                                                                        21:2

with    a.  paler border, something like a <U+FB02>eur-de-lys in shape. But on
the whole the glass is remarkably uniform and free from microlithic
enclosures of appreciable size.              .
    A <U+FB01>fth specimen consists of a number of small black glassy frag
ments labelled “ Melted Rowley Basalt, cooled in water.                         Eagle
Foundry, Birmingham, February, 1858.” This material is not suited
for slicing, so I have had some of it pounded and have examined the
powder.         This shows the rock to be a glass which breaks into rather
<U+FB01>at sharp-edged chips with a clean somewhat conchoidal fracture; in
colour a translucent umber-brown, not dark in the thicker parts of
the fragments, and a very faint olive-brown, almost colourless, in the
thinner.        One or two of the larger chips give slight indications of
a <U+FB01>uidal structure, and contain, rarely, a minute cavity or a granule
or two of opacite.
    All the basalt on which Messrs. Chance experimented came, I
believe, from the well-known mass near Rowley Regis<U+FB01>‘< which has
been often described.             The natural rock is usually fairly coarsely
crystalline;      but  I happen to possess specimens of an unusually glassy
variety, collected by myself nearly twenty years since, from a pit
 which was then being opened on the northern side of the hill, near
 some collieries, which, as I was told, were called the California pits,
the excavation being evidently almost at the base of the basalt.
 These specimens, macroscopically, are compact dark magma-basalts,
 with rather smooth sub-conchoidal fracture, oneT slightly more com
 pact than the other.          Under the microscope we see in both, but more
 commonly        in the  less compact, sparse grains of serpentinised olivine
 and crystals of plagioclase, each about 0003 inch long, together
 with grains of iron oxide (magnetite, or perhaps in some cases
 ilmenite) scattered in a colourless matrix which is thickly studded
 with smaller granules of iron oxide, and tiny, rather irregularly
formed prisms of almost colourless augite, among which the presence
of lath-like microliths of felspar is suggested.              On applying polarised
light (with a magni<U+FB01>cation of about 50 diameters) much of the clear
part seems not to produce any depolarising effect, though obviously
felspar microliths are frequently present in it; but with about
150 diameters very faint bands of gray light make their appearance
—most clearly in the coarser-grained specimen: in the other, even
 when a quartz plate is used, no difference of tint can be seen in some
parts, either as the stage is rotated, or by comparison of the edge of
the slice with the coloured <U+FB01>eld.               The inde<U+FB01>nite, almost ghost-like

  aspect of the crystallites (where they are seen) does not appear to
 proceed from a crowding of minute microliths (for a crystallite may
 sometimes be larger than one of the augite granules), but from its
 power to depolarise being weak, as if its molecular condition were
 only slightly anisotropic.         It is, therefore, possible that the rock is
 in the act of passing rather than has actually passed from a glassy
 condition, though it is not truly a tachylite.
    On comparing the results of arti<U+FB01>cial processes, described above,
 with rocks which have solidi<U+FB01>ed from natural fusion, we observe
 (1) that while quartz and felspar crystals in acid rocks, after having
 formed, frequently appear to have been partially melted down, the
 quartzes, as a rule, are not cracked, the inner parts of the felspars are not
locally converted into glass. The exterior only—as when a soluble sub
stance is acted on by a <U+FB02>uid—appears to have been affected; (2) that,
in the case of the basic rocks arti<U+FB01>cially melted, the glassy part is a
 true tachylite, but the structure of the devitri<U+FB01>ed specimen, with its
peculiar skeletal crystals of felspar and magnetite and absence of
well-de<U+FB01>ned augite, is unusual in nature?                 It is, however, as I know
from specimens in my own collection, and as may be seen from
Vogelsang’s book, rather characteristic of slags and glasses. This
appears to be con<U+FB01>rmatory of the View commonly entertained that an
igneous rock is not lique<U+FB01>ed by the action of heat alone, but that
water is a contributing agent, and is always present in the magma;
further that the formation of a glass in the process of cooling is facili
tated by the escape of the water, which may explain the comparative
rarity of tachylites in nature, and the fact that when they                     do occur,

that a new star had been discovered in the constellation Auriga, and
that photographs had been obtained at Greenwich on Monday night.
  Observations were therefore impossible here before last night. This
ismuch to be regretted, and suggests that some local organisation is
needed to further quick transmission  of news to observing stations
relating to phenomena which may change in                             a few days         or even
hours.
  Last night was fortunately <U+FB01>ne, and two photographs                               were taken
of the spectrum :—

     The <U+FB01>rst registered thirteen lines; the second appears to contain
some    additional ones, but they are very faint and have not yet been
measured.
  A  complete discussion of these photographs will form the substance
of   asubsequent communication, but already the following approxi
mations to the wave-lengths have been obtained, the photographs
being treated absolutely independently, means, however, being taken
for the four least refrangible lines, as there has not yet been time to
construct a proper curve for this region.                              '

   For the eye observations, the new 3-f00t mirror, which has recently
 been presented to the Astrophysical Laboratory by Mr. Common, was
employed, but unfortunately the clock is not yet mounted, so that
the observations were dif<U+FB01>cult.
  C    was the brightest line observed.       In the green there were
several lines, the brightest of which was in all probability F, the
position being estimated by comparison with the <U+FB02>ame of a wax
taper.    Another line was coincident, with the dispersion employed,
with the radiation at 500 from burning magnesium wire. A fainter

 taper.    A feeble line in the yellow was coincident, under the condi
 tions employed, with the sodium line at D.
    The hydrogen line at G was distinctly seen, as well as a band or
 group of lines between G and F.
    Nearly all the lines appear to be approximately, if not actually,
 coincident with the lines seen in the various types of Cygnus stars,
 the chief difference being the apparent existence of carbon, hydro
 carbon, and calcium in the nova.
    The colour was estimated by Mr. Fowler as reddish-yellow, and by
Mr. Baxandall as rather purplish. My own impression was that the
 star was reddish, with a purple tinge.        This was in the 10-inch
achromatic.      In the 3-foot re<U+FB02>ector it was certainly less red than
many stars of Group II. No nebulosity was observed either in the
 3-foot or the 10-inch refractor, nor does any appear in a photograph of
 the region taken by a {dig-inch Dallmeyer lens with three hours’ ex
posure.     It should be stated that the camera was carried by the
 photographic telescope, the clock of which had had its normal rate
 purposely changed to give breadth to the spectrum.
    The photographs were taken and reduced by Messrs. Fowler and
 Baxandall. The eye observations and comparisons were made by
 Mr. Fowler alone.
II. “ Note     on the Energy Absorbed by Friction in the Bores of
       Ri<U+FB02>ed Guns.” By Captain NOBLE, O.B., F.R.S., 800. (late
       Royal Artillery). Received December 31, 1891.
    The object of the experiments which I proceed to describe was to
ascertain approximately, and under varied conditions, the loss of
energy due to the friction of the driving ring of the projectile in the
bores of ri<U+FB02>ed guns.
    The rotation of modern breech-loading projectiles is generally given
by means of a copper ring or band on the projectile, on a plan
originally proposed by Mr. Vavasseur, the diameter of this ring being
not only somewhat larger than that of the bore, but even larger than
the diameter of the circle representing the bottom of the grooves,
and the projections which give the rotation are formed by the pressure
of the powder gases forcing the driving ring into the grooves of the
gun. At the commencement of motion the driving ring is conse
quently exactly moulded to the section of the bore at the seat of the
shot, and under the conditions due to the pressure to which the gun
is at the moment subjected.                             '
    It  will readily be conceived that   a band or ring, moulded as de
scribed, may give rise to considerable friction in its passage through
the bore, and the amount of this friction may be modi<U+FB01>ed to a
considerable extent by various circumstances.
                                                            2 r 2

410          Capt. Noble.      Note on the Energy absorbed       [Feb   4,
    For example, the nature of the powder employed may, depending
on the deposit or fouling left in the bore, affect appreciably the
friction. Again, the friction may be considerably modi<U+FB01>ed by the
form and diameter of the ring itself, while a variable amount of
energy must be absorbed by the methods employed to give rotation,
and by the amount of that rotation.                                        -
    In the preliminary experiments three descriptions of powder were
employed—(1) the powder known as P, or the pebble powder of the
English Service; (2) an amide powder in which the nitrate of
potassa of ordinary powder is largely replaced by nitrate of ammonia,
and which powder, in addition to other valuable properties, gives rise
to a smoke much less dense and much more rapidly dispersed than
is the case with pebble and other similar powders;        and (3) a true
smokeless powder.      The form of smokeless powder employed in this
country is best known under the name of cordite, a propelling agent
which promises to be of' great value, and for which we are indebted
to the labours and experiments of Sir F. Abel and Professor Dewar.
A somewhat similar explosive is employed abroad under the name
of “ballistite,” and with this explosive also I have been able to
make an interesting series of experiments.        These experiments do
not, however, come within the scope of the present note.
    The preliminary experiments having shown that a very consider
able amount of' friction was, in the case of pebble powder, due to the
fouling of the gun, while no such result was observed either in the
case of the amide powder or the cordite, it was determined to carry
out the subsequent experiments with the amide powder, <U+FB01>ring, how
ever, for purposes of corroboration an occasional round with the
cordite, of which a small quantity only was available.
 '
    It may be of interest to note the loss of velocity and energy due to
 the fouling with pebble powder.      The charge of powder in a 12-cm.
gun being 12 lbs., and the weight of the shot 45 lbs., the velocity of
the shot, the gun being carefully cleaned and oiled, was, in three
 trials, respectively, 1877 ft.-secs., 1877 ft.-secs., and 1878 ft.-secs.
 The two rounds <U+FB01>red immediately afterwards, the bore then being
 foul, were respectively 1850 and 1868 ft.-secs., 1848 and 1847 ft.-secs.,
 1852 and 1847 ft.-secs., or, taking the means of the whole series, the
 mean velocity with the gun clean was 1877'?) ft.-sees., with the bore
 foul 18'52 ft.-secs., or, to put the result in another form, the mean
 energy realised from the pebble powder, the bore being carefully
 cleaned, and allowance being made for the energy of rotation, was
 1102 ft.-tons, while the mean energy similarly realised with the
 bore foul was only 1072 ft.-t0ns, showing a loss of 30 ft.-tons or of
 2'73 per cent. of energy attributable to the extra friction due to the
 powder deposit in the bore.
     For the purposes of the subsequent experiments,        three  l2-cm.

1892.]                by   Friction in       the Bares of Ri<U+FB02>ed Guns.                           411
quick-<U+FB01>ring guns were specially prepared and ri<U+FB02>ed in the following
manner :—The <U+FB01>rst had grooves of the usual section of the Service,
but these grooves were all cut parallel to the axis of the bore, that is
to say, the pitch of the ri<U+FB02>ing was in<U+FB01>nite, or, in other words, there
was no twist, and no rotation round the central axis would be com
municated to the projectile; the second gun was ri<U+FB02>ed with a
uniform pitch of 1 turn in 162 inches (about 1 turn in 35 calibres) ;
while the third gun was ri<U+FB02>ed with a uniformly-increasing pitch of
from 1 turn in 472"'5 at the breech to 1 turn in 162” at the muzzle,
so that in the last two guns, assuming the same muzzle velocity, the
projectiles would leave the gun with the same angular velocity.
   The projectiles used in these experiments were <U+FB02>at-headed cylin
ders (all being made of the exact weight of 45 lbs.), and di<U+FB01>ered from
one another solely in the driving bands of the projectiles, which
differed from one another both in diameter and length, the differences
being shown in the sketches attached to the tabular results.
   The <U+FB01>rst experiments were made with the rings marked “ A,”
three rounds being <U+FB01>red from each of the three guns described, and
 the following table shows the velocities and energies obtained from
each nature of gun.

   Now, if the results given in this table be examined, it will be
observed that the whole of the velocities obtained from the gun with
out twist are higher than those obtained from ,the gun ri<U+FB02>ed with a
uniform twist, while the whole of the velocities obtained from the
last-mentioned gun are higher than those obtained from the gun
with the parabolic or uniformly increasing twist.
   Using the mean results, there is a loss 2f velocity of 20 ft.-secs. in
passing from the gun with no twist to that with a uniform twist, and
afurther loss of 29 ft.-secs., or 49 ft.-secs. in all, in passing to the gun
with the parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing. Translating these losses of velocity into
losses of energy, it appears that there is a loss of 21 ft.-tons, or about
1'5 per cent. of the total energy due to the uniform ri<U+FB01>ing, and a
further loss of 39 ft.-tons, or 275 per cent., making 60 ft.-tons, or
about 4* per cent.,'in all when the parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing is employed.
   In a paper published in vol. 45 of the ‘Phjlosophical Magazine’
(1873) I investigated the ratio existing between the forces tending to
produce translation and rotation in the bores of ri<U+FB02>ed guns, and I
showed that, if R be the pressure tending to produce rotation, and G
be the gaseous pressure acting on the base of the projectile,             the
resultant of which pressure acts along the axis of the bore, that                            is,

1892.]             by   Friction in     the   Bares of Ri<U+FB02>ed Guns.                    415
    The values of R as given in the last columns of the above tables
are graphically shown on p. 414, and from a comparison of the two
curves it will be readily seen that, although the maximum pressure
between the driving surfaces is not so high with the parabolic as
with the uniform ri<U+FB02>ing, yet, as has been pointed out by Professor
Osborne Reynolds, the mean driving pressure is with the parabolic
ri<U+FB02>ing considerably higher, and             as the energy absorbed        by the friction
between the driving surfaces is approximately proportional to the
mean driving pressures, the loss of energy with that form of ri<U+FB02>ing is
appreciably greater than with the uniform ri<U+FB02>ing.
    In the experiments I am now discussing the mean driving pressure
thronghout the bore was, with the uniform rifling, 7‘35 tons; the
mean loss of energy due to the uniform ri<U+FB02>ing was 21 ft.-tons; hence
the coe<U+FB01>icient of the friction between the driving surfaces derived
from these particular experiments is ,u = 0199.
    Again, with the parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing, the mean driving pressure
throughout the bore is 1106 tons, and if we had only a similar
friction to consider, the loss of energy with this ri<U+FB02>ing should be pro
portioned to the pressure.               The loss, however, is much higher,
amounting,      in   fact,  to  60  ft.-tons.           Part of this extra loss must be
ascribed to the continual alteration of form that the copper driving
ring is subjected to in its passage up the bore,* but it seems to be
doubtful if the whole of this loss can be ascribed to this cause.                    Part
may possibly be ascribed to the ribs being continually forced, so to
speak, to ride on to the sloping driving surface; but the number of
rounds in each case being few, a part may possibly be ascribed tov
   * The action    I  refer to will readily be understood from the annexed diagram.
If the thick lines represent the plan of one of the grooves at the initial angle of the
ri<U+FB02>ing, the projections on the driving ring will be moulded into that form, and if
the light lines represent the groove at its terminal angle it will be seen that the
<U+FB01>nal form of the projections on the ring will be as shown by the shading, while the
cross-hatched portion represents the metal removed by the action of the driving;
surface.

 variations in the energy developed in the gun. Variations in energy,
  under precisely similar conditions, might easily amount to 1 or 2
 per cent., or occasionally more, and, as will be subsequently seen, the
 differences between the uniform and parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing, although always
 in the same direction, are not the same in all the series, and the mean
 of the whole will probably give the most reliable result.
     Summing up the results at which we have so far arrived in the
 experiments I have discussed, it appears that the total loss of energy
 arising from the fouling of pebble powder and from the friction due
 to the parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing together amounted to close upon 7 per cent. of
 the whole energy developed.
    The third and subsequent series of experiments were made some
 weeks later, and from climatic or other causes there was a slight
 but decided decrement in the energy obtained with the amide powder.
 This decrement did not in any way affect the experiments except that
 the absolute values of the energies at the different dates are not
strictly comparable.
    The object of the third series was to ascertain if a narrow driving
 band would rotate the projectile equally well, as with an increasing
 twist it is important, if rotation be secured, that the breadth of the
driving band be as small as is convenient, and further, as in the last
.series, to ascertain the loss of energy due to the                      uniform and para
 bolic ri<U+FB02>ing.
    The results of this third series were                   as shown         in the following

    The results of this series con<U+FB01>rm generally those of the previous
series.    The loss of energy due to the friction of the uniform ri<U+FB02>ing
amounts to 14 ft.-tons, or, a little more than 1 per cent., while that
due to friction and other causes with the parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing amounts to
57 ft.-tons or about 4‘1 per cent., and nearly the same as before.
The di<U+FB01>erence between the uniform and parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing should have
been less than in the former series ; as a matter of fact it is greater,
but this may be accounted for by variations in the powder as pre
viously suggested, as the suppression of a single round in each of the
two guns would make the results in accordance with theory.
    The coef<U+FB01>cient of friction calculated from the uniform ri<U+FB02>ing gives
'ul
     = 0133.
    The driving ring in this series was amply suf<U+FB01>cient for rotative
purposes, there not being even with the highest velocity obtained the
slightest appearance of slip or undue wear.
    In the fourth series the driving ring was of the Government pattern,
but longer, and as is shown in section “ C,” and the results obtained
were as given in the table.

    From     these       two tables it will be seen that the loss of velocity
due to the uniform and parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing is, in Table VI, 12 ft.-secs.
and 64 ft.-secs. respectively; and in Table VII, 18 ft.-secs. and 36 ft.
secs. respectively           ;  these velocities       corresponding to losses of energy
of   12 ft.-t0ns and           22 ft.-tons      due to the uniform twist, and 41 ft.-tons
and    42 ft.-tons, or about 3 per cent., due to the parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing.
Calculated as before from the uniform ri<U+FB02>ing, the coef<U+FB01>cients of fric
tion are respectively 0114 and 0208.
    Examining now with respect to the uniform ri<U+FB02>ing the whole of the
 series   I have described, and observing that with this ri<U+FB02>ing the
 particular form or width of the driving ring would have but a very
 slight, if any, effect upon the loss of energy due to friction, it will
 be seen, from Table VIII, that the mean loss of energy amounts to 1'52
 per cent. of the total energy corresponding to a mean coe<U+FB02>icient of
 friction of 0203, or, say, 02.
    If, as I have pointed out, the loss of energy in the parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing
 was proportional to the pressure on the driving surfaces, the additional
 loss due to that ri<U+FB02>ing would be 0'74 per cent. The actual additional
 loss is, on the mean of the whole of the experiments, about three times
 as great, the mean loss due to parabolic ri<U+FB02>ing being, as shown by
  Table VIII, 378 per cent., and this considerable increment may be
  ascribed to the causes            I have       mentioned.

    The author commences by pointing out the great di<U+FB01>erences be
tween the results obtained in 1879 by G. Forbes for the con
ductivities of quartz in diiferent directions and those obtained in
1883 by Tuschmidt.                     He then refers to Kundt’s discovery, that
the metals       stand        in     the    same order as conductors, and as to the
velocity of propagation of light through them, and mentions that his.

422        On the Thermal Conductivities      of Crystals,  (90.  [Feb    4,
experiments were originally intended to furnish data for a similar
comparison for crystals, but that their object has been extended.
   After some preliminary experiments, he adepted the “ divided bar”
method, which consists in placing a disc of the material the con
ductivity of which is required, between the ends of two bars of
metal placed coaxially, heating one end of the combination,             and
observing, by means of thermo-junctions         applied to the bars, the
distribution of temperature along them, <U+FB01>rst, with the disc in position,
second, with the bars in contact without the disc. When the con
ductivity of the bar is known, these observations suf<U+FB01>ce to deter
mine that of the disc.
   The bars used were 1'9 cm. diameter, and about 341 cm. long.
The ends which came in contact with the discs were amalgamated,
as this was found to be the best method of securing good contacts.
These bars were suspended horizontally in a frame, by means of
strings passing over adjusting screws, which enabled the bars to be
set accurately in the required position.    The temperatures were found
by  means  of a copper-platinum-silver   junction  applied to points along
the bars, at which small conical holes about 0'5 mm. diameter,
containing mercury, were placed. This junction was in circuit with
a galvanometer, and the circuit was so arranged that its resistance
could be found by a modi<U+FB01>cation of Thomson’s bridge method.
   The conductivity of the brass bar was determined before cutting,
by the method—due to Forbes—of determining the loss of heat from
the surface by allowing the bar to cool and observing the change of
temperature with time, and then observing the steady distribution of
temperature along the bar when heated at one end.
   The author shows that change of both the “ internal ” and “externa ”
conductivities with temperature must be taken into account in the
equation for the distribution of temperature.       He takeseach to be a
linear function of the temperature, and <U+FB01>nds <U+FB01>nally the conductivity
of the bar to be 0‘27 c.g.s. unit, and to increase slightly with the
temperature.
   The discs used were of the same diameter as the bar, and were of
various thicknesses, in order to make the distribution of temperature
throughout the bars nearly the same in each case.
   The following are the results obtained, the conductivities of a few
other bodies being given, in order to show the positions of the bodies
 experimented on amongst conductors generally.          No relation of the
kind-found    by Kundt     for metals  seems    to hold for the    crystals
experimented on :—

IV. “On            the Mechanical Stretching of Liquids: an Experi
         mental Determination of the Volume-Extensibility of Ethyl
          Alcohol.” By A. M. WORTHINGTON, M.A. Communicated
         by Professor POYNTING, F.R.S. Received February 1, 1892.
                                         (Abstract)
    After adverting to the three known methods of subjecting a liquid
to tension, viz., (i) the method of the inverted barometer, (ii) the
    VOL. L.                                                                                 26

424             On the Mechanical Stretching    of Liquids.      [Feb     4,
centrifugal method devised by Osborne Reynolds, (iii) the method of
cooling discovered in 1850 by Berthelot, and pointing out that the
<U+FB01>st two afford means of measuring stress but not strain, while the
third gives a measure of strain but not stress, the author proceeds to
describe the manner in which he had used the method of Berthelot in
combination with a new mode of determining the stress, and had
succeeded in obtaining simultaneous measures 0f tensile stress and
strain for ethyl alcohol up to a tension of more than 17 atmospheres,
or 255 lbs. per square inch.
   The liquid, deprived of air by prolonged boiling, is sealed in a. strong
glass vessel, which it almost <U+FB01>lls at a particular temperature, the
                                                   '
residual space being occupied only by vapour.        On raising the tem
perature, the liquid expands    and   <U+FB01>lls the whole.   On now lowering
the temperature, the liquid is prevented from contracting by its
adhesion to the walls of the vessels, and remains distended, still
<U+FB01>lling the whole and exerting an inward pull on the walls of the
vessel.    The tension exerted is measured by means of the change in
capacity of the ellipsoidal bulb of a thermometer sealed into the
                        “ tonometer."     This bulb becomes slightly more
vessel and called the
spherical, and therefore more capacious, under the pull of the liquid,
and the mercury in the tonometer stem falls. The tension correspond
ing to the fall is previously determined from observation of the rise
produced by an equal pressure applied over the same surface.
   The liquid is caused at any desired instant to let go its hold and
spring back to the unstretched volume corresponding to its tempera
ture and to its saturated vapour-pressure by heating for amoment, by
means of an electric current, a <U+FB01>ne platinum wire passing transversely
through the capillary tube that forms part of the vessel. The space
left vacant in the tube represents the apparent extension uncorrected
for the yielding of the glass vessel.
   The measures obtained show that, within the limits of observa
tional error, the stress and this appparent strain are proportional up
to the highest tension reached (17 atmospheres) ; bu t, since the small
yielding of the nearly rigid glass vessel must itself be proportional to
 the stress, it follows that the stress and absolute strain are propor
tional.
   By subjecting the liquid to a pressure of 12 atmospheres in the same
vessel, it was found that the apparent compressibility   was the same as
the apparent extensibility, whence it is deduced that betv'veen pres
 sures of +12 and —17 atmospheres the absolute coef<U+FB01>cient of elasti
city is, within the limits of observational error, constant. Its actual
value is best obtained by observations of compressibility.
   The paper concludes with a description and explanation of a
peculiar phenomenon of adhesion between two solids in contact when
immersed in a liquid that is subjected to tension.

 SIR,
    I have  had the honour to lay before the Queen the loyal and dutiful
 Address of the Fellows of the Royal Society of London on the occa
 sion of the death of His Royal Highness The Duke of Clarence and
 Avondale, K.G., and      I  have to inform you that Her Majesty was
 pleased to receive the Address very graciously.
                           I have the honour to be,
                                       Sir,
                                    Your obedient Servant,
                                                        HENRY MATTHEWS.
 The Treasurer and Vice-President of the
          Royal Society of London.
    A List of the Presents received was laid on the table, and thanks
 ordered for them.

I. “Note on the Spectrum of Nova Aurigae.”                   By  J. NORMAN
            LOOKYER, F.R.S.       Received February        8, 1892.
    Since the observations of Wednesday (Feb. 3), recorded in a pre
liminary note, the weather precluded any further work till last night
(Feb. 7).    Two more photographs were taken and eye observations
made.
    The photographs,    though exposed for a shorter time, gave many
more lines than the long-exposed one on Wednesday.
    The bright lines at K, H, h, and G are accompanied by dark lines
on their more refrangible sides.
                 Addendum.        Received February 11.
                              Eye  Observations.
    On account of continued bad weather, no further photographs             or
 observations of the Nova have been obtained since February 7.              It

 then appeared to be slightly brighter than on February 3, when the
 star was <U+FB01>rst observed at Kensington. With the 10-inch refractor
 and Maclean spectroscope, C was seen to be very brilliant, and there
 were four very conspicuous lines in the green.            Several fainter lines
 were also seen, and a dark line was suspected in the orange.                   I
 noticed that some of the lines, especially the bright one near F, on
 the less refrangible       side, appeared to change rapidly in relative
 brightness,  and   this was   con<U+FB01>rmed by Mr. Fowler.
    Observations of the spectrum were made by Mr. Fowler with the
 53-foot re<U+FB02>ector, and the Hilger 3-prism spectroscope.             Of the four
 most conspicuous lines in the green, F is the most refraugible, and
comparisons with burning magnesium showed one of them to be
sensibly coincident with the edge of the magnesium <U+FB02>uting at 5006.
 The least refrangible of the four bright green lines was found to be
slightly less refrangihle than the carbon <U+FB02>uting near 7t 517; it gives
no indications of a <U+FB02>uted character, and further observations seemed
to suggest that it was magnesium b, unless there be a very great
change of position due to motion in the line of sight.               The fourth
line, which lies between F and 5006, is about one-third of the dis
tance between them from F, and its wave-length, assuming the star
to be at rest, was estimated to be about 490.
    In addition to these, the G line of hydrogen was distinctly visible,
and also a. group of lines between G and F. The latter were not
measured, as they appear on the photographs.
    Amongst the fainter lines, one was estimated to be near X 527, and
is probably the iron line at E. By comparison with the spectrum of
manganese chloride burning in a spirit-lamp <U+FB02>ame, another line was
found to be sensibly coincident with the edge of the brightest <U+FB02>uting,
>. 5576
    There was a bright line a little more refrangible          than C, and the
D line was faintly visible.
                                   Photographs.
    The <U+FB01>rst photograph       was exposed from 10.20 to 11.50      P.M., and the
second from    12 to 2 A.M.,  Feb. 7, the 6-inch object-glass and prism being
employed in each case.         The same number of lines is shown in both
photographs,    the   sky  not  being so clear during the second as during
the <U+FB01>rst exposure.        Twenty bright lines have been measured, and
their wave-lengths are given in the accompanying table.
   The table also shows probable coincidences with the lines in the
spectra of the \Volf-Rayet stars, as photographed                 by Professor
Pickering; dark lines in the Orion stars, photographed at Kensing
ton; and bright lines in the Orion nebula, photographed at Westgate.
This part of the subject will be discussed in a subsequent paper.

434              Note    on the Spectrum   of lVova .-lurfgn2.    [Feb.   11,
  In addition to the lines recorded in the table, the photographs   of
the spectrum of the Nova. showed several lines more refrangible than
K. These have not yet been reduced, but they probably include
some of the ultra-violet hydrogen lines.
   All the lines in the spectrum of the Nova are broad, although in a
photograph of the spectrum of Arcturus, taken with the same instru
mental conditions, the lines are perfectly sharp.     It is important
to note that the broadening of the lines is not accompanied by any
falling off of intensity at the edges, as in the case of the hydrogen
lines in such a star as Sirius. With the method employed in taking
the photographs, long exposures are liable to result in a. thickening
of all the lines, on account of atmospheric tremors.   The lines would
also be thick if the Nova be hazy, as observed at Greenwich.      In the
photographs, however, all the lines are not equally thick.
   If the lines are similarly broadened when a slit spectroscope is
employed, the e<U+FB01>ect must be due to internal agitations; for    different
                                                                 it'
regions of the Nova are moving with varying velocity, or with the
same velocity in dilferent directions, a normally <U+FB01>ne line might be

   The hydrogen lines and the K line of calcium are very bright, and,
as pointed out in the note above, they are accompanied by dark lines
on their more refrangible sides. This was previously noticed in the
photographs taken on February    but as the dark lines were not very
                                    3,
conspicuous, they were not referred to until further con<U+FB01>rmation

that dark lines have also been observed on the more refrangible
sides of the bright hydrogen lines in the photographs taken at
Harvard College Observatory.
   A somewhat similar phenomenon has already been recorded by
Professor Pickering, in the case of      Lyrae, and this has been con

firmed by a series of photographs taken at Kensington.         In this
case, the bright lines are alternately more and less refrangible than
the dark ones,   with a period probably corresponding to the known
period of variation in the light of the star.   The maximum relative
velocity indicated isstated  by Professor Pickering as approximately
300 English miles per second.
   In the case of Nova Aurigaa, the dark lines in all four photographs
taken at Kensington are more refrangible than the bright ones, so
that as yet there  isno evidence of revolution.   The relative velocity
indicated by the displacement of the dark lines with respect to the
bright ones appears to be over, rather than under, 500 miles per
second.   The reduction     not yet complete.

two meteor swarms.    On this supposition, the spectrum of Nova
Auriga; would suggest that a dense swarm is moving towards the
earth with a great velocity, and passing through a sparser swarm,
which is receding.     The great agitation set up in the dense swarm
would produce the dark line spectrum, while the sparser swarm would
give the bright lines.

                                 (Abstract.)
  0111‘ communication begins by stating that we have sought to study
the action of the Mammalian heart in conditions (unexcised and
intact) as nearly approaching the normal as we were able to make
compatible with the employment of exact methods of research.    This
is followed by a general consideration of the difficulties attendant
upon such a study, and of the means by which these dif<U+FB01>culties may
be overcome.
  Under the heading of Methods we describe a cardiometer which we
employed to measure the contraction volume and the “output,” as
well as the changes in the volume of the heart other than those due
to its rhythmic contractions and expansions.   A description is also
given of the method of employing     together with a statement as to
                                         it,
the degree of the accuracy with which, according to our experience,
the instrument supplies information regarding the changes in the
volume of the heart. We then describe an automatic counter, which
we employed for measuring out and recording the output of the
heart, as obtained by the cardiometer.
  This     followed by a description of our myocardiograph, which we
          is
made use of to record the contractions and expansions of any part
or parts of the ventricular and auricular walls without interfering
with the movements of the heart. In most cases we employed this
instrument to obtain simultaneous records of the contractions of
one auricle and one ventricle.    We state also our doubts as to the

    Section   III   begins by a consideration of the relationship between
the circumference of a hollow spherical muscle and its cubic contents,
this being illustrated by a- diagram, and by one or two concrete
examples with regard to the bearing of this subject upon the phy
                                                       '
siology of the ventricles.
   We then state the relation between the internal circumference of a
hollow spherical muscle and the resistance to contraction              of its
walls.     Reference is also made to the elastic resistance which the
heart wall itself o<U+FB01>ers to contraction, and the bearing of this upon
the production of negative pressure within its cavity under certain
conditions.
   We then consider brie<U+FB02>y the effect on the ventricular contractions
of changes in the blood pressure within the systemic and pulmonary
arteries, pointing out how much the heart has in common with the
voluntary muscles of the body, and explaining why the amount of
residual blood is liable to changes, concluding with a few remarks
        “ failure of the heart.”
upon
   In Section IV we enter upon a study of the effects of the vagus
nerve upon the heart. We begin with the changes in the contraction            i
volume, and point out that, at <U+FB01>rst sight, our curves seem to show
that, other things being equal, the volume of blood expelled at each
systole varies in inverse ratio to the rapidity of heart beat. We show,
however, that this general law does not hold' good for vagus slowing
(if, indeed, it be exact for slowing of any kind), which is found to
be accompanied by a lowering of the output; that, with moderate
slowing, this diminution of the output may be as much as 30 or 35
per cent.
   We then speak of the increase in the amount of residual blood in
the heart which is produced by vagus excitation, showing that this
does not necessarily indicate any weakening of the ventricular con
tractions.
   We next analyse myocardiographic records of the action of the
vagus upon the heart, showing that the auricular contractions are
weakened or arrested, and noting that the in<U+FB02>uence of the vagus upon
the force of the auricular contractions bears no constant proportion to
the vagus slowing.          By strong vagus excitation or by muscarin the
auricles may be completely arrested, it may be, for hours.         This com
plete  arrest   is,  in some cases, led up to by progressive weakening, but
sometimes arrest occurs immediately after fairly strong beats, or with
fairly strong      beats presenting  themselves at times during the arrest.
These latter      cases may be explained    by weakening of the excitations
which reach       the auricles from the sinus, although they are possibly
due to diminished excitability of the auricles.

  1892.]    Physiology and Pathology of    the Mammalian Ifeart.      437
     On coming to the eifect of the vagi upon the ventricles we <U+FB01>nd that
  the distension of the heart during vagus actions is due to the ven
  tricles being more expanded, both in diastole and in systole. We point
  out that the increased volume of the heart at the end of systole is a
  necessary result of the increased contraction volume, and combat the
  conclusions of those who ascribe it to weakening of the ventricular
  contractions,  pointing out that the greatly increased contraction,
  volume increases to a corresponding extent the work done at each
 contraction.    We give detailed reasons for concluding that this
 su<U+FB02>ices to explain the apparent diminution of the ventricular con
                                                         '
 tractions.
     We then examine the in<U+FB02>uence of the vagus upon the tonus of the
 relaxed ventricles, and point out that the great distension during
 vague action is due entirely to increased intra-ventricular pressure
 during diastole, and not, as has been asserted by some, to any change
 in the elasticity of the relaxed ventricular wall.
     Next, we consider the cause of the rise of venous (systemic and
 pulmonary) pressure, and <U+FB01>nd that this is due not to any increase in
 the amount of blood entering the veins in a given time or to contrac
tion of their walls, but that it is to be ascribed to the diminished
 in<U+FB02>ow into theyentricles.
     The cause of this diminished in<U+FB02>ow into the ventricles leading to
corresponding diminution of the output is twofold, namely, weaken
ing or arrest of the auricles, and, secondly, the elastic resistance of
the ventricular wall to distension.      We show that this explanation
must apply to both sides of the heart, and that observed facts corre
spond with it.
     We then consider the after-effects of vague excitation, and show
that the temporary increase in the output which is sometimes present
may be exPlained by a temporary increase in the force of the auricular
contractions, and by the venous pressure taking some little time to
fall after the vagus excitation has ceased.
    After this, we examine the in<U+FB02>uence of the vagus upon the heart
rhythm, and show that, when the vagus excitation reaches a certain
degree (varying in different animals), the ventricles begin to beat
independently of the sinus and Qiricles ; that this rhythm, which is at
<U+FB01>rst slow and irregular, gradually becomes fairly rapid and almost
completely regular.
    This rhythm, we show, must be looked upon as the same as that
which, as Wooldridge and Tigerstedt observed, makes its appearance
when the ventricles are severed from the auricles.         We point out,
however, that the independent ventricular rhythm of vagus action is
characterised by the slowness with which it establishes itself.
    This characteristic is due to the lowering of the excitability of the
ventricles produced by vagus action, and we adduce a considerable

438              Prof. C. S. Roy and Mr. J. G. Adami.             [Feb.  11,
number of facts showing that the vagus does lower the excitability of
the ventricles, and that, by means of muscarin and by discontinuous
stimulation of the vagus, it is possible to isolate the in<U+FB02>uence of the
vagus on the rhythm and force of the auricles from its in<U+FB02>uence
upon the excitability of the ventricles.      The power of the vagus to
stop the ventricles temporarily can only be explained by this diminu
tion of their excitability.
    We show that, with a certain degree of vagus excitation, irregu
larity of the ventricles necessarily results, in consequence of the
sinus and the ideo-ventricular rhythms interfering with one another;
that this is the common cause of irregularity; and that irregularity
may also be caused by the auricles not responding to all the impulses
which reach them from the sinus.
    We explain that, in rare instances, direct excitation of the vagus
may so lower the excitability of the ventricle that the contractions
may not extend over the whole of their walls, and may in this way
produce the apparent weakening which is sometimes met
                                                                with.
    In  Section V  we pass on to study the eifect of direct excitation of
 the Merci augmentnres (accelerantes) upon the heart, and show that
 the acceleration of the rhythm may be extremely slight if the heart
 be beating fast, and that the acceleration and augmentation of force
 of the heart bear no constant proportion to one another.                The
 augmentor nerves     increase the diastolic expansion  of the  auricles and
 also increase their systolic contraction; but these two effects do not
 go hand in hand.
     Excitation of the augmentors increases the output of the heart,
 owing to the increased force and frequence of the auricular contrac
 tions, the result of this being that the pressures in the systemic and
 pulmonary arteries rise, while the systemic
                                                   and pulmonary venous
 pressures fall.     If there be but little quickening, the contraction
 volume of the ventricles is increased.
     The augmentors, on direct stimulation, cause a slight increase in
 the diastolic expansion of the ventricles, which is passive in nature
  and due to the increased force of the auricular contraction.           The
 force of the ventricular contractions is increased; they contract more
 completely, diminishing the amount of- residual blood,
                                                             in spite of the
 fact that the arterial pressure is usually somewhat    raised.
     There are certain nerve <U+FB01>bres other than the nervi augmentores
  proper which pass from the stellate ganglion
                                                      to the heart, some
  times by the annulus of Vieussens to the inferior cervical ganglion.
  but sometimes as separate branches ‘passing directly to the heart
  from the ganglion stellatum, or the annulus.       On peripheral excita
  tion of the cut nerves there is marked weakening of the contractions
  both of the auricles and of the ventricles, usually with some degree
   of slowing, this being sometimes followed on cessation of the excita

  tion by a very well-marked increase in the force and frequence
  of the auricular and ventricular contractions.        They may be vaso
  constrictors for the coronary vessels, although we give no proof of
 this.
     There are nerve <U+FB01>bres which descend to the heart by the vago
 sympathetics, which, on excitation under certain conditions, increase
 the force and frequence of beat of the auricles and ventricles, and
 which may be. vaso-dilators for the coronary vessels.
     Re<U+FB02>ex excitation of the vagus produces results which are the
 same as those of direct excitation of the nerve, and the curves are
 more typical and satisfactory than those obtained on direct excitation
                                               '
 of the nerve.
     Excitation of   a  mixed   nerve   like the sciatic usually produces
 e<U+FB01>ects on the    heart similar in kind to those due to direct excitation
of the augmeutors, but the phenomena are complicated by the greater
rise of the pressure in the systemic arteries.      Sometimes the increase
 in force of the ventricle more than counterbalances this increased re
sistance to contraction, and the amount of residual blood in the left
ventricle is reduced; in other cases the increase in force of the ven
tricular contractions is not suf<U+FB01>cient to counterbalance the increased
resistance, and the residual blood in the left ventricle is increased.
     In Section IX we show that excitation of the central end of a
mixed nerve like the sciatic 0r splanchnic usually a<U+FB01>ects both the
augmentor and vagus centres in the medulla, and that, in nearly all
cases, the augmentor centre is the more strongly excited of the two,
so that augmentor e<U+FB02>’ects show themselves during the excitation, but
are succeeded by vagus action on ceasing to excite the nerve. In
many cases augmentor e<U+FB01>'ects alone show themselves. When excited
re<U+FB02>exly the augmentor centre ceases to act earlier than the vagus;
the opposite, therefore, to what takes place with direct excitation.
In rare    cases the excitation  of the vagus centre may be stronger than
that of the augmentor from the <U+FB01>rst. Although, in the absence of
any augmentor action, the vagus does not reduce the force of the
ventricular systole, it does unmistakably have the power of in
hibiting the strengthening in<U+FB02>uence which the augmentors exert upon
the ventricular contractions.
     In Section X, upon the part played by the vagus in the economy,
we show that vagus excitation relieves the heart of work and there
fore of waste to as great an extent as is compatible with a continua
tion of the circulation, and conclude that the vagus acts as a
protective nerve to the heart, reducing the work thrown upon that
organ when from fatigue or other cause such relief is required by it.
The presence of <U+FB01>bres in the sciatic and other mixed nerves which
cause re<U+FB02>ex excitation of the vagus would seem to indicate that this
nerve may be used by other parts of the body to diminish the out

  put of the heart and lower the blood pressure, thereby reducing the
  activity of the circulation as a whole. The in<U+FB02>uence of the blood
  pressure in the systemic arteries on the degree of vagus activity and
  the readiness with which the vague centre is called_ into play by
  raising the intercranial pressure indicate that the vagus mechanism
  is specially employed in lowering the circulation so as to limit
'
  cerebral congestion.    The vagus acts chie<U+FB02>y in the interests of the
  heart and central nervous system.
     The power of the vagus over the heart is limited, and the ideo
  ventricular mechanism, which comes into play when the vagus action
  exceeds a certain limit, must be looked upon as the means by which
  arrest of the circulation and death is prevented, whenever from any
  cause the nerve exerts a maximum          in<U+FB02>uence.    The power of the
  vagus to lower the excitability of the ventricles makes their tem
  porary arrest possible, but this reduction of the excitability of the
  ventricles cannot be kept up, no matter how strong the stimuli applied
  to the nerve, for a period long enough to endanger the economy.
     In Section XI we show that the function of the augmentor in the
  economy is to increase the work and tissue waste of the heart as part
  of the mechanism by which the nervous system governs the circu
  lation, and that the augmentor mechanism sacri<U+FB01>ces the heart in
  order to increase the output of the organ and enable the ventricles
  to pump out their contents against a heightened arterial pressure.
  Such excessive action of the heart is limited by the vagus, which,
  as we have seen, readily steps in so soon as the call for an increased
  supply of blood has ceased.    It may do so earlier, presumably because
  the  increased blood pressure  or the fatigue of the heart calls for vagus
  intervention.
     In Section  XII  we consider the mode of interaction of the vagi and
  augmentores;    we  point out that when the vagi are paralysed by sec
  tion or atropin the augmentores have no control over the cardiac
  rhythm, and that therefore they can only act by inhibiting the in<U+FB02>u
  ence of the vagi on the rhythmic centre of the heart.      When neither
  nerve is acting on the auricles they contract with a certain force,
  which is increased by the augmentores and diminished or inhibited
  by the vagi.    The force of the ventricular contractions is increased
  by augmentor action: this increase can be inhibited by vagus excita
  tion, which latter has otherwise no power to reduce the strength of
  ventricular contractions.
     The force of the heart’s contractions is in<U+FB02>uenced by other factors
  than the vagi, augmentores, and other nerves. The pressure of the
  blood in the coronary arteries is one of the most important of these
  factors.   If this be lowered, the contractions of both auricles and
  ventricles diminish in strength, while a rise of pressure in the
  systemic arteries causes an increase in the force of the heart’s con

1892.]    Physiology and Pathology of      the   Illummalian [Ieart       441
tractions, so that the force of the heart’s contractions is to a certain
extent regulated automatically by changes in the blood pressure in
the aorta, which is one of the variable quantities a<U+FB01>ecting the work
of the left ventricle.
   Change of the volume of blood in the body affects greatly the con
traction volume and output of the heart. Inject-ions into the veins of
a volume of de<U+FB01>brinated blood equal to one-tenth of the total blood
in the body may double the output.         It is important to note here
that there is no increase in the strength of the ventricular contrac
tions ; increase in the work, therefore, of the ventricles due to increase
in the output has no tendency to automatically increase the force of
the ventricular contractions, as is the case with rise of pressure in the
systemic arteries.   We refer to the bearing of this in cases of
plethora.
   Increase of the watery constituents of the blood increases the con
traction volume and output to the same extent (though only tempor
arily) as does transfusion of blood, but acts more nnfavourahly on
the heart, seeing that the work done by the ventricles is increased,
while the nutritive value of the blood supplied to the coronaries is
diminished.
   The increased output of the heart both in plethora and in hydreemia
is due to rise of pressure in the systemic veins increasing the volume
of blood which enters the right ventricle during diastole.     We refer
to the bearing of these facts upon the treatment of chlorosis and
heart disease.
   In Section XIV we consider the limits of the power of the heart to
perform the work thrown upon         and show that in strictly physio
                                    it,
logical conditions, and in spite of the beautiful mechanism by which
the force of the ventricular contraction  is  regulated, the heart, like the
voluntary muscles of the body,is  liable to fatigue when the work thrown
upon it greatly exceeds that required to maintain the circular-ion under
ordinary circumstances.     We take as example the increased work
thrown upon the organ during active muscular exertion, and show
that exertion and endurance of fatigue are limited mainly by the
limited power of the heart to continue supplying the increased
amount of blood which     isrequired by the acting voluntary muscles.
We show that those luxuries which are forbidden or limited in
“
  training,” and which are known to hinder prolonged exertion, such
as water, alcohol, tobacco, ca<U+FB01>ein, all directly weaken the force of the
heart’s contractions, and, in the case of water, place the organ under
a disadvantage; also that fatigue of the heart leads to dilatation of
the organ.
   On comparing the power of fatigued ventricles to carry on increased
work, as compared with well-nourished unfatigued ventricles,             it   is
found that not only     is the strengthening effect of the augmentor

nerves upon the individual contractions less in the former case, but
also that the fatigued and therefore dilated heart is per se unfavour
ably placed for meeting increase in the work thrown upon it. An
explanation is given of the reason why in heart disease failure takes
place during exertion.
   The part played by the vagus in protecting the diseased heart from
harmful over-work is referred to, and it is shown that irregularity of
the heart in disease may be explained by the mode in which this
nerve, when acting powerfully, releases the ventricles from the con
trol of the rhythmic centre in the sinus. The chief forms of rhythmic         ,
and arrhythmic irregularity are considered, and it is shown that these
correspond with the forms of irregularity which can be produced by
vagus action.     The irregular heart expends more energy, and its
tissues therefore are more wasted, for a given amount of work than
the heart which is beating regularly.
   The effect upon the heart of imperfect aeration of the blood   is,
                                                                  <U+FB01>rst
of all, to produce powerful vagus action from the medullary centre;
this    usually, though not always, accompanied in curarised animals
       is
by  diminution   of the output of the heart. But reasons are given for
assuming that the output would be increased in uncurarised animals,
owing to the high venous pressure which results from struggling.
Besides the vagu action,    itcan be shown that asphyxia causes pro
gressive weakening both of the auricles and of the ventricles, and
attention   drawn to the fact that the considerable rise of pressure
                 is
in the systemic arteries in asphyxia is accompanied by vagus effects
upon the heart, and not by augmentor action, as     the case, so far

1892.]    Cervical and Upper Thoracic Sympathetic Fibres,            <§'c. 447
vertebral canal, and the e<U+FB01>ects of the stimulation observed. The
results were as follows :—
   None of the lower cervical nerves produces any of the effects
which can   be produced     by stimulating the upper thoracic       or cervical
sympathetic; i.e., the lower cervical nerves send no e<U+FB02>t'erent visceral
<U+FB01>bres to the sympathetic.
   The pupil receives dilator <U+FB01>bres from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd thoracic
nerves. The relative eifect of these nerves upon the pupil varies
somewhat in different animals of the same species, and varies con
siderably in animals of different orders-           In the cat and dog, both
the lst and 2nd thoracic nerves cause great dilation of the pupil; in
the cat, as a rule, the 1st produces greater dilation than the 2nd
thoracic, but this is not always the case, and sometimes the 2nd is
more powerful than the 1st thoracic nerve; the 3rd thoracic nerve
has a comparatively slight action, and the extent of its action varies:
in some cases the dilation produced by it is readily observed, in others
it requires special attention.      In the rabbit, the 2nd thoracic nerve is
the chief dilator nerve    for the  pupil; the 3rd thoracic nerve produces
a considerable dilation, but less promptly than .the 2nd; the 1st
thoracic has the least action of the three, and in some cases has a
very slight effect.
   The nerve-<U+FB01>bres     causing retraction of the nictitating membrane and
opening of   the eyelids have     in the dog and rabbit the same origin as
the dilator <U+FB01>bres for the pupil. In' the cat, their origin is somewhat
more extended; a few <U+FB01>bres arise from the 4th thoracic nerve, and
occasionally a very few from the 5th thoracic nerve.
   The vase-motor <U+FB01>bres for the head*‘ari'se in the cat from the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve
thoracic nerves, in the dog from the <U+FB01>rst four, and probably to a
slight extent also from the 5th. The-lstthoraeic nerve has a slight to
moderate vase-motor e<U+FB01>ect in the dog, a less and inconstant effect in
the cat; the 2nd“ and‘ 3rd thoracic nerves: cause complete and rapid
constriction of the small arteries on the same side of the head; the
lith thoracic also causes complete contraction, but more slowly than
either the 3rd or the 2nd : in- the dog its eifect is less than in the cat;
the 5th thoracic nerve has in the cat a distinct though less effect than
the 4th; in the dog its action is dou-btfull.
    In the rabbit, the vaso-motor nerves for the ear arise from the 2nd
to the 8th thoracic nerves inclusive; the 5th nerve has usually the
most rapid effect ;. passing upwards or down-wards, the e<U+FB02>’ect decreases ;
the 2nd and 8th nerves usually cause complete constriction in a part
only of the auricular artery.
   The secretory <U+FB01>bres for the sub-maxillary gland of the cat and dog
have the same origin, as the vaso-motor <U+FB01>bres for the head. The 2nd
thoracic causes secretion more readily than any other nerve.
               * Certain parts only of the head have been observed.

    The cardiac accelerator <U+FB01>bres arise in the cat from the <U+FB01>rst four or
 <U+FB01>ve thoracic nerves; the maximum effect is obtained sometimes from
 the 2nd and sometimes from the 3rd thoracic nerve ; the 1st and the
 4th thoracic nerves have in some animals a considerable accelerator
 action, in others little or none; the 5th nerve appears occasionally to
 contain a few accelerator <U+FB01>bres, but further evidence is desirable.
     Taking into account the pilo-motor <U+FB01>bres of the cat and dog, it is
 seen that the cervical sympathetic arises in these animals from the
,<U+FB01>rst seven, and in the rabbit from the <U+FB01>rst eight, thoracic nerves ; the
 lat thoracic is, however, less represented in the cervical sympathetic
 0f the rabbit than it is in that of the cat and dog.
     Comparing the rabbit with the cat and dog, as regards sympathetic
 <U+FB01>bres, which are present in all, it results that in the cat and dog
 the <U+FB01>bres of any one kind are higher in origin, and in some cases
 present in fewer spinal nerves, than they are in the rabbit.            In accord
 ance with this, the 2nd thoracic more frequently causes a movement
 of the fore-foot in the rabbit than in the other two animals.              On the
 whole, the sympathetic <U+FB01>bres of any one kind appear to be slightly
 higher in the dog than in the cat.
     The uppermost white ramus communicans arises from the 1st
 thoracic nerve; the lowest in the dog and cat arises usually, as de
 scribed by Gaskell, from the 4th lumbar nerve; occasionally, however,
  the 5th lumbar nerve gives off a white ramus to the sympathetic.
  Both in the upper and lower regions of the spinal cord, there is
  satisfactory experimental evidence of efferent sympathetic <U+FB01>bres in
  those spinal nerves which have white rami, and in those only.                This
  is in agreement with the views of Gaskell.
     In the grey rami, medullated <U+FB01>bres of greater diameter than 41 [1.—
  and, perhaps, some of the smaller ones—are probably afferent <U+FB01>bres,
  which pass to the spinal cord by the white rami.
     A comparison of the histological characters and of the re<U+FB02>ex effects
  yielded by various parts of the sympathetic, by the depressor, and by
  the   nervus erigens, affords strong evidence that a considerable
  number of the medullated <U+FB01>bres of larger diameter than 4 ,u, although
  afferent, are not <U+FB01>bres of general sensibility.
     In the course of the paper the results of previous observers are
  given and discussed.

 hydrogen       was prepared from zinc and sulphuric, or from zinc and
 hydrochloric, acid, and was liberated upon a platinum plate, the
 generator being in fact a Smee cell, enclosed in a vessel capable of
 sustaining a vacuum, and set in action by closing the electric circuit
 at an external contact.           The hydrogen thus prepared was puri<U+FB01>ed by
 corrosive sublimate and potash, and desiccated by passage through
 a long tube packed with phosphoric anhydride.                  The oxygen was
 from chlorate ot' potash, or from mixed chlorates of potash and soda.
    In a subsequent paper on the Composition of Water,‘ attacked      I
 the problem by a direct synthesis of water from weighed quantities of
 the two component gases.              The ratio of atomic weights thus obtained
 was 15'89.
    At the time when these researches were commenced, the latest
 work bearing upon the subject dated from 1845, and the number then
 accepted was 1596.            There was, however, nothing to show that the
 true ratio really deviated from the 16:1 of Prout’s law, and the
 main object of my work was to ascertain whether or not such devia
 tion existed. About the year 1888, however, a revival of interest in
 this question manifested itself, especially in the United States, and
 several results of importance have been published.              Thus, Professor
 Cooke and Mr. T.           W.   Richards found a number which, when cor
rected for an error of weighing that had at <U+FB01>rst been overlooked,
became 15'869.
    The substantial agreement of this number with those obtained by
myself seemed at <U+FB01>rst to settle the question, but almost immediately
afterwards there appeared an account of a research by Mr. Keiser,
who used a method presenting some excellent features, and whose
result was as high as 15'949. The discrepancy has not been fully
explained, but subsequent numbers agree more nearly with the lower
value.       Thus, Noyes obtains 15'896, and Dittmar and Henderson give
15'866.
    I   had intended further to elaborate and extend my observations
on the synthesis of water from weighed quantities of oxygen and
hydrogen, but the publication of Professor E. W. Morley’s masterly
researches upon the “Volumetric Composition of Water "1” led me to
the conclusion that the best contribution that I could now make to
the subject would be by the further determination of the relative
densities of the two gases.            The combination of this with the number
20002; obtained by Morley as the mean of astonishingly concordant

   I   It should not be overlooked that this number is di<U+FB02>icult to reconcile with
views generally held as to the applicability of Avogadro’s law to very rare gases.
From what we know of the behaviour of oxygen and hydrogen gases under com
pression, it seems improbable that volumes which are as 20002 : 1 under atmo

individual experiments, would give a better result for the atomic
weights than any I could hope to obtain directly.
    In all work of this sort, the errors to be contended with may be
classed as either systematic or casual.        The latter are eliminated by
repetition,   and  are usually of no   importance in the <U+FB01>nal mean.          It is
systematic errors that are most to be dreaded.          But although directly
of but little account, casual errors greatly embarrass a research by
rendering dif<U+FB01>cult and tedious the detection of systematic errors.
Thus, in the present case, almost the only source of error that can
prejudice the <U+FB01>nal result is impurity in the gases, especially in the
hydrogen.       The better the hydrogen, the lighter it will prove; but
the discrimination is blunted by the inevitable errors of weighing.
After perhaps a week’s work it may become clear that the hydrogen
is a little at fault, as happened' in one case from penetration                 of
nitrogen between the sealed-in platinum electrodes and the glass of
the generator.
    Another di<U+FB02>iculty, which a<U+FB01>ects the presentation of results, turns
upon the one-sided character of the errors. most to- be feared.                As
has been said, impure hydrogen can only be too heavy, and another
important source of error, depending upon imperfect establishment of
equilibrium of' pressure between the contents of the globe and the
external atmosphere, also- works one-sidedly in the same direction.
The latter source of error is most to be feared immediately after a
re-greasing of the tap of the globe.        The super<U+FB02>uous grease <U+FB01>nds its
way into the perforation of the plug, and partially blocks the passage.
so that the six minutes usually allowed for the escape of the initial
excess    of pressure in the globe may become inadequate.                 Partly
from this cause and partly from incomplete washing out of nitrogen
from the generator, the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>lling of a set was so often found ab
normally heavy that it became a rule in all cases to reject it.            From
these and other causes, such as accidental leakages not discovered at
the time, it was. dif<U+FB01>cult to secure a set of determinations in which
the mean really represented the most probable value.               At the same
time, any arbitrary rejection of individual results must be avoided as
                                                 '
far as possible.
   In the present work two objects have been especially kept in view.
The <U+FB01>rst is simplicity upon the chemical side, and the second the use
of materials in such a form that the elimination of impurities goes
forward in the normal‘ working of the process. When, as in the
former determinations, the hydrogen is made from zinc, any im
purity which that material may contain and communicate to the gas
cannot be eliminated from the generator;               for each experiment
spheric conditions would remain as 2 z 1 upon inde<U+FB01>nite expansion.   According to
the formula of Van der Waals, a greater change than this in the ratio of volumes
is to be expected.

 brings into play a fresh quantity of zinc, with its accompanying con
 tamination.      Moreover, the supply of acid that can be included in
 one charge of the generator is inadequate, and good results are only
 obtained as the charge is becoming exhausted.               These dif<U+FB01>culties are
 avoided when zinc is discarded.          The only material consumed during
 the experiments is then the water, of which a large quantity can be
 included from the <U+FB01>rst. On the other hand, the hydrogen liberated
 is necessarily contaminated with oxygen, and this must be removed
 by copper contained in a red-hot tube.              In the experiments to be
 described the generator was charged with potash,* and the gases
 were liberated at platinum electrodes.             In the case of a hydrogen
 <U+FB01>lling  the  oxygen    blew  off  on  one  side  from   a mercury seal, and on
 the other the hydrogen was conveyed through hot tubes containing
 copper.    The bulk of the aqueous vapour was deposited in a small
<U+FB02>ask containing strong solution of potash, and the gas then passed
over solid potash to a long tube packed with phosphoric anhydride.
Of this only a very short length showed signs of being affected at the
close of all operations.
    With respect to impurities, other than oxygen and oxides of
hydrogen, which may contaminate the gas, we have the following
alternative.     Either the impurity is evolved much more rapidly than
in proportion to the consumption of water in the generator, or it is not.
If the rate of evolution of the impurity, reckoned as a fraction of the
quantity originally present, is not much more rapid than the corre
spondingly reckoned consumption of water, the presence of the im
purity will be of little importance.             If on the other hand, as is
probable, the rate of evolution is much more rapid than the con
sumption of water, the impurity is soon eliminated from the residue,
and the gas subsequently generated becomes practically pure.                     A
similar argument holds good if the source of the impurity be in the
copper, or even in the phosphoric anhy dride ; and it applies with in
creased force when at the close of one set of' operations the generator
is replenished by the mere addition of water.                It is, however, here
assumed that the apparatus itself is perfectly tight.
    Except for the reversal of the electric current, the action of the
apparatus is almost the same whether oxygen or hydrogen is to be
collected.     In the latter case the copper in the hot tubes is in the re_
duced, and in the former case in the oxidised, state. For the sake of
distinctness we will suppose that the globe is to be <U+FB01>lled with
hydrogen.
    The generator itself (<U+FB01>g. 1) is of the U-form, with unusually long
branches, and it is supplied from Grove cells with about 3 amperes
of electric current.      Since on one side the oxygen blows 0E into the

 air, the pressure in the generator is always nearly atmospheric. Some
 trouble has been caused by leakage between the platinum electrodes
 and the glass. In the later experiments to be here recorded these
joints were drowned with mercury.              On leaving the generator the
 hydrogen    traverses a red-hot  tube  of  hard  glass charged with copper<U+FB01>“
 then a <U+FB02>ask containing a strong solution of potash, and afterwards a
 second similar hot tube.       The additional tube was introduced with
 the idea  that  the action  of  the hot copper in promoting the union
 of the hydrogen with its oxygen contamination might be more com
 plete after removal of the greater part of the oxygen, whether in the
 combined or in the uncomhined state.           From this point onward the
 gas was nearly dry.      In the earlier experiments the junctions of the
 hard furnace tubes with the soft glass of the remainder of the ap
 paratus were effected by fusion.      One of these joints remained in use,
but the others were replaced by india-rubber connexions drowned in
mercury.     It is believed that no leakage occurred at these joints;
but as an additional security a tap was provided between the
generator and the furnace, and was kept closed whenever there was
no forward current of hydrogen.               In this way the liquid in the
generator would be protected from any possible in<U+FB01>ltration of
nitrogen.     Any that might <U+FB01>nd its way into the furnace tubes could
easily be removed before the commencement of a <U+FB01>lling.

  at a tap which for distinctness may be called the regulator.         In the
  generator and in the furnace tubes the pressure must be nearly atmo
  spheric, but in the globe there is (at the commencement) a vacuum.
  The transition from the one pressure to the other takes place at the
  regulator,   which must    be so adjusted    that the <U+FB02>ow through it is
  approximately equal to the production of gas.       At <U+FB01>rst the manipula
  tion of the regulator was a source of trouble and required almost con
  stant attention, but a very simple addition gave the desired control.
  This was merely a long wooden arm, attached to the plug, which
  served both as a lever and as an indicator.      Underneath the pointed
  extremity was a small table to which its motions could be referred.
  During the <U+FB01>rst two-thirds of       a <U+FB01>lling very little readjustment was
  needed,   and the apparatus could be left for half an hour with but
  little fear of displacing too much the liquid in the generator. Towards
  the close, as the motive force fell off, the tap required to be opened
  more widely.      Sometimes the recovery of level could be more con
  veniently effected by insertion of resistance into the electric circuit,
  or by interrupting it altogether for a few minutes.         Into details of
'
  this kind it is hardly necessary to go further.
     From the regulator the gas passed to the desiccating tubes. The
  <U+FB01>rst of these was charged with fragments of solid potash, and the
  second with a long length of phosphoric anhydride.          Finally, a tube
  stuffed with glass wool intercepted any suspended matter that might
  have been carried forward.
      The connexion of the globe with the generator, with the Toppler,
  and with the blow-off, is shown in the accompanying <U+FB01>g. 2.           On the
  morning of a projected <U+FB01>lling the vacuous globe would be connected
  with the free end of the stout-walled india-rubber tube, and secured
  by binding wire.      The generator being cut off, a high vacuum would
  be made up to the tap of the globe.        After a couple of hours’ stand~
  ing the leakage through the india-rubber and at the joints could be
  measured.      The amount of the leakage found in the <U+FB01>rst two hours
  was usually negligible, considered as an addition to a globeful of
  hydrogen, and the leakage that would occur in the hours following
  would (in the absence of accidents) be still smaller. If the test were
  satisfactory, the <U+FB01>lling would proceed as follows :—
      The electric current through the generator being established and
  the furnace being heated, any oxygen that might have percolated into
  the drying tubes had <U+FB01>rst to be washed out.            In order to do this
  more effectively, a moderate   vacuum   (of pressure equal to about 1 inch
  of mercury) was maintained in the tubes and up to the regulator by
  the action of the pump.      In this way the current of gas is made very
  rapid, and the half hour allowed must have been more than suf<U+FB01>cient
  for the purpose.     The generator was then temporarily out off, and a
  high vacuum produced in the globe connexion and in the blow-o<U+FB02>’

tube, which, being out of the main current of gas, might be supposed
to harbour impurities. After this the pump would be cut off, the
connexion with the generator re-established, and, <U+FB01>nally, the tap of
the globe cautiously opened.
   The operation of <U+FB01>lling usually occupied from two to three hours.
When the gas began to blow off under an excess of pressure repre
sented by about half an inch of mercury, the blow-01f cistern was
lowered so as to leave the extremity of the tube free.          For two
minutes the current of gas from the generator was allowed to <U+FB02>ow
through, after which the generator was cut off, and the globe left in
simple  communication with the atmosphere, until it was supposed
that equilibrium of pressure had been suf<U+FB01>ciently established. Doubts
have at various times been felt as to the interval required for this
purpose.   If too little time is allowed, there will remain an excess of
pressure in the globe, and the calculated weight of the <U+FB01>lling will
come out too high.     On the other hand, an undue prolongation of the
time might lead to a diffusion of air back into the globe. In a special
experiment no abnormal weight was detected after half an hour’s
communication, so that the danger on this side appeared to be small.
When the passages through the taps were free from grease, one or

was always a possibility of a partial obstruction.        In the results to be
presently given four minutes were allowed after          the  separation from
the generator.      It may be remarked that a part of any minute error
that may arise from this source will be eliminated in the comparison
with oxygen, which was collected under like conditions.
   The reading of the barometers and thermometers at the moment
when the tap of the globe was turned 01f took place as described in
the former paper.        The arrangements for the weighings were also
the same.                                                                 .
   In the evacuations the process was always continued until, as
tested by the gauge of the Toppler after at least a quarter of an
hour’s standing, the residue could be neglected.            Here, again, any
minute    error would      be  eliminated    in the comparison    of the two
gases.
   In  the case of oxygen, the errors due to contamination (even with
hydrogen) are very much diminished, and similar errors of weighing
tell very much less upon the proportional agreement of the <U+FB01>nal
numbers.      A comparison of the actual results with the two kinds of
gas does not, however, show so great an advantage on the side of the
oxygen as might have been expected.             The inference appears to be
that the individual results are somewhat largely alfected by tempera
ture errors.       Two thermometers were, indeed, used (on opposite
sides)   within the   wooden box by which the globe is surrounded, and
they  could   easily  be read to within £6" C. But in other respects, the
circumstances were unfavourable in consequence of the presence in
the same room of the furnace necessary to heat the copper.                   An
error of i0'1° C. in the temperature leads to a. discrepancy of 1 part
in 1500 in the <U+FB01>nal numbers.              Some further elaboration of the
screening arrangements actually employed would have been an im
provement, but inasmuch as the circumstances were precisely the
same for the two gases, no systematic error can here arise.                 The
thermometers were, of course, the same in the two cases.
   The experiments are grouped in <U+FB01>ve sets, two for oxygen and three
for hydrogen.      In each set the work was usually continued until the
tap of the globe required re-greasing, or until, owing to a breakage or
to some other accident, operations had to be suspended.

   In almost every    case the          weight of the globe full is compared with
the mean of the immediately                preceding and following weights empty.
The numbers recorded in the second column are derived from the
readings of the balance by the introduction of corrections—
   (1.) For the errors of the weights themselves, found by a sys
tematic comparison, only relative values uncorrected for buoyancy
being required.
   (2.) For the deviation of the mean* barometric reading at the time
of <U+FB01>lling from 30 inches (as read upon the veruier).
  .(3.) For the deviation of the temperature of the barometers
(Column 3) from 6J° F.
   (4.) For the deviation of the temperature of the gas (as read upon
the thermometers) from 12° C.
   As an example,    I  will take in detail the calculation for the hydro
gen filling of October 26.                After the evacuation of October 24, the
worsiug globe (14) with its compensating                          volume piece and

458                              Lord Rayleigh.           On the               [Feb.   18,
0'4778 gram stood on the left of the balance with globe (11) on the
 right.     The position of equilibrium of the pointer, as determined
after four di<U+FB02>ferent releasements, each observed in the usual manner.
was 1902 scale divisions.                  In like manner, after the evacuation of
 October 27, with the same weights in use, the equilibrium position of
the pointer was 18'46. After the <U+FB01>lling of October 26, the weights
associated with (14) were 0'3220 gram, instead of 0'4778; and the
pointer reading was 2008.                   So far as the weights are concerned, the
value of the hydrogen would be 04778—03220, or 01558 gram; but
to this we must add a correction corresponding to 1'34: scale divisions,
being the difference between 20-08 and §(19'02+18‘46). At the time
in question, the value of a. scale division was 0'00020 gram, so that
we obtain-—
                                01558 + 0‘00027 = 0'15607.
    The particular weights in use on this occasion were such that no
correction is necessary in order to allow for their errors.
    The mean barometer reading at the time of <U+FB01>lling was 29'742. so
that the factor required on this account is 30 : 29'742.                    The correc
tion for temperature of gas is from 133 to 12°.

   To this   a correction          for the temperature of the barometer has still
to be applied.           For    1°   F. the correcting factor is (1—0'000089), or
for 5° F. (1—0'000445).                    From 015814 we are thus to subtract
0'00007, giving the tubular number 015807.
   A further minute correction to the mean of each set may be made
for the temperature of the glass. A warm globe is larger than a cold
one, and consequently holds more gas.                          If we suppose that the
volume expansion of the glass per degree C. is 0000025, we <U+FB01>nd,

   The means here exhibited give the weights of the two gases as they
would be found with the globe at 12° 0., and the barometers at 60° F.
and at 30 inches.             The close agreement of the, mean temperatures for
the two gases shows how little room there is for systematic error de
pendent upon imperfections iu the barometers and thermometers.                          But
the results still require modi<U+FB01>cation before they                can   be compared     with
the view of deducing the relative densities of the gases.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, there is a systematic, though minute, difference in
the pressures hitherto considered as corresponding.                      The terminal of
the blow-off tube is 33'inches below the centre of the globe at the time
of <U+FB01>lling.      In the one case this is Occupied by hydrogen, and in the
other by oxygen.              If we treat the latter as the standard, we must
regard the hydrogen <U+FB01>llings as taking place under an excess of pres

and this must be compared with 30 inches of mercury.                        Hence, if we
take the sp. gr. of oxygen under atmospheric conditions at 00014,
and that of mercury at 13'6, the excess of pressure under which the
hydrogen was collected is as a fraction of the whole pressure

      The agreement is satisfactory, especially when it is remembered
   that both gases were prepared by diiferent methods in the two sets of
   experiments.—Feb. 17.]
      But there is still another and a more important correction to be
   introduced.    In my former paper it was shown that when the weigh
   ings are conducted in air the true weight of the gas contained in the
   globe is not given by merely subtracting the weight of the globe
   when empty from the weight when full.            When the globe is empty,
   its external volume is less than when full, and thus, in order to obtain
   the true weight, the apparent weight of the gas must be increased by
  the weight of air whose volume is equal to the change of volume of
   the globe.
      In order to determine the amount of this change of volume, the
   globe is <U+FB01>lled to the neck with recently boiled distilled water, and
.  the eifect is observed upon the level in the stem due to a suction of,
   say, 20 inches of mercury.        It is not advisable to carry the exhaus
   tion much further for fear of approaching too nearly the point at
   which bubbles of vapour- may be formed internally. In the earlier
   experiments, described in the preliminary note, the upper surface of
   the liquid was in the stem of the globe itself (below the tap), and
  the only di<U+FB02>iculty lay in the accurate estimation of a change of
   volume occurring in a wide and somewhat irregular tube.                   The
  method employed was to produce, by introduction of a weighed
  quantity of mercury, a rise of level equal to that caused by the
  suction.                         .
      The advantage of this procedure lay in the avoidance of joints
  and of the tap itself, but, for the reasons given, the readings were
  not quite so accurate as might be desired.             I wished, therefore, to
  supplement,    if possible,  the   former   determination    by one in which
  the change of volume occurred in a tube narrower and of better
  shape.    With this object in view, the stem of the globe was prolonged
  by    a graduated tubular pipette attached with the aid of india
  rubber. The tubes themselves were treated with gutta-percha cement,
  and brought almost into contact.          It had hardly been expected that
  the joint would prove unyielding under the applied suction, but it
  was considered that the amount of the yielding could be estimated
  and allowed for by operations conducted with tag: closed.          The eVent,
  however, proved that the yielding at the joint was scarcely, if at all,
  perceptible.
      The pipette, of bore such that 16 cm. corresponded to 1 0.0., was
  graduated to 0'01, and was read by estimation to 0001 0.0.            In order
  the better to eliminate the changes due to temperature, readings
  under atmospheric pressure, and under a suction of 20 inches of mer
  cury, were alternated.      On January 28, 1892, a <U+FB01>rst set gave 0'648—
  0300 = 0'348, a second gave 0'6645—0'316 = 0'3485 and a third gave

1892.]         Relaiire Densities of Hydrogen and Oxygen.                      461
0675—0326 = 0349.             Similar operations with tap closed‘l‘ gave no
visible movement.
    The result of the day’s experiments was thus 03485 for 20 inches,
or 0.523 for 30 inches, suction. Similar experiments on January 28,
at a di<U+FB01>erent part of the graduation, gave 0526. On this day the
yielding with tap closed was just visible, and was estimated at 0001.
 As a mean result, we may adopt 05241 0.0. The graduation of the
pipette was subsequently veri<U+FB01>ed by weighing a thread of mercury
that occupied a measured length.
    A part of the above-measured volume is due to the expansion of
the water when the pressure is relieved.                \Ve may take this at
0'000047 of the volume per atmosphere.              The volume itself may be
 derived with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy for the present purpose from the
weight of its oxygen contents.              It is 2'517/0'00137, or 1837 cc.
 The expansion of the water per atmosphere is thus 0'000047 X 1837, or
0087 0.0. This is to be subtracted from 0524:, and leaves 0437 0.0.
This number applies strictly to the volume enclosed within the glass,
 but the change in the external volume of the globe            will be almost the
samesl'
    The correction now under consideration is thus the weight of
0437 0.0. of air at the average temperature of the balance room.
The density of this air may be estimated at 000122; so that the
 weight of 0437 0.0. is 0000533 gram.              This is the quantity which
must be added to the apparent weights of the gases.                  The former
estimate was 0'00056 gram.               The <U+FB01>nally corrected weights are
thus
                      H=     0158531,          0 = 2‘51777;
 and for the ratio of densities we have
                                      15-882.
This corresponds to a mean atmospheric condition of pressure and
temperature.
    If we combine the above ratio of densities with Professor Morley‘s.
ratio of volumes, viz., 2'0002zl, we get, as the ratio of atomic
weights, 15'880.
    If we refer to the table, we see that the agreement of the <U+FB01>rst and
   * For greater security the tap was turned while the interior was under suction.
   t For a spherical shell of glass of uniform thickness and with elastic constants
following Poisson’s law, the ratio of the difference of the internal and external
expansion to either of them is 4t/3a, where t is the thickness of the shell, and a
the mean radius. In the present application the value of w/t, deduced from the
measured circumference and from the weight of glass, is about 110.
   [Perhaps an arrangement in which the external volume is directly measured
would have been preferable. No allowance for expansion of water would then be
needed—Feb. 17.]

third series of hydrogen weighings is very good, but that the mean
from the second series is decidedly lighter. This may have been in
part fortuitous, but it is scarcely probable that it was so altogether.
Under the circumstances we can hardly reckon the accuracy of the
<U+FB01>nal results as closer than §5155.
  A word should perhaps be said upon a possible source of systematic
error, viz., mercury vapour.       There is no doubt that hydrogen
passed over mercury takes up enough to cause a slow and super<U+FB01>cial,
but quite distinct, discoloration of sulphur over which it subsequently
<U+FB02>ows.    In the experiments here recorded, the gas did not, indeed,
<U+FB02>ow over mercury in mass, but, inasmuch as mercury was used to
secure the tightness of some of the joints, it is di<U+FB01>icult to feel sure of
its absence.  Again, in evacuations conducted with a mercury pump
can the vacuum be regarded as free from mercury vapour, which, it
must be remembered, would not show itself upon the gauge of the
                                                       ”
Toppler? If both the hydrogen and the vacuum
                                            “             were saturated
with mercury vapour, the result of the weighings would, according to
Dalton’s law, be free from its in<U+FB02>uence.      Thesame may be said of
any volatile impurity arising from the grease“ upon the stopcocks.
As the matter stands, the results must, I think, be regarded as a<U+FB01>ected
with a possible error amounting to a fraction of the weight of mercury
vapour at the temperatures employed.       But this is probably a very       v
small quantity.
   According to Hertz<U+FB02>" the vapour-pressure of mercury at 15° C.
would be about O'OOl mm. If this be correct, the weight of mercury
vapour in an atmosphere of hydrogen would be as a fraction of the

     In  conclusion,     I  must express my obligations to Mr. Gordon, who
has assisted me throughout.               The work has been unusually tedious,
partly    from    its  inherent    nature,   requiring as it does a certainty of
0‘1 milligram in the weighings, and still more from the constant
liability to accidents, which may render nugatory a large amount of
preparatory       work.

       D.C.L., LL.D., . F.R.S., and Mrs. HUGGINS.              Received
       February 24, 1892.
    We have delayed up to the present time presenting any account of
 our observations of Nova Auriga), in the constant hope that <U+FB01>ne
 weather would enable us to make our observations more complete.
 We think now, however, that it may be of interest without further
 delay to send a short preliminary notice of this remarkable, and, in
 some respects, unprecedented, celestial phenomenon.      For up to this
 time we have no record of a star in the spectrum of which the bright
and dark lines of the same substances have been regarded as indi
cating respectively motions of approach and of recession of so great
magnitude.     It was partly for this reason that we were anxious for
the opportunity of observing if any change in the amount of relative
motion would show itself.
    We received a telegram from Dr. Copeland in the early morning
of the 2nd instant, and began our observations of the star on the
night of the 2nd instant.
    Perhaps the most noticeable feature to the eye in the star’s
spectrum was the great brilliancy of the hydrogen lines at C, F, and
G; but the point of greatest interest was obviously that two of these
lines, F and G—and we have since observed the same with C—were
accompanied each by a strong absorption line on the side towards the
blue.    Comparison with the lines of terrestrial hydrogen, while con
<U+FB01>rming the obvious presumption that the star- lines were really those
of hydrogen, showed at once a large motion of recession of the bright
lines and a motion of approach of a similar order of magnitude of the
hydrogen which produced the absorption.
   A photograph which we have since taken gives the star’s spectrum
as far in the ultra-violet as about 7» 3200.   On this plate we see not
only the other hydrogen lines at h and H, but also the series beyond,

    which is characteristic of the white stars, bright, with dark absorp
    tion lines on the blue side.
      Besides the hydrogen   series there appear to be other lines doubled
    in a similar manner, including the sodium lines at D. The line K,
    which is at least as strongly impressed upon the plate as H, is not
    followed by so strong an absorption.
       In the green part of the spectrum three very brilliant lines are seen
I
    on the red side of F. One of these falls not far from the position of
    the chief nebular line; but even when the shift of the spectrum is
    taken into account, we can scarcely regard this line as the true
    nebular line.    In this connexion it was a point of some importance
     to <U+FB01>nd that the strong and very characteristic       line of the Orion
    nebula, which falls about 7t 3725, is absent in our photograph of the
    Nova, also the strong line between a and B at about 7t 3868.
        [The third line from F is rather broad and resolvable into lines.
    It falls partly upon the more refrangible pair of the magnesium
    triplet at b, but its character and position do not permit us to ascribe
    it either to magnesium or carbon—Feb. 25.]
       We wish to mention an early photograph of this star taken on the
    3rd instant by Father Sidgreaves, at Stonyhurst, which we had the
    privilege of examining.      This successful photograph extends from
    about It to near D, and shows the remarkable doubling of many of
    the bright lines by dark ones, a feature which was at once noticed by
    Father Sidgreaves and ourselves.
       In our photograph the spectrum of the star, which extends on the
    plate as far into the ultra-violet as our photographs of Sirius, is
    crowded throughout its entire length with dark and bright lines.      In
    the visible region the number of bright lines and group, including
    the double line of sodium, a <U+FB01>ne line about the position of D3, and
    lines on both sides of C, id also very great.
       We prefer in this preliminary note not to enter into any more de
    tailed discussion of the star’s spectrum, nor to refer to the probable
    phenomena which may now be in progress in this celestial body. YVe
    reserve these considerations for the present.
    II. “Note    on   the New Star in Auriga.”      By         .1.   NORMAN
          LOGKYER,    F.R.S. Received February 25, 1892.
      Since my note of February 11, observations of the new star have
    only been possible at Kensington on seven evenings, namely,
    February 11, 12, 13, 16, 22, 23, and 24s. The 13th and 22nd were
    the only two very <U+FB01>ne nights.
      The star now appears to be fading.     In the photograph of the
    region taken on February  3 the Nova appeared to be brighter than

1892.]              Note   on the ZVew Star in Auriga.                467
X Aurigee    (mag. 5‘0), but in that taken on February 23 it is not
brighter   than  the companion to this star, which is fainter than 6th
magnitude.     No marked diminution in brightness was noticed before
February 22.
   The colour has not appreciably changed since the star was <U+FB01>rst
observed.
   Photographs of the spectrum were attempted on all the dates
named. Those of February 11, 12, 16, and 23, however, were insuf<U+FB01>
ciently exposed, but they show that the dark lines were still more
refrangible than the accompanying bright ones, and that the same
lines were present as in the previous photographs.          A plate was
exposed for 2 hours 35 minutes on February 24!, but no impression
was obtained.      The photograph taken on February 13 is identical
with those referred to in the notes which I have already commu
nicated to the Society.       In the three photographs of February 22
there appears   to be a slight diminution in the intensity of the H and
K lines, but otherwise there is no decided change.
   There is no evidence of revolution during the twenty days of
observation.    In all the photographs the dark lines are more refran
gible than the bright ones, and the relative velocity deduced from
those of February 3, 7, l3, and 22 appears to be about 600 miles per
second.     As this only represents the velocity in the line of sight, we
are still ignorant of the real velocities of the two bodies.    The con
stant relative velocity    indicated by  the displacement of the bright
and dark lines may be regarded as con<U+FB01>rming the supposition that
two meteor-swarms or comets have collided, the velocities being so
great, and the masses so small, that neither was captured by the
other.
   The relative velocity of 600 miles per second seems at <U+FB01>rst sight
to be abnormally great, but, if we regard each of the component
swarms as moving at the rate of 300 miles per second, the velocities
are quite comparable with those of other bodies in space.        The star
1830, Groombridge, for example, moves at the rate of 200 miles per
second across the line of sight, and its real velocity may be much
greater.
   Eye observations have been made on every possible occasion. The
chief variations from those previously reported are the general fading
of the continuous spectrum and the consequent unmasking of the
lines between b and D. MicrOmetric measures of four new lines in
this region were made by Mr. Fowler on February 23 and 24. These,
with the other lines observed at Kensiugton in the region F to C,
are shown in the table which follows.           The corresponding lines
observed in the spectra of new stars which have previously appeared,
and those in the spectra of some of the bright line stars, are added for
comparison.

   It will be seen   that all the lines of Nova Aurigae have previously
been recorded   in other Novas, or in the bright-line stars.
   The complete spectrum, including the photographic region, was
shown in the diagram exhibited on the screen. This, and the light
curve of the spectrum from F to C, was drawn by Mr. Fowler and
Mr. W. J. Lockyer, on February 22, and con<U+FB01>rmed by Mr. Fowler on
February 23. The 3-foot re<U+FB02>ector and McClean spectroscope were
employed in each case.
   The changes which are taking place in the Nova are exactly what
would be expected according to my hypothesis, that new stars are
produced by the collision of meteor-swarms.          The rapid fading of
the star demonstrates that small masses and not large ones are en
gaged, and this is further con<U+FB01>rmed by the observed diminution in
the brightness of the continuous spectrum relatively to the bright
lines.   If two condensed bodies were in collision, it is evident that
the lines would fade <U+FB01>rst.

       F.R.S., Professor of Botany in the Owens College,'Man
       chester. Received January 18, 1892.
                                 (Abstract)
   The author recalls attention to the discovery by the late Rev. W.
Vernon Harcourt of a fragment of a Lepidodendroid branch, in which
the internal structures were well preserved.          The specimen was
described and <U+FB01>gured, <U+FB01>rst by Witham, who gave to it the well-known
name of Lepidoderulron Harcourt/Ti.     It was next described by Lindley
and Hutton, in their ‘Fossil Flora,’ and still later, and more scienti<U+FB01>
cally, by Brongniart, in his ‘Végétaux Fossiles.’          In its interior
Brongniart found a single vascular cylinder encasing a medulla.        At
a later period he obtained fragments of two other plants, in each
of which he found the above cylinder, but invested by a second one
which was obviously an exogenous product of a cambium zone.
From these three specimens he unfortunately concluded that the <U+FB01>rst
belonged to a Cryptogamic Lycopod, whilst the second and third were
 Gymnospermous Phanerogams.           These latter examples he further
identi<U+FB01>ed with his genus Sigillar'ia.
   This classi<U+FB01>cation was universally accepted by the palieobotanical
world until 1871, when, in his Memoir, Part II, the author announced
his    conviction that Lepidodendra         and Sigillariaa were alike
Cryptogams, and that the exogenous zone supposed to be characteristic
of the Phanerogams was not con<U+FB01>ned, in ancient times, to that great
division of the vegetable kingdom.

   Apart from this general question, new conclusively settled, further
knowledge of L. Harcourtfi has long been sought for in vain.                  Har
court’s original fragment was unfortunately an imperfect one. Its outer
cortex and foliage were wholly wanting, as well as specimens illus
trating its various stages of growth.v Recently, however, a very <U+FB01>ne
series of such specimens has come into the hands of the author, and
a large amount of new information has been obtained from them.
Some of the new examples are very young branches, perfectly in
vested by their bark and leaves.          The detailed structures of all the
organs of these specimens are now described in minute detail. A
more exact technical nomenclature than has hitherto been employed
is applied to their various structures.           Besides these young forms,
other specimens resembling that studied by Brongniart, both as
regards condition and apparent age, have been obtained, and also one
magni<U+FB01>cent older and arborescent example, from Airdrie, in Scotland,
which, including all its leaves, has been between four and <U+FB01>ve inches
in diameter.
    But even this latter specimen presents no appearance of the
secondary or exogenous vascular zone so common amongst other much
younger Lepidodendra.         Hence the author concludes that L. Harcourtii
has in this respect been like L. Wunsch'ianum, the well-known Arran
species. in which a magni<U+FB01>cent            exogenous zone exists, but which
was only developed when the plants attained to an advanced arbor
escent condition.
    Some of these youngest specimens show evidence that they had
been fructigerous twigs.          But, before describing these, the author
examines anew the entire subject of the branches to which the names
of Halom'a and Ulodendron have been applied.                Both of these have
now been proved        to have been fruit-bearing branches, but their true
relations to each       other and to their parent plants are still in a
state of serious       confusion.    The existing de<U+FB01>nitions of these two
types are shown        to be altogether unsatisfactory; some specimens
which according to one generally accepted de<U+FB01>nition are Haloniae
according to another are Ulodendra.                 In fact the two sets of
de<U+FB01>nitions     overlap    in such   a manner     as renders     them   no   longer
applicable.
    Two classes of facts have to be considered here; <U+FB01>rst, the positions
and arrangements of the reproductive fructi<U+FB01>cations on the support
ing branches, and, secondly, the nature of the scars left on the
exterior of the bark after these deciduous fructi<U+FB01>cations fell to the
ground.       The positions of these scars in Ulodend'ron are usually
de<U+FB01>ned as biserial, being arranged in two longitudinal rows,"ll one on
each side of the sustaining             branch, whilst in Halonia these

 such rows.

 1892.]          of the Fossil Plants of the    Coal-Measures.             471
 rows are de<U+FB01>ned as being more numerous, and the scars quincuncially
 arranged.      In Ulodendron each such scar is further surrounded
 by  a large  circular, or oval, and very characteristic disk. The author.
shows that the essential and homologous structure in all these fruit
bearing branches is a small circular area, forming the summit
of a larger or smaller conical arrested branch which was covered
with leaves. This small apical area represents the part at which
the deciduous fructi<U+FB01>cation was organically united with its sustain
ing branch.        Each such branch was supplied with a distinctive
form of vascular bundle, which diifered alike from those larger ones
seen    in ordinary vegetative branches, and from the smaller             ones
passing outwards to the leaves; this bundle is always abruptly
broken oif at the extreme apex of the fructigerons tubercle in a way
demonstrating that it was formerly prolonged into some deciduous
appendage which is rarely preserved in situ.          But Ulodendron has, in
addition, surrounding each of these fruit-bearing points, a <U+FB02>attened
surface, the size of which was mainly dependent upon the age to which
the tree had attained when it perished.          This orbicular surface was
primarily covered      with ordinary leaves, normally arranged, but the full
development of which was arrested by the pressure of some external
agent.      The author concludes that the central fructigerous point was
homologous in all these cases, and that the variations seen in them
arose largely from the degree of prominence attained by the arrested
lateral branch.      When that prominence was suf<U+FB01>cient, the cone-like
fruit was pedunculate, and no disturbance of the surrounding leaves
was produced; but when that elevation was small, or almost non
existent, the cone was practically sessile, and, as it grew, its expanding
base crushed down the leaves which         it covered and thus produced the
large   <U+FB02>attened   disk characteristic  of  Ulodendmn.    These two names,
Halom'a and Ulodendron, have no longer any generic value, but the
terms Halonial and Ulodendroid may be conveniently retained as
adjectives applicable to appropriate speci<U+FB01>c forms.
    The author applies these conclusions to his younger specimens of
L. Harcourti'i, and shows that many of them were fructigerous in the
Halonial form.
    The organisation of the leaves of some of these Lepidodendroid
plants has been re-examined.          As is well known, on the
                                                                    leaf-scars
alike of Lep'idodendron and of Sigillam'a, each scar left on the bark
after the fall of the deciduous leaf had three minute points impressed
upon its surface. Brongniart regarded each of the three as represent
ing the entrance of a leaf-trace into the leaf, and very recently some
other observers have arrived at the same conclusion.        The author, long
ago, showed that the central spot alone represented the vascular
leaf-trace, the two lateral ones being merely cellular structures, but
the details of which were very imperfectly known. These new speoi~

mens demonstrate the exact features of these structures.          Professor
Bertrand, of Lille, and M. Hovelacque, of Paris, have simultaneously
investigated the two lateral points on the leaf-scar, to which the
former author has given the name of parichnos, which name Pro
fessor Williamson adopts.         But these two palmontologists have
further called attention to a fourth structure in these leaves, hitherto.
in some degree, overlooked; and which they designated the ligule.
The author <U+FB01>nds this organ well developed both in L. Harcourt'ii
and in Lep'idophloios, but rejects the name ligule, on the ground
that he cannot identify the fossil structure with the organ bearing
 the same name in living Isoetes and Selaginellae.           He, therefore,
adopts    for the  former  the term  Adenoid   organ, believing  it to have
had glandular functions.       Details are also given of the organisation
of several forms of Lepidostrobi, some of which are identi<U+FB01>ed with
their parent plants.
    The general conclusion arrived at' by the author in reference to
the L. Harcourtii, which has been so often made the subject of
debate during the last twenty years, is that it occupies no exceptional
position amongst the other Lepidodendra, but that whilst palaeon
tologists in various parts of the world quote the species as one with
the organisation of which they were familiar, they were all alike mis
taken in their determinations.       Until now no specimen of the same
plant   has been  in  the possession of any observer less imperfect than
that described by Brongniart; hence, when in the past authors have,
as was my own case, referred various examples of cortex, leaves, and
fruits to Lepidodendron Harcourt'ii, we have no evidence whatever
that such references are true ones.
    If such references are still declared to  be authoritative, I must ask
where the specimens are to be seen      that carry our knowledge beyond
what we derived from Harcourt’s imperfect branch.
   IV. “ On Biologic Regions and Tabulation Areas.”             By   C. B.
            CLARKE, F.R.S.       Received February     8, 1892.
                                 ( Abstract.)
    Biologic regions have been used for two purposes, viz.: (1) to ex
hibit the most natural primary divisions of the globe, so far as the
distribution of existing Mammalia (or of plants or living things) is
concerned; (2) as areas of reference on which the complete distribu
tion of a large genus or order of plants or animals may be tabulated.
    It is clearly of the highest importance that one set of areas of
reference should be employed by all naturalists, as foreseen by Mr.
Wallace when he devised his primary zoologic regions and sub-regions.
 If one naturalist tabulates one order of Butterflies on one geographic

1892.]           ()n Biologic Regimw and Tabulation Areas.             473
framework,      and another naturalist tabulates another order of Butter
<U+FB02>ies on a different geographic framework, the results of the two
naturalists can only be combined by doing the tabulation all over
again, instead of by a simple addition.
    Naturalists have not agreed on one system of primary reference
areas; and, consequently, it is not possible to combine the results
attained by different writers.
    The <U+FB01>rst reason why naturalists have not accepted Wallace’s
recommendation is that his regions do not appear the most natural
to many naturalists; Professor Huxley, Dr. Giinther, and numerous
botanists have proposed widely different regions as more natural.
A   second reason why these regions have not been used for tabulations
is that their boundaries are (in many important cases) not accurately
de<U+FB01>ned.
    I  have been for eighteen months past making trial of various
geographic frameworks         on which to tabulate the distribution of
 2000 species of plants;        and I have constructed a considerable
 number of maps, and have executed trial tabulations of a few genera
 on them.      I have arrived at one conclusion which I deem of su<U+FB02>icient
 importance to bring before this Society, viz., that the two objects
 hitherto confounded in the designing of biologic regions must be kept
entirely separate. Biologic regions representing the natural distribu
 tion of Mammalia or of life are not convenient to use as tabulation
 areas. I may venture to say, indeed, that the more perfectly natural
 the biologic regions are, and the more complex and detailed their
 boundary    lines, the more impossible     they are to use as   reference
 areas  or as tabulation areas on any considerable scale.
    The idea of biologic regions presupposes a geographic framework
of some kind on which the area of each genus of animals or plants
 was previously plotted.        It appears to me that all naturalists,
zoologists, botanists, and palaeontologists, might easily agree to use
one system of tabulation areas.       Out of the results attained on this
system, they might construct various biologic regions, each to please
                                                                    ‘
himself.
    I have constructed, as a reference map for my own tabulations, the
Map B. I would urge naturalists to use this, or that a committee be
appointed to design a better, which should be put out by authority.
    This Map B I have gradually arriVed at by <U+FB01>xing down accurately
the boundaries, and otherwise modifying the Map A, which is
Wallace’s map of zoologic regions. My object has been to make the
smallest alterations in Wallace’s map consistent with easy tabula
tion.
    The greater part of the paper here abstracted is occupied with a
 detailed discussion of various boundary lines in the Map B, in order
 to bring out clearly the principles which should guide us in forming

our tabulation   areas. One main object is that our primary frame
work of areas and sub-areas should separate our species and genera
(so far as possible) into these areas and sub-areas; if a boundary
line is drawn between two sub-areas A and B, so that nearly all the
species found on one side of it are also found on the other, then we
might as well, in this tabulation, have thrown the two sub-areas A and
B into one, and saved ourselves labour. This brings us round prac
tically pretty nearly to Wallace’s view again; i.e., geographic frame
work for reference and tabulation must be as near as possible to a
system of natural biologic regions. subject to the condition that the
boundary lines are rapidly and accurately <U+FB01>xed, and are easily re
membered.      It is impracticable to effect large tabulations of tens of
thousands of specimens if it is necessary continually to refer to
some special large-scale  map.
   The present paper    is not intended    to include  marine  regions or
areas.
V.   “The Electric Organ of the Skate: Observations on the
       Structure. Relations, Progressive Development, and Growth
       of the Electric Organ of the Skate.”           By J. C. EWART,
       M.D., Begins Professor of Natural History, University of
       Edinburgh. Communicated by Prof. J. BURDON SANDERSON.
       F.R.S. Received February 10, 1892.
                                (Abstract)
   After referring to the observations of Stark, the discoverer of the
skate’s electric organ, and to the work of Robin, Leydig, Babuchin,
and others, the author describes the arrangement of the muscles in
the tail of Selachians with a view to determining which muscles in
the skate are transformed into the electric organs.
   By comparing the caudal muscles of Sci/Ilium, Lam/no, Mylt'obatis,
and Rate, it is made out that, while the middle row of muscular cones
remains unaltered in the sharks and rays, it is transformed into a
more or less perfect electric organ in the skates, the various members
of the genus Rate. It is pointed out that, while the middle row of
muscular cones is transformed in Raia into electric cones, the two
adjacent rows of cones as in the rays and certain sharks diminish in
size, and in some cases disappear about the middle of the tail.
   In considering the structure of the organ, it is stated that, when
the various modi<U+FB01>cations are taken into consideration, it may be
described as consisting of a series of electric cones made up of more
or less completely metamorphosed muscular <U+FB01>bres.            Twenty-eight
 distinct cones were counted in the organ of R. bat-is.         The <U+FB01>rst,
 which in a half grown     <U+FB01>sh   measured 5 cm. in length, was all but

  1892.]             The Electric ()rgan oft/1e Skate.                  475
 completely invested by the last unaltered muscular cone.         From the
 <U+FB01>rst to the tenth the cones slightly increased in length; but from
 the eleventh they diminished in length, the twenty-sixth measuring
 only 0'75 cm. Beyond the twenty-eighth-there were from six. to
 eight incomplete cones.
    In transverse sections the anterior third of the organ was seen to
 present an oval or rounded form, while the middle and posterior
 thirds were less regular, owing to the organ coming into contact
 with the vertebral column, and being grooved by the dorsal and
 ventral muscles.
    The cones are described as consisting of numerous loculi or
 chambers, each having an electric disc suspended by nerve <U+FB01>bres
from its anterior wall, and occupied in front and behind the disc
with gelatinous tissue.
   It is estimated that each organ in R. batis is made up of about
 10,000 electric elements, t.e., about 20,000 in the two organs.       Tor
pedo marmorata has about 500,000, and T. gigantea about 1,000,000,
elements in the two batteries, all considerably larger than those of
the skate.
    The layers of the electric discs, the electric, striated, and alveolar,
are described in detail; and the various views as to the termination
of the nerve <U+FB01>brils in the disc are referred to.
   In the chapter on the progressive growth of the organ a table is
given to show that in R. hates the organ, after a time, grows at a
greater rate than the tail in which it is lodged, e.g., in <U+FB01>sh 60 cm. in
length the tail measures about 28 cm., and the electric organ
 225 cm.; well-formed discs having an area of 0'8 to 1 sq. mm.
 In  <U+FB01>sh 225 cm. in length the tail measures 85 cm., the organ 70 cm.,
 and the discs have an area of about 2'08 sq. mm.              In <U+FB01>sh from
 25'5 to 305 cm. in length the organ is from 1278 to 140 cm., and
weighs 0'5 to 0'6 gram ; in <U+FB01>sh from 835 to 9125 cm. the organ is
from 3050 to 34.25 cm., and weighs from 6'0 to 8'0 grams; in <U+FB01>sh
 157 cm., the organ measures 48-25 cm., and weighs 2500 grams;
while in 225 cm. <U+FB01>sh the organ, which measured 7000 cm., weighed
 156'00 grams.    These facts, especially the great size and weight of
the organ in large skate (about 7 feet in length), do not seem to
point to the skate’s organ being in process of degeneration; more
especially as the increase in size is not accompanied by any histologi
cal changes of a retrogressive nature, the largest organ examined
being apparently as perfect as that of Torpedo and Gymnotus.
   In discussing the organ from a physiological point of view, reference
is made to the investigations of Sanderson and Gotch, and it is
pointed out that, when the electric plate is taken as the unit, the value
per square millimetre of the single plate of the skate is in all prob
ability equal to, if not greater than, that of the torpedo.

476                              Presents.                           [Feb. 25,
   The structures of the organs of the skate and torpedo are compared
at length, and it is shown that in the case of the torpedo all the
non-essential structures are absent, while the all-essential part, the
electric layer or plate, closely resembles the corresponding layer or
plate in the skate, the electric
                              I
                                   layer of R. circular-11s being especially
like that of the torpedo.
   In considering the modi<U+FB01>cations of the electric organ in the skate
genus, it is shown that in all the British species, with the exception
of R. radiata, R. circularis, and R. fullonica, the elements are in the
form of discs. In the three exceptions the elements are more or less
cup-shaped.     In R. radiate, as described in a former paper, they arc
in the form of thick-walled shallow cups. The electric plate, ap
parently a greatly enlarged motor plate, lines the cup, which through
out resembles an ordinary striated muscle.         In R. circularis, a mom
specialised member of the group, the electric elements are larger and
better developed.     The cups are deep and well moulded, and tilt
electric layer is even more complex than in R. batis ; at least, it mom
closely resembles the electric layer of the torpedo.             Further, th<
cups are invested by a thick nucleated cortex, from which a numbei
of delicate short processes project—the <U+FB01>rst appearance of the long
prongs found in R. batis.     In R. fullom'ca the electric elements stanc'
nearly midway      between   the  only partially transformed musculai
<U+FB01>bres of R. radiate and the complex discs of R. butts.             The cups in
R. fullom'ca are less deep than in R. circularis ; and while the electri<
and striated layers appear to be all but identical in the two species
the cortex is decidedly more like that of R. batis.        The short simplt
processes of R. circularis are represented in R. fullonica by processes
often complex, which, by projecting freely from the outer surface 01
the cup, give it an irregular villous appearance, and at once sugges1
the processes or prongs which are so characteristic of the alveolai
layer of R. batis.
   After giving a summary of his observations on the electric orgar
of the skate, the author concludes by pointing out that it is not yet
possible'to indicate by what method the electric organs of <U+FB01>shes havs
been produced.

 copies as they may think <U+FB01>t to be so delivered.

  A NOTE       ON    THE   HISTORY OF THE                STATUTES       OF    THE
                                  - SOCIETY.
         BY M. FosTER,      M.A., M.D., LL.D., SENIOR SECRETARY.
     The following note was drawn up for the use of the Council of
  the Society while preparing the foregoing revised edition of the
  Statutes :—
                             THE FIRsT      STATUTES.
                The second Charter, amending the <U+FB01>rst granted in 1662,
 A nn. 1663
                having been granted April 22nd, 1663, the Statutes were
 drawn up in that year.         A copy of these is published in Weld’s
 “
    History of the Royal Society.”
                     THE STATUTES FROM         1663    To 1752.
    During the succeeding ninety years changes were from time to time
 made in the Statutes; but no new version of the Statutes appears to
 have been drawn up until the year 1752*
    “The laws of the Royal Society, like those of other communities,
 were altered from time to time, until they appeared suf<U+FB01>cient to
 embrace every contingency that might occur, while they held their
 meetings in Gresham College, which they continued to do for near the
 space of <U+FB01>fty years.      But the arrangement of the Society’s affairs
 being somewhat altered upon possessing a house of their own, it
became necessary to make different establishments in many particulars
and to alter and augment some of their Statutes.                  However, the
greater part of them was still left in the original form, suited tothe
situation of the Society at Gresham College.”—(Preface to Statutes,
Edition of 177 6.)
    Between    1663 and 1752, the     following    seem to have been the most
important changes.
                           The Election    of Fellows.
                In the original Statutes,     Cap.   VL, “Of the Election and
Ann. 1663.
                Admission   of Fellows,”     Sec. 1 provides that candidates
be propounded at one        meeting, and put to the vote at some other
   * The British Museum contains a small 8vo. edition, dated 1728, but this appears
to be a verbatim copy of the Statutes of 1663, except that Cap. VI., Sec. 7, begins
with the words “ The admission of,” instead of “ The election and admission of.”

502                                 A ppend
meeting at which twenty-one Fellows (as prescribed by Charter) are
present; but that every one of his Majesty’s subjects having the title
and place of Baron, or any higher title and place, and every one of his
Majesty’s Pl ivy Council, may be propouuded and put to the vote the
same day.      And Sec. 3 of the same chapter provides that “ the name
of every person propounded as a Candidate, together with the name of
the Fellow proposing, shall be entered in the J0urnal-book;” by
                                          ”
which it appears that “ propouuding          by one Fellow was suf<U+FB01>cient.
               In 1682, however, the following was proposed on August 2,
Ann. 1682.
               and passed on August 5 :—
   “ The Statute for Election of Fellows
                                                 having by long Experience
been found insufficient for bringing in persons qualifyed for the ends
of the Institution of the Royal Society, few ballotting in the negative
and presuming the person to be well known to the Member that Pro
poseth the Candidate, it is thought requisite by the Councell to propose
this Statute following,—
   “
     Every person that would propose a Candidate shall <U+FB01>rst give in his
Name to some of the Councell, that so in the next Councell it may be
discoursed viva voce whether the person is known to be so quali<U+FB01>ed
as in probability to be usefull to the Society.          And if the Councell
return no other Answer but that they desire further time to be
acquainted with the gentleman proposed, the Proposer is to take that
for an Answer.        And if they are well assured that the Candidate may
be   usefull  to  the  Society then the Candidate shall be proposed at the
next meeting of the Society and ballotted according to the Statute in
that behalf, and shall immediately sign the usual Bond and pay his
admission mony upon his Admission.”
   (Neither the Statutes of 1663, nor the Edition of 1752, make any
                                                                 ”
mention of the “Bond for the payment of the contribution;          the words
<U+FB01>rst  occur  in  the Edition  of 1776, but  the actual Bonds preserved in the
Archives of the Society date from January 1, 1674, onwards.)
                In 1727 (January 9th) the following Statute was passed,
Ann.   1727.
                that of 1682 being apparently repealed :—
   “Every Person to be Elected Fellow of the Society shall <U+FB01>rst at a
Meeting of the Society be propounded as a Candidate to be approved
by the Council, and shall be recommended by three members, one of
which at least shall be a. member of the Council, and one of them shall
at the same Time mention and specify the quali<U+FB01>cations of the said
Candidate. And afterwards such Person shall at another meeting of
the Society (whereat there shall be a competent Number for making
Elections) be refered back from the Council if approved, and shall then
be propounded and put to the Vote for Election, Saving and Excepting
that it shall be free for every one of his Majesties Subjects who is a
Peer or the Son of a Peer of Great Britain or Ireland, and for every
one of his Majesties Privy Council of either of the said kingdoms to

                    A Note  on the  History of  the Statutes.            503
 be propounded      by any single Person and to     be put    to the Vote for
 Election on the same 'Day, there being present a competent Number for
 making Elections.”
                This, however, was in turn, very soon, viz., in 1730,
 Ann. 17 3 O.
                changed to the following form, all mention of Council
 being omitted from the Statute :—
    “X. Every person to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, shall
 be propounded and recommended at a meeting of the Society by three
 or more Members; who shall then deliver to one of the Secretaries a
 paper, signed by themselves with their own names, specifying the name,
 addition, profession, occupation, and chief quali<U+FB01>cations; the inventions,
 discoveries, works, writings, or other productions of the candidate for
 Election; as also notifying the usual place of his habitation.
    “ A fair
               copy of which paper, with the date of the day when
delivered, shall be <U+FB01>xed up in the common meeting room of the
Society at ten several ordinary meetings, before the said candidate shall
be put to the ballot: Saving and excepting, that it shall be free for
every one of his Majesty’s subjects, who is a Peer or the Son of a
Peer of Great Britain or Ireland, and for every one of his Majesty’s
Privy council of either of the said Kingdoms, and for every foreign
Prince or Ambassador, to be propounded by any single person, and
to be put to the ballot for Election on the same day, there being present
a competent number      for making Elections.”
    It appears in this form in the Edition of 1752 as Sec. 10 of Gap.     VI.
                      |    The Admission  of Fellows.
Ann.   1727.   In 1727, also on January 9th, the two following Statutes
were enacted :—
   “ lI. Every Person who is a Foreigner and every one of his
Majesties Subjects whose habitation or usual place of residence is at
more than forty miles distance from London, shall be and be deemed
as a Fellow of the Society immediately after he shall be Elected, and
shall be registered in the Journal Book of the Society as such: Provided
always, that no such person shall have liberty to Vote at any Election
or meeting of the Society before he shall be quali<U+FB01>ed pursuant to the
Statutes.     And if he shall neglect so to qualify himself the <U+FB01>rst time
he comes to London when he may be present at a meeting of the
Society and can be admitted; his Election shall be declared Void, and
his Name shall be cancelled in the Register.
   “III. No Person shall be Proposed, Elected, or Admitted a Fellow
of the Society upon St. Andrew's Day or the Day of the Anniversary
meeting for Electing the Council and Of<U+FB01>cers.”
These    appear in the Edition     of 1752   as Secs. 8 and 9 respectively
of  Gap.  VI.                 '

504                               Appendiz'.
  As far, then, as the election and admission of Fellows are concerni
no new Statutes were enacted in 1752 ; the Edition of that ye
simply adds to the Statutes of 1663 the two enacted in 1727 and t
one enacted in 1730.
                   The Election   of Council and   O<U+FB01>icers.
             In the original Statutes, Cap. VIL, “Of the Election
Ann. 1668.
             the Council and Oliicers” makes arrangements that t
eleven members of the existing Council who are 'to be continu
should <U+FB01>rst be determined, after that the ten new members, and <U+FB01>na
the of<U+FB01>cers.   The Statutes of 1752, reproduce the chapter in its origil
             form of 12 sections, with the addition of Sec. 13, enact
Ann. 1735.
             in 1735, which provides that in order to lessen t
tediousness of the election, Fellows may give in at the same ti
three lists—(1) of 11 old Members of Council to continue, (2)
10 new Members, (3) of O<U+FB02>icers.
                     The Philosophical   Transactions.
  But the most important changes introduced in            1752,   those whi
probably led to the issue of the new version of the Statutes in that ye.
Ann. 1663.
              relate to the Philosophical Transactions.  In the old Statut
              Cap.  XIII.,  “Of the Printer to the Society,” provides 1
the printing and binding of books, catalogues, and such other thin
by order of the Society or Council; there are no other provisions
              to publications.      The Philosophical   Transactions    we
Ann. 1665.
              begun in 1665 ; but up to the 46th volume inclusive, pt
lished in 1749—50, “the printing of them was always, from time
time, the single act of the respective Secretaries” (Adv. to PhllOSOPlllt
Transactions, vol. 47), though with regard to the <U+FB01>rst number t
Council (Minutes, March 1, 1664) ordered “that the Philosophk
Transactions,   to be composed by Mr. Oldenburg, be printed the <U+FB01>]
Munday of every month, if he have suf<U+FB01>cient matter for            it,
                                                                and      tt
that Tractbe licensed by the Council of the Society, being <U+FB01>rst review
by some of the Members of the same.         And that the President
desired, now to Licence the <U+FB01>rst papers thereof, being written in to
sheets in folio, to be printed by John Martyn and James Allestrei
and this practice of licensing‘was continued with reference
those papers read before the Society which were published in             t
Transactions.
           In 1752      was determined to place the Philosophi<
                       it
Ann.   1752.
           Transactions directly in the hands of the Council, and         t‘
Edition of the Statutes of 1752, while leaving Cap. XIII. inta
adds the following two new chapters, enacted March 26th of th
year :—

                  A  Note on    the History of the Statutes.              505
    Cap.  XX. “Of the selecting of Papers laid before the Society, in
 order for Publication,”   establishes and lays down regulations for the
 “Committee of Papers.”        These regulations are almost verbatim the
 same as Secs. 1 to 4 of Cap. XIII, “0f the Publication of Papers,” of
 the Statutes in force at the present time, except that the Quorum of
 the Committee of Papers is <U+FB01>ve, not seven, and a. provision is contained
 that no entry in the Minute-book of the Committee is to be made
 of Papers “ thought improper to be laid before the public.”
    In the Statute in its original form the Committee “shall be at liberty
 to call in to their assistance . . . any other members of the Society
 who are knowing and well skilled in any particular branch of Science
 that shall happen to be the subject-matter of any paper which shall
 be then to come under their deliberation,” and almost the same words
 are retained in the Statutes at present in force. The custom of the
 Committee is now, and for a long time has been, to “call in to their
 assistance” two or more Fellows, by asking for written reports, and
 such Fellows so assisting are generally spoken of as “referees.”         The
 earliest mention which has been found in the Society’s records of a
               paper being “referred” is on May 25th, 1780, when a
 Ann. 1780.
              paper by Mr. Ludlow was “referred” to Mr. Cavendish
 and Dr. Hutton. There does not appear to be a similar record until
              March 21st, 1831, when a paper by Prof. Davy was
 Ann. 1831.
              referred to Mr. Faraday.      By 1832, however, the practice
of referring papers seems to have become very common. For some
time the name of the person (or persons) to whom the paper was referred
is stated in the Minutes of the Committee of Papers, and in all these
cases, including those just mentioned, the persons in question were
members of the then Council.         Very soon, however, the name was
omitted, the entry being simply “referred.” There seems to he no
means of ascertaining when “referees” outside the Council were
<U+FB01>rst had recourse to, or when the practice of written reports <U+FB01>rst
began.
   Cap. XXI. “Of the Manner of Publication of the Papers laid before
the Society, and defraying the Expences thereof,” provides for the print
ing and distribution of the Philosophical Transactions, and is to a large
extent, even in its very words, the same as Secs. 5 to 9 of Gap. XIII.
of the Statutes at present in force, the word “ Clerk” being used where
“Assistant Secretary” is now used.
                             Payments  by  Fellows.
   In order to defray the additional expenses thus incurred by the publi
cation   and gratis distribution     to the Fellows of the Philosophical
Transactions, the “ admission-money” is by Sec. 2 of Cap. XXI. raised
from two guineas to <U+FB01>ve guineas.        In Cap. III. of the Statutes of 1663,

506                                 Appendix.
“ Of the Payments by the Fellows t0 the Society,” the admission-money
is <U+FB01>xed at forty shillings, and indeed, in the Edition of 1752, the
same sum of forty shillings is retained in this Chapter, the error
apparently escaping notice. The change from forty shillings to forty
two shillings (two guineas) seems to have taken place at some time in
the interval.
                     THE   STATUTES    FROM   1752 TO 1776.
   In  1774   and   1775,   the Council    were engaged in considering the
Statutes,    and in   1776 published      a new     Edition, containing several
important changes. An interesting preface to this Edition (from which
a quotation is given above), explains that in spite of large changes in
                                                                                '
the practices of the Society, the Statutes had been kept as far as
possible in their original form; and, indeed, the Statutes of 1752 differ
from those of 1663 chie<U+FB02>y in the additions described above. In 1776,
however, the Council determined to bring the Statutes into more strict
conformity with the practice of the Society, and in consequence the
 Edition of 1776 differs widely from the twa earlier versions.
    Five whole chapters are omitted, viz., V,—-Of Experiments, and the
 Reports thereof; XI, Of Curators by O<U+FB02>‘ice; XIII, Of the Printer
 to the Society; XIV, Of Operators to the Society; XVII, Of Benefactors:
 the 21 chapters of 1752 being thus reduced to 16.                 The preface
 explains how the changes in the Society had long rendered these
 Statutes unnecessary.
    The order of the several chapters is largely altered, the new arrange
 ment adopted being that which has on the whole been followed in
 subsequent editions, and is still maintained.
                             The Election   of Fellows.
               The regulations for the election of Fellows remain on the
 Ann.  1776.
               whole the same, save that it is precisely stated that twenty
 one is “the competent number” for making an election, a majority
 of two-thirds being necessary, and in the Statute relating to what
 we now call the “privileged class,” the words “Foreign Prince or
 Ambassador” are replaced by the words “Foreign Sovereign Prince,
 or the son of a Sovereign Prince, or an Ambassador to the Court of
 Great Britain.”
                                Composition    Fee.
    In the Edition     of   1752,  as stated    above, no mention is made of
 any    “ bond”    or  “
                          composition fee,” but in the next year, 1753
               (June  7), the Statute, Cap. VL, Sec. 8, concerning Foreign
 Ann. 1753.
               ers and persons residing more than forty miles from London,
  was repealed, and the following substituted :—

                       A Note   on the   History of   the Statutes.       507
       “ That no one of his Majesties subjects, or any other person
    residing in his Majesties Dominions, who shall be elected a Fellow
    of the Society, shall be deemed an actual Fellow thereof, nor shall
    the name of any such person be Registered in the Journal Book, or
    printed in the List of Fellows of the Society, until such Person shall
    have paid his admission Fee, and given the usual Bond, or paid the Sum
    of Twenty-one pounds for the use of the Society in lieu of contribu
    tions: But that upon such payment or giving Bond as aforesaid, it
    shall be lawful for the Society to give leave for the name of any such
    person so elected as aforesaid to be entered in the Journal Book, and
    printed in the list of Fellows of the Society: Provided always that
    no such person shall have liberty to Vote at any Election or Meeting
    of the Society, before he shall be duly admitted a Fellow thereof
    pursuant to the former Statute.”
      This is the <U+FB01>rst time that the Statutes contain any reference to a
    composition fee.
                 In  1766 (December 11) a Statute was passed increasing
    Ann. 1766.
                 the composition fee from twenty to twenty-six guineas;
    and the   Statute of 1753 just quoted re-appears, with some slight
    changes, in the Edition of 1776 as Sec. 8 of Cap.        1.,
                                                      the “sum of twenty
    one pounds” being altered into “the sum appointed,” and this the
    Chapter on payments by Fellows states to be twenty-six guineas.
                                  Foreign Members.
      The Statutes of 1776 contain, what the Statutes of 1752 and 1663
    do not, special regulations for Fellows “residing in foreign parts and
    not subjects of the British Dominions.”
                 So early as 1664 (Ap. 13)     Statute was passed providing
                                               a
    Ann. 1664.
                 that persons “ residing in Forraigne parts,” who are elected
    Ann. 1716.   Fellows, should not pay fees; in 1716    reference occurs to
                                                              a
    Ann, 1737, Foreigners who are Fellows; and in 1737           resolution of
                                                                      a
    Council (which did not become        Statute) proposed that Foreigners
                                          a
    resident in London might be on the Home List     they paid contributions.
                                                        if
    It would appear, therefore, in spite of no mention of the matter being
    made in 1752, that, from an early period,          distinction was made
                                                         a
_   between Fellows who were Foreigners and others, and that the Fellows
    who were Foreigners did not, of necessity, pay contributions to the
    Society.   In the Register of Fellows, however, at this date no distinc
    tion of any kind   made.
                       is
       It was apparently soon felt that the Foreign Members were
    too numerous and in some cases not of suf<U+FB01>cient distinction; for
                in 1761 (March 19) the Council, in order to ensure that
    Ann. 1761.  “ n0 persons residing in Foreign parts, not being subjects
    of the Crown of Great Britain, be elected Fellows unless their Quali<U+FB01>ca

508                               A ppendiw.
tions be very well known as well abroad as at home,” enacted a Statute
providing that in the case of such persons the certi<U+FB01>cate should be
signed by at least “three Foreign Fellows,” as well as at least “by
              three Fellows named in the Home List.” And in 1765
Ann. 1765.                               “ to restrain the number of
              (Dec. 19) on a proposal                                foreign
members,” it was resolved “that no foreigner be proposed for election
that is not known to the learned world, by some publication or
invention which may enable the Society to form a judgment of his
merit, and that till the number of foreign members be reduced to
eighty, not more than two shall be admitted in one year.” A special
mode of procedure in the election of foreigners as Fellows was, at the
same time, resolved upon, providing for the election of two a year;
and a subsequent resolution (Dec. 26) provides that Foreign Members
                              “
paying contributions shall      have their names printed in an alphabetical
List next after that of the Home Members, as Foreign Member's“
contributing towards the expenses of the Society,” and so distinct from
                            ”
“other foreign members          “who do not contribute.” On January 16
              of the next year the limitation to eighty was withdrawn,
Ann. 17 6 6.
              and the above resolutions were then embodied in the form
of Statutes. These at the same time provided that the new regulation
should not extend to Foreign Princes or their sons, and gave permission
to foreigners resident in Great Britain to become Fellows in the usual
Ann_ 1769'    way, which permission was extended on Jan. 26, 1769, to
              foreigners Who had been resident in Great Britain for the
Ann 1773_ space of six months. Soon after, namely on June 10th, 1773,
              the word “Foreigner” appears in the “Register” for the
<U+FB01>rst time, being placed after the names of Stehelin, Le Roy, and Le Duc;
thenceforward it is used frequently.
              In the Edition of 1776 these regulations, in a somewhat
Ann. 1776.
              modi<U+FB01>ed form, are introduced as part of Sec. 8 of Gap. 1.;
the limitation to the election of two a year is omitted, and the certi<U+FB01>
cates, signed by at least three Fellows upon the Foreign List, and at
least by three Fellows on the Home List, are directed to be suspended
from the 30th November until the weekly Meeting on, or next after,
              the 30th May. Some years afterwards, however (March 8,
Ann. 1787.
              1787), this part of Sec. 8 was repealed, and a new Sec. 9
added, which provides a somewhat complex mode of procedure in the
election, under the title of “Foreign Members,”'|' of persons “who are
                                                                                    ‘

is limited to one hundred.      Certi<U+FB01>cates signed by six or more Fellows
are to be presented at some meeting between Easter and the Anniver

sary. At a meeting immediately before the following Easter a selection
of candidates is to be made, and the candidates so selected are to be
balloted for at the next meeting immediately after Easter.                   These
regulations are not, however, to apply to Sovereign Foreign Princes or
their Sons, or to such Foreigners resident in Great Britain as may desire
to become Fellows in the usual way.
              The O<U+FB01>icers  of the  Society, the Clerk,  Librarian,    do.
    No changes are      made   in the Statutes of 1776 for the election of
Council and ()<U+FB02>icers;     but to meet the changes in the contributions there
are changes in the regulations for the Treasurer.         There are also changes
in the duties of the Secretaries, chie<U+FB02>y in reference to the Clerk and to
the publication of the Philosophical Transactions.
    Cap. X. provides regulations for the quali<U+FB01>cations, mode of election,
duties and remunerations of the Clerk, the Librarian, the Keeper of the
 Repository, and the House-Keeper.
                The Statutes of 1663 contain regulations for the Clerk,
 Ann. 1663.
                and prescribe clerkly duties for him; and the Society had
 at <U+FB01>rst neither House-keeper nor Librarian.
                When in 1710 the Society moved to Crane Court, the o<U+FB01>ce
 Ann. 1710.
                of House-Keeper was established; but the then Clerk was
 made House-Keeper. As the Library and Repository were increased
 the o<U+FB02>ices of Librarian and Keeper of the Repository were established;
 but both these o<U+FB02>iees were held by the Clerk, under supervision, during
 a certain period at all events, of Fellows chosen for that duty under
               “ Inspectors.”     But the Statutes of 1752 contain no regula
 the title of
 tions for these of<U+FB01>ces other than that of the Clerk, the Statutes con
 cerning whom remain exactly the same as in 1663 ; and in spite of the
                special regulations present in the edition of 1776, it appears
 Ann. 1776.
                that the Society had never more than one of<U+FB01>cer to carry
                                                                 “
 out these several duties, and that he was called                  the Clerk,” until
                at a later period (1823)     the  o<U+FB02>ice  of  Clerk was abolished,
  Ann' 1823'
                 and that of Assistant Secretary instituted.
                       The Ordinary Meetings     of  the Society.
                 In the edition      of   1776,  Cap.    XI.   “ Of the
                                                                           Ordinary
  Ann. 1776.
                 Meetings of the Society,” Sec. 1 provides that the ordinary
  Meetings should be held on “Thursdays, beginning at 6 p.m., and
  continue about an hour, as usual, at the discretion of the President.”
  Ann 1769_ This Statute was passed in 1769.
                 The Statutes of        1663  (IV., Sec. 1) provide that the
  Ann. 1663.
                 ordinary meetings      should  be held on “ Wednesday, begin
  ning about three of the clock in the afternoon, and continuing until

 51 O                               A ppendiw.
six, unless the major part of the Fellows present shall, for that time,
             resolve to rise sooner, or sit later.” And the Statutes of
Ann' 1752'
              1752 reproduce exactly the Statute (IV. Sec. 1) of 1663.
Nevertheless, the records of the Society show that the day and hour
of the ordinary meeting were more than once changed in the interval,
as they have been since.   The following shows the changes and their
respective dates up to the present time :—
                1663.     On Wednesdays, at 2 p.m.
                July     1, 1663, changed to Wednesday, 3 to 6 p.m.

             The <U+FB01>rst Statute enacting that no meeting should be held
Ann.    1831.
             on certain days or in certain weeks was passed in 1831 ;
 previously to that the Statutes simply said “upon Wednesday,” or
 “
   upon Thursday.” But the practice of having an Autumn recess was
of much older date than this; moreover, the Journal Book sh0ws
that from the earliest times it was customary to hold no meetings on
Ash Wednesday and certain other holy days, and that in particular
no meeting was held on the anniversary of the death of Charles I.
In 1661 the Journal Book omits the date, January 30, without remark,
although a meeting was due upon that day.          On January 30, 1666,
the Minute appears, “This day being the Anniversary Fast-Day, there
was no Meeting of the Society.”     In 1667, the entry    “The Societyis,
met not, because of the solemne Fast.”         Similar entries occur in
subsequent years, the last being on January 30, 1834.    After this date
the custom was omitted.
           The Admission      of Strangers   to the Meetings   of   the Society.
                 In the Statutes of
                                  1752, any of his Majesty’s  subjects
Ann.    1752.
            having the title and place of a Baron, or having any
higher title or place, are permitted to be present at the Meetings of
the Society, “with the allowance of the President;” other persons
may attend “upon leave obtained of the President and Fellows present.”
 1‘
    Careful search has failed to show when this change         was made,            but   it   was
probably about this time.

                    A   Note  on the  History of   the Statutes.               511
                In  1776 the mention of titled     persons is omitted, and the
 Ann. 1776.
                Statute simply provides for “strangers” being present.
                Some years later, viz., in 1784, a new section was added
 Ann. 1784
                to Cap. XI. as follows :—
     “VI. That the meetings of the Society may not be wasted by
 unpro<U+FB01>table debates, contrary to the intent and meaning of the <U+FB01>fth
 section of this chapter, it is constituted, established, and ordained,
 that every motion or question, proposed to be ballotted for by the
 Society, shall be fairly transcribed on paper, and being signed by six or
 more Fellows of the Society, it shall be by them delivered to one of
 the Secretaries at a meeting of the Society; and shall thereupon be
 read immediately after the declaration of the Presents on the table;
 and after being marked by the Secretary with the date of the day
 when delivered, it shall be <U+FB01>xed up in the common Meeting-room of
 the Society at the next ordinary Meeting; and on the Meeting next
following the same, it shall be put to the Ballot, unless those who
 have signed it agree to withdraw it.
     “ But nothing contained in this Statute is to be construed to extend
to matters relative to elections, or the ordinary business of the
Society.”
     The motions or questions proposed to be “ballotted                for” must
therefore have had reference to matters of science.
                        Publications, Records, and Library.
                In   Cap. XII., the quorum of the Committee of Papers is
Ann. 1776.
                raised from <U+FB01>ve to seven, and the part of the Statute
providing that there should be no entry of rejected papers is omitted.
                In Cap. XIII, “Of the Manner of Publication of the
Ann. 1776.
                Papers laid before the Society,” the word “Librarian”
is substituted for that of “Clerk”; also the period during which
surplus copies not required by Fellows must remain before they are
disposed of by the Council, is extended from one year (as in 1752) to
<U+FB01>ve years.
                               “ Of the Books and
                Cap. XIV.,                             Papers of the Society,”
Ann. 177 6.
                differs somewhat from the corresponding Cap. XVI, “Of
the Books of the Society,” in the Statutes of 1752. The copy of
Statutes, the List of Benefactors, and the Register of Fellows is
omitted from the Charter Book?           The Statute concerning the Register
   ’l‘ The Charter Book never did contain, as provided by the Statute, the Register
of Fellows,-but only their signatures.   The Society possesses, however, a volume
now called “The Register," which contains the names, with dates of election, of
all the Fellows from the foundation of the Society up to the year 1875. Since that
date the Register is continued in a second volume.
                                                                            '

              A new Statute (Sec. V.) is introduced, to the effect that
  Ann. 1776.
              the original copy of every paper read at the Society shall
  be considered as the property of the Society; and another (See. VI.)
  provides for the care of the papers read. And, lastly, a new Statute
 (Sec. VII.) introduces, for the <U+FB01>rst time, into the Statutes regulations
 concerning the use of the Library.        The Library is to be open
 Tuesdays    and  Thursdays,  from 11  am.  to 2 p.m., and Fellows may,
 by leave of the Society or of the Council, take out four volumes
 for six weeks. If these are printed books, the Fellow gives merely
 his note ; if MSS., a bond of £50 for each.

  In 1831 the Statutes relating to the Assistant Secretary were

the Statutes concerning the Treasurer and Secretaries.       Cap. XL,

  Very   soon after, however, viz., in 1846, a Committeeof Council was
appointed to consider the mode of Election of Fellows, with the result
that in 1847 new Statutes were enacted, regulating the Election of
<U+FB01>fteen Fellows annually, according to the plan at present in use.

                       The Changesfrom 1847 to 1888.
   The most notable changes which have since then been enacted or
proposed are as follows :'—
   On November 3rd, 1864, the repeal of the Statute relating to the
admission of strangers to the meetings was moved, but negatived;
and again, on March 21st, 1867, a propOsal that the public be admitted
to the Ordinary Meetings of the Society was negatived.
   In 1865 the privileged class (Cap.    1.,
                                        Sec.   was extended to include
                                                    4)
Foreign Sovereign Princes and their sons.
   In 1866 the practice of paying for a proportional part of the year
was abolished, and the annual payment was made one in advance.
    In 1871 a new Statute was enacted prohibiting the payment of
dividends to Fellows.
   On October 30th, 1873, upon       amotion to assimilate the mode of
election of the Privileged Class to that of Ordinary Fellows, to place
in the hands of the Council the selection of such candidates, and to
require “evidence of ascertained special power and disposition to forward
the aims of the Society from exceptional, personal, or of<U+FB01>cial advantages
of position, or of great eminence in any branch of learning, instead of
any quali<U+FB01>cation based only on accident of lineage or of political status,”
the Statute concerned was referred to the consideration of a Committee,
and on April 23rd, 1874, the Statute in its existing form was enacted.
    On December 17th of same year, 1874,        Committee was appointed
                                                a
 to consider the election of candidates for Fellowship, which Committee
presented on November 30th, 1875,          along report giving reasons
why    no changes  should be made.
    In 1878—9 changes were made in the payment of fees.
    In 1879 the Statutes relating to Foreign Members were altered to
their present form.
    In 1880 (February 19th) the hour of meeting was changed from the
evening to the afternoon.
    In 1885 the time during which the Library       open to Fellows was
                                                         is
extended.
  In   1888 the Statute,   Cap. XL, Sec.     was altered to admit of an
                                               2,
Ordinary Meeting    being   held on the  day of Election of Fellows, and
Statute, Cap. XIII, Sec.     7, was altered to allow Fellows to receive
their copies of the Philosophical Transactions upon    request in writing.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   SIR JOHN HAWKSHAW, civil engineer, was born at Leeds in 1811,
and   was educated at the Grammar School of that town.             After
serving a pupilage to an engineer of large practice in Yorkshire, he
went to South America for a few years to superintend some large
copper mines, and soon after his return succeeded George Stephenson
as engineer to a railway between Manchester and Leeds.        This led to
a further connexion with the railways which afterwards expanded
into the great group called the “ Lancashire and Yorkshire ” system,
 and he soon took a position as one of the most eminent railway
engineers in the country.
   After he established himself in London, his practice extended to
other branches of engineering, and about 1856 he succeeded Mr. J.
M. Rendel in directing the construction of the great Harbour of
 Refuge at Holyhead.    He made, with the sanction of the Government,
 extensive alterations of the original design, and, in consideration of
his important services on the work, he received in 1873 the honour
of knighthood.
   Among other large works of his in Great Britain may be mentioned
 docks in London, Hull, and Fleetwood; a main drainage system for
 Brighton; waterworks for Dublin; important improvements in the
 drainage of the Fen districts ; the foundations of the great iron forts
at Spithead, and the tunnel, 43';- miles long, lately formed under the
Severn.    He also devoted much attention to the proposed great
tunnel under the Straits of Dover, and considered he had favourably
solved the question from an engineering point of View. But, sub
 sequently, he doubted the expediency, on grounds of national policy,
of forming such a connexion between the two countries, and withdrew
his support from the scheme.
   He is best known to Londoners by his extension of the South
Eastern Railway from London Bridge to new termini at Charing
Cross and Cannon Street, a very dif<U+FB01>cult and expensive work, cutting
through the heart of London, and requiring two large new bridges
across the Thames.     And though artistic critics doubt whether this
has contributed, like the Thames Embankment, to the embellishment
of the Metropolis, there can be no question that it has been of immense
bene<U+FB01>t to the inhabitants; and Sir John always held that aesthetic
considerations were out of place if they interfered with works of
public utility.
                                                                 b

                                     ii
   He was also largely engaged on foreign works.        Towards the end
of 1863 he visited Egypt, at the request of the Viceroy, to report on
doubtful points respecting'the Suez Canal, and his emphatic recom
mendations led largely to its completion.       He executed a great ship  .
canal in Holland, made designs for navigating the First Cataract
of the Nile, and had to do with railways and other large works in
Russia, India, the Mauritius, and Brazil.
   He was one of the most active members of the Institution of Civil
Engineers, and occupied the position of President in the years 1862
and 1863.
   Sir John was not merely    a railway maker; he paid much attention
to general principles, and some that he strongly advocated may be
mentioned.      One was the allowance of greater latitude in regard
to gradients.    The earlier engineers thought that almost any cost
should be incurred for the purpose of getting a road as <U+FB02>at as
possible; and for very heavy traf<U+FB01>c to be carried very cheaply this is
always true.    But Sir John urged that in a vast number of cases it
was preferable to adopt steeper gradients, and so to save original
outlay.   He relied on the mechanical skill of engineers to work such
gradients effectively and safely, and contended that this principle
would lead to a great extension of the system in districts where it
would be otherwise impracticable.        It is remarkable how his pre
dictions have been veri<U+FB01>ed.     In the days of George Stephenson, 1 in
264 was thought Very steep, and 1 in 100 was said to require
stationary engines.    Now 1 in 100 is thought nothing of, and 1 in 40
or 50 is allowed for important lines, while for mountain districts we
<U+FB01>nd gradients of 1 in 4, or even steeper still.
   Another principle he advocated was that, when the traf<U+FB01>c became
very large, railways could never be worked to their full advantage
unless special lines were allotted to special speeds, thus separating
the quick from the heavy tra<U+FB02>ic.      It was a long time before practical
railway managers appreciated this idea, but the pressure of increased
traf<U+FB01>c has lately forced it on them, and it is now being extensively
carried out by duplications of many great lines.
   In 1875—76 Sir John <U+FB01>lled the honourable o<U+FB01>ice (succeeding Pro
fessor Tyndall) Of President of the British Association, and gave his
opening address at Bristol 0n the 25th August, 1875.       He began by
saying :—
   “ Past
           Presidents have already discoursed on many subjects—on
things organic and inorganic—0n the mind, and on things, perhaps,
beyond the reach of mind ; and I have arrived at the conclusion that
liumbler themes will not be out of place on this occasion.
   “I
       propose in this address to say something of a profession to which
my lifetime has been devoted—a theme which cannot, perhaps, be
expected to stand so high in your estimation as in my own, and I

                                    iii
                                                          I
may have some dif<U+FB01>culty in making it interesting; but have chosen
it  because it is a subject I ought to understand better than any
other.”
   Half the address was devoted to the history of works of a nature
corresponding to those of modern civil engineering, in a long series,
comprising those of the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Peruvians, the
Hindoos and Mahomedans, the Chinese, the Carthaginians,              the
Greeks, and the Romans, down to the present day. Modern engi
neering works were then alluded to, particularly steam navigation
and the electric telegraph; and in regard to the speaker’s own
special subject, railways, he dwelt more on economical than con
structive views.    He pointed out in a striking manner the great
bene<U+FB01>ts that they had conferred on mankind.      He said :I—
   “Railways add enormously to the national wealth.          It may be
safely assumed that the railways in the British Islands now save the
nation a much larger sum annually than the gross amount of all the
dividends payable to the proprietors, without at all taking into
account the bene<U+FB01>t arising from the saving in time. The bene<U+FB01>ts
under this head defy calculation, and cannot, with any accuracy, be
put into money. But it would not be at all over-estimating this
question to say that in time and money the nation gains at least
what is equivalent to 10 per cent. on all the capital expended”.
   He argued from this that even where a railway would only yield a
small dividend to its proprietors, it was to the national interest that
it should be carried out by Government aid.
   He also alluded to the subject of safety in railway travelling :—
   “It is well that the elements on which this depends should be
clearly understood.    It will be thought that longer experience in the
management of railways should go to ensure greater safety, but
there are other elements of the question.     It depends 011 the perfec
tion of the machine in all its parts; it depends also on the nature
and quantity of tra<U+FB01>ic ; and, lastly, on human care and attention; for
so many of these accidents as arise from the fallibility of men will
never be eliminated until the race be improved.”
   He, however, gave some remarkable statistics to show how minute
the risk of accident really is, and quoted the saying of a former
President of the Board of Trade that he felt safer in a railway
                                  “ And,” added Sir John, *‘ he was
carriage than anywhere else.                                         not
far wrong.”
   He took interest in geology, and published, in 1842, some good
descriptions of fossil footsteps and fossil trees that had been dis
covered in works under his care. He further presented to the Man
chester Geological Society, in 1843, a somewhat elaborate theoretical
paper on the Origin of the Deposits of Coal.
   He was elected into the Royal Society, by the propositions of
                                                                0

times on the Council, namely, in 1868—69, in 1874—75, and in 1881—82.
    In his later years he gave up active practice; but he retained his
faculties to the last, and he died, at the ripe age of 80, on the 2nd of
June,   1891.
    PETER MARTIN       DUNCAN   was born at Twickenham in 1824, and
received his early     education in the Grammar School of that village,
once the home of      Walpole and of Pope. He was afterwards placed
for a short time        in a school in Switzerland.       On his return to
England,     he   entered  the  Medical   Department     of  King’s College,
London, in 184-2.        Here he received his formal scienti<U+FB01>c training,
taking his degree of MB. London in 1846, and in 1849 he was elected
an Associate    of his College.    After acting for  a time as assistant to a
doctor at Rochester, he removed to Colchester, where a practice had
been purchased      for him. Here he resided for many years, and pub
                                                           “

the Pollen-tube, its Growth, Histology, and Physiology                 (1856).
But he did not at Colchester secure much time for original research,
for most of that which was left him by his profession was occupied
by work in connexion with the municipality.            During his residence
he <U+FB01>lled the of<U+FB01>ce of Mayor, thus proving that he had won the con
<U+FB01>dence of his fellow-townsmen, while the admirable arrangement of
the local Museum, which under his direction was reorganised upon
lines far in advance of the time, is a sign of his interest in the educa
tional institutions of the town.         About 1860 he took a practice at
Blackheath, when he was able to spare more time for scienti<U+FB01>c work,
devoting himself to the study of fossil Corals; and, as his interest
 deepened in the problems which they presented to him, he was led to
 abandon the lucrative prospects offered by his profession, and to
 devote himself entirely to original research.      In this he was no doubt
 encouraged by the reception accorded to his <U+FB01>rst palaeontological
 papers, which were read in 1863, and gained for him recognition as a
 most able palaeontologist. In the following year he was appointed one
 of the honorary secretaries of the Geological Society, and two years
 later, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
     After leaving Blackheath, he settled near Regent's Park; but he
 was not long allowed to remain in retirement, for in 1870 he was
 called to the Chair of Geology at King’s College, and a Fellow
 ship followed in 1871.        Shortly afterwards he accepted also the
 Professorship     of  Geology   at Cooper's Hill, both of which appoint
 ments he held till his death. He resigned the Secretaryship of the
 Geological Society in 1870, after a seven years’ tenure of of<U+FB01>ce, and
 in  1872 he was elected a     Vice-President, and President in     1876 and

                                      V
1877.     In 1881 he was awarded the Wollastou Medal, the highest
honour which the Geological Society can bestow.          Though he was
most closely connected with the Geological          Society, he was an
in<U+FB02>uential member of other scienti<U+FB01>c bodies; he served on the
Council of the Royal Society from 1876 to 1878, was President of the
Geological Section of the British Association in 1879, and of the
Microscopical    Society from 1881 to 1883.
    On turning to Professor Duncan’s scienti<U+FB01>c work, one is impressed
by the enormous amount he accomplished, and the wide range of his
 interests and in<U+FB02>uence.    His <U+FB01>rst paper (1856) was botanical, and he
long retained his attachment to this subject, his last paper on veget
 able physiology being published in 1874; while, still later on, he
 worked out the parasitic Algae which he discovered in some Silurian
 Corals.    His <U+FB01>rst important work was the series of <U+FB01>ve memoirs on
 the Fossil Corals of the West Indies.          The subject was full of
 dif<U+FB01>culties; the living Corals of the area. were but little known, so
 that the materials for the comparison of the recent and fossil faunas
 were quite insuf<U+FB01>cient.    But Professor Duncan attacked the subject
 with characteristic energy, and his sound common sense enabled him
  to avoid many a pitfall; his memoir was certainly a most valuable
 addition to our knowledge of the later Tertiary Corals. This work
 was followed by a long list Of memoirs, in which he describes the
 Coral faunas {especially the Cainozoic) of England, Australia, Tas
                                                                          ”
 mania, India, Java, Arabia, and Malta. His “British Fossil Corals
 is probably one of the best contributions published by the Palaeonto
 graphical Society; being so much more modern in its method, and
 more thorough in its treatment, than the work to which it was issued
  as a supplement.
     But though Professor Duncan’s       interests were probably at <U+FB01>rst
 rather zoological than geological, he soon became absorbed in the
 line of work which he had been led by circumstances to select. He
  soon realised that the description of the anatomical structure and the
  determination of the systematic position 'of a fossil did not constitute
  the sole duties of a palaeontologist; with him these were but prelimi
  nary to the consideration of the af<U+FB01>nities of faunas and their bearing
  on the physical geography of the past. He was a palaeontologist in the
  truest sense of the word—not a morphologist who happened to study
  extinct forms, but a geologist who used fossils as a petrologist uses
  minerals.   Hence his early work on the West India Corals com
  menced by a detailed study of their conditions of fossilisation, and
  closed by a discussion of their evidence as to the Caiuozoic physio
  graphy of the Caribbean region; similarly, his later studies of the
                                                          “ The Physical
   European Corals led to his striking paper on
   Geography of Western Europe during the Mesozoic and Cainozoic
   Periods elucidated by their Coral Faunas."

                                    vi
    In his later study of the Echinoidea, he commenced with those in
beds the Corals of which he had already examined, among the most
remarkable being those from South Australia, which he described in
a  series of papers dating from 1864.- to 1887.    It was apparently his
interest in the origin of this fauna, with its mixture of Cretaceous
and Cainozoic genera, that led him to take up the Indian Echinoids,
which, in conjunction with Mr. W. P_ercy Sladen, F.L.S., he mono
graphed with such detail and care.
    He studied with especial interest the Echinoids Of the Cenomanian,
and by the aid of the small collections of the Rev. W. F. Holland, in
Sinai, and of Dr. Carter, in South Arabia, he gradually built up the
connexion between the European fauna and that of Northern India.
By his comparison of those of the Peninsular and Extra-Peninsular
areas he demonstrated the existence of the land-barrier that stretched
across India, and away to the southwest, of which such important
use has been made in recent controversy.      His views on geographical
distribution were original, and had been carefully matured; his
                                                            ”
lecture on “ The Formation of the Main Land Masses            showed that
he did not accept the views of the permanence of oceans and con
tinents, a subject upon which he was competent to speak with
authority. His paper on “The Fauna of the Alpine Lakes” prob
ably dealt the most serious blow ever struck to the theory of the
glacial origin of the Swiss lake-basins.                  _
    But though Professor Duncan did not regard morphology as the
highest end, he did not by any means neglect it; thus our knowledge
of the perignathic girdle of the Echinoids and its value in classi<U+FB01>ca
tion we owe mainly to him; while his remarkably suggestive and
original essay on the structure of the ambulacra of the regular
Echinoidea, perhaps his most masterly piece of work, has gained the
highest praise even from men opposed to his views.
    In addition to his contributions to palmontology,  he has done much
in zoology; he wrote a series of papers on the anatomy of the
Temnopleuridaa, Saleniida), and other groups of the Echinoidea, and
described, amongst others, the Madreporaria of the “ Porcupine
                                                                        ”
Expedition, the Ophiurids and Corals of Mergni, and, in conjunction
 with his constant collaborator, Mr. Sladen, the Echinodermata from
 Greenland.     Two of his most valuable works are “The Revision of
 the Madreporaria,” and his “ Revision of the Genera and Great
 Groups of the Echinoidea.” The former was issued in 1885, and con
 sisted of diagnoses of every genus of Coral (excluding the Rugosa),
and of a. classi<U+FB01>cation which ‘has not yet been supplanted.           His
 revision of the Echinoidea made a great advance in our knowledge
 of every order.    The application of his own discoveries on the ambu
 lacral structure enabled him to bring the Palechinoidea from chaos
 into order, and to replace the arti<U+FB01>cial arrangement of the Diadema

                                       vii
 tidae by a natural classi<U+FB01>cation    ; his previous detection of the funda
 mental differences between the pits of Temnoplemus and the fossettes
 of Temneehinus gave him the clue to the arrangement of that group;
 and his substitution of positive for comparative diagnoses in many
 recent genera has greatly aided the comparison of the fossil and deep
 sea types.   By  these two revisions   alone Professor Duncan has earned
 the gratitude of every palaaontologist and zoologist, and has given a
 <U+FB01>rm basis for future work.        They are indispensable works of refer
 ence to every student     of these groups.
    In addition to the Corals and Echinodermata, Professor Duncan
 made some contributions to the study of the Protozoa and Sponges,
 while his clearness as a teacher led him to undertake a good deal of
 lecturing and popular literary work ; thus be edited the six volumes
 of ‘ Cassell’s Natural History," and, amongst others, wrote a primer
 of physical   geography, a volume of biographies of the ‘Heroes of
 Science,’ a paper on Voltaire’s attitude to geology, and edited recent
 issues of Lyell’s ‘ Student’s Elements.’
    To his <U+FB01>rst love, the Corals, he proposed to return on the conclusion
 of his revision of the Echinoidea; be commenced work upon a large
 Indian collection, and planned a supplement to his revision of the
'Madreporaria, in which he intended to discuss recent criticisms and
incorporate subsequent progress.          But it was not to be. He was
smitten with disease, and, after a long and painful illness, quietly
passed away on .the early morning of the 28th of May.
    The <U+FB01>ne, keen sense of humour, which remained nnblunted almost
to the last, the genial kindness with which he. was ever ready with
help, especially to younger men, united with the recognition of his
sterling worth and sound judgment, gained him wide popularity and
esteem.
    HENRY MARTYN       J EFFERY was the only son of Mr. John Jeffery, of
Gwennap, Cornwall, a parish situated about midway between the
towns of Redruth and Pe'nryn.          He was born on January 5, 1826, at
Lamorran, near Truro, on the banks of the River Fal, at the rectory
of his maternal grandfather, the Rev. W. Curgenven, who married
the sister of the distinguished Orientalist and missionary, the Rev.
Henry Martyn, B.D., the Senior Wrangler in 1801. Mr. eifery was J
also related    to the family of the Rev. Malachy Hitchins, Vicar of
St. Hilary, near Marazion, the comparer of the “ Nautical Almanac,”
under Dr. Maskelyne, from 1767 to 1809, and one of the observers of
the transit of Venus at the Royal Observatory in 1769.          Mr. Jeffery
always referred with a natural pride to these two well-known mathe
matical members of his family.
    The early years of Mr. Jeffery were mostly spent at his father’s home
at Gwennap, but from the age of seven to fourteen he was a pupil at

                                    viii
the Falmouth Grammar School.          On leaving this school, in 1840, he
exhibited undoubted signs of considerable mathematical and classical
ability—so much so that he o<U+FB01>ered himself as a tutor in a private
gentleman’s family.       The writer of this notice has seen a copy of
his letter containing a list of the subjects which he considered him
self competent to teach, and from it we may gather that he was
really an intelligent youth with more than usual precocity.          Fortu
nately for himself, he was, at the advice of some friends, sent in 1841
to the Grammar School at Sedbergh, Yorkshire, where he was
trained by the Rev. J. H. Evans, a late Fellow of St. John’s College,
 Cambridge.      Here he remained until 1845.         In October of that
                                                 J
 year he entered as an undergraduate at St. ohn’s College, but soon
 after migrated to St. Catharine’s       College, graduating as B.A. in
 1849 in the Mathematical Tripos as Sixth Wrangler, and in the Clas
 sical Tripos in the Second Class. He proceeded to the degree of M.A.
in 1852, and in that year he was adjudged the special distinction of
bracketed <U+FB01>rst Tyrwhitt Hebrew Scholar.
    Soon after taking his degree, Mr. Je<U+FB01>ery accepted the post of
 Lecturer in the College of Civil Engineers at Putney, and in 1852 he
 was selected by the President and Fellows of Corpus Christi College,
 Oxford, to <U+FB01>ll the of<U+FB01>ce of Second Master of Pate’s Grammar School,
 at Cheltenham.       Sixteen years after, on the resignation of the Rev.
 Dr. Hayman, in 1868, he was appointed to succeed to the vacant
 Headmastership, an of<U+FB01>ce which he retained with success until his
 retirement in 1882.       Many of his pupils have acknowledged their
 indebtedness to Mr. Je<U+FB02>r'ery for their general success in life, some
 of whom have attained high distinction at the Universities, and in
 various competitive      examinations for admission into the public
 service.
     Although, while   at the Cheltenham Grammar                   J
                                                       School, Mr. e<U+FB01>ery’s
 of<U+FB01>cial time was more especially devoted to the classical department,
 it is as a pure mathematician that his name will be most remembered.
  Shortly after he permanently settled in Cheltenham he commenced
 the long and continuous series of investigations in pure mathematics
  which have enriched the pages of the ‘Quarterly Journal of Pure
  and Applied Mathematics,’ the ‘ Proceedings of the London Mathe
  matical Society,’ the ‘ Reports of the British Association,’ and other
  scienti<U+FB01>c journals.    His most important papers have been on pure
  analysis and analytical geometry, especially on the classi<U+FB01>cation of
  class-cubics, both in plane and spherical geometry.        Instalments of
  the similar classi<U+FB01>cation for class-quartics have also been published.
  He had been for some time engaged on the continuation of this work.
  The titles of a few of his numerous papers will give a suf<U+FB01>cient indi
  cation of the general character of his investigations :——“ Two Theo
  rems in Permutations and Combinations,          and a Theorem     in Con

                                    ix
           ”  “
gruencies ; The Spherical Ellipse referred to Trilinear Geordiuates ”;
“
   Cubics of the Third Class with Triple Foci, both Plane and Spheri
cal”; “ Spherical Class Cubics with Double Foci and Double Cyclic
Arcs”; “On Sphero-Cyclides”; “On the Identity of the Nodes of
a  Nodal Curve of the Fourth Order with those of its Quartic and
Sextic   Contravariants”; and “On the Genesis of Binodal Quartic
Curves from Conics.”                                    J
                          It appears to have been Mr. eff‘ery’s inten
tion to prepare a text-book on his favourite subjects.       Some pro
gress was made in the preparation of such a work, and he was looking
forward with considerable interest to the publication of a treatise
which he hoped would prove useful to the student of the higher
mathematics.     Only last summer, while the writer was enjoying his
hospitality, Mr. Jeffery exhibited to him a huge quantity of mathe
matical manuscript, beautifully written out for the press, in the pre
paration of which all his recent leisure hours had been devoted.      He
was anticipating with evident enthusiasm the prospect of an early
completion of his labours in this branch of pure mathematics by the
production of a text-book; but, alas! his wishes can never be real
ised, for the small portion of the work prepared for the press exists
only as a fragmentary record of his mathematical talents, and of the
 studious activity of his life to the end. His last original paper was
communicated to the London Mathematical Society only a few weeks
before his fatal illness, and it was read at the meeting of the Society
 on November 12, nine days after his decease.        In addition to his
 mathematical work, Mr. Jeffery has occasionally been occupied in
 other <U+FB01>elds of labour, mostly in classics, archaeology,       and topo
 graphical history. In 1853 he wrote, as a coadjutor with Dr. E.
 R. Humphreys, on classical composition in Greek iambics and Latin
 prose.
    On his retirement from Cheltenham Grammar School Mr. Jeffery,
 who was never married, took up his residence at Falmouth, partly
 that he might be in a convenient locality to undertake the manage
 ment of a considerable amount of house property inherited from his
 father, and partly on account of the comparatively mild winter
 climate of his native county.      Here be identi<U+FB01>ed himself with the
 active management of several local scienti<U+FB01>c institutions, especially
  of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, at Truro, and the Royal Corn
  wall Polytechnic Society, at Falmouth, in both of which he had <U+FB01>lled
  the of<U+FB01>ce of Vice-President, and was a valued contributor to their
 journals. His paper on the “Early Topography of Falmouth,” in
 the ‘Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall,’ is a most im
  portant contribution to the local history of that part of Cornwall.
  Mr. Jeffery was the Honorary Secretary of the new Falmouth Ob
  servatory, in which he has taken a great interest since its foundation.
  Mr.__Kitto, the Superintendent, has remarked that he was much
                                                                  d

                                         x
 indebted to him for assistance in the initial dif<U+FB01>culties of the mag
netograph work, a department of the Observatory to which Mr. ef           J
fery paid a constant personal attention.             He also retained much
affection for the Falmouth Grammar School, where he received his
early education, and this he was always ready to show by his advice
and pecuniary support.           His loss will be severely felt by all these
institutions.
     Mr. Jeffery was elected      a Fellow of the Royal Society on June 3,
1880, but, owing       to the distance of his residence from London, he
rarely had an opportunity of attending the meetings.             It was, how
ever, a great delight to him to spend a few weeks in London each
 year, and he usually chose the months of May or June, so that he
 might enjoy the pleasing association with his scienti<U+FB01>c friends at one
 of the annual conversaz'iones.         He also took great interest in the
meetings     of the  British Association   for the Advancemement of Science,
 at which he was a frequent attendant, and a contributor of papers.
 For some years past Mr. Jeffery was troubled, more or less, with an
 internal complaint which occasionally caused him considerable per
 sonal inconvenience, and, latterly, he su<U+FB01>ered from the effects of in
 somnia, but still he remained active to within a fortnight of his
 death, often walking from Falmouth to Truro, a distance of about nine
 or ten miles, without any apparent fatigue.           He was a great lover of
 long-walking exercise, and, even within a few weeks of his death,
  though in ill-health, he took a wearying walk of about twelve miles.
 When the writer visited him in the past summer, Mr. Je<U+FB02>ery ap
  peared to be in better health than usual ; but in the middle of October
  the disease became much aggravated, necessitating an operation, and,
  after a short illness, accompanied by much suffering, he gradually
  sank.     On the Saturday before his death he became partially uncon
  scious, and on the Monday following wholly so, and in this condition
  he passed away, peacefully, on the morning of Tuesday, November
  3, 1891, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.         Three days afterwards
  his remains were interred in the family vault, with his father and
  mother, at Gwennap, the country home of his early youth.
                                                                      E. D.
     HENRY BOWMAN BRADY, LL.D., was born in 1835.                 He was the
  second son of Henry Brady, of Gateshead, who for <U+FB01>fty years carried
  on an extensive practice as surgeon in that town.          He was educated
  at  the  schools  of the  Society  of Friends,  at Ackworth, and at Tulketh
  Hall, near Preston. His father was a naturalist, and instilled into
  his son   a love of nature, which was fostered at his <U+FB01>rst school; but
   the  in<U+FB02>uence   that shaped his mature career came from the colony of
   naturalists which has had its headquarters at Newcastle-on-Tyne for
   several generations.      The names of Bewick, Alder, Albany and John

                                    xi
Hancock, and others are those of men whom Newcastle has contri
buted to the roll of English naturalists, and the Brady family would
seem to have been thoroughly permeated with the local enthusiasm
for the study of natural history.                              _
   On leaving school, in 1850, Brady was apprenticed to the late Mr.
Thomas Harvey, pharmaceutical       chemist, of Leeds, and in 1855 he
entered upon business for himself in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
'
   His conspicuous ability soon gained for him the support of the
medical profession and the public, and he laid the foundation of the
very extensive business in wholesale and retail pharmacy and scien
ti<U+FB01>c apparatus subsequently conducted by the <U+FB01>rm of Brady and
Martin. During the twenty-one years of his business life, Mr. Brady
was closely identi<U+FB01>ed with the Pharmaceutical Society, and he
became the President of the British Pharmaceutical        Conference in
1872.    He was for many years on the Council of the Pharmaceutical
Society, and greatly contributed to the progress of that body by
developing the scienti<U+FB01>c education of pharmaceutical chemists.
   His more direct contributions to science were in the form of re
searches in natural history, especially on the Foraminifera. His <U+FB01>rst
publication seems to have been a contribution, in 1863, to the British
Association, as a report on the dredging of the Northumberland coast
and Dogger Bank; his last was a paper which appeared only a short
time ago, on the minute organisms with which his name will always
be connected.    Between these two he published a large number of
researches, including a monograph on Carboniferous and Permian
Foraminifera, an exhaustive report on the Foraminifera of the “ Chal
        ”
lenger    Expedition, as well as monographs on Parker'ia and Loftusia,
and on Polymorphina, in which he was joint author with Mr. W. K.
Parker, F.R.S., and Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S. The report on
the Foraminifera is embodied in two quarto volumes, one containing
814 pages of text, and the other 114 plates, which possess great artistic
merit.    The bibliography of the subject alone occupies forty-six pages
of the <U+FB01>rst volume.      The illustrations of such works are of much
importance, and the author gave to this department of his work the
fastidious care of a skilled draughtsman.       By these works he not
only established a position both in this country and abroad as one of     _
the highest authorities on the subject, but, what is of more import
ance, largely advanced our knowledge.       Every one of his papers is
characterised by the most canscientious accuracy and justice; and
though his attention was largely directed to classi<U+FB01>cation and to the
morphological points therein involved, his mind, as several of his
papers indicate, was also occupied with the wider problems of mor
phological and biological interest which the study of these lowly
                          ‘
forms suggests.
   In  1874 he was elected a  Fellow of this Society, and in 1888 served

                                     xii
on our  Council.     In the same year the University of Aberdeen con
ferred upon   him   the  degree of LL.D., in recognition of his scienti<U+FB01>c
work, and he also received from the Emperor of Austria a valuable
gold medal, as a mark of his appreciation of the valuable assistance
which Mr. Brady had rendered to the Hof-Museum.
   He was a man of slight physique and delicate health, and in later
years he was compelled to leave his business and seek refuge in
warmer climates than our own.        In his travels he visited the United
States of America, the Upper Nile, India, Ceylon, Japan, Java,
Australia, New Zealand, and various islands of the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean.
His last journey was in the winter of 1890, when, with some friends,
he visited Cairo and ascended the Nile.         He was laid up at Cairo
 with (edema of the feet and legs, from which he never quite recovered,
but the actual cause of his death, which occurred on the 10th of
January, 1891, was a rapid attack of pneumonia.
   He accomplished an immense amount of work, which remains as a
monument to his unwearied patience and industry. His amiability
won for him a large circle of friends, and he could have wished no
higher tribute to his memory than that offered by Dr. Michael Foster,
who wrote as follows in ‘ Nature,’ January 29th, 1891 :—-“ Science
has lost a steady and fruitful worker, and many men of science
have lost a friend and a helpmate whose place they feel no one
else can <U+FB01>ll.    His wide knowledge of many branches of scienti<U+FB01>c
inquiry and     his   large acquaintance with scienti<U+FB01>c men made the
hours spent with him always pro<U+FB01>table; his sympathy with art
and literature, and that special knowledge of men and things which
belongs only to the travelled man, made him welcome also where
science was unknown, while the brave patience with which he bore
the many troubles of enfeebled health, his unsel<U+FB01>sh thoughtfulness
for interests other than his own, and a sense of humour which, when
 needed, led him to desert his usual staid demeauour for the merriment
 of the moment, endeared him to all his friends.”
    The catalogues of the Royal Society show that, down to 1883, Mr.
 Brady was the author of thirty papers and monographs.              He has
 bequeathed to the Society the very valuable portion of his library
 which relates to the study of the Protozoa.        This collection, which
 now forms a distinct section of the Society's Library, and for the
 maintenance and increase of which he made provision, consists of
 some 150 volumes,including, besides many older works on the subject
 of great rarity and value, his extensive series of collected excerpt
 ‘
   Memoirs   and Papers relating to the Foraminifera,’ gathered,
 arranged, and annotated by him during many years of labour.

 was the seventh of seventeen children, of whom Sir James Paget,
 Bart, F.R.S., is the only survivor. His early education was at the
 Charterhouse.    He was admitted at Caius College, Cambridge, in
 1827, and graduated    in Arts  as Eighth Wrangler in   1831.    He was
 elected Fellow of his college in 1832, graduated as MB. in 1833 and.
 as  M.D. in 1839, was elected physician to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in
 1841, and held the of<U+FB01>ce for forty-three years, retiring in 1884, when
 a marble bust of him was placed in the hospital, as a memorial of his
 long and valued services.     He represented the University of Cam
 bridge on the General Medical Council from 1864: to 1869, and was
 then chosen President of the Council, from which post he retired in
 187&.   In 1872 he was appointed Regius Professor of Physic by the
 Crown, and held the o<U+FB01>ce till his death. He became Fellow of the

honour done him by the Queen and by various universities.          These
qualities and his genial, kind manner gave him a large circle of warm
friends. Added to all this, his brightness and cheerfulness, his great
stores of accurate information and his inexhaustible fund of anecdotes
and stories, the relation of which in his precise and humorous style
was most telling, and his fondness of social life made him a delightful
companion.     He was a spare, brisk, active man, enjoyed good health,

   SIR JAMES CAIRD was the son of James Caird, of Stranraer.         He
was born in 1816, educated at Edinburgh High School and University,
                                                                e

and at an early period turned his attention to those agricultural and
economic questions to which he eventually devoted the greater part
of his life.
    In 1849 appeared the <U+FB01>rst edition of his work on ‘ High Farming,’
and in the autumn of that year he visited Ireland, which was still
suifering from the e<U+FB01>ects of the famine of 1846—47, and reported to
the Government upon the agricultural outlook in that island.        In the
following year ‘The Times’ obtained the services of Mr. Caird as
commissioner to investigate the condition of agriculture in England.
 His letters to that newspaper constituted the <U+FB01>rst general account of
 English agriculture since the time of Arthur Young, and they after
 wards appeared in book form. In 1859 he published an account of a
 visit to the Prairie Lands of the Mississippi Basin, directing atten
 tion to their extraordinary agricultural capabilities.
    In 1857 Mr. Caird entered Parliament, and in the session of 1864
he at length carried a resolution in favour of the collection of agri
cultural statistics.   As a result of this vote the Agricultural Returns
for Great Britain were commenced. These have been issued annually
since 1866, and have proved of the highest value.        In 1869 he again
visited Ireland and published a pamphlet on the Land Question.
    After the great Indian famine of 1876—77, Mr. Caird served upon
 the Commission which was appointed to enquire into the Whole sub
 ject, and he afterwards embodied his own views and conclusions in
his work, ‘ India; the Land and the People.’
    In 1882 Mr. Caird was knighted, being created K.C.B. In 1886
he joined Earl Cowper’s Irish Commission, and in 1889, upon the
 formation of the new Board of Agriculture, Sir James Caird became
a member of the Board, and was appointed a Privy Councillor.          One
-of his last undertakings was the preparation, at the request of the
 Royal Agricultural Society of England, of an account of the work of
the Society during the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>fty years of its existence. This valuable
 retrospect appeared in 1890, in the opening number of the Third
 Series of the Society’s Journal, under the title of “ Fifty Years’ Pro
gress of British Agriculture.”
    Sir James Caird was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
 1875.   He was a    JP. for Kirkcudbrightshire, and a D.L. and J.P. for
Wigtonshire.      He died in London, February 9, 1892.
    COLONEL JAMES AUGUSTUS      GRANT, O.B., O.S.I., died at Nairn on the
11th February.        He was born at Nairn in 1827, “a son of the
manse,” being the son of the parish minister.       After being educated
at the Grammar School, and at Marischal College, Aberdeen, he
obtained in 1846 a commission in the Indian Army.             In India he
saw much hard service: was present at the two sieges of Mooltan,
the battle of Gujerat, the relief of Lucknow, under Havelock, and

                                     XV
  his <U+FB01>ngerless    right hand   bore testimony      to the wounds   he re
  'ceived.
     But his claim to fame and public notice rests upon his work as an
   African explorer, at a time when a dark pall of ignorance still spread
  over most of Central Africa, and when the real sources of the Nile
   were still a mystery.   In 1859 Burton and Speke returned from the
  heart of Africa, after the former had discovered Lake Tanganyika,
   and the latter Lake Ukerewe, which he named the Victoria Nyanza,
  and rightly conjectured to be the main source of the Nile.           But
  the two allies quarrelled, and Grant from the <U+FB01>rst championed his
  friend Speke, and accompanied him in 1860 when he was commis
  sioned by the Royal Geographical Society to lead an expedition for
  the exploration of the Victoria Nyanza.       Crossing to the mainland
  from Zanzibar, the travellers marched by Unyanyembé to the country
  on the west shore of the lake.       There they made friends with the
   King Rumanika, of whom, and the men who constituted the ruling
  population of the region, Grant often spoke in kindly remembrance.
  He had a high opinion both of the country and of the people, and was
  wont to compare the chiefs, with their retainers, to the old chiefs of
  his native Highlands, who, like them, were cattle rearers and cattle
  raiders, proud of their descent, scornful of work, but hospitable and
  honourable after their own fashion.       In July, 1862, the explorers
‘
  reached their goal, the point  where  the Nile issues from the northern
  shore of the Victoria Nyanza, thus verifying Speke’s prediction.
  They followed the Nile for 120 miles, when they were obliged to
  leave it, but they struck it again 70 miles lower down, and at length
  reached Gondokoro,      in February, 1863, where they met Samuel
  Baker, who had been sent out to assist them. On their return to
  England the two explorers were received with enthusiasm.           Grant
  was given the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1864,
  in which year he published an interesting and instructive work, under
                                    ”
  the title “ A Walk across Africa ; he also contributed to the account of
  the botany of the expedition, which <U+FB01>lls a volume of the ‘ Transactions
  of the Linnean Society.’ In 1866 he was made a Companion of the
  Bath. In 1868 he served in the Abyssinian campaign, and for his
  services was made a Companion of the Star of India.         He became a
  Fellow of the Royal Society in 1873.
     He was one of the simplest, most modest, and genial of men, and a
  universal favorite : a man of commanding stature, but with the
  kindliest expression of face. After his return from Abyssinia, his
  time was mostly spent between London and Nairn.           His death has
  caused a sad blank in the large circle of his friends and acquaintances.
