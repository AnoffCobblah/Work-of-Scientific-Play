                                              I. Nebulw.
       In   a paper communicated to the                  Royal Society on November 15th,
  1887,      I  showed that the nebula: are composed of sparse meteorites,
  the collisions of which bring about a rise of temperature sc<U+FB02>icient to
I render luminous one of their chief constituents—magnesium.                                                This
  conclusion was arrived at from the facts that the chief nebula lines
  are coincident in position with the <U+FB02>uting and lines visible in the
  bunsen burner when magnesium is introduced, and that the <U+FB01>nting is

   [888.]         of  the various Species of Heavenly Bodies.                 3
   far brighter at that temperature than almost any other spectral line
  or <U+FB02>uting of any element whatever.
       I suggested that the association or non-association of hydrogen
  line: with the lines due to the olivine constituents of the meteorites
  might be an indication of the greater or less sparseness of the swarm.
  the greatest sparseness being the condition de<U+FB01>ning fewest colli
  sions, and therefore one least likely to show hydrogen.         This sugges
  tion was made partly because observations of comets and laboratory
  work have abundantly shown that great liability to collision in the
  one case, and increase of temperature in the other, are accompanied
  by the appearance of the carbon spectrum instead of the hydrogen
 spectrum.
      The now demonstrated meteoric origin of these celestial bodies
  renders it needful to discuss the question in somewhat greater detail,
  with a. view to classi<U+FB01>cation ; and to do this thoroughly it is requisite
  that we should study the rich store of facts which chie<U+FB02>y Sir William
  Herschel’s labours have placed before us regarding the various forms
 of nebulae, in order to ascertain what light, if any, the new view
  throws on their development.
      To do this the treatment must be vastly different from that—the
 only one we can pursue—utilised in the case of the stars, the images
 of all, or nearly all, of which appear to us as points of light more or
 less minute; while, in the case of the nebulae, forms of the most
 de<U+FB01>nite and, in many cases, of the most fantastic kind, have been long
 recognised as among their chief characteristics.
      It will at once be evident that since the luminosity of the meteorites
depends upon collisions, the light from them, and from the glow of
 the gases produced from them, can only come from those parts of u
 meteor-swarm in which collisions are going on. Visibility is not the
 only criterion of the existence of matter in space; dark bodies may
 exist in all parts of space, but visibility in any part of the heavens
 means, not only matter, but collisions, or the radiation of a mass of
 vapour produced at some time or other by collisions.             The appear
ances which these bodies present to us may bear            little  relation to
 their actual form, but may represent merely surfaces, or loci of
disturbance.
     It  seemed   proper, then, that  I should seek to determine whether
the view     I have put forward explains the phenomena as satisfactorily
as they have been explained by old ones, and, whether, indeed, it can
go further and make some points clear which before were dark.
    To do this it is not necessary in the present paper to dwell at any
great length either on those appearances which were termed nebu
10sitz'es by Sir William Herschel       or on irregular nebulae generally;
but it must be remarked that the very great extension of the former
-—-which there is little reason to doubt will be vastly increased by
                                                                    n 2

 increase of optical power and improvement in observing conditions
 and stations—may be held to strengthen the view that space is really
 a meteoritic plenum, while the forms indicate motions and crossings
 and interpenetrations      of streams or sheets, the brighter portions
 being due to a greater number of collisions per unit volume.
    From this point of view it is also possible that many stars, instead
 of being true condensed swarms due to the nebulous development to‘
 which we have referred, are simply appearances produced by the
 intersection of streams of meteorites.         They are, then, referable to
 an intensi<U+FB01>cation of the conditions which gave rise to the brighter
 appearances recorded by Herschel here and there in his di<U+FB01>used
 nebulosities.    The nebulous appendages sometimes seen in connexion
 with stars strengthen this view.
    When we come to the more regular forms we <U+FB01>nd that they may
 be generalised into three groups, according as the formative action
 seems working towards a centre; round a centre in a plane or nearly
 so ; or in one direction only. As a result we have globular, spheroidal,
and comet-i0 nebulae.     I propose to deal with each in turn.
                               Globular Nebulae.
    The remarkable appearance presented by           the so-called planetary
 nebulae   requires that I should refer to them in some detail.            Sir
 William Herschel does not describe them at any great length, but in
 his paper on “ Nebulous Stars ” he alludes to the planetary nebulosity
 which in many cases is accompanied by a star in the centre, and
                                          “ the
 <U+FB01>nally comes to the conclusion that             nebulosity about the star is
                          ”
 not of a starry nature     (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 81, 1791, p. 73.)
    Sir John Herschel, in his valuable memoir published in ‘Phil.
 Trans,’ 1833, describes them as “ hollow shells” (p. 500). It was so
 dif<U+FB01>cult to explain anything like their appearance by ordinary ideas
of stellar condensation that Arago, as quoted by Nichol (‘ Architec
ture of the Heavens,’ p. 86), abandoning altogether the idea that they
represented clusters of stars or pal-took in any wise of a stellar con
stitution, imagined them as hollow spherical envelopes, in substance
cloudy and opaque, or rather semi-transparent;              a brilliant body
invisible in the centre illuminating this spherical <U+FB01>lm, so that it was
made visible by virtue of light coming through it and scattered by
re<U+FB02>ection from its atoms or molecules.
   Lord Rosse (‘Phil. Trans,’ vol. 140, 1850, p. 507) records that
nearly all the planetary nebula: which he had observed up to that
time had been found to be perforated.         In only one case was a perfo
ration not detected, but in this ansaa were observed, introducing into
the subject for the <U+FB01>rst time the idea of nebulous bodies resembling
to a certain extent the planet Saturn.       But Lord Rosse, although he
thus disposed of the idea of Arago, still considered that the annular

1888.]          of   the various Species  of Heavenly Bodies.                  5
nebulae were really hollow shells, the       perforation  indicating an appa
rently transparent centre.
    Huggins and Miller subsequently suggested that the phenomena
represented by the planetary nebulaa might be explained without
reference to the supposition of a shell (or a <U+FB02>at disk) if we consider
them to be masses of glowing gas, the whole mass of the gas being
incandescent, so that only a luminous surface would be visible (‘ Phil.
Trans,’ vol. 154, 1864-, p. 442).
    It will be seen that all these hypotheses are mutually destructive;
but it is right that     I should state, in referring to the last one, that the
demonstration that these bodies are not masses of glowing gas merely
has been rendered possible by observations of .spectra which were not
available to Dr. Huggins when his important discovery of the bright
line spectrum of nebulae was given to the world.
    It remains, then, to see whether the meteoritic hypothesis can explain
 these appearances       when it is acknowledged that all the prior ones
 have broken down.          If we for the sake of the greatest simplicity
consider a swarm of meteorites at rest, and then assume that others
 from without approach it from all directions, their previous paths
 being de<U+FB02>ected, the question arises whether there will not be at some
distance from the centre of the swarm a. region in which collisions
 will be most valid. If we can answer this question in the af<U+FB01>rmative,
 it will follow that some of the meteorites arrested here will begin to
 move in almost circular orbits round the common centre of gravity.
     The major axes of these orbits may be assumed to be not very
diverse, and we may further assume that, to begin with, one set will
 preponderate over the rest. Their elliptic paths may throw the peri
 astron passage to a. considerable distance from the common centre of
 gravity; and if we assume that the meteorites with this common
 mean distance are moving in all planes, and that some are direct and
 some retrograde, there will be a. shell in which more collisions will
 take place than elsewhere.      Now, this collision surface will be practically
 the only thing visible, and will present to us the exact and hitherto unex
 plained appearance of a planetary nebula—a. body of the same intensity
 of luminosity at its edge and centre—thus putting on an almost phos
 phorescent appearance.
     If the collision region has any great thickness, the centre should
 appear dimmer than the portion nearer the edge.
     Such a. collision surface, as I use the term, is presented to us during
 a meteoric display by the upper part of our atmosphere.
     I  append a diagram, Fig. 1, which shows how, if we thus
 assume movement round a. common centre of gravity in a mass of
 meteorites, one of the conditions of movement being that the peri
 astron distance shall be somewhat considerable, the mechanism which
  produces the appearance of a planetary nobula is at once made appa

conditions of all the orbits with reference to the major axis shall be
nearly identical, but the appearances would not be very greatly altered
if we take the more probable case in which there will be plus and
minus values.

                                       is reached.
   If we grant the initial condition of the formation of a collision
shell, we can not only explain the appearances put on by planetary
nebuhe, buta continuation of the same line of thought readily explains
those various other classes to which Herschel has referred, in which
condensations are brought about, either by a gradual condensation
towards the centre, or by what may be termed successive jumps.
These condensations doubtless are among the earliest stages of nebular
development.
   To explain these forms we have only to consider what will happen
to the meteorites which undergo collision in the <U+FB01>rst shell. They will
necessarily start in new orbits, and it is suggested that an interior
collision-shell will in this way be formed.
   In consequence of the collisions the orbits will have a tendency to
get more and more elliptic, while the pericentric distance will at the
same time be reduced ; the swarm will, in consequence of this action,

      portion.    As in the former case, the luminosity of the fainter portion is due to
      the collisions which occur along the sphere of intersection represented by the
      larger circle.   After collision the meteorites will travel in new orbits, and there
      will be an additional sphere of intersection, represented by the smaller circle.

    In such meteor-swarms as those we have considered, it must be that
rotation is, sooner or later, set up. Otherwise it would be impossible
to account for the spheroidal nebulae at all.                    I am aware that in
Newton’s opinion the cause of this rotation was not mechanical, but
the moment we assume a meteoric origin of these globular clusters it
is straining the facts to assume that the intake will be exactly the
same at all points, and the moment the bombardment is more or less
localised, rotation must follow sooner or later. Sir William Herschel,
in his paper of 1811 (p. 319), says, “ If we consider this matter in a.
general light, it appears that every <U+FB01>gure which is not already globui
lar must have eccentric nebulous matter, which, in itslendeavouc

FIG. 8.—Suggestion as to the origin of a nebulous star. The orbits of the inner set
      of meteorites are very elliptic, so that the shell of inlersection appears almost

 to come to the centre, will either dislodge some uebulosity which is
 already deposited, or slide upon it sideways, and in both cases produce
 a circular motion; so that, in fact, we can hardly suppose a possible
 production of a globular form without a subsequent revolution of
 nebulous matter, which in the end may settle in a regular rotation
 about some <U+FB01>xed axis.”
     Given, then, a globular swarm with a rotation around an axis, we
 have to discuss the phenomena produced by collisions under a new
                                                                  '
 set of circumstances.
     Here at once we have to account for the fact that the nearly
  spherical forms are very short-lived, for they are very rare ; we seem
 to jump, as it were, from globes to very extended spheroids.
     If it be conceded that from the above considerations we are justi<U+FB01>ed
 in supposing that the elliptic and other spheroidal nebulw really repre
 sent a higher stage of evolution than those presented to us by the
  globular form, it is clear that on the meteoritic hy'pothesis the greater
 part of the phenomena will represent to us what happens to such a
  system under the condition of a continuous bombardment of meteor
 ites from without.
  ' So
          soon as we have a minor axis, there will at <U+FB01>rst be most colli
  sions caused by the movements of meteors, the paths of which are
  most nearly parallel to it; the result of this will be that the equatorial
  plane will be intensi<U+FB01>ed, and then, later on, if we conceive the system

  as a very extended spheroid,    it is obvious that meteorites approaching
  it  in directions parallel to its minor axis will have fewer chances of
  collisions than those which approach it, from whatever azimuth, in
  what we may term the equatorial plane.             These evidently, at all
  events if they enter the system in any quantity, will do for the
  equatorial plane exactly what their fellows were supposed to do
  for the section in <U+FB01>g. 1, and we shall have on the general back
  ground of the symmetrically rotating nebula, which may almost be
  invisible in consequence of its constituent meteorites all travelling
  the same way and with nearly equal velocities, curves indicating the
  regions along which the entrance of the new swarm is interfering
  with the movements of the old one; if they enter in excess from any
  direction, we shall have broken rings or spirals.
     This was suggested in my last paper. Various segments of rings
  will indicate the regions where most collisions are possible, and the
  absence of luminosity in the centre by no means demonstrates            the
  absence of meteorites there.
     Researches by Lord Rosse and others have given us forms of
   nebulae which may be termed sigmoid and Saturnine, and these
   suggest that they and the elliptical nebula themselves are really pro
   duced by the rotation of what was at <U+FB01>rst a globular rotating swarm
  of meteorites, and that in these later revelations we pick up those
  forms which are produced by the continued <U+FB02>attening of the sphere
  into a spheroid under the meteoric conditions stated.       It is worthy of
   remark that all the forms taken on by the so-called elliptic nebulae
  described by the two Herschels, and by the spiral, sigmoid, and
   Saturnine forms which have been added to them by the labours of
  Lord Reese and others, are recalled in the most striking manner by
  the ball of oil in Plateau’s experiment, when rotations of different
  velocities are imparted to it.
     The Saturnine form may, indeed, in some cases represent either the
  <U+FB01>rst or last stages in this period of the evolutionary process.       I say
  may represent, in consequence of the extreme di<U+FB02>icnlty in making the
  observations so that in the early stages a spherical nebula, beginning
  to change into a spheroid, may have its real spheroidal <U+FB01>gure cloaked
  by various conditions of illumination.
     The true Saturnine form must, as in the case of Saturn itself,
. represent one of the latest forms in the meteor-swarm, because, if it
  be not continually fed from without, collisions must sooner or later
  bring all the members of the swarm to the centre of <U+FB01>gure.

     I  do not know that any explanation has, so far, been suggested as
  to the origin of these curious forms, which were <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>gured by
  Sir William Herschel, and of which a number have recently been

observed     in the southern hemisphere (‘ Observations of the Southern
Nebulaa, made with the Great Melbourne Telescope,’ Part I).                    It
is clear that in them the conditions are widely different from those
hitherto considered in this paper.         I think that the meteoritic hypo
thesis satisfactorily explains them, on the supposition that we have
either a very condensed swarm moving at a very high velocity
through a sheet of meteorites at rest, or the swarm at rest surrounded
by a sheet all moving in the same direction.           It is a question of rela
tive velocity.
    If  we consider the former case,    it is clear that    the collision region
will   be in the rear of the swarm, that the collisions      will be due to the
convergence      of the members of the sheet due to the gravity of the
swarm, and that the collision region will spread out like a fan behind
the swarm.
    The angle of the fan, and the distance to which the collisions are
valid, will depend upon the velocity of the condensed swarm.

                    II.  Stars with Bright Lines 01' Flutings.
    I  pointed out in my last paper that those stars in the spectra of
which bright lines had been observed were in all probability the <U+FB01>rst
result of nebulous condensation, both their continuous spectrum and
that of the surrounding vapour being produced by a slightly higher
temperature than that observed in nebula) in which similar though
 not identical phenomena are observed.
    I  have recently continued my inquiries on this point; and            I may
 say that all     I  have recently learned has con<U+FB01>rmed the conclusions         I
 drew in my last paper, while many of the di<U+FB02>iculties have disappeared.
 Before    I  refer to these inquiries, however, it is necessary to clear the
 ground by referring to the old view regarding the origin of bright
 lines in stellar spectra, and to the question of hydrogen.
 Reference to the Old View by which it was supposed some of the           Bright
                     line Phenomena might be accounted for.
    In the views which,       some years ago, were advanced by myself and
 others,  to account for the bright lines seen in some of the “ stars ” to
which reference has been made, the analogy on which they were based
 was founded on solar phenomena; the “ stars " in question being sup
 posed to be represented in structure by our central luminary.               The
 main constituent of the solar atmosphere outside the photosphere is
hydrogen, and it was precisely this substance which was chie<U+FB02>y
 revealed by these stellar observations and in the Novas, in which
 cases it was sometimes predominant.          A tremendous development of

an atmosphere like that of the sun seemed to supply the explanation
of the phenomena.
    Acting on this view in 1878," I attempted to catch these chromo
spheric lines in a Lyraa, abandoning the use of a cylindrical lens in
front of the slit with this object in view.
    Further, it was quite clear that if such gigantic snpraphotospheric
atmospheres existed, their bright lines might much modify their real
                                  “ worlds without                   "
absorption spectra; even                                  hydrogen      might be thus
 explained without supposing a lusus naturre, and so                       I  explained
them.
    That this view is untenable, as I now believe, and that it is unneces
sary, will,    I think, be seen from what follows. A long series of newly
described phenomena, which are absolutely incomprehensible while it
is applied to them, <U+FB01>nd,        I  think, a simple and suf<U+FB01>cient explanation.
I  must hold that the view is untenable, because how a body constituted
in any way like the sun could change its magnitude from the thirteenth
to the sixth every year or so, or change its hydrogen lines from bright
to dark once a week, passes comprehension; and the more closely a
“star ” resembles the sun the less likely are such changes to happen.
Even the minor evolutionary changes are inexplicable on this hypo
thesis, chie<U+FB01>y because in a completely condensed mass the temperature
must be very high and constant, while I have shown that the spectro
scopic phenomena are those of a specially low temperature ; and                         I
may now add that many of the objects are extremely variable in the
quantity and quality of the light they emit.
    Another cause of the appearance of the hydrogen lines has been
suggested by Mr. Johnstone Stoney (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 17, p. 54).
He considers it due to the clashing together of the atmospheres of two
   .  “ . . . The sun which we see, the sun which sends us the majority of the light
we receive, is but a small kernel in a gigantic nut, so that the diameter of the real
sun may he, say, 2,000,000 miles.      Suppose then that some stars have very large
coronal atmospheres ; if the area of the coronal atmosphere is small compared with
the area of the section of the true disk of the sunI of course we shall get an ordinary
spectrum of the star; that is to say, we shall get the indications of absorption
which make us class the stars apart; we shall get a continuous spectrum barred by
dark lines.    But suppose that the area of the coronal atmosphere is something very
considerable indeed, let us assume that it has an arca, say <U+FB01>fty times greater than
the section of the kernel of the star itself; now, although each unit of surface of
that coronal atmosphere may be much less luminous than an equal unit of surface
of the true star at the centre, yet, if the area be very large, the spectroscopic writing
of that large am will become visible side by side with the dark lines due to the
brilliant region in the centre where we can study absorption; other lines (bright
ones) proceeding from the exterior portion of that star will be visible in the
spectrum of the apparent point we calla star.        Now it is di<U+FB02>icult to say whether
such a body as that is a star or a nebula.     We may look upon it as a nebula in a
certain stage of condensation;    we may look upon it as a star at a certain stage of

raised by the friction to brilliant incandescence.
    Another objection we can urge against the old view is that all
bodies in the universe cannot be <U+FB01>nished suns in the ordinary sense,
and that it leaves out of account all possible processes of manufacture,
not only of single stars, but of double and multiple systems, at all
stages between nebula and sun; while the new one, by simply changing
the unit from the star to each individual constituent, it is hardly too
much to say, explains everything, though it is perfectly true that
in   some   of the steps a considerable acquaintance with spectroscopic
phenomena is necessary to realise the beauty and the stringency of the
solutions.
         The Question of Hydrogen    in the Case of Bright-Zine Stars.
    It may    be convenient   also that   I should summarise the various
conditions    under which the lines of hydrogen are observed in the
meteoritic    swarms we are now considering.
    In the   “ nebulaa” we
                             begin with the widest interspaces. Future
investigation may, as    I  have suggested, show that those in which the
hydrogen lines are absent are the most widely spaced of all.         Be this
as it may, it is a matter of common knowledge that in the brighter
nebulm, such as that of Orion, to take an instance, we have hydrogen
associated with the low-temperature radiation of olivine.          That the
hydrogen is electrically excited to produce this glow is proved by the
fact that the temperature of the meteorites themselves must be very
low; otherwise the magnesium would not show itself without the
manganese and iron constituents, and the continuous spectrum would
be much brighter and longer than it is.
    In the former paper I showed that in my laboratory experi
ments, when the pressure was slightly increased in a tube containing
gases obtained from meteorites, the carbon bands began to be visible.
 We should expect this to happen therefore in a meteor swarm at some
 point at which the mean interstitial space was smaller than that
accompanied by the appearance of the hydrogen lines; and it would be
natural that both should be seen together at an early stage and both
feeble, by which    I mean not strOngly developed, as hydrogen is not
 strongly developed even in the nebula of Orion, none of the ultra
violet lines being visible in a photograph, while the magnesium
line is.
    The association of the low-temperature lines of hydrogen with the
<U+FB01>utings of carbon is therefore to be expected, and            I shall subse
quently show that we have such an association in the so-called bright
line stars; and even at a further stage of development, in stars like
a Orionis, the hydrogen is still associated with the carbon.

       The Cometic Nature Qf Stars with Bright Lines in their Spectra.
    Seeing that the hypothesis         I  am working on demands that the
luminosity in stars and the bright lines in their spectra are produced
by the collisions of meteorites, the spectra of those bodies must in
part resemble those of comets, in which bodies by common consent
the luminosity is now acknowledged to be produced by collisions of
meteorites.
    We must, however, consider the vast di<U+FB01>ierence in the way in which
the phenomena of distant and near meteoric groups are necessarily
presented to us; and, further, we must bear in mind that in the case
of comets, however it may arise, there is an action which drives the
vapours produced by impacts outward from the swarm in a direction
opposite to that of the sun.
    It must be a very small comet which, when examined spectro
scopically in the usual manner, does not in consequence of the size
 of the image on the slit enable us to differentiate between the spectra
 of the nucleus and envelopes.          The spectrum of the latter is usually
 so obvious, and the importance of observing it so great, that the
details of the continuous spectrum of the nucleus, however bright it
may be, are almost overlooked.
    A moment’s consideration, however, will show that if the same
comet were so far away that its whole image would be reduced to a
 point on the slit-plate of the instrument, the differentiation of the
 spectra would be lost ; we should have an integrated spectrum in
 which the brightest edges of the carbon bands, or some of them,
 would or would not be seen superposed on a continuous spectrum.
    The conditions of observation of comets and stars being so different,
 any comparison is really very dif<U+FB01>cult; but the best way of proceeding
 is to begin with the spectrum of comets, in which, in most cases, for
the reason given, the phenomena are much more easily and accurately
recorded.
    But even in the nucleus of acomet as in a. star it is much more easy
to be certain of the existence of bright lines than to record their exact
positions,‘ and as a. matter of fact bright lines, including in all pro
 bability hydrogen, have been recorded, notably in Comet Wells and
in the great comet of 1882.
    The main conclusion to which my researches have led me is that
the stems now under consideration are almost identical in constitution
with comets between that condition in which, as in those of 1866 and
 1867, they give us the absolute spectrum of a nebula and that put on
by the great comet of 1882.

indications of many lines just beyond the verge of distinct visibility."—~Copoland.

  14            Mr.   J.  N. Lockyer.    On the Classi<U+FB01>cation     [Apr. 12,
     I am aware that this conclusion is a startling one, but a little con
 sideration will show its high probability, and a summary of all the
  facts proves it, I think, beyond all question.
     While we have bright lines in comets, it can be shown that some of
  them are the remnants of <U+FB02>utinga. Thus in Comet           III of 1881, as
  the carbon lines died away the chief manganese <U+FB02>uting at 558 became
 conspicuously visible; it had really been recorded before then. The
 individual observations are being mapped in order that the exact facts
 may be shown.       It may probably be asked how it happened that the
 <U+FB02>uting of magnesium at 500 was not also visible.        Its absence, how
 ever, can be accounted for: it was masked by the brightest carbon
 <U+FB02>uting at 517, whereas the carbon <U+FB02>uting which under other circum
 stances might mask the manganese <U+FB02>nting at 558 is always among
 the last to appear very bright and the <U+FB01>rst to disappear.
    In the great comet of 1882, which was most carefully mapped by
 Copeland, very many lines were seen, and indeed many were recorded,
 and it looks as if a complete study of this map will put us in posses
 sion of many of the lines recorded by Sherman in the spectrum of
 q Cassiopeiaa.    We have then three marked species of non-revolving
 swarms going     on   all fours with three marked species of revolving
 ones, and in this we have an additional argument for the fact that
 the absence in the former of certain <U+FB02>utings which we should expect
 to <U+FB01>nd may be attributed to masking by the carbon <U+FB02>utings.
    We have next, then, to show that there are carbon bands in the
bright-line   stars.
    There is evidence of this. Among the bright lines recorded is
the brightest carbon <U+FB01>uting at 517.        This is associated with those
lines of magnesium       and manganese  and iron visible at a low tempera
ture which have been seen in comets.
    But we have still more evidence of the existence of carbon. In
a whole group of bright-line stars there is a bright band recorded
at about 470, while, less refrangible than it, there appears a broad
absorption band.       I  regard it as extremely probable that we have
here the bright carbon band 467—474, and that the appearance of an
absorption band is due to the fact that the continuous spectrum of
the meteorites extends only a short distance into the blue.
    If we consider such a body as Wells's comet, or the great comet of
1882, at so great a distance from us that only an integrated spectrum
would reach us, in these cases the spectrum would appear to extend
very far, and more or less continuously, into the blue; but this
appearance would be brought about, not by the continuous spectra of
the meteorites themselves, but by the addition of the hydrocarbon
<U+FB01>uting at 431 to the other hot and cold carbon bands in that part of
the spectrum.
    There are other grounds which may be brought forward to suggest

1888.]            of  the various Species      of Heavenly Bodies.                15
that the di<U+FB01>erence between comets and the stars now under discussion
is more instrumental than physical.
    Supposing that the cometic nature of these bodies be conceded,
laboratory work will eventually show us which <U+FB02>utings and lines
will be added to the nebula spectrum upon each rise of tempera
ture.
    The di<U+FB02>iculties of the stellar observations must always be borne in
mind.       It will also be abundantly clear that a bright <U+FB02>uting added to
a continuous spectrum may produce the idea of a bright line at the
sharpest edge to one observer, while to another the same edge will
appear to be preceded by an absorption band.
       III.  Stars with Bright Fluttngs accompanied          by Dark- Flutings.
    I also   showed in the paper to which reference has been made that
 the so.called “stars” of Class <U+FB01>le of Vogel's classi<U+FB01>cation are not
 masses of vapour like our sun, but really swarms of meteorites ; the
 spectrum being a compound one, due to the radiation of vapour in
 the interspaces and the absorption of the light of the red- or white
 hot meteorites by vapours volatilised out of them by the heat produced
 by collisions.      The radiation is that of carbon vapour, and some of
 the absorption, I stated, was produced by the chief <U+FB02>utings of manga
 nese.
     These conclusions were arrived at by comparing the wave-lengths
 of the details of spectra recorded in my former paper with those of
 the bands given by Dunér in his admirable observations on these
 bodies!
     The discovery of the cometic nature of the bright-line stars greatly
 strengthens the view        I then put forward, not only with regard to the
 presence of the bright <U+FB01>utings of carbon, but with regard to the actual
chemical substances driven into vapour.                From the planetary nebula:
 there is an undoubted orderly sequence of phenomena through the
 bright-line stars to those now under consideration, if successive stages
 of condensation are conceded.

                  PART II.—CLASSIFICATION m'ro GROUPS.
                   I.  FORMER. CLASSIFICATIONS   or Suns.
   In the various classi<U+FB01>cations of the celestial bodies which have
been attempted      from time to time, nebulae and comets have been
regarded as things apart from the stars; but from what I have stated
in the <U+FB01>rst part of this paper, relating to the origin of the various
groups of heavenly bodies, it is clear that it is not only unnecessary
but unphilosophical to make such a distinction; and, indeed, if any
such separation were needed, such a result would seem to indicate
that the line of evolution is by no means so simple and clear as it
really seems to be. But although it is no longer necessary to draw
                                          I
this distinction, it is important that should state the various spectro
scopic classi<U+FB01>cations which have been attempted in the case of the
stars. With this information before us, we shall be better able to
see the de<U+FB01>nite lines on which any new classi<U+FB01>cation must be based to
include all celestial forms.
                     Fraunhofer, Rutherfurd, and Secch'i.
   When we inquire into the various labours upon which our present
                                                          “ stars ” is based,
knowledge of the spectra of the various orders of
the <U+FB01>rst we come across are those of Fraunhofer, who may be said
to have founded this branch of scienti<U+FB01>c inquiry in the year
1814.
   Fraunhofer not only instituted the method of work which now is
found to be the most eifective, but his observations at that time were
so excellent that he had no di<U+FB01>iculty in <U+FB01>nding coincidences between
lines in the spectrum of the sun and of Venus.
   Fraunhofer’s reference in his observations runs as follows :—
   “I  have also made several observations on some of the brightest
<U+FB01>xed stars. As their light was much fainter than that of Venus, the
brightness of their spectrum was consequently still less.              I have
nevertheless   seen,   without any illusion, in the  spectrum    of  the light
of Sirius, three large lines, which apparently have no resemblance
with those of the sun’s light. One of them is in the green, and two
in the blue space. Lines are also seen in the spectrum of other <U+FB01>xed
stars of the <U+FB01>rst magnitude; but these stars appear to be different
from one another in relation to these lines. As the object-glass of the
telescope of the theodolite has only thirteen lines of aperture, these

   experiments may be repeated, with greater precision, by means of an
  object-glass of greater dimensions.“
      He did not attempt to classify his observations on stellar spectra,
  but, as pointed out by Professor Dunér (“ Sur les Etoiles a Spectres de
  la Troisieme Classe,” p. 3), those that he most particularly mentions
  are really remarkably diverse in their characteristics.
      In these researches Fraunhofer was followed by Rutherfurd, who,
  in the year 1863, was the <U+FB01>rst to indicate that the various stellar
  spectra which he had then observed were susceptible of being
                                                                         ‘
  arranged into different groups. His paper was published in Silliman’s
             ’
  Journal (vol. 35, p. 71), and, after giving an account of the observa
  tions actually made, continues as follows :—
      “ The star
                  spectra present such varieties that it is dif<U+FB01>cult to point
  out any mode of classi<U+FB01>cation.                              I
                                           For the present, divide them into
  three groups z—First, those having many lines and bands, and mostly
 resembling the sun, viz., Capella, ,B Geminorum, a Orionis, Aldebaran,
  q Leonie, Arcturus, and B Pegasi.          These are all reddish or golden
  stars.    The second group, of which Sirius is the type, presents spectra
 wholly unlike that of the sun, and are white stars. The third group,
 comprising a Virginis, Rigel, &c., are also white stars, but show no
 lines ; perhaps they contain no mineral substance, or are incandescent
 without      <U+FB02>ame.”
      Soon afterwards Secchi carried on the inquiry, and began in 1865
 by dividing the objects he had then observed into two types.                  These
 two types were subsequently expanded in 1867 into three (‘ Catalogo
 delle Stelle di cui si e determinato lo Spettro Luminoso,’ Secchi,
 Parigi, 1867) : <U+FB01>rst, white“ stars, like a Lyrse; secondly, yellow stars,
 like Arcturus; and thirdly, deeply coloured stars, like a Herculis
 and a: Orionis.      The order of these types was not always as stated,
 but I have not been able to <U+FB01>nd the exact date at which the order
 was changed (Dunér, “ Sur les Etoiles,” p. 128). Secchi subsequently
 added a fourth type, in which the <U+FB02>utings were less numerous.
 There is little doubt that Secchi was led to these types not so much
by any considerations relating to the chemical constitution of the
atmospheres of these bodies, as in relation to their colours. His <U+FB01>rst
classi<U+FB01>cations, in fact, simply separated the white stars from the
coloured ones (see on this point ‘Le Scopirte Spettro'scopiche,’                   A.
Secchi, Roma, 1865).
     The fourth type included, therefore, stars of a deeper red colour
than those of the third, and Secchi pointed out thatthis change of
colour was accompanied by a remarkable change in the spectrum ; in
fact, of Secchi’s four types thus established, the <U+FB01>rst and second had

line spectra and the third and fourth had fluted ones. At that time
the important distinction to be drawn between line- and fluted-spectra
was not sowell recognised as it is at present; and further the relation
of spectra to temperature was not so fully considered. Secchi, as a
result of laboratory work, however, at once showed an undoubted
connexion between the absorption flutings in the stars of the fourth
type and the bright ones seen in the spectrum or carbon under certain
conditions ; and although this conclusion has been denied, it has since
been abundantly confirmed by Vogel and others (see Vogel, * Publica
 tionen, &c., Potsdam,' No. 14, 1884, p. 31).
                           Relation to Temperature.
    At the time that Secchi was thus classifying the stars, the    question
was taken up also by Zöllner, who in 1865 first threw out the sugges
tion that the spectra might probably enable us to determine some
what as to the relative ages of these bodies ; and he suggested that
the yellow and red light of certain stars were indications of a reduc
tion of temperature (Zöllner, * Photometrische Untersuchungen,'
p. 243).
    In 1868 this subject occupied the attention of Angström with
special reference to the contrasted spectra of lines and flutings. On
this he wrote as follows, showing that temperature considerations
might help us in the matter of variable stars (* Recherches sur le
Spectre solaire,' Upsala, 1868):
    * D'après les observations faites par MM. Secchi et Huggins, les
raies d'absorption dans les spectres stellaires sont de deux espèces :
chez l'une, le spectre est rayé de lignes très-fines, comme le spectre
solaire ; chez l'autre, les raies constituent des groupes entiers à espaces
égaux ou des bandes nuancées. Ces derniers groupes appartiennent
vraisemblablement aux corps composés, et je mentionnerai, en par
ticulier, que ceux trouvés dans le spectre de a Orionis ressemblent
fort aux bandes lumineuses que donne le spectre de l'oxyde de man
ganèse.     Supposé que ma théorie soit juste, l'apparition de ces bandes
doit donc indiquer que la température de l'étoile est devenue assez
basse pour que de telles combinaisons chimiques puissent se former
et se conserver.
    * Entre  ces deux  limites de température chez les étoiles, limites que
 l'on peut caractériser par la présence de l'une ou de l'autre espèce
des raies d'absorption, on peut s'imaginer aussi un état intermédiaire,
 dans lequel les gaz composés peuvent se former ou se dissocier, suivant
 les variations de température auxquelles ils sont assujettis par l'action
 chimique même. Dans cette classe doivent probablement être com
 prises les étoiles dont l'intensité de lumière varie plus ou moins
 rapidement, et avec une périodicité plus ou moins constante.'
                         I
    In the year 1873, referred to this subject in my Bakerian Lecture

  1888.]         of the various Species  of Ileavenly Bodies.             19
   (‘ Phil. Trans,’ vol. 164, 1874, p. 492), in which I attempted to bring
  to bear some results obtained in solar inquiries upon the question of
  stellar temperatures.
      I quote the following paragraphs :—
      I. The absorption of some elementary and compound gases is
  limited to the most refrangible part of the spectrum when the gases
  are rare, and creeps gradually into the visible violet part, and <U+FB01>nally
  to the red end of the spectrum, as the pressure is increased.
      II. Both the general and selective absorption of the photospheric
  light are greater (and therefore the temperature of the photosphere
  of the sun is higher) than has been supposed.
      III. The lines of compounds of a metal and iodine, bromine, &c.,
 are observed generally in the red end of the spectrum, and this holds
 good for absorption in the case of aqueous vapour.
      Such spectra, like those of the metalloids, are separated spectro
 scopically from those of the metallic elements by their columnar or
 banded structure.
      IV. There are, in all probability, no compounds ordinarily present
  in the sun’s reversing layer.
      V. When a metallic compound vapour, such as is referred to in
 III, is dissociated by the spark, the band spectrum dies out, and the
 elemental lines come in, according to the degree of temperature
 employed.
      Again, although our knowledge of the spectra of stars is lament
 ably incomplete, I gather the following facts from the work already
 accomplished with marvellous skill and industry by Secchi, of Rome.
     VI. The sun, so far as the spectrum goes, may be regarded as a
 representative of class (,6) intermediate between stars (a) with much
 simpler spectra of the same kind, and stars ('1) with much more com
 plex spectra of a different kind.
     VII. Sirius, as a type of a, is (1) the brightest (and therefore
 hottest ?) star in our northern sky; (2) the blue end of its spectrum
is open,—it is only certainly known to contain hydrogen, the other
 metallic lines being exceedingly thin, thus indicating a small propor
 tion of metallic vapours; while (3) the hydrogen lines in this star are
enormously (lislended, showing that the chromosphere        is largely com
posed of that element.
     There are other bright stars of thisclass.
     VIII. As types of '1 the red stars may be quoted, the spectra of
which are composed of channelled spaces and bands, and in which
naturally the blue end is closed.      Hence the reversing layers of these
stars probably contain metalloids, or compounds, or both, in great
quantity; and in their spectra not only is hydrogen absent, but the
metallic lines are reduced in thickness and intensity, which in the

20                 Mr.    J.  N. Lockyer.         On the Classification         [Apr..12,
associated.       It  is fair to assume that these stars are of a. lower tem
perature than our sun.
    In the same year, in a letter to M. Dumas, published in the
‘
  Comptes Rendus,“             I again pointed out that, if we consider merely
the scale of temperature, a celestial body with <U+FB01>utings in its spectrum
would be cooler than one which had lines in its spectrum; and also                     I
pointed out that, taking the considerable development of the blue end
of the spectrum in white stars as contrasted with its feeble exhibition
in stars like our sun, we had strong presumptive evidence to the e<U+FB01>ect
that the stars like on Lyme, with few lines in their spectra, were hotter
than those resembling our sun, in which the number of lines was very
                                          I
much more considerable, and added an inference from this: “ plus
une étoile est chaude, plus son spectre est simple.”                         This related
merely, as       I   have said before, to the consideration of one line of
temperature.
                                    Vogel’s Classi<U+FB01>cation.
   In the year following my paper, the most considerable classi<U+FB01>cation
which has been put forward of late years was published by Dr. Vogel
(‘Astn Nachr.,’ No. 2000), who, basing his work on the previous
types of Secchi, and also taking into account the inference                          I  drew
in my letter to Dumas, modi<U+FB01>ed Secchi’s types to a. certain extent,
but always along one line of temperature, the leading idea being, as I
gather from many remarks made in Dunér’s admirable memoir, to be
referred to presently, that the classi<U+FB01>cation is based upon descending
temperatures, and that all the stars included in it are supposed
at one time or other to have had a spectrum similar to that of
a-Lyrse.t
    This classi<U+FB01>cation is as follows           :
   * “  Il  semble que plus une étoile est chaude, plus son spectre est simple et quc lee
éléments métalliques       se font voir dens l’ordre de leurs poids atomiqnes.    Ainsi nous
avons :—

    CLASS   I. Spectra in which the llIetallic Lines are extremely Faint or
entirely   Invisible—The most refrangible part-s, blue and violet, are
very vivid.     The stars are white.
    (a.) Spectra in which the lines of hydrogen are very strong.
    (b.) Spectra in which the lines of hydrogen are wanting.
    (0.) Spectra in which the lines of hydrogen and D3 are bright.
    CLASS II. Spectra in which the Metallic Lines are Numerous and very
 Visible—The blue and violet are relatively weaker; in the red part
there are sometimes faint bands. The colour of the star is clear
bluish-white to deep reddish-yellow.
    (a.) Spectra with numerous metallic lines, especially in the yellow
and green. The lines of hydrogen are generally strong, but never as
strong as in the stars of Class I. In some stars they are invisible,
and then faint bands are generally seen in the red formed by very
close lines.
     (b.) Spectra in which besides dark lines and isolated bands there are
several bright lines.
     CLASS III. Spectra in which besides the Metallic Lines there are
 numerous Dark Bands in all parts of the Spectrum, and the Blue and
 Violet are remarkably Faint—The stars are orange or red.
     (a.) The dark bands are fainter towards the red.
     (b.) The bands are very wide, and the principal are fainter towards
 the violet.
     It is pointed out that if this classi<U+FB01>cation be true, there must be
 links between all the classes given. Now it is perfectly obvious that
 if this classi<U+FB01>cation includes in its view all the stars, and if there is
 a line of ascending as well as descending temperatures—that is to say,
 if some of the stars are increasing their temperatures, while others
 are diminishing them—the classi<U+FB01>cation must give way.
     It is not di<U+FB01>cult to see, in the light of my communication to
 the Society of November 17th, that it has given way altogether, and
 principally on this wise.
     The idea which underlies the classi<U+FB01>cation is that a star of Class    I
 on cooling becomes a star of Class II, and that a star of Class     II has
 as it were a choice before it of passing to Class 1110. or Class IIIb.
 Thus under certain conditions its spectrum will take on the appear
 ance of Secchi’s        third type, Class IIIa (Vogel) ; on certain
 other conditions it will take on the appearance of Secchi‘s fourth
 type, Class IIIb (Vogel).       There is now, however, no doubt what
 ever that Secchi’s Class IlIa represents stars in which the tem
 perature is increasing, and with conditions not unlike those of the
 nebulae—that is to say, the meteorites are discrete, and are on their
way to form bodies of Class       II             I
                                     and Class by the ultimate vaporisa
 tiou of all their meteoric constituents. There is also no doubt that the
stars included in Class     IIIb  have had their day  ; that their tempera

ture has been running down, until owing to reduction of temperature
they are on the verge of invisibility brought about by the enormous
absorption of carbon in their atmospheres.
    Pechüle was the first to object to Vogel's classification, mainly on
the ground that Secchi's types 3 and 4 had been improperly brought
           ;
 together and my work has shown how very just his objection was,
and how clear-sighted was his view as to the true position of stars of
 Class  IIIb.   I give the following extract from his memoir :
    * M.  Vogel   a proposé une classification suivant les diverses phases
 de refroidissement indiquées      par les spectres, dans laquelle  il fait des
types    III et IV    de Secchi deux subdivisions d'une même classe,
IIIa et IIIb. Mais je trouve certaines difficultés negatives contre
cette classification relativement au rôle qu'y joue le IIIb. En effet,         il
est admis que le IV type de Secchi se distingue nettement du                 III
type, non seulement par la position et la quantité des zones obscures,
mais aussi par le fait très-remarquable, que les principales de ces
zones sont bien définies et brusquement interrompues du côté du
violette dans le     III  type, du côté du rouge dans le IV. Or, si
le  IV   type doit représenter une des phases de refroidissement, par
lesquelles passent les étoiles, on peut faire deux hypothèses. La
première est que le spectre du IV type soit co-ordonné au spectre
du   III  type, de manière qu'il ait des étoiles, qui passent de la phase
représentée par le     II   type, à la phase représentée par le   III  type, et
d'autres, qui passent directement du          II  type au IV. Mais cette
hypothèse est inadmissible.          Car on connaît de spectres entremé
diaires entre le   I et le II type, et entre le II et III; mais on ne      con
naît pas, à    ce que  je   sache, de spectres du   II type tendant au IV.
Reste donc l'hypothèse, que la phase de refroidissement, représentée
par le spectre du     IV   type, soit postérieure à la phase représentée par
le  III type, de manière que les spectres des étoiles passent du         III  au
                                                 il
IV type. Si ce passage se fait peu à peu, devrait avoir des spectres
entremédiaires entre le       III et le IV type ; mais quoique Secchi par
exemple le 17 Jan., 1868, ait déterminé le spectre de l'étoile 273
Schjell., comme semblant entremédiaire entre le           III et le  IV   type,
                                 IV
il l'a plus tard reconnu du type, et l'existence de spectres de           III
IV type n'est nullement prouvée. On pourrait objecter que les
étoiles du    IV  type sont peu nombreuses et en général si petites que
leurs spectres sont difficiles à voir, et que par conséquent      il  pourrait
y avoir parmi ces spectres quelques-uns, qui se rapprochassent du
III   type. Mais je réponds à cette remarque, que les spectres du
III-IV     type, indiquant une phase moins refroidie, devraient au con
traire en général appartenir à des étoiles plus grandes que celles avant
des spectres du IV type. Si on veut supposer que le passage du               III
au IV type se fasse subitement, ou par une catastrophe, pendant
laquelle apparaissent des lignes brillantes, cettes supposition même

une phase bien distincte, la derniere peut-étre avant l’extiuction

que j’ai cru pouvoir encore me conformer a l’exemple de d’Arrest, en

   Having, then, gone over the various classi<U+FB01>cations of stars accord
ing to their spectra,    I  now proceed to consider the question of the
classi<U+FB01>cation of celestial bodies from a more advanced point of view.
I   pointed out in the year 1886 that the time had arrived when stars
with increasing temperatures would require to be fundamentally
distinguished from those with decreasing temperatures, but          I did not
then know that this was so easy to accomplish as it now appears to be
(‘ Nature,’ vol. 34, p. 228); and, as      I  have already stated, when we
consider the question of classi<U+FB01>cation at all, it is neither necessary
nor desirable that we should limit ourselves to the stars; we must
include the nebulae and comets as well.            Stellar variability should
not introduce any difficulties, seeing that as a. rule in its extremest
form it is the passage from one spectrum to another, even if of a
di<U+FB01>erent type, owing to sudden changes of temperature.
   In the <U+FB01>rst classi<U+FB01>cation on these lines, which is certain to be modi
<U+FB01>ed as our knowledge gets more exact, it is desirable to keep the
groups as small in number as possible; the groups being subsequently
broken up into sub-groups, or, even into species, as the various
minute changes in spectra brought about by variations of temperature
are better made out.
   For the purpose of making clear what follows,            I here introduce
                                             “
from my paper of November 17th, the temperature curve,” on which
is shown the distribution of nebulae, comets, and of stars as divided
into classes by Vogel, on the two arms of the curve.
    On one arm of this we have those stages in the various heavenly
bodies in which in each case the temperature is increasing, while on
the other arm we have that other condition in which we get <U+FB01>rst
vaporous combination, and then ultimately the formation of a crust
due to the gradual cooling of the mass, in dark bodies like, say, the
companion to Sirius. At the top we of course have that condition in
which the highest temperature must be assumed to exist.
   To begin, then, a more general classi<U+FB01>cation with the lowest tempe
ratures, it is known that the nebulae and comets are distinguished

'
  or almost alone      so far as we know.         Absorption has been suspected in
  the spectra of some nebulae,<U+FB02> and has been observed beyond all doubt
  in some comets-1- But there are some stars in which we also get
  radiation, accompanied by certain absorption phenomena. But there
  is no dif<U+FB01>culty in showing that nebulae and comets are more special
  on account of their bright lines than on account of their absorption
  bands.      I  have already shown that in all probability the stars with
  bright lines are most closely allied with nebulae. Indeed, it seems as
  if they are very nearly akin to those condensations in nebula, showing
  an undoubted olivine and hydrogen spectrum, which gave them the
  appearance of resolvability.             It seems, also, highly probable that
  future observations with instruments of great light-collecting power,
   will show that in nebulae, the spectra of which are recorded as
  continuous, lines including the remnants of some of the carbon
   <U+FB02>utings, which there is good reason to believe have already been
   traced in the spectra of bright line stars, are also present. From this
   point of view, the various recorded observations of regions of di<U+FB01>erent
   colour in certain nebulae acquire an additional interest. It is also
   clear that since the only real difference between comets and other
   meteor swarms of equal denseness is that the former are in motion
   round the centre of our system, comets whether at aphelion or at
   perihelion will fall into this group. We may, therefore, f0rm the <U+FB01>rst
   group of bodies which are distinguished by the presence of bright
   lines or <U+FB02>utings in the spectrum.
       The great distinction between the <U+FB01>rst group and the second would
   be that evidences of absorption now become prominent, and side by
   side with the bright <U+FB02>ntings of carbon and occasionally the dines of
   hydrogen we have well-developed <U+FB01>uting absorption.
      The second group, therefore, is distinguished from the <U+FB01>rst by
   mixed <U+FB01>utings as well as lines in the spectrum.

26              Mr. J. N. Lockyei'.    0n  the Classi<U+FB01>cation    [Apr. 12,
   The passage from the second group to the third brings us to those
bodies  which are increasing their temperature, in which radiation and
<U+FB02>uting absorption have given place to line absorption.
   At present, the observations already accumulated have not been
discussed in such a way as to enable us to state very de<U+FB01>nitely the
exact retreat of the absorption—by which I mean the exact order in
which the absorption lines fade out from the <U+FB01>rst members to the last
in the group. We know generally that the earlier bodies will contain
the line absorption of those substances of which we get a paramount
<U+FB02>uting absorption in the prior group. “re also know generally
that the absorption of hydrogen will increase while the other
diminishes.
   The next group—the fourth, brings us to the stage of highest
temperature, to stars like a Lyrne; and the division between this
group and the prior one must be more or less arbitrary, and cannot at
present be de<U+FB01>ned.       One thing, however, is quite clear, that no
celestial body without all the ultra-violet lines of hydrogen discovered
by Dr. Huggins can claim to belong to it.
   We have now arrived at the culminating point of temperature, and
now pass to the descending arm of the curve. The <U+FB01>fth group, there
fore, will contain those bodies in which the hydrogen lines begin to
decrease in intensity, and other absorptions to take place in conse
quence of reduction of temperature.
   One of [the most interesting problems of the future will be to watch
what happens in bodies along the descending scale, as compared with
what happens to the bodies in Group III, on the ascending one. But
it seems fair to assume that physical and chemical combinations will
now have an opportunity of taking place, thereby changing the con
stituents of the atmosphere ; that at <U+FB01>rst with every decrease of tem
perature an increase in the absorption lines may be expected, but'it
will be unlikely that the coolest bodies in this group will resemble the
<U+FB01>rst one in Group III.
   The next group, the sixth, is Secchi’s type IV, and Vogel‘s Class 1111;,
its distinct characteristics being the absorption <U+FB01>ntings of carbon.
The species of which it will ultimately be composed are already appa
rently shadowed forth in the map which accompanies Dnnér’s volume,
and they will evidently be subsequently di<U+FB01>erentiated by the gradual
addition of other absorptions to that of carbon, while at the same
time the absorption of carbon gets less and less distinct.
   To sum up, then, the classi<U+FB01>cation    I propose consists of the follow
ing groups :—
   Gronp      I.—Radiation lines and <U+FB01>utings predominant.      Absorption
                     beginning in the last species.
   Group    II.—Mixed radiation and absorption predominant.
   Group   III.—Line absorption predominant, with increasing          tem

1888.]          of the various Species  of Heavenly Bodies.            27
                     perature. The various species will be marked by
                     increasing simplicity of spectrum.
    Group IV.—- Simplest line absorption predominant.
    Group V.-—-Line absorption predominant, with decreasing tempera
                     ture. The various species will be marked by de
                      creasing complexity of spectrum.
    Group VI.—Carbon absorption predominant.
    Group VII.—-Extinction of luminosity.
    It will be seen from the above grouping that there are several
fundamental departures from previous classi<U+FB01>cations, especially that
of Vogel.
    The presence of the bright <U+FB02>utings of carbon associated with dark
metallic <U+FB02>utings in the second group, and the presence of only absorb
ing carbon in the sixth, appears to be a matter of fundamental
importance, and to entirely invalidate the view that both groups (the
equivalents of <U+FB01>le and IIIb of Vogel) are produced from the same
mass of matter on cooling.
    This point has already been dwelt upon by Pechiile.
    Another point of considerable variation is the separation of stars
with small absorption into such widely different groups as the <U+FB01>rst
and fourth, whereas Vogel classi<U+FB01>es them together on the ground of
the small absorption in the visible part of the spectrum. But that
this classi<U+FB01>cation is unsound is demonstrated by the fact that in these
 stars, such use] Cassiopeiaa and B Lyrse, we have intense variability.
 We have bright hydrogen lines instead of inordinately thick dark
 ones ; and on other grounds, which            I shall take a subsequent
 opportunity of enlarging upon, it is clear that the physical conditions
 of these bodies must be as di<U+FB01>erent as they pretty well can be.
    It will be seen also that, with our present knowledge, it is very
 di<U+FB01>icnlt to separate those stars the grouping of which is determined
 by line absorption into the Groups       III  and V, for the reason that
 so far, seeing that only one line of temperature, and that a descending
 one, has been considered, no efforts have been made to establish the,
 necessary criteria.    I noted this point in the paper to which    I have
 already referred in connexion with the provisional curve.

                          I. SUB-GROUP.     NEBULE.
     Having, in the preceding part of this memoir, attempted to give a
 general idea of that grouping of celestial bodies which in my opinion
 best accords with our present knowledge, and which has been based
 upon the assumed meteoric origin of all of them,        I now proceed to
 test the hypothesis further by showing how it bears the strain put

28               Mr. J. N. Lockyer.       On the Classi<U+FB01>cation    [Apr. 12,
upon it when, in addition to furnishing us with a general grouping, it
is used to indicate how the groups should be still further divided, and
what speci<U+FB01>c differences may be expected.
    The presence or absence of carbon will divide this group into two
main sub-groups.
    The <U+FB01>rst will contain those nebulae in which only the spectrum of the
meteoric constituents is observed with or without the spectrum of
hydrogen added.
    It will also contain those bodies in which the nebula, spectrum gets
almost masked by a continuous one, such as Comets 1866 and 1867,
and the great nebula in Andromeda.
    In the second sub-group will be more condensed swarms still, in
which, one by one, new lines are added to the spectra, and carbon
makes its appearance; while probably the last species in this sub
group would be bodies represented by q Cassiopeiae.
                               Species of  Nebuloz.
    I  have   elsewhere   referred to the extreme dif<U+FB01>culty of spectro
scopic discrimination in the case of the meteor swarms which are just
passing from the <U+FB01>rst stage of condensation, and it may well be that
we shall have to wait for many years before a true spectroscopic
classi<U+FB01>cation of the various aggregations which        I have indicated, can
be made.
    It is clear from what has gone before that in each stage of evolu
tion there will be very various surfaces and loci of collision in certain
parts of all the swarms, and we have already seen that eVen in the
nebulosities discovered by Sir Wm. Herschel, which represent possibly
a very inchoate condition, there are bright portions here and there.
    If the conditions are such in the highly elaborated swarms and in
the nebulosities that the number of collisions in any region per cubic
million miles is identical, the spectroscope will give us the same
result. In the classi<U+FB01>cation of the nebulae, therefore, the spectro
scope must cede to the telescope when the dynamical laws, which
must in<U+FB02>uence the interior movements of meteoric swarms, have been
fully worked out. The spectroscope, however, is certainly at one with
the telescope in pointing out that the so-called planetary nebulae are
among the very earliest forms—those in which the collisions are most
restricted in the colliding regions. The colour of these bodies is blue
tinged with green; they do not appear to have that milkiness which
generally attaches to nebulae, and the bright nebulous lines are seen
in some cases absolutely without any trace of continuous spectrum.
In higher stages the continuous spectrum comes in, and in higher
 stages still possibly also the bands of carbon ; for in many cases
 Dr. Huggins in his important observations has recorded the weakness

1888.]         of the various Species  of Heavenly Bodies.             29
of the spectrum in the red, or in other words the strengthening of
the spectrum in the green and blue, exactly where the carbon
bands lie.
    But in all the bodies of Group    I which possess forms visible to us
in the telescope, it would seem proper that their classi<U+FB01>cation should
depend mainly—at present at all events—upon their telescopic ap
pearance, and there is very little doubt that a few years’ labour with
the new point of view in the mind of observers armed with suf<U+FB01>cient
optical power, will enable us to make a tremendous stride in this
direction; but it seems already that this must not be done without
spectroscopic aid. For instance, if what     I have previously suggested
as to the possible origin of the planetary nebula be accepted, it is
clear that in those which give us the purest spectrum of lines—one in
which there is the minimum of continuous spectrum—we <U+FB01>nd the
starting point of the combined telescopic and spectroscopic classi<U+FB01>ca
tion, and the line to be followed will be that in which, cwten's paribus,
we get proofs of more and more condensation and, therefore, more
and more collisions, and therefore higher and higher temperatures,
and therefore greater complexity in the spectrum until at length
 “ stars ” are reached.
    When true stars are reached those in a cluster may appear nebulous
in the telescope in consequence of its distance ; the spectroscope must
give us indications of absorption.
    It is not necessary in this connexion, therefore, to refer to un
 doubted star clusters, as the presence of absorption will place them
in another group; but the remark may be made that it is not likely
that future research will indicate that new groupings of stars, such
 as Sir Wm. Herschel suggests in his paper on the breaking up of the
Milky Way, will di<U+FB02>fer in any essential particular from the successive
groupings of meteorites which are watched in the nebulae.           Space
 and gravitation being as they are, it is not necessary to assume
 that any difference of kind need exist in the groupings formed by
 stars and meteoric dust; indeed there is much evidence to the con
 trary.
                   II. SUB-Gsour.     BRIGHT-LINE Suns.
    It might appear at <U+FB01>rst sight that the distribution of bright
 line stars among various species should be very easy, since a constant
 rise of temperature should bring out more and more lines, so that
 species might be based upon complexity of spectrum merely.
    But this is not so, for the reason that the few observations already
recorded, although they point to the existence of carbon bands, do not
 enable us to say exactly how far the masking process is valid.    Hence
 in the present communication     I content myself by giving some details
 relating to masking, and the results of the discussions, so far as they

                                            shall return to the line of
evolution of these bodies in a later paper.
  lIIasking of Radiation Efects produced by Variations of Interspacing.
  I have   already stated that carbon bands are apt to mask the appear
ance of other spectral phenomena in the region of the spectrum in
which they lie. In this way we can not only account for the apparent
absence of the <U+FB01>rst manganese <U+FB02>uting, while the second one is visible,
but it is even possible to use this method to determine which bands
of carbon are actually present. There is another kind of masking
elfect produced in a different way, and this shows itself in connexion
with sodium. It is well known that when the temperature is low, D
is seen alone, and if seen in connexion with continuous spectrum the
continuous spectrum is crossed by either dark or bright D, according
to the existing circumstances.
     I
     showed some years ago that the green line of sodium (but not the
red one) is really visible when sodium is burned in the bunsen burner.
It however, very much brighter when higher temperatures are used,
      is,
although when bright        does not absorb in the way the line
                                it                                  does.       D
   Now,     we imagine
             if             swarm of meteorites such that in the line of
                                 a
sight the areas of meteorite and interspace are equal, half the area
will show        absorbed, and the other half D bright; and in the
                  D
resulting spectrum D will have disappeared, on account of the
equality, or nearly equality, of the radiation added to the absorption
of the continuous spectrum. The light from the interspace just <U+FB01>lls
up and obliterates the absorption.
   But    the temperature is such that the green line
            if                                             seen as well as
                                                                      is
D in consequence of its poor absorbing effect there will be no dark line
  ;
corresponding to       in the resulting spectrum, but the bright green
                          it
line from the interspace will be superposed on the continuous spec
trum, and we shall get the apparently paradoxical result of the green
line of sodium visible while        absent. This condition can be partly

reproduced    in the  laboratory by volatilising a small piece of sodium

bright, while D      dark.

while   we know that   in Comet Wells most of the luminosity at    a certain
 stage of the comet’s history was produced by sodium.        It is therefore
extremely probable that the view above put forward must be taken as an
 explanation of the absence of I) when not seen, rather than an abnor
 mal chemical constitution of the meteorites—that is to say, one in
 which sodium is absent. This may even explain the fact that up to
 the present time the D line of sodium has not been recorded in the
 spectrum of any nebula.
    [Note—In the lecture the author here referred to the spectrum of
 o Ceti, as photographed by Professor Pickering for the Henry Draper
 Memorial, the slide having been kindly placed at his disposal by the
 Council of the Royal Astronomical Society. All the bright hydrogen
 lines in the violet and ultra-violet are shown in the photograph, with
 the exception of the one which is nearly coincident with H. The
apparent absence of this line is in all probability due to the masking
 effect of the absorption line of calcium. In this case, then, it appears
 that the calcium vapour was outside the hot hydrogen, and this there
 fore was being given off by the meteorites at the time.—April 18.]
      Detailed Discussions  of the Spectra of some  Bright-line Stars.
    These things then being premised,    I now submit some maps to the
 Society illustrating this part of the inquiry, although it will be some
time before my investigations on the bright-line stars are <U+FB01>nished.
 These maps will indicate the way in which the problem is being
attacked, and the results already obtained. To help us in the work
 we have <U+FB01>rst of all those lines of substances known to exist in
 meteorites which are visible at the lowest temperatures which we can
command in the labora/ory.       We have also the results of the carbon
 work to which reference was made in the previous paper; and then
we have the lines which have been seen, although their wave-lengths
have in no case been absolutely determined in consequence of the
extreme dif<U+FB01>culty of the observation, both in stars and in comets,
which I hold to be almost identical in structure.
    In the case of each star the lines which have been recorded in its
spectrum are plotted in the way indicated in the maps.         The general
result is that when we take into account the low temperature radia
tion, which we learn from the laboratory work, not only can we
account for the existence of the lines which have been observed, but
apparent absorptions in most cases are shown to be coincident with
the part of the spectrum in front of a bright <U+FB02>uting.
    A continuation of this line of thought shows us also that, when in
these stars the spectrum is seen far into the blue, the luminosity
really proceeds <U+FB01>rst from the carbon <U+FB02>uting, and in the hotter stars,
from the hydrocarbon one, which is still more refrangible, in addition.

spectrum, which at <U+FB01>rst sight appear due to absorption, are shown to
be most likely caused by defect of radiation in that part of the
spectrum between the blue end of the continuous spectrum from the
meteorites, and the bright band of carbon.
    All the observations, it would appear, can be explained on the
assumption of low temperature.                                       -
                              Notes on the Maps.
    q Argus.—R.A. 8h. 5m. 56s., Dec. -—46° 5195'.             Respighi and
myself observed the bright lines in the spectrum of this star at
Madras in 1871.      No measurements were made of the wave-lengths
of the lines, which were observed by Ellery at Melbourne in 1879, and
given as 5760, 5648, and 4682.       Other bright lines were suspected.
    Copeland examined and mapped the spectrum of this star while in
the Andes in 1883.       His wave-lengths are 580'9, 566'8, 4646, and
a. fainter line at 590.   The continuous spectrum extends from 420 to
675, the lines being seen bright on this, but no mention is made by
either Ellery or Copeland of absorption of any kind.       The bright lines
at 590 and 5668 are most probably the lines of sodium, 5890—95 and
5687; the 5809 line is probably the 579 strongest low-temperature
line of iron ; and the 468 (4646 Copeland) is due to the carbon <U+FB02>uting,
which has its maximum intensity at 468, the other carbon <U+FB02>utings at
 517 and 564, being rendered invisible to Copeland by the bright con
tinuous spectrum, although Ellery’s measurement of 564'8 is most
probably the carbon band at that point.         The 517 carbon may have
 been seen by Ellery, for although no measurements are given he saw
other bright lines or spaces.     The dark band 474 to 486 seen in the
 Cygnus stars, Argelander-Oeltzen 17681, and Lalande 13412, being
due to the shortness of the continuous spectrum, and the appearance
of the carbon band beyond the blue end, is not seen in this star,
because it has a. long continuous spectrum.
   The bright lines seen in it are due to low temperature sodium and
iron, and to carbon <U+FB02>utings on a bright continuous spectrum.

580—585, evidently when using a wide slit, while in a later account of
his observations he <U+FB01>xes the wave-length           at 580.   The line is
probably 579, the strongest line of iron at a low temperature.     Vogel
mentions a bright band extending from 470 to 461 with a maximum
between these limits.       Pickering measures this as commencing at
473.    This band is evidently the bright band of carbon commencing
at 474, with a maximum about 468 as observed and photographed at
Kensington.      Between this band and 486 Vogel has shown a dark
band in the spectrum. This appearance is due not to any absorption
but to the continuous spectrum being short, ending evidently at 486,
while the bright carbon appearing beyond this in the blue, leaves
a dark band due to absence of radiation.
   Vogel has not noticed any other bright lines, but Pickering “sus
pected” a brightening at 540. This would be the only line of
manganese which appears in the bunsen burner.           Vogel may have
noticed this line and yet not given any wave-length of it in his list,
just as he indicates one bright line in 2nd Cygnus, and two bright
lines in 3rd Cygnus in his light curves of those stars, without men
tioning them in any list of bright lines observed.
   Pickering suspected the presence of several other lines, but was
unable to obtain any measurements of them.

   Vogel’s results are given in the Publicationen des Astrophysikal
ischen Observatoriums zu Potsdam,’ vol. 4, No. 14, p. 15, and in the
sketch at the end of that number.
   Pickering’s are in ‘ The Observatory,’ vol. 4, p. 82; the ‘ American
Journal of Science and Art,’ No. 118, 1880; ‘ Copernicus,’ vol. 1,
p. 86; and ‘Astronomiscbe N achrichten,’ 2376.
   Lalande   134-12—Both Vogel and Pickering have observed the
spectrum    of this star and have measured the wave-lengths of the
bright lines.
   Vogel gives a sketch of the spectrum as well as a. list of wave
lengths.
   Vogel mentions a dark band at the blue end of the spectrum, and
gives the wave-length in his sketch as from 486 to 473.
   Both observers measure the bright 486 hydrogen (F) line.
   Vogel measures a bright line at 540, while Pickering’s measure is
545; but Pickering in another star, Arg-Oeltzen 17681, has measured
a line at 540, so there can be little doubt that is the correct wave
length.
   Vogel measures a line at 581, but this has not been noticed by
Pickering.
   The bright part of the spectrum extending from 473 towards the
blue with its maximum at 468 is, I would again suggest, the :carbon
band appearing beyond the continuous spectrum, the rest of the carbon

  being cut out by the continuous spectrum, although 564 asserts
  itself by a brightening of the spectrum at that wave-length in Vogel’s
 sketch, and by a rise in his light curve.
     The line at 540 is the only line of manganese visible at the tem
 perature of the bunsen burner, while the 581 measurement of Vogel
 is in all probability the 579 line, the strongest line of iron visible at
 low temperatures.
     In this star, therefore, we have continuous spectrum from the
 meteorites, and carbon bands, one of them appearing beyond the con
 tinuous spectrum in the blue as a bright band; bright lines of
 hydrogen, manganese, and iron being superposed on both.         There is
 no absorption    of  any  kind, the  apparent dark band being due to
 defect of radiation, as in Argelander-Oeltzen 17681.

     1st Cygnus—RD.     + 35°, No. 4001.—Tl1e spectrum of this star
 was observed by Messrs. Wolf and Rayet in 1867, but no measure
 ments of the positions of the bright lines were then published.       In
 the same paper, however, they give the measurements of the positions
 of the bright lines in 2nd Cygnus (B.D. + 35°, No. 41013) which
 they observed about the same time, and since the bright lines were
 similar in these stars, the wave-lengths 581, 573, 540, and 470, may
be taken as indicating the positions of the lines in 1st Cygnus.    They
 also observed dark spaces between 470 and 486, and on the blue side
 of 573.
    Dr. Vogel, of Potsdam, examined the spectrum of this star, and
has published his results in three ways, as a list of bright lines
 given in wave-lengths; as a sketch of the spectrum as it appeared to
him, and as a curve showing the intensity of the light throughout
the spectrum.
    His wave-lengths are 583, 571, 5411, 486 (hydrogen F) for lines,
and a bright band from 470 to 4165, with its maximum at 4168.
    The sketch con<U+FB01>rms these lines, while the light curve adds three
others to them at wave-lengths 507, 527, and 558.       He also gives an
absorption-band between the 486 line and 470 band, and in his
sketch gives a darkening on the blue side of 570, this being also
indicated in the light curve.    These dark spaces agree with the dark
spaces observed by Messrs. Wolf and Rayet.
    The bright band, with its maximum at 468, is the bright carbon
fluting commencing at 4174:, and extending towards the blue with its
maximum at 468, as photographed at Kensiugton, and the dark space

between this and the 486 line is not due to absorption of the light
from the meteorites by any vapour around them, but rather to the
absence of any radiation except that from the meteorites themselves
at this part of the spectrum.
   The carbon at 564 raises the curve at that point, and this bright
ness with the bright 570 line produces the appearance of a dark
space between those wave-lengths, the band being simply due to the
contrast of a bright <U+FB02>uting and a bright line lying some distance
apart on a faint continuous spectrum.              There is therefore no
absorption   of  any  kind in this star,  all the dark  bands being due to
absence of radiation.
   Of the bright lines two, the 540 and the 558, are due to manganese,
540 being the manganese line visible in the bunsen, while 558 is the
strongest of the low temperature <U+FB02>utings of manganese.            The line
at 581, or thereabouts, is most probably the strongest low temperature
line of iron.     The line at 569 is most probably the green sodium
line, while the 486 line is assigned by Vogel to hydrogen.       The faint
line at 507 has been observed in the <U+FB02>ame spectra of several meteor
ites, and is in the exact position of the strongest line of cadmium
at the temperature of the bunsen burner.
   This star, therefore, gives a spectrum, which is short and faintly
continuous, due to radiation of meteorites, but has light from carbon
added, with a separate band appearing in the blue; while the strongest
low-temperature lines of manganese, iron, and cadmium, with a
strong manganese <U+FB02>uting, and the green sodium line, appear bright
on the continuous spectrum.              There is no absorption of any
kind.
   Wolf and Rayet's discovery of bright lines is recorded in ‘ Comptes
Rendus,’ vol. 65, p. 292, and con<U+FB01>rmed in vol. 68, p. 1470, vol. 69,

   2nd Cygnus—RD. + 35°, No. 4013.—Messrs. Wolf and Rayet, in
 1867,  <U+FB01>rst observed the spectrum of this star, and measured the
 positions of the bright lines.       Micrometer readings and reference
lines are given by them from which a wave-length curve has been
constructed.     The wave-lengths of the bright lines in the star thus
ascertained are: 581 (7), 573 (B), 540 (6), and 470 (a); the
relative intensities being shown by the Greek letters. They state
 that :—

 of the spectrum      as  it appeared to him, and    a curve showing the
 variation of intensity of the light throughout the spectrum.
    The wave-lengths given by Vogel are 582 and 570, and a band
 with its brightest part at 464, fading 05 in both directions and
 according to the sketch having its red limit at 473.        In the light
 curve Vogel not only shows the 582 and 570 lines, but also bright
 lines in positions which by a curve have been found to correspond to
 wave-lengths 540 and 636. Vogel indicates in his sketch :3. dark
 band extending from 486 to the bright band 473, and an apparent
 absorption on the blue side of the 570 line, this absorption being
 ended at 564.       These two bands agree in position with the dark
 spaces  observed   by Messrs. Wolf and Rayet. The bright band in the
 blue at 473 is most probably the carbon band appearing bright upon
 a faint continuous spectrum, this producing the apparent absorption
 from 486 to 473. If the bright carbon really accounts for the appearr
 ance of a (contrast) dark band between the bright 570 and 564 in this
 star, all the apparent absorption is explained as due to contrast
 of bright bands on a fainter continuous spectrum due to red-hot
 meteorites.
    The line at 540 is the only line of manganese visible in the bunsen
 burner, and the 580 line is the strongest low-temperature iron line.
 The 570 line is most probably the green sodium line 569, the absence
 of the yellow sodium being explained by the half-and-half absorption
and radiation mentioned in the discussion of the causes which mask
and prevent the appearance of the lines in a spectrum.
    The line at 636 is in the red just at the end of the continuous
 spectrum, and as yet no origin has been found for it, although it has
been observed as a bright line in the Limerick meteorite at the
 temperature of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.
    This star therefore gives a continuous spectrum due to radiation
from meteorites, and on this we get bright carbon (with one carbon
 band appearing separate as being beyond the continuous spectrum
in the blue), with bright lines of iron, manganese, sodium, and
some as yet undetermined substance giving a line at 636 in the oxy
hydrogen blowpipe.

  1888.]       of  the various Species     of Heavenly Bodies.         43
 lengths are fairly correct for this star, especially as Dr. Vogel's
 measurements of the bright lines are 582 and 569 with a bright band
 commencing at 468. Vogel, in addition to his wave-lengths, also
 gives a sketch of the spectrum in which he shows the bright 540 line;
 and a light curve showing the variations of the intensity of the light
 throughout the spectrum, in which curve he indicates all the lines
 above-mentioned, and an additional bright line at 636.
    The sketch shows also a dark band in the spectrum from about
 488 to 473, another from 553 to 556, and a third on the blue side of
 570 extending from that line to 564. These dark spaces are con<U+FB01>rmed
 in the light curve, and two of them, 488 to 473, and 570 to 564, agree
 with the dark spaces observed by Messrs. Wolf and Rayet in 2nd
 Cygnus.                                 _
    The bright band at 470 is the carbon band in the blue commencing
 at 474, with its maximum at about 468, as observed and photographed
 at Kensington, and between this and 488 is the dark space which is
 most probably due to absence of radiation rather than to any
 absorption.   The carbon at 517 asserts itself by a rise in the light
 curve at that point, while the 564 carbon is also seen to produce a
 sudden rise in the curve.
    The 564 carbon and the 558 manganese <U+FB02>uting uniting produce
 a bright band of light between those wave-lengths, and this
on the faint continuous spectrum produces an apparent dark
 space on each side, thus accounting            for the dark appearances
 at 554—557 and 564—570, these being contrast appearances
 only and not absorption bands.            The 540 line is the manganese
 line seen in the bunsen burner.            The line at 570 is most pro
 bably the green sodium line, the yellow sodium being rendered
 invisible by the half-and-half absorption and radiation masking pre
viously mentioned. The 580 line is most probably the strongest low
temperature line of iron, 579 ; while the 636 line has been seen in the
 Limerick meteorite when heated in the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame, although
 its origin has not yet been determined.
    In this star, therefore, we have continuous spectrum from the
meteorites; carbon bands at 474, 517, and 564, rendering them
 selves apparent in the light curve; the low-temperature manganese
line and the strongest manganese <U+FB02>uting; the low-temperature iron
line, the green sodium, and a line the origin of which is unknown,
all appearing bright.     There is no absorption.

p. 108.)
   Vogel on June 19th, 1872 observed a bright line in the greenish
blue 486, and one in the yellow which he assumes to be D3. An
absorption band was also noticed in the red, but its wave-length was
not determined.      (‘ Both. Beob.,’ Heft 2, p. 29.)
   Great  stress   was   laid on the fact that the bright lines died out
between 1874 and 1883, when they were observed by Gothard, but on
                                              “
December 26th, 1879, C was noted as             superbly visible” by Lord
Lindsay,   J.  G. Lohse    and Dr. R.  Copeland,  and two bright lines, one
evidently  F,  observed   on October  28th, 1877.   No mention is made of
C in the records of the observation. (‘Monthly Notices of the R.
Astron. Soc.,’ vol. 47, p. 92.)
   Konkoly examined '1 Cass. (and ,8 Lyrae) repeatedly between 1874
and 1883, without seeing bright lines; Gothard repeatedly examined
both stars after the autumn of 1881, but saw no trace of bright lines
until 1883. (‘ Astr. Nachr.,’ 2581.)
   The Greenwich observations for October 1st, and November 21st,
1880, December 7th, 1881, and November 16th, 1883, show the F line
bright.   No mention is made of bright D3 or C, but only F was being
used to measure velocity in line of sight, and so .the others may not
have been particularly noted.
   Gothard, in ‘Astr. Nachr.,’ No. 2539, records his observations on
August 20th, 1883, when C, F, D3, and the absorption band at
 633 were visible.
   Konkoly took up this work at once, and in the O’Gyalla Observa
tions we <U+FB01>nd two sketches of the spectrum as seen by him.             In the
<U+FB01>rst C and F are bright lines sharply de<U+FB01>ned. D3 is seen as a bright
line, while between D3 and F is a bright patch of light extending
from near 520 to 560.          This seems to be absent in the second
spectrum, while dark b lines and dark D are added as well as bright
 hydrogen G with a dark line near it.
    Sherman at Yale College Observatory records all the bright lines
previously observed and many others in addition, but while dark lines
are recorded by him, D and b are not mentioned.
    Gothard (‘ Astr. Nachr.,' No. 2881) has observed Ha, H5, and
 Hq as dark lines in [3 Lynn, and afterwards as bright lines.
    Sherman’s observations, in which no mention is made of dark D
lines, are of extreme interest, indicating as they do that the sodium
line absorption was masked by the bright radiation of manganese,
which produces a bright <U+FB02>uting almost exactly in the position of
 D3. Gothard, in ‘Astr. Nachr.,’         No. 2581, records the fact that
 the dark sodium lines became visible only when D3 had ceased
 to be seen as a bright line. Later on in the same paper, however,
 he records bright D3 and dark D in [3 Lyrae, and Konkoly, in

 When we consider the great variations in brightness of DS in these
stars and the great changes in the conditions of the radiating
 meteorites and their atmospheres, indicated by these changes of
 brightness, these apparently discordant results are not so dif<U+FB01>cult to
 understand. An increase in the number of meteorites containing Mn
would cut out all the D absorptiOn and brighten D3 ; an increase of
 sodium and a decrease of Mn would cause the D dark lines to assert
themselves, while the condition of bright D3 and dark D is obtained
by increased quantities of Mn and N a vapours produced by collisions?
     Sherman does not record dark b lines, although Konkoly observed
them Several times. Sherman, however, saw the bright carbon at
517, which would completely mask the b lines.                     It seems possible
Konkoly saw this bright carbon, and by contrast with the surrounding

 Gothard noticed it; so after all it may be probable that Konkoly’s
record of magnesium absorption at b was right, and that in Sherman’s
observation it was masked by the carbon band.
   Sherman, in ‘ Astr. Nachr.,’ N0. 1707, gives a list of <U+FB01>fteen bright
lines in q Cassiopeiae, the wave-lengths of which he has determined as
accurately as possible. He says,
                                      “ the di<U+FB01>iculties of the observation
and the roughness of the recording apparatus have hindered the
completely satisfactory identi<U+FB01>cation of the lines.          Assuming the
position of the hydrogen lines and D3,     and  on their basis constructing
a curve connecting scale-reading and wave-length, the mean of nine
observations upon 7 Cassiopeia: affords the following approximate
wave-lengths."      (See map.)
   The line in the yellow being assumed as D3 at 5875, instead of the
 5870 manganese,.causes an error running all through the measurements,
but not suf<U+FB01>cient to invalidate any conclusions based on the corrected
 wave-lengths.
   The hydrogen lines seen are C, F, hydrogen G, and h. We have
 the manganese at 558 and 586 (D3), 88 well as the low-temperature
line (bunsen) at 540.     Iron is represented by lines at 527, 579, and
616, these being the strongest low-temperature lines. Magnesium is
responsible for the 500 line while the carbon accounts for the 517,
thus leaving only the 636 and the 463 lines unaccounted for.
   The line at 636 has been seen in the Limerick meteorite, although
its origin has not yet been determined, while the 463 line is bright in
R Geminorum, but has up to the' present not been detected in any
experiment with meteorites. In the spectrum of the <U+FB01>rst of Wolf
and Rayet’s stars in Cygnus (B.D. 35°, No. 4001), Vogel has observed
the manganese lines at 540 and 558, the iron lines at 527 and 579,
and the hydrogen F, all of which are present in q Cassiopeias, the
only additional lines seen in 1st Cygnus being the sodium green, 569,
and cadmium, 507.
          On the Sequence of Tempcrature of the Stars in Cygnus.
   The three “ bright line stars” in Cygnus, discovered by MM.
Wolf and Rayet in 1867, present di<U+FB01>erences in their spectra, which
raise some very interesting questions for discussion.      Wolf and Rayet
did not observe any great differences in the spectra, simply recording
the fact that the second star gave the lines most brilliantly; but
Dr. Vogel has, in his investigations, brought out very striking ones.
   Thus the <U+FB01>rst of these stars, B.D. + 35°, N0. 4001, has seven bright
lines in its spectrum, as shown on his light curve, besides the bright
band at 468.      One of the bright lines is hydrogen F                The
second, B.D. + 85", No. 4013, and third, B.D. + 36°, No. 3956, stars
have only four bright lines, and the bright band; the hydrogen (F)
line being absent.

    These di<U+FB01>erences may at <U+FB01>rst sight be taken as indicating a higher
 temperature in the <U+FB01>rst of these stars than in either of the others, but
further investigation seems to indicate this is not the case. The con
 tinuous spectrum from the meteorites is very faint in each case, and
on it is superposed bright carbon, that in the blue showing itself as a
separate bright band, 468. The curve rises in each star at 564 carbon,
and is high in the position 517.
    It will be seen from the light curves that the rise at 564: is less in
lst Cygnus than in either of the other stars, and the end of the
<U+FB02>uting 558, due to the manganese, becomes visible as a line in this
star, while in 2nd and 3rd Cygnus the carbon at 564 with this <U+FB02>uting
produces such a brightening of the spectrum that the manganese
cannot be seen as a bright line.            In 2nd Cygnus the 564 carbon
is nearly equal in brightness to    the   558 manganese <U+FB02>uting, and these
produce together such an intensely bright patch between those wave
lengths that we get apparent dark spaces on each side of it. The
540 line of manganese has a considerable di<U+FB02>iculty in showing itself
on the bright spectrum due to meteorites and carbon combined,
whereas in 1st Cygnus where the radiation of carbon is weaker the
line is very bright. The invisibility of 507 and 527 in the spectra of
2nd and 3rd Cygnus stars is therefore due probably to the extra
brightness of the <U+FB02>uting spectrum due to carbon, rather than to the
lower temperature of these stars. The greater number of lines in
1st Cygnus indicates therefore a lower temperature than in the other
stars, and this conclusion is borne out by the appearance of the 636
line in 2nd and 3rd Cygnus, and its absence from 1st Cygnus.
    The conclusion which has been arrived at after a careful considera
tion of these stars is that let Cygnus is the coolest, 2nd Cygnus ranks
next above in temperature, and 3rd Cygnus is the hottest of the three.
    With regard to the line in 2nd and 3rd Cygnus at 636 there is an
element of doubt as to the true position. Vogel does not give the
 wave-length in his list of lines, neither does he show it in his sketch
 of the spectrum, but he indicates its position on the light curve, and
from this a curve had to be drawn andlthe wave-length ascertained as
nearly as possible. Vogel suggests the line may be the hydrogen C
 line, but this seems very improbable, since F is absent, and although
F is frequently recorded in bright-line stars without C, in no case is
 C given without F. It may be the C line is seen clearly because
 there is no continuous spectrum near it, while F is not visible on
account of the bright spectrum around it.
    The  above   stars are not the only ones with bright lines in the
constellation Cygnus.

    A  recent photograph of the region in Cygnus, previously known to
 contain four spectra exhibiting bright lines, has served to bring to
our knowledge four other spectra of the same kind. One of these is
 that of the comparatively bright star P Cygni, in which bright lines,
apparently due to hydrogen, are distinctly visible. This phenomenon
recalls the circumstances of the outburst of light in the star T Coronm,
especially when the former history of P Cygni is considered.         Accord
ing to Schdnfeld, it <U+FB01>rst attracted attention, as an apparently new
star, in 1600, and <U+FB02>uctuated greatly during the seventeenth century,
<U+FB01>nally becoming a star of the <U+FB01>fth magnitude, and so continuing to
the present time.       It has recently been repeatedly observed at the
Harvard College Observatory with the meridian photometer, and does
not appear to be undergoing any variation at present.
   Another of the stars shown by the photograph to have bright lines
is D.M. + 37° 3821, where the lines are unmistakably evident, and
can readily be seen by direct observation with the prism. The star
has been overlooked, however, in several previous examinations of
the region, which illustrates the value of photography in the detection
of objects of this kind.
   The other two stars <U+FB01>rst shown by the photograph to have spectra
containing bright lines are relatively inconspicuous.          The following
list contains the designations according to the ‘ Durchmusterung,’ of
all eight stars, the <U+FB01>rst four being those previously known :—35°
4001, 35" 4013, 36° 3956, 36° 3987, 37° 3821, 38° 4010, 37° 3871, 35°
3952 or 3953.       Of these 37° 3171 is P Cygni, and 37° 3821, as above
stated, is the star in the spectrum of which the bright lines are most
distinct.

I pointed out
of
                 that
             like our
                      the so-called
                                    “ stars " of Class 1110, were not masses
                      sun, but swarms of meteorites ; the spectrum being
    vapour
a compound one, due to the radiation of vapour in the interspaces and
t0 the aborption of the light of the red- or white-hot meteorites
by vapours volatilised out of them by the heat produced by colli
mom.
   I also showed that the radiation was that of carbon vapour, and
that some of the absorption was produced by the chief <U+FB02>utings of Mn
and Pb.
   These conclusions were arrived at by comparing the wave-lengths
of the details of spectra recorded in my former paper with those of

   Dunér in his map gives eleven absorption bands, chie<U+FB02>y <U+FB02>utings,
in Class IIIa, but in the case of the tenth and eleventh bands there is
some discrepancy between his map and the text, to which reference
will be made subsequently. His measurements are of the darker
portions of the <U+FB01>utings, speaking generally.
   It will be clear at once that in the case of the dark <U+FB02>utings the dark
bands should agree with the true absorption of the vapours, and that
when the amount of absorption varies, only that wave-length away
from the maximum of the <U+FB01>utings will vary.         Thus, the same <U+FB02>uting
may be represented in the following manner, according to the quantity
of the absorbing substance present.

 brighter and wider the bright <U+FB02>utings are the more the dark <U+FB02>utings
 on either side of them will appear to vary, and in two ways: <U+FB01>rst,
 they will dim by contrast when the bright <U+FB02>uting is dimmer than
 ordinary; and secondly, the one on the side towards which the bright
 <U+FB02>uting expands from its most decided edge will diminish as the bright
 <U+FB02>uting expands.      See  following diagram.
FIG. l3.—Diugram   showing the variation in width of a bright <U+FB02>uting and the conse
         quent variation in width of the contrast band at the fainter edge.
   There is also another important matter to be borne in mind. As
these spectra are in the main produced by the integration of the con
tinuous spectra of the meteorites, the bright <U+FB02>utings of carbon, and
the dark <U+FB02>utings produced by the absorption of the continuous
spectra by the vapour surrounding each meteorite; the proportion of
bright <U+FB02>uting area to dark <U+FB02>uting area will vary with the reduction
of the spacing between the meteorites.
   If any bright or dark <U+FB02>utings occur in the same region of the
spectrum, when the spaces are greatest, the radiation effect will be
stronger, and the absorption <U+FB02>uting will be “masked;” where they
are least the radiation itself will be masked. This reasoning not only
applies to <U+FB02>utings but to lines also.

The brightest less refrangible edge of the chief one is at wave-length
517, where it sharply cuts o<U+FB02>" the tail end of the absorption of the
magnesium <U+FB01>uting the darkest edgeiof which begins at 520, as the
carbon light from the interspace pales the absorption.     The same

     Ifthis explanation of the rigidity of the less refrangible edge may
be accepted,        suggested that the rigidity of the end of band
                     it   is                                           at                                         8
11-96, near the nebula line 495, seems to indicate that we may have
that line as the bright, less refrangible, boundary of another radiation

next more refrangible one, which would be most easily seen, as the

refrangible and brightest edge at 474.

   It    not necessary for me to point out the extreme and special
          is
dif<U+FB01>culty of observations and determinations of wave-lengths in this
part of the spectrum.   Taking this into consideration, and bearing in
mind that my observations of the chemical elements have shown me
no other bands or <U+FB02>utings in this region,     feel justi<U+FB01>ed in looking       I
upon the narrow bright space between bands        and 10 as an indica              9
tion of another carbon <U+FB02>uting—the one we should expect to <U+FB01>nd
associated with the one at 517, with its bright edge at 473 instead of
476, where Dunér's measurements place it.     There       bright <U+FB02>uting                    is  a
in this position in Nova Orionis.

1888.]          of  the various Species of IIeavenly Bodies.            53
    I shall refer to both these points later on.
    The third <U+FB01>uting, the carbon' one with its brightest edge at 564:, is
certainly also present; though here the proof depends upon its
masking eEect, and upon the manner in which this effect ceases when
the other <U+FB02>utings narrow and become faint.
    In addition to these three <U+FB01>utings of carbon, which we shall dis
tinguish in what follows as carbon A, there is sometimes a fourth
more refrangible one beginning at wave-length 461, which is due            _
to some other molecular form of carbon; this we shall distinguish
as carbon B. It extends from wave-length 461 to 451, and, as we
shall presently see, it is this which gives rise to the apparent
absorption band No. 10 in the blue.
    It is very probable also that in some cases there is, in addition to
carbon A and carbon B, the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>uting which begins at
wave-length 4:31, the evidence of this being Dunér’s apparent absorp
tion band 11. It may be remarked here, that although most of the
luminosity of this <U+FB02>uting is on the more refrangible side of 4.31, there
is also a considerable amount on the less refrangible side.
     \Vith regard to bands 9, 10, and 11, then, there is little doubt that
 they are merely dark spaces between the bright blue <U+FB02>utings of
carbon, and that whether they are seen or not depends upon the
 relative brightness of the carbon <U+FB02>utings and the continuous spectrum
 from the incandescent meteorites. When the continuous spectrum
 is faint, it will not extend far into the blue, and the resulting dark
 space between the bright carbon A <U+FB02>uting at 474 and the end of the
 continuous spectrum is the origin of the apparent absorption band 9.
 When the continuous spectrum gets very bright, band 9 should, and
 does, disappear.       On reference to the maps of the spectra of the
 “starsH with bright lines, it will be seen that the broad apparent
 absorption band in the blue agrees exactly in position with band 9,
 and it undoubtedly. has the same- origin in both cases. This band
 may therefore be regarded as the connecting link between the bodies
 belonging to Group I and those belonging to the group under con
 sideration.
      Band 10 is the dark space between the bright carbon A <U+FB01>uting at
  4-74 and the carbon B at 461, and can only exist so long as the carbon
  <U+FB01>utings are brighter than the continuous spectrum.         Dunér’s mean
  values for the band are 461—473, and on comparing these with the
  wave-lengths of the carbon <U+FB02>utings (see <U+FB01>g. 16) it will be seen that
  the coincidence is almost perfect.
      There is a little uncertainty about band 11, which Dunér was only
  able to measure in one star, but it very probably has its origin in the
  dark space between the bright carbon B <U+FB02>uting and the hydrocarbon
  <U+FB02>uting at 431 (see <U+FB01>g. 16). This would give a band somewhat
  broader and more refrangible than that shown in Dunér’s map; but,

   In order to prove that my explanation of the nature of these
celestial bodies is suf<U+FB01>cient, a discussion of the individual observa
tions of them, seeing that di<U+FB02>'erences in the spectra are known to
exist, should show that all the differences can be accounted for in the
main by di<U+FB01>erences in the amount of interspace        that  to say, by a      ;         is
di<U+FB01>erence between the relative areas of space and meteorite in a
section of the swarm at right angles to the line of sight.    say in the                   I
main, because subsequent inquiry may indicate that we should expect
to <U+FB01>nd minor differences brought about by the beginnings of conden
sation in large as opposed to small swarms, and also by the actual or
apparent magnitudes of the swarms varying their brilliancy, thus
enabling     amore minute study to be made of the same stage of heat
in one swarm than in another.
   How minor differences may arise will be at once seen when we con
sider the conditions of observation.
   The apparent point of light generally seen      on my view producedis
not by a mass of vapour of more or less regular outline and structure,
but by   a swarm of meteorites perhaps with more than one point of
condensation.
   An equal amount of light received from the body may be produced
by any stage, or number of nuclei, of condensation; and with any
di<U+FB01>erences of area between the more luminous centre and the outliers
of the swarm.
   All these conditions producing light of very different qualities are
integrated in the image on the slit of the spectroscope.
I    have said “generally seen,” because     has been long know that
                                                                it
many   of the  objects am  now Idiscussing are variable, as well as red,
and that at the minimum they are not always seen as sharp points of
lightf but have been described as hazy.
   The severe nature of the tests at our disposal will be recognised
when We inquire what must follow from the variation of the spacing.
Thus, as the spacing     reduced—     is
  I.  The temperature must increase.

proceed to discuss M. Dunér’s individual observations.    shall show     I
subsequently that there are, in all probability, other bodies besides
those he has observed which really belong to this group.
              II.   DISCUSSION      or Dus<U+FB01>s‘s        INDIVIDUAL   OBSERVATIONS.
                Consideration      of   the   Extreme Conditions   of Spacing.
     Cazteris paribus, when the interspaces are largest we should have a
preponderance of the radiation of carbon, so far as quantity goes. The
bands will be wide and pale, the complete radiation will not yet be
developed; a minimum of metallic absorption phenomena—that is.
only the <U+FB01>utings of magnesium       and 7), the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>uting of manga

nese (3), and the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>uting of iron       but the great width of the
bright band at 517 will mask band 8.
   When the interspaces are least, the radiation of carbon should give
place to the absorption phenomena due to the presence of those
metallic vapours produced at the highest temperature at which a
swarm can exist as such; the bright <U+FB02>utings of carbon should be

diminished, and the true absorption <U+FB02>utings of Mg, Fe, Mn, Pb, and
the band of Ba, should be enhanced in intensity.
   There will be an inversion between the radiation and absorption.
   The highest intensity of the absorption phenomena will be indicated
by the strengthening of the bands 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the appear
ance of the other <U+FB02>utings and bands specially recorded in a Orionis.
The bands 7 and 8 will disappear as they are special to a low tempera
ture, and will give way to the absorption of manganese, iron, b, (be.
   This inversion, to deal with it in its broadest aspect, should give us
at the beginning 7 strong, and 2, 3 weak, and at the end 7 and Sweak,
and 2, 3 strong.
   The <U+FB01>rst stage, representing almost a cometic condition of the
swarm before condensation has begun, has been observed in Nos. 3,‘l
23, 24:, 25, 36, 68, 72, 81, 118, 247, 249.       There is a very large number
of similar instances to be found in the observations.             The above are
only given as examples.                                 -
   The last stage, before all the bands fade away entirely, has been
observed in Nos. 1, 2, 26, 32, 33, 38, 40, 61, 64, 69, 71, 75, 77, 82, 96,
101, 116.     As before, these are only given as instances.
   It is natural that these extreme points along the line of evolution
represented in the bodies under consideration should form, as               I think
they do, the two most contrasted distinctions recorded by Dunér——
that is, recorded in the greatest number of cases.
                    Origin. of the Disconl'lnuous   Spectrum.
   I  have already shown that when the meteorites are wide apart,
though not at their widest, and there is no very marked condensation,
the spectrum will extend farther into the blue, and therefore the
<U+FB02>utings in the blue will be quite bright; in fact, under this condition
the chief light in this part of the spectrum, almost indeed the only
light, will come from the bright carbon. Under this same condition
the temperature of the meteorites will not be very high, there will
therefore be little continuous spectrum to be absorbed in the red and
yellow.     Hence we shall have discontinuity from one end of the
spectrum to the other. This has also been recorded, and in fact it is
the condition which gives us almost the most beautiful examples of
the class (196, z Herculis, 141, 172, 229).
   The   defect of continuous light in the blue in this class, after conden
sation has commenced,          and the carbon <U+FB02>utings are beginning to
disappear, arises from defect of radiation of the meteorites, and hence
in all fully-developed swarms the spectrum is not seen far into the
blue for the reason that the vapours round each meteorite are at a
temperature such that <U+FB02>uting absorption mainly takes place, although
       ' The references are to the numbers of the stars in Dunér's catalogue.

58             Mr.   J. N. Lockyer.       On the Classi<U+FB01>cation        [Apr. 12,
of course there must be some continuous absorption in the blue. This
is perhaps the most highly-developed normal spectrum-giving condi
tion; 44, 45, 55, 60, 65, 86, 9‘2, 278 are examples.
                         The  Paling 0f  the Flulings.
   Subsequently, the spectra are in all cases far from being discon
tinuous, and the <U+FB02>utings, instead of being black, are pale.               Thus,
while  the  bands   are dark  in  the  stars we   have named,     they  are  not
so dark in a Orionis.       Here, in short, we have a great distinction
between this star and a Herculis, o Ceti, R Lynn, and p Persei.
   Obviously this arises from the fact that the average distances
between the meteorites have been reduced; their temperature being
thereby increased as more collisions are possible, the vapours are
nearly as brilliant as the meteorites, and radiation from the inter
spaces cloaks the evidences of absorption.          Nor is this all: as the
meteorites are nearer together, the area producing the bright <U+FB01>ntings
of the carbon is relatively reduced, and the bands 10 and 9 will fade
for lack of contrast, while 8 and 7 will fade owing to the increased
temperature of the system generally carrying the magnesium absorp
tion into the line stage; b is now predominant (see 102, 157, 163,
114, 125, 135).
   Under these     conditions the outer absorbing metallic atmosphere
round each meteorite will in all probability consist of Mn and Fe
vapours, and in this condition the masking eifect will least apply to
them. This is so (114, 116) ; they remain dark, while the others are
p ale.
   Here we have the indication         of  one  of the penultimate       stages
already referred to.
                         Phenomena    of Condensation.
    Dealing specially with the question of condensation,—I                 have
already   referred   to possibly   the  <U+FB01>rst condition   of all,   recorded   by
 Dnnér iu the observations now discussed—I may say that the <U+FB01>rst
real and obvious approach to it perhaps is observed when all, or
nearly all, except 9 and 10 of the <U+FB02>utings are wide and dark.               The
 reasons  will be  obvious  from   what  has  been  previously   stated.    Still
 more condensation will give all, or nearly all, the bands wide and
 pale, while the <U+FB01>nal stage of condensation of the swarm will be
reached when all the bands fade and give place to lines. We have
then reached Class      II (107, 139, 168, 264); 2 and 3 should be and.
 are perhaps the last to go (203).

1888.]        of  the various Species   of  Heavenly Bodies.            59
                            The Bands 9 and 10.
    With regard specially to the bands 9 and 10, which include between
them a bright space which I contend is the second <U+FB02>uting of carbon,
 I may add that if this view is sound, the absence of 10 should mean
a broad carbon band, and this is the condition of non-condensation,
though not the initial condition.       The red <U+FB02>utings should therefore
be well marked—whether broad. or not does not matter; but they
should be dark and not pale.       Similarly the absence of band 9 means
non-condensation.
    Therefore 9 and 10 should vary together, and as a matter of fact
we <U+FB01>nd that their complete absence from the spectrum, while the
metallic absorption is strong, is a very common condition (1, 2, 6, 16,
26, 32, 39, 40, 46, 54, 60).
    That this explanation is probably the true one is shown by further
consideration of what should happen to the red <U+FB02>utings when 9 and
 10 are present. As the strong red <U+FB02>utings indicate condensation,
according to my view this condensation (see ante) should pale the
other <U+FB02>utings.     This happens (3, 8, 13, 28, 35, 45, 30; and last, not
 least, among the examples,    I give 50, a Orionis).
                     III. RESULTS    or 'rns DISCUSSION.
                           The Line of Evolution.
    I have gone over all the individual observations recorded by Dunér,
and, dealing with them all to the best of my ability in the light
aiforded by the allocation of the bands to the various chemical sub
stances, the history of the swarms he has observed seems to be as
follows :—
    (l) The swarm has arrived at the stage at which, owing to the
gradual nearing of the meteorites, the hydrogen lines, which appeared
at <U+FB01>rst in consequence of the great tenuity of the gases in the inter
spaces, give way to carbon.      At <U+FB01>rst the <U+FB02>uting at 473 appears (as in
many bright-line stars), and afterwards the one at 517.       This is very
nearly, but, as I shall show subsequently, not quite, the real begin
ning of the group, and the radiation is now accompanied by the
<U+FB02>uting absorption of Mg, Fe, and Mn—bands 7, 2, 3. This is the
absorption produced at the temperature of the oxy-coal-gas <U+FB02>ame,
while the stars above referred to give us the bright line of Mn seen
at the temperature of the bunsen.
    (2) The bright band of carbon at 517 narrows and unveils the Mg
absorption at band 8. We have 8 now as well as 7 (both represent
ing Mg), added to the bands 2 and 3, representing Fe and Mn, and
these latter now intensity.
    (3) The spacing gets smaller; the carbon, though reduced in

60                Mr. J. N. Lockyer.       0n the Classi<U+FB01>cation    [Apr. 12,
relative quantity, gets more intense. The second hand at 473 in the
blue gets brighter as well as the one at 517. We have now bands
9 and 10 added.        This reduced spacing increases the number of col
lisions, so that Pb and Ba are added to Mg, Fe, and Mn. We have
the bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. This is the condition which
gives, so to speak, the normal spectrum.
     (4) This increased action will give us a bright atmosphere round
each meteorite, only the light of the meteorite in the line of sight
will be absorbed: we shall now have much continuous spectrum from
the interspaces as well as the vapour of carbon.              The absorption
flu-tings will pale,  and the Mg <U+FB01>utiugs    will disappear on  account of the
higher temperature, while new ones will make their appearance.
     (5) Greater nearness still will be followed by the further dimming
of the bright carbon <U+FB02>utings including the one at 517. The blue end
of the spectrum will shorten as the bands fade, narrow, and increase
in number. If the star be bright, it will now put on the appearance
of a. Orionis; if dim, only the <U+FB02>ntings of Fe and Mn(l), bands 2 and
3,   will remain prominent.
     (6)  All the <U+FB02>utings and bands gradually thin, fade, and disappear.
A    star of the third group is the result.
     In the latter higher-temperature stages we must expect hydrogen
to be present, but it need not necessarily be visible, as the bright
lines from the interspaces may cancel or mask the absorption in the
line of sight of the light of the meteorites; but in case of any violent
action, such as that produced by another swarm moving with great
velocity, we must expect to see them bright, and they are shown
bright in a magni<U+FB01>cent photograph of o Ceti, taken for the Draper
Memorial, which        I owe to the kindness of Professor Pickering.         I
shall return to this question.
                  Stages antecedent to those recorded by Dunér.
      So far  I  have referred to the swarms observed by Dunér.           The
 result of the discussion has been to show that all the phenomena are
 included in the hypothesis that the <U+FB01>nal stages we have considered
 are antecedent t0 the formation of stars of Group III, bodies which
give an almost exclusively line absorption, though these bodies are
 probably not yet stars, if we use the term star to express complete
 volatilisation, similar to that observed in the case of our sun.
      The question then arises, Are all the mixed <U+FB01>uting stages really
 included among the objects already considered ?
      It will be remembered that in my former communication adduced I
 evidence to the effect that the mixed <U+FB02>uting stage was preceded by
 others in which the swarms were still more dispersed, and at a lower
  temperature.      The <U+FB01>rst condition gives us bright hydrogen; the last
  little continuous spectrum to be absorbed, so that the spectrum is one

1888.]         of  the various Species  of Ifea'venly Bodies.              61
with more bright lines than indications of absorption;          and, in fact,
the chief difference between the spectra of these swarms and of those
still sparser ones which we call nebulae lies in the fact that there are
a few more bright metallic lines or remnants of <U+FB02>utings; those of
magnesium, in the one case, being replaced by others of manganese
and iron.
   If my view be correct—if there are stages preceding those recorded
by Dunér in which we get both dark and bright <U+FB02>utings—it is among
bodies with spectra very similar to these that they should be found.
   The <U+FB01>rst stage exhibited in the objects observed by Dunér is
marked by <U+FB02>utings 7, 3, and 2 (omitting the less refrangible one not

lowest temperatures.
   The stars which     I look upon as representing a prior stage should
have recorded in their spectra the <U+FB01>utings 7 and 3 (without 2), re
presenting Mg and Mn.

   We   are now   in a position to apply all that has gone   before in sum
marised statements of the various spectral changes,         including those
connected   with hydrogen, which take place not only in these objects
studied by Dunér, but in those others to which I have referred as
forming the true beginning of the group.
   The following statements and tables, however, must not be taken
as anything else than a <U+FB01>rst approximation to the real criteria of
speci<U+FB01>c di<U+FB01>erences.      I am convinced that further thought is required
on them, and that such further thought will be well repaid.
    The Sequence of the Various Bands in the Spectra     of the  E laments
                       indicated by Bodies of the Group.
   In comparing the spectrum of an element which         has been    mapped
in the laboratory with the absorption bands in the spectrum of a
“star,” we need only consider those bands and <U+FB01>utings which stand
out prominently and are the <U+FB01>rst to <U+FB02>ash out when there is only a
small quantity present. Thus, in the <U+FB02>ame spectrum of barium there
is an almost continuous background of <U+FB01>utings with a few brighter
bands in the green, and it is only important to consider the bands, as
the <U+FB01>utings would mainly produce a general dimming of the continu—
ous spectrum.      In order to show at a glance what portions of the
spectrum of an element it is most important for us to consider in this
discussion,  I  have reconstructed the map of low-temperature spectra
which   I gave in my previous paper, with reference to those elements
which are indicated in the spectra of bodies of Group II. Five orders
of intensities are represented, the longest lines, <U+FB02>ntings, or hands

being the brightest (<U+FB01>g. 14).         The lines, <U+FB02>utings, or bands in
the lowest horizon, in the case of each element, are those seen at
the lowest temperatures, and are the <U+FB01>rst to appear when only
a small quantity of substance is present.           Those in the upper
horizons are the faintest, and are only seen when the tempera
ture is increased, or a considerable amount of the substance is
volatilised.   The map shows that if there are any indications of
magnesium, for instance, in bodies at low temperatures, the <U+FB02>uting
at 500 will be seen, possibly without the other <U+FB02>uting or lines. The
<U+FB01>rst indications of manganese will be the <U+FB02>uting at 558, and so on.
Again, on account of the masking effect of the spectrum of one element
upon that of another, we may sometimes have an element indicated in
a. star spectrum, not by the brightest band or <U+FB02>uting in its spectrum,
but by the second or even third in brightness; this, of course, only
occurs when the darkest band falls on one of the brightest <U+FB02>utings of
carbon, or upon a dark band in the spectrum of some other element.
In the former case the dark band will be cancelled or masked ; in the
latter case the two absorptions will be added together, and form a
darker band of a di<U+FB01>ercnt shape.
                         The Question  of Masking.
   If we consider the masking e<U+FB01>ects of the bright carbon <U+FB02>utings
upon the absorption spectrum of each of the elements which, accord
ing to the results obtained, enter into the formation of Dunér’s bands,
we have the following as the main results :—
   Magnesium.—-There are two <U+FB02>utings of magnesium to be considered,
the brightest at 500 and the other at 521.       In the earlier stages of
Dunér‘s stars only   the fainter one   at 521 is  visible, but the absence
of the brightest at 500 is accounted for by the masking effect of the
bright carbon <U+FB02>uting starting at 517. As the carbon fades, the 517
<U+FB02>uting narrows and the absorption of magnesium 500 becomes
evident.
   Manganese—The       two chief <U+FB01>utings of manganese are at 558 and
586, the former being the brightest <U+FB02>uting in the spectrum.            The
second <U+FB02>utiug is seen in all {of Dunér's stars.      The <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>uting, 558,
however, does not appear as an absorption <U+FB01>uting until the radiation
<U+FB01>uting of carbon starting at 56% has narrowed suf<U+FB01>ciently to unmask
it. It is thus easy to understand why, in some stars, there should be
the second <U+FB01>uting of manganese without the <U+FB01>rst.
   Barium.—The spectrum of barium consists of a set of <U+FB01>utings ex
tending the whole length of the spectrum, and standing out on this
as a. background are three bright bands;        the brightest band is at
515, the second is at 525, and the   third, a broader band, is about 485.
The second band is recorded as an absorption band in Dunér’s stars,
the apparent absence of the <U+FB01>rst band being due to the masking

effect of the bright carbon at 517. The third band at 485 probably
forms a portion of band 9. A fourth band, at 533, and the three
brightest <U+FB02>utings at 602, 635, and 648 are also seen in a Orionis.
   Chromium.—The <U+FB02>utings of chromium do not form portions of
the ten principal bands of Dunér, but the brightest are seen in
a Orionis.    The brightest <U+FB02>uting is at 580, and this forms band 1 ; the
second, at 557, is masked by the manganese <U+FB02>uting at 558, and the
third at 536 is seen as line 2. The chromium triplet about 520, which
is visible in the bunsen, is seen as line 3.
   Bismuth—The brightest <U+FB02>utiug of bismuth is at 620, the second is
at 571, the third at 602, and the fourth is at 646. The <U+FB01>rst is masked
by the iron dating at 615, the second is seen in a Orionis as band 2
 (570—577).
   The points I consider as most <U+FB01>rmly established are the masking
e<U+FB01>ects of the bright carbon <U+FB02>utings and the possibility of the demon
stration of the existence of some of the <U+FB02>utings in the spectrum by
this means, if there were no other. There are two chief cases, the
                            ”
masking of the “ nebula <U+FB01>uting 500 by the bright carbon <U+FB02>uting with
its brightest less refrangible edge at 517, and that of the strongest
<U+FB01>uting of Mn := Mn (1) 558, by the other carbon <U+FB02>uting with its
brightest edge at 564.      I have little doubt that in some quarters my
anxiety   not to  be content  to refer to the second <U+FB02>uting of Mn without
being able to explain the absence of the <U+FB01>rst one, will be considered
thrown away, as it is so easy to ascribe any non-understood and therefore
“abnormal” spectrum to unknown physical laws; but when a special
research had shown me that at all temperatures at which the <U+FB01>utings
 of manganese are seen at all, the one at 558 retained its supremacy,
I  felt myself quite justi<U+FB01>ed in ascribing its absence in species 1—4 to
the cause   I have assigned, the more especially as the Mg <U+FB02>uting which
is visible even in the nebula followed suit.
                 The   Characteristics of the Various Species.
    I append   the following remarks and references to the number of
the   bodies  in   Dunér’s catalogue, in which the speci<U+FB01>c di<U+FB01>erences
come out most strongly, to the tabular statement.            I also refer to
some dif<U+FB01>culties.

of the meteorites, 516 masking Mg 500, and 564 masking Mn(l) 558.
The bands visible in the spectra of bodies belonging to this species
will therefore be Mn(‘2) 586, and Mg(2) 521; band 9 will be so wide
and pale that it would most likely escape detection. It is very
doubtful whether any of the bodies the spectra of which have
hitherto been recorded can be classed in this species, but laboratory

    now visible is three—namely, 2, 3, and 7. The iron comes out as a
    result of the increased temperature.       Mg(l) and Mn(l) are still
    masked by the bright carbon <U+FB02>utings, and there is still insuf<U+FB01>cient
    luminosity to make the apparent absorption-band 9 dark enough to i
    be noticed.

    visible are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, the two latter still being the widest

    They will all be pretty wide, and they will be dark because the con‘

    been already specially referred to, has been too wide and pale to be

                        [Received April     5, 1888.]
PART    V.—ON   THE CAUSE or VARIATION        IN run  LIGHT or Booms or
                              GROUPS  I  AND   II.
                   I.  GENERAL    VIEWS on VARIABILITY.
   In my former paper     I referred to the collision of meteor-swarms as
producing “new stars,” and to the periastron passage of one swarm
through another as producing the more or less regular variability
observed in the case of some stars of the group under consideration.
   I propose now to consider this question of variability at somewhat
greater length, but only that part of it which touches non-condensed
swarms; i.e., I shall for the present leave the phenomena of new stars,
and of those whose variability is caused by eclipses, aside.
   It is not necessary that I should pause here to state at length the
causes of stellar variability which have been suggested from time to
time. It will suf<U+FB01>ce, perhaps, that I should refer to one of the <U+FB01>rst
suggestions which we owe to Sir 1. Newton, and to the last general
discussion of the matter, which we owe to Zdllner (‘ Photometrische
Untersuchungen,’ 76 and 77, p. 252).
   Newton ascribed that special class of variability, to which           I
shall have most to refer in the sequel, as due to the appulse of
comets.
   “ Sic ctiam stellaa <U+FB01>xue,
                              quaa paulatim expirant in lucem et vapores,
cometis in ipsas incidentibus re<U+FB01>ci possunt, et nova alimento accensw pro
stellis      haberi.    Hujns generis sunt stellae <U+FB01>xm, quaa subito appa
rent, ct sub initio quam maxime splendent, et subinde paulatim evan
 escnnt.   Talis fuit stella in cathedra Cassiopeia; quam Cornelius
 Gemma octavo Novembris 1572 lustrando illam coali partem nocte
serena minime vidit ; at nocte proxima (Novem. 9) vidit <U+FB01>xis omnibus
 splendidiorem, et luce sua vix cedentem             Veneri. Hanc Tycho
 Brahmus vidit undecimo ejusdem mensis ubi maxime splenduit ; et ex
 ea tempore paulatim decrescentem et spatio mensium sexdecim evan
                        ”
 escentem observavit      (‘ Principia,’ p. 525, Glasgow, 1871).
    With regard to another class of variables he makes a, suggestion
 which has generally been accepted since :—
    “ Sed <U+FB01>xre,
                quaa per vices apparent et evanescunt, quaaque paulatim
 crescunt, et luce sua <U+FB01>xas tertiaa magnitudinis vix unquam superant,
 videntur esse generis alterius, et revolvendo partem lucidam et partem
 obscuram per vices ostendere.       Vapores antem, qui ex sole et stellis
 <U+FB01>xis et caudis cometarum oriuntur, incidere possunt per gravitatem
 snam in atmosphieras       planetarum et- ibi condensari et converti in
 aquam et spiritus    humidos,  et subinde per lentum calorem in sales et
 sulphura et tinctures et limum et lutum et argillam et arenam et
 lapides et coralla et substantias alias terrestres paulatim migrare."

 1888.]         of  the various Species   of Heavenly Bodies.             81
    Ztillner in point of fact advances very little beyond the views
advocated by Newton and Sir W. Herschel.              He considers the main
causes of variability to be as follows. He lays the greatest stress upon
an advanced stage of cooling, and the consequent formation of scoriaa
which <U+FB02>oat about on the molten mass.          Those formed at the poles are
driven towards the equator by the centrifugal force, and by the
increasing rapidity of rotation they are compelled to deviate from
their course. These facts, and the meeting which takes place between
the molten matter, <U+FB02>owing in an opposite direction, in<U+FB02>uence the form
and position of the cold non-luminous matter, and hence vary the
rotational eifects, and therefore the luminous or non-luminous appear
ance of the body to distant observers.
    This general'theory, however, does not exclude other causes, suchus;
for instance, the sudden illumination of a star by the heat produced
by collision of two dark bodies, variability produced by the revolution
of a dark body, or by the passage of the light through nebulous light
absorbing masses.
                   I
   If the views have put forward are true, the objects now under
consideration are those in the heavens which are least condensed.         In
this point, then, they differ essentially from all true stars like the
sun.
    This fundamental difference of structure should be revealed in the
phenomena of variability; that is to say—The variability of the
bodies we are now considering should be di<U+FB01>erent in kind as well as in
degree from that observed in some cases in bodies like the sun or
a Lyme, taken as representing highly condensed types.          There is also
               I
little doubt think,      that  future research  will show that when we get
short-period variability in bodies like these, we are here really dealing
with the variability of a close companion.
                    II.  ON THE VARIABILITY     1N  Gsour L
   That many of the      nebulae are variable is well known, though so far
ns  I am aware there are no complete records of the spectroscopic result
of the variability.     But bearing in mind that in some of these bodies
we have     the  olivine  line by itself, and in others, which are usually
brighter, we have the lines of hydrogen added, it does not seeui
unreasonable to suppoee that any increase of temperature brought
about by the increased number of collisions should add the lines of
hydrogen to the spectrum of a nebula in which they were not pre
viously visible.
   The explanation of the hydrogen in the variable stars is not at <U+FB01>rst
so obvious, but a little consideration will show that this must happen
if my theory be true.
                                                  I

very akin to nebulae in their structure, we might, reasoning by analogy,
suppose that any marked variability in their case also would be
accompanied by the coming out of the bright hydrogen lines.
    This is really exactly what happens both in )9 Lyras and in :1 Gas
siopeiae.     In B Lyra; the appearance of the lines of hydrogen has a,
period of between six and seven days, and in q Cassiopeiaa they appear
from time to time, although the period has not yet been determined.

now beginning to replace the <U+FB02>utings—balence the absorption of the
meteoric nuclei.
   Anything which in this condition of light-equilibrium will increase
the amount of incandescent gas and vapour in the interspaces will.
bring about the appearance of the hydrogen lines as bright ones.
The thing above all things most capable of doing this- in a most
transcendental fashion. is the invasionof one'part of the swarm by

     variation. In this case, there will be a. greater number of collisions at perias
     tron than at other parts of the orbit.  The variation in the light, however, will
     not be very great under the conditions represented, as the revolving swarm never
     gets very near the middle of the central one.
another one moving with a high velocity.                  This is exactly what I
postulate.     The wonderful thing under these circumstances then
would be that bright hydrogen should not add itself to the bright
carbon, not only in bright-line stars, but in those the spectrum of which
consists of mixed <U+FB02>utings, bright carbon representing the radiation.
   I  now propose to use this question of variability in Group               II  as a
further test of my views.
                                                                          G 2

84                Mr.  J. N. Lockyer.        On the Chsz<U+FB01>cat-ion           [Apr. 12,
   The <U+FB01>rst test we have of the theory is that there should be more
variability in this group than in any of the others. Others are as
follows:          When the swarm is most spaced, we shall have the least
results from collisions, but           when it is fairly condensed, the effect
at periastron passage (if we take the simplest case of a double star 'in
posse) will be greatest of all, because (4) condensation may ultimately
bring the central swarm almost entirely within the orbit of the
secondary (cometic) body, in which case no collisions could happen.
FIG. 19.—Explanation of     the variability of bodies of Group II.    (3.) Minimum
     variation.    Under the conditions shown, the smaller swarm will never be
     entirely out of the larger one, and at periastron the number of collisions will
     not be very greatly increased.   Consequently, the variation in the amount of
     light given out will be small.
   In   the   light of what    has gone     before it is as easy to test these
points   as the   former ones.

its great range. The light may be stated in the most general terms to
vary about six magnitudes—from the sixth to the twelfth.        This,                                                         I

             I                          A variation of six magnitudes

250 times brighter than at its minimum.‘

the variability of stars which have been suggested, those which have
been always most in vogue consider the maximum luminosity of the

 stars of short period, which obviously are not here in question, there
 can be no reasonable doubt, that the eclipse explanation is a valid
 one; but in cases such as we are now considering, when we may say
 that the ordinary period is a year, this explanation is as much out of
 place on account of period, as are such suggested causes as stellar
 rotation and varying amount of spotted area on a stellar surface, on
 account of range.
    We are driven, then, to consider a condition of things in which
 the minimum represents the constant condition, and the maximum a
 condition imposed by some cause which produces an excess of light ;
 so far as I know the only explanation on such a basis as this that has
 been previously offered is the one we owe to Newton, who suggested
 such stellar variability as that we are now considering was due to
con<U+FB02>agrations brought about at the maximum by the appulse of
comets.
 How the Di<U+FB01>iculz‘y of Regular Variabilily011Neu-ton's      View is  got over
                                  in mine.
    It will have been noticed that the suggestion put forward by
myself is obviously very near akin to the one put forward by Newton,
and no doubt his would have been more thoroughly considered than
it has been hitherto, if for a moment the true nature of the special
 class of bodies we are now considering had been en e'vidvnce.            We
know that some of them at their minimum put on a special ap
pearance of their own in that haziness to which I have before
referred as having been observed by Mr. Hind. My researches show
that they are probably nebulous, if indeed they are not all of them
 planetary nebula in a further stage of condensation, and such a
 disturbance as the one I have suggested would be certain to be com
petent to increase the luminous radiations of such a congeries to the
extent indicated.
    Some writers have objected to Newton’s hypothesis on the ground
that such a con<U+FB01>agration as he pictured could not occur periodically ;
but this objection I imagine chie<U+FB02>y depended upon the idea that the
con<U+FB01>agration brought about by one impact of this kind would be quite
suf<U+FB01>cient to destroy one or. both bodies, and thus put an end to any
possibilities of rhythmically recurrent action. It was understood that
the body cou<U+FB01>agrated was solid like our earth. However valid this
objection might be as urged against Newton’s view, it cannot apply to
mine, because in such a swarm as I have suggested, an increase of
light to the extent required might easily be produced by the incan
descence of a few hundred tons of meteorites.
    I have already referred to the fact that the initial species of the stars
we are now considering have spectra almost cometary, and this leads
us to the view that we may have among them in some cases swarms

1888.]          of the various Species    of Heavenly Bodies.              8‘.)
with double nuclei    -—incipient double stars, a smaller swarm revolving
round the larger     condensation,   or rather round their common centre
of gravity. In such a. condition of things as this, it is obvious that,
as before stated, in the swarms having a. mean condensation this
action is the more likely to take place, for the reason that at <U+FB01>rst the
meteorites are too sparse for many collisions to occur, and that, <U+FB01>nally,
the outliers of the major swarm are drawn within the orbit of the
smaller one, so that it passes clear. The tables show that this view is
entirely consistent with the facts observed, for the greater number of
instances of variability occur in the case of those stars in which on
other grounds moan spacing seems probable.
                          The Cases of Small Range.
    So far, to account for the greatest diEerence in luminosity at
periastron passage, we have supposed the minor swarm to be only
involved in the larger one during a part of its revolution, but we can
easily conceive a condition of things in which its orbit is so nearly
circular that it is almost entirely involved in the larger swarm.
Under these conditions, collisions would occur in every part of the
orbit, and they would only be more numerous at periastron in the
more condensed central part of the swarm, and it is to this that I
ascribe the origin of the phenomena in those objects—a very small
number—in which the variation of light is very far below the normal
range, one or two magnitudes instead of six or seven.           Of course, if
 we imagine two subsidiary swarms, the kind of variability displayed
 by such objects as [3 Lyraa is easily explained.
                            Study of Light Curves.
    I owe to the kindness of Mr. Knott the opportunity of studying
                                  "
 several light curves of “ stars of this group, and they seem to entirely
justify the explanation which I have put forward.            It is necessary,
 however, that the curves should be somewhat carefully considered
 because in some cases the period of the minimum is extremely small,
 as if the secondary body scarcely left the atmosphere of the primary
 one but was always at work.          But when we come to examine the
 shape   of the  curves more    carefully what we <U+FB01>nd is that the rise to
 maximum is extremely rapid ; in the case of U Geminorum for instance
 there isa rise of <U+FB01>ve magnitudes in a day and a, half; whereas the fall
 to minimum is relatively slow.        The possible explanation of this is
 that the rise of the curve gives us the <U+FB01>rst sudden luminosity due to
 the collisions of the swarms, while the descent indicates to us the
gradual toning down of the disturbance.           If it be considered fair to
 make the descending curve from the maximum exactly symmetrical
 with the ascending one on the assumption that the immediate e<U+FB01>ect
 produced is absolutely instantaneous, then we <U+FB01>nd in all cases that           I

 90              Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer.     0n  the Classi<U+FB01>cation     [Apr.  12,
have so far studied that the star would continue for a considerable
 time at its minimum.
    Broadly speaking, then, we may say that the variables in this group
 are close doubles.      The invisibility of the companion being due to
 the nearness to the primary or to its faintness.
                                  Double Stars.
    If, in connexion with this subject, we refer to the various observa
tions which have been made of double nebulae and stars, we are
 driven to the conclusion that in many cases a double star has at one
time existed as a double nebula, while on the other hand, from what
has been stated it seems probable that in many cases the companion is a
late addition to the system.       It would seem as if we may be able in
 the future, by observing the spectra of double stars, or possibly even
 their colours when once each particular colour has been attached to
a particular spectrum, to discriminate between these two condi
tions.
    In discussing this matter, however, a dif<U+FB01>culty arises on account of
the fact that on the new view there will be no constant relation
between the mass of a swarm and its brightness.              When we see a
“star” of a certain magnitude, we cannot tell from its brightness
alone whether it is a large faint one or a small bright one, for a large
body at a low temperature may be equalled or even excelled in bright
                            ”
ness by a smaller “ star      at a higher temperature. But when we know
the spectra of the bodies, we also know their relative temperatures.
 In the absence of spectroscopic details, colour helps us to a certain
extent.
    If a pair of “ stars ” of unequal masses have condensed from the same
nebulosity, the smaller one will be further advanced along the tempe
rature curve than the larger one, and the colours and spectra will be
diiferent; but it is notiimperative that the magnitudes shall be unequal,
for the smaller swarm will for a time be considerably hotter than the
larger one.
    If the masses be very unequal, the smaller one will have the smaller
magnitude for the longest time. Where there is a great difference in
magnitude, therefore, it is generally fair to assume that the one with
the smaller magnitude has also the smaller mass.
   Another dif<U+FB01>culty in the discussion, in the absence of spectroscopic
details, is due to the similarity in colour of bodies at opposite points
of the temperature curve. Thus, bodies in Group          III   have, as far as
we at present know, exactly the same colour, namely, yellow, as those
in Group V. Again, many of the members of Group             II  have the same
colour as some in Group VI.
   The general conditions with regard to this subject may be thus
brie<U+FB02>y stated z—IE the magnitudes, colours, and spectra of the tWo

  1888.]        of the various Species  of Heavenly Bodies.             91
 components of a physical double are identical, both had their origin
 in the same nebulosity.
     If the magnitudes are nearly equal, but the colours and spectra
 di<U+FB01>erent, it may be that the one with the most advanced spectrum has
 the smaller mass, and if the advance is in due proportion, we are
 justi<U+FB01>ed in regarding them as having bad a common origin.
     If the magnitudes are very unequal, we may take the one with the
 smaller magnitude as having the smaller mass, and if it is proper.
 tionately in advance, as indicated by its spectrum or colour, we may
 regard both components as having had a common origin.              If the
 smaller one be less advanced than the larger one, as most generally
 happens, we have to regard it as a late addition to the system.
    If the two stars are of equal mass and revolve round their common
 centre of gravity they have in all probability done so from the nebu
 lous stage, and therefore they will have arrived at the same stage
 along the evolution road, and their colours and spectra will be
 identical.
    If, however, the masses are very different, then the smaller mass
 will run through its changes at a much greater rate than the larger
 one.    In this way it is possible that the stars seen so frequently
 associated with globular nebulae may be explained;     while the nebula
 with a larger mass remains still in the nebulous condition, the smaller
 one may be advanced to any point, and may indeed even be totally
 invisible, while the parent nebula is still a nebula. This condition
 may be stated most generally by pointing to those double stars in
 which the companions are small and red, although we know nothing
for certain with regard to their masses.      But if we pass to the other
category in which the companion is added afterwards, the most
extreme form would be a nebula revolving round a completely formed
star; a less extreme form would be a bright line star, or a star of the
second group, revolving round it.      In this case the colour would be
blue or greenish-blue or gray; now this is the greatly preponderating
condition, as I have gathered from a discussion of the colours of the
small companions given in Smyth’s ‘ Celestial Cycle ’; and accepting
these colours alone, we should be led to think that most of the small
companions of our present stars were not companions originally, but
represent later additions to the systems.            -
    It is obvious that there are very many other questions of great
interest lying round these considerations, but it is not necessary that
I   should refer at greater length to them on this occasion, as my
present object is only to show that a consideration of the colours of
double stars really adds weight to the; cause of variability which I
have suggested.

                               CONCHJSION.
   Although in this paper   I have  chie<U+FB02>y con<U+FB01>ned myself to the discus
sion of the probable nature of the bodies in Groups I and II,     I  have
also been engaged in the investigation of the spectra of some of the
bodies included in the remaining groups, with a view to their detailed
classi<U+FB01>cation. Here, however, the work goes on slowly for lack of
published material, especially with regard to the examination of the
stars which should be included in Groups      III  and V. \Vith regard to
Group VI, however, I may state that all the stars the spectra of which
have been recorded have been distributed among. <U+FB01>ve well-marked
species, and that there is evidence that some of the absorption is pro
duced by substances which remain in the atmosphere during the next
stage, that of Group VII.      This probability is based. upon the fact
that some of the bands are apparently coincident with bands in the
telluric spectrum   as mapped by     Brewster,    Angstrom,   Smyth, and
others.
   In special connexion with the discussion of Groups       I and II, the
spectrum of the Aurora Borealis, concerning which I have already
(January 19, 1888) communicated to the Society a preliminary not-e
indicating the possible connexion. between the spectra of the aurora
and of stars of Group II, has been further studied. By this inquiry
the work has been advanced a stage, and the view is strengthened
that in the case of the aurora the spectrum is mainly one of metallic
<U+FB02>utings and lines, probably produced by electric glows in an atmo
sphere charged with meteoric dust and the (16sz of shooting stars;
while in bodies of Groups   I and  II it is chie<U+FB02>y produced by collisions
between the component meteorites.
   It may be thought by some premature to give an extended discus
sion of the bodies belonging to the two groups which have been dealt
with before my view of their constitution has been thoroughly tested
by observations. My reasons, however, for the present publication
are twofold.   I have not suf<U+FB01>cient optical power at my disposal to go
over the ground myself, and I have been anxious to save time by
indicating to those who are at present occupied with stellar spectra,
or who may be prepared to undertake such observations with suf<U+FB01>
cient optical appliances, the points chie<U+FB02>y requiring investigation as
being of a crucial nature.
   From this point of view the small number of observatories paying
attention to these matters is much to be regretted, and the import
ance of Mrs. Draper’s noble endowment of spectroscopic photography
at Harvard College will be best appreciatedv
   I may, however, say that I have made some observations in the

clear air of Westgate-on-Sea, with a <U+FB01>ne 12-inch mirror which
has been kindly lent to me by Mr. Common, which have convinced
me of the existence of bright carbon <U+FB02>utings in a Orionis.               This is
the most crucial observation I have been able to suggest.
     The necessity for the employment of large apertures in the investi
gation is shown by the fact that with Mr. Common’s mirror I was
totally unable to see any lines in the spectrum of ry Cassiopeiaa except
the red line of hydrogen.
 . The laboratory researches on the spectra of meteorites are also being
continued.       I am glad to be permitted to state that the meteorites
employed from the commencement of my work are fragments of un
doubted authenticity which have been placed at my disposal by the
Trustees of the British Museum, and my best thanks are due to that
body.
 . I have also to thank Professor Flower and Mr. Fletcher, the o<U+FB01>cial
in charge of the Mineral Department, for their kindness in giving me
special facilities for studying our national collections.
     Finally, as before, I have to thank my assistants, Messrs. Fowler,
Taylor, and Richards for the manner in which they have helped me
throughout these inquiries.          Their intelligent and nn<U+FB02>agging zeal
have rendered me greatly their debtor.
     I  also wish to thank Mr. Ceilings for the care with which the illus
trations have been prepared.

       municated by Professor A. W. RUGKER, F.R.S. Received
       March    8, 1888.
                                  (Abstract)
   In the full paper    I have treated the subject of the radio-micrometer
in such   a manner as to arrive at the best proportions of the instru
ment.     But   I  have <U+FB01>rst referred to the fact that the invention of an
instrument of the kind was originally made by M. d’Arsonval, and it
was in ignorance of this that I sent in my preliminary note.
    The instrument consists essentially of a thermo-electric circuit
suspended by a torsion <U+FB01>bre in a strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld.            At <U+FB01>rst I
have shown that the parts cannot be too thin nor the circuit too small
until the limits imposed by practical considerations make further re
duction objectionable.      I have made the circuit of a bar of antimony
and bismuth, with the ends joined by a hoop of copper Wire.
    I have at <U+FB01>rst taken the bar as an invariable, and shown how the
copper wire may be proportioned to it to give the best results.
    By “best” may he meant that which will give the greatest de<U+FB02>ec
tion, either for the weight or for the moment of inertia of the sus
pended parts.

  and that the best number of turns of wire is 1.
     The numerical values for a particular bar 10 X         5  x  1   mm. are—
             a = 0002007 sq. cm.,                     1  =   4'621 cm.
     If the breadth be also a variable, the best rectangle is a square of
 in<U+FB01>nite size made of the samo wire, which is always the best, what
 ever shape, size, or number of turns the circuit may have.
     The best circuit with respect to moment of inertia is that which
 is practically required, because a convenient period of oscillation must
 be made use of, and so the torsion must be supposed to vary as the
 moment of inertia. A dif<U+FB01>culty was found in working the expression
 for this, which was entirely overcome by supposing the wire where it
 crosses the axis to have a sectional area proportional to its distance
from the axis, except in its immediate neighbourhood.               On this sup
 position   the resistance  and the  moment   of  inertia  of  the   upper side of
 the rectangle    are  each equal to that of half  the  same   length of copper
 wire on the sides, and thus not only has the best variation been
found, but, what is more important, the coef<U+FB01>cients for resistance
and moment of inertia have been made identical, which is required
 in order to put the equations into a simple form.
    The expressions found with respect to weight are now applicable to
moment of inertia if certain changes are made.              Thus, the <U+FB01>gure 1
in the expression for length must be replaced by %. The moment
of inertia of the active bar K must replace its weight W, and the
moment of inertia of a unit piece of copper at 5 mm. from the
axis 11.must replace its weight 1".
    It is thus found that the expressions for
                     The best sectional area, a =
                                                      \/      u

    And this is true whatever length or number of turns                  the circuit
may have.

   As  before, the best number of turns is 1.
   The numerical values are—

   These     expressions give the proportions which will produce the
greatest de<U+FB02>ection. But in case of a strong magnet the resistance
to the motion is so great as to be more than su<U+FB01>icientto make the
movement dead heat, and this is inconvenient.                    I  have therefore
introduced the effect of this resistance into the equations, and found
expressions for the best circuit that is just dead heat.

    From these it is found that the best sectional area is reduced to about
three-fourths its previous value, but that the short-er the rectangle of
copper the better, until the greatest magnetic <U+FB01>eld that can be made
use of practically is reached.
    On considering variations of breadth in the circuit, it is found that
if the upper side of the rectangle—that which crosses the axis—is
neglected, the sensibility is independent of the breadth, and that the
 following relations hold :—

 when    I) is the     breadth, and that what          I have  called the greatest

     Since the cross wire becomes increasingly mischievous with an
 increasing breadth of circuit, 1) cannot be made too small.
     Further, it appears that the copper wire should have the same
  moment of inertia and resistance as the invariable parts of the
 circuit.
     Other expressions are given, but it may be suf<U+FB01>cient to state here

1888.]                    On Hamilton’s  thbers.                        99
that the circuit which is best according to the rules given by these
equations is seven times as good as the best previously found.
   I   have then shown that the mirror must be of such a size as to
have a moment of inertia one-third of that of the active bar.           In
the particular case considered, where the active bar consists of two
pieces, one antimony and one bismuth, 5 X 1 X          i mm., at a mean
distance of 1 mm. apart, the diameter of the mirror should be 2% mm.
This size both theoretically should, and practically does, enable one
with certainty to observe a de<U+FB02>ection of 1; mm. on a scale 1 metre
distant.
    General considerations show that the antimony-bismuth bars cannot
have too small a sectional area, but that the length when already short
is only involved in a secondary manner.
    It is shown that the heat in the circuit is equalised mainly by con
duction, which is thirty times as e<U+FB01>ective as the Peltier action.
    It is found necessary to screen the antimony and bismuth from the
magnetic <U+FB01>eld by letting them swing in a hole in a piece of soft iron
buried in the brass work.
    I  have shown that the instrument imagined in the preliminary note
 would be so much more than dead beat that it would not be possible
to use it advantageously, but on making a corresponding calculation
for the best circuit, now found, using conditions which have been
proved by practice to work well together, a difference of temperature
of one ten-millionth of a degree centigrade is by no means beyond
the power of observation.
    The <U+FB01>gures given by an actual comparison between the newest
instrument and one of the original pattern is very favourable to the
 former.
    In conclusion, I have explained the peculiar action of the rotating
pile, and have shown that it is di<U+FB01>erent from that <U+FB01>gured in Noad’s
‘
  Electricity and Magnetism.’

designated as the hydraulic mean depth.

section of the liquid by that part of its perimeter in contact with the

required to pass through two given <U+FB01>xed points with the are between these points
ofa   given length, the constants of integration would not be arbitrary, and there
would be two equations from the fact of the circle passing through the given points
and another arising from the given length.      The solution here given avoids the
necessity of two such equations by employing the well-known properties of an arc
of a circle and its included segment—March 29, 1888.

diameter, so that for a pipe of 2 feet internal diameter the greatest
hydraulic mean depth would be'when the surface of the liquid had
fallen below the top by 44928, or nearly 4% inches. As the velocity
of the liquid is nearly as the square root of the hydraulic mean depth,
the pipe <U+FB01>lled to this height would carry liquid with a velocity
slightly greater than when completely full. This conclusion is only
true when the effective head of liquid is due solely to the inclination of
the pipe.      When the level of the liquid within the pipe falls the
hydraulic mean depth tends towards its minimum value, and its
decrease becomes rapid as the arc diminishes ; thus if 6 is a very small

   Although pipes and conduits for water supply are usually quite full,
those for drainage purposes are most commonly only partly <U+FB01>lled with
liquid, and the amount of liquid is liable to great <U+FB02>uctuations.              This
has led to the adoption for drainage pipes of an oval curve for the
outline of cross-section, with the longer axis of the oval vertical and
terminated at bottom by an arc of greater curvature than at top.
The form of this cress-section suggests an inquiry as to how far a.
curve which has been often treated in isoperimetrical problems would
satisfy the conditions for giving a. favourable hydraulic mean depth
in an open channel with <U+FB02>uctuating contents. We have seen that a
particular are of a circle gives a maximum for the quotient of the
area of the segment divided by the' perimeter of the arc, and we shall
<U+FB01>nd that there is a particular catenary which gives a maximum for a
corresponding quotient of the area included between its perimeter and
its chord.
   If as usual we make the directrix the axis of w, a the parameter,
and l the length of the curve, then adopting the usual notation

to amount to this elementary statical question :—A <U+FB02>exible and

for circular channel and for one formed by a catenary of equal peri

looking at the outline of such a catenary inscribed in a semicircle,
this result seems to be con<U+FB01>rmed, and the curve approaches the
oval which experience has led engineers to adopt for the section of
pipes carrying <U+FB02>uctuating quantities of liquid.
   The general result of the preceding inquiry may be summed up
in the following conclusions :-—-For all pipes and conduits employed
to convey liquid for consumption or for milling power, the circular
section    the best, as the level of the liquid in the pipe
            is                                                      rarely,                   is             if

  This result indicates a catenary with its convexity turned to the
chord and to the axis of 1, but between the limits a: = O and a: = av
the value of y becomes imaginary, the constant 0 being the hydraulic
mean depth, which must be very small in such a case as here sup
posed, if we take a: from a: = c to = a:             .1:
                             y    =    0   log
and such a notch or channel might be approximately realised by two
arcs of a catenary with parameters corresponding to the small arbi
trary value of   c.

  A notch or channel with such                     a cross-section would have an almost
constant hydraulic                      would be inapplicable to any
                             mean depth, but               it
useful purposes in the application of hydraulics.
  The cross-sections of rivers and navigable canals are regarded
chie<U+FB02>y with reference to permanence,      and the question of their
hydraulic mean depth    is less important than in the case of water

supply and drainage pipes.         In canals the trapezoidal section is that
which experience      has  almost universally established as the best wher
ever canals are carried through ordinary earth, and the rectangular
section is only adopted when the sides are composed of coherent
matter such as rock or masonry. The semicircular section for an
open channel would not approximate to the shapes usually adopted in
canals, but it may be worth remarking that the outline of the
catenary of greatest area approaches more nearly to such shapes.

 V. “ On the Compounds of Ammonia with Selenium Dioxide."
      By Sir CHARLES A. CAMERON, V.P.I.(J., F.R.(?.S.I., and on):   J
      MAOALLAN, F.I.C.        Communicated by Professor DEWAR.
      F.R.S. Received March 19, 1888.
   The following experiments were undertaken with the object of
determining the action of ammonia upon selenium dioxide.            They
have resulted in the discovery of two new compounds, which, from
what has been ascertained regarding their constitution, may, perhaps,
be best designated by the term selenosamates or ammonium salts of an
acid—selenosamic—yet to be isolated.
             Preparation of Neutral Ammonium Selenosamaie.
   Ammonia. which had been carefully dried by passing through a
series of potash tubes, was led into a solution of selenium dioxide in
absolute alcohol.      After being _ absorbed for some time, minute
crystals commenced to deposit, and when complete precipitation had
taken place, the liquid portion was <U+FB01>ltered off, the crystals washed
with alcohol, and dried over sulphuric acid in a vacuum.
   The compound formed as above described is a deliquescent salt,
which separates from its solution in alcoholic ammonia in minute,
but very well-de<U+FB01>ned hexagonal prisms and pyramids—both forms
often occurring in combination.     It is a very unstable substance, con
tinuously liberating ammonia, and tending to the formation of a
more stable acid salt.     Some of the crystals which had been placed
in a large stoppered bottle were found after some weeks to be entirely
converted into large crystals of the acid salt. It also loses ammonia
when treated with alcohol or water; and when its aqueous solution
is evaporated in a vacuum, crystals of the acid salt remain. When
heated, it is at once converted into the acid salt.    On account of its
instability, it is best prepared in a partial vacuum, and when dried
placed in a stoppered bottle, which should be quite full and kept in a
 cool place.   In this way it may be preserved of de<U+FB01>nite composition
 for a considerable time. It is with difficulty, and only partially, con
 verted into ammonium selenite by the action of water upon it. When
 barium chloride is added to its neutral aqueous solution, only a faint
 cloudiness is produced, until it is heated, when a slight precipitate
 forms, but even after standing for weeks and long-continued boiling,
 only a portion of the selenium precipitates.     Addition of excess of
 ammonia to the solution, however, precipitates a basic barium salt.
 It is but sparingly soluble in cold alcoholic ammonia. 1'6658 gram of
 solution from which crystals had deposited, left a residue of
 00134 gram, reduced to acid salt, which is equivalent to a solubility

of one part in 116 at 12°.      Heated with the alcoholic ammonia it
dissolves freely, but on cooling, the solution remains long super
saturated, crystals continuing to deposit for several days.   It is very
slightly volatile at ordinary temperatures, both in a vacuum and in a
current of air.     As might be expected, potash at once liberates
ammonia from it. Sulphurous acid and stannous chloride reduce it
with separation of selenium. It is only slightly a<U+FB01>ected by hydro
chloric or nitric acid in the cold, but strong sulphuric acid reacts
violently upon        it,
                     a portion of the salt being snblimed by the heat
evolved. Chlorine passed through its aqueous solution converts                   it
completely into ammonium selenate,—a reaction which was taken
advantage of for its analysis. 0'7820 gram was dissolved in water,
saturated with chlorine, and barium chloride added.      The resulting
barium selenate weighed 1'5150 gram, equivalent to a percentage of
7684 of selenium dioxide.       The ammonia was estimated by Kjel
dahl’s process, slightly modi<U+FB01>ed on account of the volatility of the
substance.    0'5651 gram was mixed roughly with potassium perman
ganate  in  a small strong <U+FB02>ask by means of a glass rod, after which              a
thin tube containing 10 0.0. of sulphuric acid mixture was lowered
into it, and broken by shaking the <U+FB02>ask after    had been well secured

with an india-rubber cork. It was then heated to 150° for one hour
in a para<U+FB02>in bath. The contents of the <U+FB02>ask distilled with potash
yielded 0'13175 gram of ammonia, equivalent to a percentage of
23'32.    The results obtained agree with the composition—

   The original alcoholic solution from which the crystals had depo

form it  existed. a portion of the solution was evaporated to dryness

much of the nitrogen in this salt would be precipitated by platinum

poured upon it, alcohol added, and the mixture allowed to stand in
the cold. The double chloride obtained weighed 1'5502 gram, equiva
lent to    apercentage of 20'59 of ammonia. A second estimation in

 which 0'4153 gram was taken, yielded 1'1206 gram of the double
chloride, equivalent to 2069 per cent. of ammonia. In a third esti
mation, 0-3835 gram was evaporated down with platinum chloride,
but the double chloride obtained, 1'0237 gram, showed a rather
smaller percentage of ammonia, namely, 20'52.                   The mean of the
<U+FB01>rst two results, 20'64, is equal to 87'94 per cent. of the total
ammonia, and indicates that in addition to the basic nitrogen, about
three-fourths of the nitrogen contained in the radical of the salt is
precipitated by platinum chloride.
              Preparation of Acid Ammonium Selenosamate.
   A  solution of the neutral salt in absolute alcohol was boiled down
on the water-bath until crystals were deposited.               The liquid portion
was then drained OE, and the crystals washed with alcohol, and dried
in a vacuum. On examination, they proved to consist of an acid
salt. It was also found that exposure of the neutral salt in a vacuum
over sulphuric acid for thirty hours was su<U+FB02>icient to convert it into
the same acid compound.           A portion of the salt obtained in the
latter way was submitted to analysis. For estimation of the selenium,
0'2 gram was dissolved in water, saturated with chlorine, and pre
cipitated with barium chloride.           The resulting barium selenate
 weighed 0'409 gram, equivalent to a percentage of 8111 of selenium
dioxide. In a second estimation, 0'4268 gram yielded 0'8761 gram of
barium selenate, equivalent to 81'42 per cent. of selenium dioxide.
Kjeldahl’s process was found to be unsuitable in this case for esti
mating the ammonia, the amount yielded by it being much too low,
although a very high temperature was maintained for a. considerable
time. Combustion with soda-lime also gave insuf<U+FB01>cient results, owing
to a portion of the substance being decomposed by the heat employed,
with evolution of nitrogen.        Somewhat better results were obtained
by Dumas’ process: 04035 gram yielded 49‘9 0.0. of nitrogen at 12°
and 7716 mm., equivalent to a percentage of 18'09 of ammonia. Au
estimation of the selenium in the dried crystals was also made:
0'1-523  gram yielded 0'3134 gram of barium selenate, equivalent to
81'62 per cent. of selenium dioxide.        The results thus obtained agree
with the formula 3N 113,2Se02 = NH‘,H,(Se02NH2)2.

    The salt thus obtained is deliquescent, and easily soluble in alcohol,
from which it separates in large prisms. 2'02/0 grams of saturated

one part in sixteen of absolute alcohol at 14°.                No hydrate was
obtained by evaporating its aqueous solution, but the same crystalline
forms were deposited as from alcohol.               With barium chloride it
behaves similarly to the neutral         salt,  a partial precipitation taking
place only with dif<U+FB01>culty.      It possesses much grea'er stability than the
neutral salt, but like the latter it is reduced by sulphurous acid and
stannous chloride, and oxidised by chlorine.              Potash decompoaes it
with evolution of ammonia, but hydrochloric, nitric, or sulphuric
acid has only a slight action upon it in the cold. Kept in a vacuum
or in a current of air, it is appreciably volatile at ordinary tempera
tures. When heated strongly, a portion of it sublimes unchanged,
part of it is converted into ammonium selenite, while the remainder
is decomposed into ammonia, water, nitrogen, and a residue of fused
 selenium. In order to estimate the amount of ammonia precipitated
 by platinum chloride, 0'314-0 gram was taken, which yielded
 0'6234 gram of the double chloride, equivalent to 15‘26 per cent. of
 ammonia, the amount thus precipitated being equal to 81'60 per cent.
 of the total amount of ammonia in the salt.
            Relation of   the Selenoaamates    to Sulphur Compounds.
    It is stated that a compound is formed by the action of ammonia on
 sulphur dioxide, but the description of its properties shows that it
 does not correspond with the selenosamates.                 The latter bodies
 correspond more closely with the compounds which sulphur lrioxide
 forms with ammonia. The molecule, SeOQ, therefore, in these reac
 tions acts similarly to S03, rather than to what is usually regarded
as its sulphur analogue, namely $02.
    In conclusion, we are engaged at present in the production of other
selenosamates,     and hope to give an account of them at an early
date.
 VI. “On the Logarithmic            Law of Atomic Weights.”              By G.
       JOHNSTONE STONEY, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S. Received April 16,
       1888.
                                   (Abstract)
    This memoir    is divided into <U+FB01>ve sections.
    Section   1.—‘When Newlands pointed out the dependence of the
atomieity and other properties of some of the chemical elements upon
the order in which their atomic weights succeed one another, and
especially when this law was extended by Mendeleje<U+FB02>’                 to all the
elements, it became      manifest  that there    exists a mathematical  relation
between a series of numbers and the successive atomic weights of the
elements.

 116            On the   Logarithmic [Law of Atomic              lVeig/its.   [Apr.   19,
   In the <U+FB01>rst section the reason is pointed out why the search for this
law has been fruitless, at least as hitherto pursued by the author. The
method he adopted was to plot down the atomic weights as ordinates
of a diagram of which the abscissas represented some simple numerical
series, and to endeavour to extract information from the resulting
curves. In this method atomic weights are represented by lines, the
ordinates of the <U+FB01>gure. Now in the next section it will appear that,
in that case, the curve is represented by the equation—
                              3/
                                       = k-       [10g(q@)]3,
and is further complicated by a: not representing simple integer num
bers, but a circular function of them.   The search, therefore, by this
method was from the <U+FB01>rst hopeless, as the resulting curve is one which
has not been studied by geometers, and of which accordingly the
inquirer could not recognise the appearance when presented to him.
   In Section 2 another method is pursued. The successive atomic
weights, instead of being represented by lines, are represented by
volumes.    A succession of spheres are taken whose volumes are pro
portional to  the atomic weights, and which may be called the atomic
spheres.  When    the radii of these spheres are plotted down on a
diagram as ordinates, and a series of integers as abscissas, the general
form of the logarithmic curve
                                    11
                                         =       k 108 (9w)
 becomes apparent: and close scrutiny has shown that it expresses the
real law of nature. It is the central curve that threads its way
through the positions given by observation, and the deviations from
it of the positions assigned by the actual atomic weights will be in
cluded by making a: a circular function of integer numbers, instead of
those numbers themselves.    The <U+FB01>rst three terms of this function have
been determined.
   The issue of the investigation is to show that when such a diagram
is formed with ordinates which are the cube roots of the atomic
weights referred to hydrogen as unit, so that the ordinates may be
the radii of spheres whose volumes represent the atomic weights—
   1. The logarithmic curve—
                              ym       =     k   .   log (ma),
(where                      log    k     = 0785
and                        log-a.      = $986)
threads   its   way through the positions plotted down from the observa
tions.

     2. In  the case of the perissads (the elements           of uneven atomicity)
.the complete curve which          includes    their perturbations from the central
 curve is—
     y- =    k log
                   [a (m
                           4-  gain           +  §sin % + subsequent terms):],
  the next term being probably either—
                              7II7I'                               mar
                   —§sin—g—,                          or—§sin       U
     3.  The form of the function representing the perturbations of the
‘artiads is di<U+FB01>'erent, at all events after the third term.
     Section 3.-—There are other neighbouring logarithmic curves which
  pursue a course close to the observed positions, and in Section 3 the
  method adopted 'in dealing with these curves is described, and the
  grounds on which they have been successively excluded are stated.
  The evidence relied en has been, for the most part, that the perturba
  tions from them are less reducible to order.
      In Section 4 the curve <U+FB01>nally selected is thrown into a polar form,
  and furnishes a diagram of singular convenience for laboratory use.
'It presents conspicuously the information which a. Newlands and
‘Mendeleje<U+FB01>’s table is capable of supplying, with the further advan
  tage of also placing before the eye an intelligible representation of
  the atomic weights.

        SANDERSON, F.R.S.       Received March 21, 1888.
                                  (Abstract)
    The paper consists of a short description of the electric organs
-found in the skate germs, and of an account of the development of
 the electric organ of the common grey skate (Rafa batis).
     It is shown that while in some skates (e.g., Rain. batis and others)
 the organ is made up of disk-shaped bodies, in others (e.g., Raia
fullonica<U+FB01>t consists of numerous cup-shaped structures provided with
 long or short stems.                                       .
    The disks (with the development of which the paper chie<U+FB02>y deals)
 consist essentially of three layers, viz., (1) an electric plate in front in
 which the nerves end; (2) a striated layer which supports the electric
 plate; and       an alveolar layer, posterior to which is a thick cushion
 of gelatinous tissue. Each disk is formed in connexion with a muscular
 <U+FB01>bre. In young embryos there is no indication of an electric organ,
 but in an embryo 6 or 7 cm. in length, some of the muscular <U+FB01>bres at
 each side of the notochord are found in process of conversion into
 long slender clubs having their heads nearest the root of the tail.
    The club-stage having been reached, the muscular <U+FB01>bre next

   1888.]       Aluminium in certain Vascular Cryptoyams.               121
   assumes   the form of a mace, and later the anterior end further
   expands to form a relatively large disk, while the remainder of the
   original <U+FB01>bre persists as a slender ribbon-shaped appendage.     As the
  head of the club enlarges to form a disk, it passes through an indis
   tinct cup stage, which somewhat resembles the cups of the adult Raid
  fullom'ca, hence it may be inferred that in Raia fullonica the organ
   has been arrested in its development. The conversion of the muscular
   <U+FB01>bre into a club is largely caused by the increase at its anterior end
   of muscle corpuscles. These corpuscles eventually arrange themselves,
   either in front of the head of the club, to give rise to the electric
   plate, or they migrate backwards to form at the junction of the head
   of the club with its stem the alveolar layer. The striated layer, which
   is from the <U+FB01>rst devoid of nuclei, seems to be derived from the anterior
   striated portion of the club.
      The gelatinous tissue between the disks and the connective tissue
  investing them, are derived from the embryonic connective tissue
  developing disks.
   III.  “ On the Occurrence of Aluminium in Certain Vascular
         Cryptogams.” By A. H. CHURCH, M.A., F.U.S.' Communi
         cated by Dr. J. H. GILBERT, F.R.S. Received Mai-ch29,
         1888.
      Most of the older and fairly complete analyses of plant-ashes dis
  closed the presence of alumina in sensible quantities.        Gradually,
.  however, as analytical   methods became   more exact, it was generally
  recognised that this constituent had been derived from extraneous
  sources and not from the plants themselves; alumina had in fact been
  introduced by the employment of glass and porcelain vessels, of
  impure reagents, and of imperfectly cleansed vegetable products.
  Even when traces of this oxide were obtained in analyses conducted
  under the most favourable conditions, an adventitious origin was
  assigned to them, and so the item of alumina disappeared         entirely
  from the tables of the constituents of plant-ashes. Yet there were
  some conspicuous exceptions, although these were con<U+FB01>ned to certain
  cryptogams. For Ritthausen in 1851 (‘ Journ. Prakt. Chem.,’ vol. 53,
                  “ much alumina” in the ash of
  p. 413) found                                     Lycopodium compla'na
  'tum, Linn., while Alderholdt in 1852 (‘Ann. Chem. Pharm.,’ vol. 82,
  p. 111) determined the percentage of alumina in the ash of the same
  Lycopodium to be 5185 in the plant when gathered in March, and
  57'36 when collected in November.       The same chemist found 26'65
  per cent. of alumina in the ash of Lycopodium clavatum.        Again, in
   1856, Solms-Laubach found (‘ Ann. Chem. Pharm.,’ vol. 100, p. 297)
  in the ash of L. clavatum 27 per cent. and in the ash of L. complem

tum, var. Chamwcyparissus,        54 per cent. of alumina.  These results,
with others by Arosenius,          are conclusive as to the occurrence in
notable proportion of alumina in the ash of certain Lycopodia.         But
when Solms-Laubach records in the ash of Selagz'malla krams'iana,
 A. Br. (erroneously described as Lycopodium denticulatum) the occur
 rence of 2 per cent. of alumina. we may regard the observation as
 likely to be incorrect; the same remark applies to the supposed dis
 covery of a similar proportion of this earth in the ash of Aspida'um
<U+FB01>lz'm-mas and of Athym'um <U+FB01>lm's-famine.     And when the ashes of these
 plants were examined by modern methods, and with all the pre
 cautions which improved analytical processes require, then alumina
 can scarcely be recognised qualitatively in them.          In one of the
 species of Selagimlla, however, which I examined, I found a weighable
 trace of alumina, namely, 0'26 part in 100 parts of the ash. This
 plant, grown at Kew, was Selag'inella martensii, var. robusta (the
compacta of A. Braun).        The ash was large in amount, namely,
 11'66 per cent. in the dry plant; besides the 0'26 per cent. of alumina
in  it,  there was 41'03 per cent. of silica (‘Chemical News,I vol. 30,
 1874-, p. 137).   In pursuing this inquiry,      Iexamined,   with every
 possible precaution    to ensure  exactness,  three   British  species of
Lycopodz'um all obtained from the neighbourhood of Shap in W'est
 moreland, as well as the single species of Selaginella which belongs
 to Britain.    This last plant, now known as Selaginella, spinulom,
 A. Br., was formerly called Lycnpodium spinulosum; my supply
 came from Largo Links in Fifeshire.      The following <U+FB01>gures represent
 the percentages which     obtained :—

  All          results pointed unmistakeably to the conclusion that
           these
while alumina was an important mineral constituent of many species
of Lycopodium,       was practically absent from Selaginella.

tinction was con<U+FB01>rmed by an analysis of L. cernuum, which           I  subse

Podium, quite   distinct botanically from  the  group to  which  L.  alpinum
and L. claratum belong, and also distinct from the L. selago group
and the L. complanatum group. The following are the <U+FB01>gures yielded
by this plant :—

    I  found alumina (qualitatively) in the ash of another member of
the   L.   cernuum group, namely, L. casuarim'oides, Spring, from Mount
 Ophir, Malacca, but the quantity of material at my disposal was too
small to admit of quantitative determination.                      So far my results were
strongly con<U+FB01>rmatory of my conclusion that alumina was character
istic of Lycopodium, and absent from Selaginella.                         But this opinion
was soon seriously shaken by an analysis of two exotic species of
Lycopodium, namely, L. Phlegmaria, Linn., and L. billa'rdieri, Spring.
These plants were examined with the following results :—
                                                                        100 parts of ash

    On obtaining these results             I   abandoned the further prosecution of
the inquiry, it being         obvious    that     alumina could no longer be regarded
as a characteristic ingredient of the ash distinguishing Lyaopodhun
from Selaginella.            But when Mr. J. G. Baker’s work on the ‘Fern
Allies’ was published last year I turned to the classi<U+FB01>cation of the
ninety-tour species of Lycoyozlium there described, and found that
these last-named plants belonged                      to a group containing eighteen
species, all of which are epiphytic!                     It was clear that, having no
direct access to the soil, these plants could obtain alumina only from
their living hosts, which in all probability contained none or mere
traces.        The anomalous absence of this constituent from these two
Lycopodia was thus in a measure explained; at all events, it was
proved that alumina was not essential to all the species of this gennsfi‘
    The present research was extended by examining plants more or
less closely related to the two genera under discussion.                            Following
the classi<U+FB01>cation of Sachs (‘Text-book of Botany,’ edited by S. H.
   .  The analyses, in the present paper, to which an asterisk is pre<U+FB01>xed, have not
been previously published.
   1' The occurrence of a high proportion of alumina in the mineral constituents             of
those coals which give the smallest proportion of ash loses much of its signi<U+FB01>cance
when the mode of the formation of coal is considered. It is impossible to feel sure that
this ash is essential and not intrusive.         The so-called Lycopods of the Carboniferous
Period are, moreover, now believed to belong to the Selayinncew.                Of course it is
possible    that    many   of   the  plants    of  that remote   geological   epoch  may have
absorbed an element which their recent representatives refuse.

of traces of soil from which it was found impossible to free this

in the lily house, Kew,  and I have to thank the Director of the Royal
Gardens for the material which I submitted to analysis.

for analysis; the same remark applies to the allied species Tmesi-pteris
tannemis.    Selaginella comes next, and then Isoé'tea.  An analysis of
at least one of  the species of this last-named   genus   still desideis        a

I    will now revert, still following the classi<U+FB01>cation of Sachs, to the
true ferns.    In none of the British species have    been able to detect

more than traces of alumina.        But among the exotic Cyatheaccaa
which Sachs places above the Polypodiaceaa,        there seems to be a
notable exception.     Last year Mr. W. F. Howlett, of Pahiatua,
Wellington, New Zealand, forwarded to Mr. Thiselton Dyer some
specimens of the ashes of a tree-fern.      He wrote, under date 22nd
February:    “  The other  day found a half-burnt Prmga, or tree-fern.

The ashes were pure white, very tenacious, and retained the structure
of the wood.      They were obviously not in any way contaminated
with accidental impurities, nor had they been rained upon.               .

   This entirely    unexpected    discovery of nearly 20 per cent. of alumina
(two determinations gave         198 and 195) in the                ash of a tree-fern
induced me to examine the ashes of known species of other Cyatheaceso
for this substance. Three specimens of the caudex of distinct species of
these plants were furnished by the kindness of the Director of the
Royal Gardens, Kew.           Of these one only was suf<U+FB01>ciently free from
adventitious impurities to admit of trustworthy analysis. A cross
section of the caudex of this plant, Cyathea serra from the West Indies,
was sawn so as to preserve intact the whole of its pith as well as its
<U+FB01>bro-vascular sheath.         This section was broken up and burnt to a
white ash, which amounted to 2'7 per cent. of the material dried at
100°.     But it gave, on careful analysis, the merest trace of alumina.
                                                                  100 parts of ash

   Even this trace of alumina may have been extraneous, since the silica
obtained was not entirely free from sandy particles (about 1% per cent.
of the ash), although the material taken for the preparation of the ash
was apparently perfectly clean.
   Mr. Hewlett forwarded, with the              ash of the unknown            tree-fern, a
few grams of the caudex of a plant of Cyathea medullaris. The
amount was quite insuf<U+FB01>cient for a satisfactory determination of the
ash and its constituents, so I was obliged to content myself with a
qualitative examination for alumina.                The very small quantity of ash
which I obtained on the incineration of these fragments of C. medullaris
gave abundance of alumina.           Indeed, I should not be surprised to <U+FB01>nd
that the ash of the undetermined tree-fern was really that of this
species of Cyathea.          If this be the fact alumina will have been
recognised, at present, in but a single species of tree-fern.                         Other
genera of Cyatheacem, such as Alsophila and Dicksom'a, may of course
be characterised by the presence of this earth in notable quantities,
but as yet analyses are wanting.
   So far. it will be seen, alumina has been found in important quanti
ties in a single tree-fern and in a number of different kinds of Lym
 podium. The ash of another plant, however, contains over 2 per cent.

before a decisive conclusion can be drawn from this analysis.
   In a previous paper, “ Notes on the Occurrence of Aluminium in
certain Cryptogams
                        ”                                         I
                          (‘ Chemical News,’ loo. cit), have detailed the
various precautions which I have taken to prevent the intrusion of
accidental traces of alumina during the analytical operations required
for its determination.      How far such precautions have been taken by
the chemists who have recently investigated the occurrence of
aluminium in certain vegetable products, I am not aware.                     But as the
proportions   of  alumina    obtained     have      been   much   smaller    than    those
recorded by the earlier analysts,        it  may      be assumed    that   the  determi
nations are in general quite trustworthy.                 I now proceed to give a
brief notice of the more important of these later inquiries, that it
may be seen how their results di<U+FB01>'er from those to which attention
has been directed in the present paper.
   Mr. H. Yoshida found alumina in the ash of Japanese lacquer, the
latex of Rhus vemicifera (‘ Chem. Soc. Trans,’ 1883, p. 481). But
the quantity is quite insigni<U+FB01>cant.                 A tree yields annually about
2'5 grams of lacquer,     and  this   contains       from 3 to 8 per cent. of the
gum in which alone the alumina occurs.                   Mr. Yoshida found 5'1 per
cent. of ash in this gum, and on analysing its ash detected alumina
in it to the extent of 6'3 per cent. or thereabonts (‘ Chem. Soc.
Trans.,’ 1887, p. 748). Now let us see to what amount of alumina
this corresponds per tree, assuming the maximum amount, 8 per cent,
of gum above-named to be present in the latex.                          A single tree
yields—
                 Gum . . . .  ............             0‘2       gram.
                Ash in this gum     ........           O'Ol         ,,
                Alumina in this ash         . . . .    0'00063       ,,
that is, a single tree annually yields rather less than two-thirds of a
milligram of alumina. In other words, the latex or lacquer contains
0'0025 per cent. of alumina.           The chief point of interest connected

  1888.]       Aluminium in certain Vascular Cryptogams.                127
  with this fact seems to lie in the concentration of the alumina in the
 gummy     matter  contained in the latex. It should be remarked here
 that a little alumina occurs in the ash of some samples of cherry-tree
 gum and of gum arabic ;. whether this substance be constantly present
 remains to be ascertained.
    Quite recently Mr. H. Yoshida (‘ Chem. Soc. Traus.,’ 1887, p. 748)
 has determined the amount of alumina present in the ash of some
 grains and seeds, as Glycine- Soja, the soy-bean; Phascolus mungo,
 the Mung-bean (the var. radiaius) ; rice, wheat, barley, two species of
 millet and buck-wheat.      The highest percentage, 0'27‘2, was observed
 in the ash of Italian millet; the lowest, 0'053, in the ash of the soy
 bean.    In none of these cases can alumina be regarded as a character
 istic ingredient.
    Mr. W. C. Young (‘ Analyst,’ vol. 13, 1888, p. 5) con<U+FB01>rms
 Mr. Yoshida’s results as to the occurrence of alumina in wheat.       This
 experimenter found, moreover, that this constituent is intimately asso
 ciated with the gluten. In Vienna <U+FB02>our, containing 0'7 per cent. of
 ash, he found 0'0075 per cent. of phosphate of alumina, which corre
 sponds to 0'45 per cent. alumina in the ash.     This proportion may be
in excess of the truth, for, in separating the alumina strong sodium
 hydrate solution was boiled in a glass vessel, while no mention is
 made of a blank analysis having been made to control the result.
    The quantity of alumina found by L'Hote (‘ Comptes Rendus,’
vol. 104, p. 853) in grapes and in wine seems to be too small to be
taken into account; it is a mere trace.
    So far as the materials at one’s disposal warrant any de<U+FB01>nite con
clusions, it may, perhaps, be permissible to say, that aluminium is a
characteristic and abundant constituent of the ash of many, if not of
all, the species of terrestrial Lycopodia; that it is absent from Selag'i
nella and from a number of other allied vascular cryptogams; that it
is present in notable quantity in at least one species of tree-fern though
practically absent from others ; and that it occurs in insigni<U+FB01>cant
amount (like many other elements) in almost every plant in which its
presence has been carefully sought for. As to the state of combination
in which alumina exists in those plants in which it occurs in mere traces,
we have very little information, but in the cereal grains and pulses it
is probably in combination with phosphoric acid.       In Lycopodia John
states that aluminium acetate occurs, Ritthausen speaks of the malate
Arosenius of the tartrate. Anyhow it is easy to extract abundance of
an organic salt of aluminium by exhausting dried and pnlverised
Lycqiodium alpinum with boiling water. So, in some cases, at least,
the alumina present in these plants does not exist, as silica does in
Equisetum and other highly silicious vegetable structures, in an
insoluble form. As to the physiological function, if any, of this
element, it is rash to o<U+FB01>er an opinion.    It is just possible that it may

serve to some       extent to neutralise the abundant organic acids of the
plants in which it occurs, and thus assist, like the cognate element
magnesium, in the metabolic processes of vegetation.
    One further observation may be hazarded.              It remains to be seen
whether the study of the periodic function which connects the atomic
weights with the general properties of the elements will throw any
light upon the relations subsisting between vegetation and the few
elements necessary for its development.            It seems that the position of
aluminium in Mendelejeff’s third periodic series decidedly favours the
view of the peculiarity of its occurrence in certain plants, taken in
the present paper.        It stands between magnesium and silicon, two
elements of which the physiological mile is, to say the least, obscure;
while of one of them—silicon, we may af<U+FB01>rm that it is not an essential
plant-food.      Its occurrence in the ashes of various plants is indeed
more general and more abundant than that of aluminium, but appears
to be quite as capricious; and a point of difference as to the state in
which these two elements are found in plants is obvious.               Aluminium
occurs mainly if not entirely in the form of soluble organic salts,
silicon in the form of insoluble silica.                                            .
    In considering this aspect of the periodic law one cannot help being
struck with the low atomic weights of the essential elements of plants.
If we exclude certain cases of apparently casual and accidental
absorption (of such elements as bromine, iodine, copper, zinc and
arsenic) it will be noticed that Mendelejcff’s Series I, II,          III  and IV,
having a range of atomic weights from 1 to 56, comprise all the essen
tial elements, even if we include manganese, chlorine, silicon and

 Tasmania. I have also detected more than mere traces of alumina in
 the ash of the caudex of Dick-sonic squarrosa.

        malian Teeth.”          By H. G. SEELEY, F.R.S., Professor of
        Geography      in  King’s College, London. Received April 4,
        1888.
    Approximations between reptiles and mammals have been recognised
in many parts of the skeleton.‘"           They are most marked between
certain genera and orders of the two classes. The oldest known
 fossil representatives of both groups certainly approximate closer
towards each other in all known parts of skeletons than do the
orders which survive; so it may be a legitimate induction that, in an
earlier period of geological time, the characters of both groups were
so blended, that there existed neither the modern reptile, which has
specialised by losing mammalian attributes, nor the modern mammal,
which has specialised by losing the skeletal characters which have
come to be regarded as reptilian.         The most ancient mammals exhibit,
in the known parts of their skeletons, resemblances to Monotremes,
Edentates, Insectivores, and apparently Carnivores; and it is among
these orders that the closest correspondence is found, bone for bone,
with reptiles. Therefore, if an attempt were made to predict on an
inductive basis, the kind of dentition which the earliest mammals
which existed would show, it might be expected to be in harmony
with the mammalian and reptilian characters of their skeletons. On
the same basis it might be suspected that existing mammals, with

reptilian elements in the skeleton, would still preserve teeth which
might be compared with teeth of reptiles ; and as a matter of observa
tion it is found that there are several features in which teeth of
reptiles and mammals resemble each other morphologically.
   The idea conveyed by the expression “ mammalian tooth
                                                                              " is
necessarily that specialisation of tooth structure which is limited to
the mammalian class.         It may be unknown in the dental conditions
of entire families and orders of mammals. And there is an absence
of pronounced character in the incisor or canine teeth of any mammal
order which would distinguish them as mammalian.
                                                                         ”
   Similarly the idea implied in the term “reptilian tooth is the
specialisation of teeth in the reptilian class, which is as far from being
universal in the class, as mammalian teeth are universal among
mammals.         Indeed, the lower mammals emphatically approach
towards reptiles in all essential characters of tooth form.
   Because the diversities iu the teeth of the two classes have been
emphasised      for purposes of classi<U+FB01>cation, the signi<U+FB01>cance of the
resemblances     has been less considered.
   There are six typical characters of teeth which are regarded as
                                     '
mammalian. They are :—
   (1.) The presence of more than one root to a tooth;
    (2.) The implantation of teeth by distinct sockets;
    (3.) The existence of di<U+FB01>'erent kinds of teeth in the same jaw;
   (4.) The development of distinct cusps to the teeth;
   (5.) The wear of the crown with use;
   (6.) Replacement by a successions] series;
   No one of these characters can be relied on as constant in the class;
and its loss is in every case an approach towards a reptilian type.
   First, the root is not the original or essential part of the tooth.
While the sucessional teeth are within the jaw they commonly have
the roots undeveloped, and thus up to a certain stage of growth are
without this evidence of class character. There is never more than
one root to an incisor or canine tooth in any mammal; and never more
than one root to any tooth (so far as I can ascertain) in an existing
Edentate or Cetacean.          Hence if all mammals are supposed to have
had a common origin, it is legitimate to conclude that all the teeth
originally possessed but one root; and that there is a certain relation
subsequently established between the complexity of the crown and
 the number of the roots.
    The situation of a root would imply that its development is due to
 the same law of growth under intermittent pressure or strain as deter
 mines the form or elongation of any other bone.‘            If more than one

is great and the wear considerable the crown of the tooth grows in
length, while the roots are relatively small; but if the intermittent
strain on the tooth is great then the crown is relatively short and the
roots long.         The latter condition is well seen in the molars of Carni
vora; the former in the molars of rodents and ungulates. The small
roots of ungulates and rodents illustrate a mode of development of
roots: for I have seen teeth of an aged fossil horse from the gravel
in which the crown was completely worn down, and then the roots
appeared to be relatively almost as well developed as in Rhinoceroe."
Perhaps no order is more instructive in regard to the classi<U+FB01>cational
value of roots of teeth than the Sirenia, because Manalus has tuber
culate teeth and well-developed roots to the molars, while Halichore
has but one strong root to these teeth, indistinguishable from the
crown, with a hollow conical base, such as is often seen in Reptiles.
From these considerations I infer that the type of tooth—at least as
regards complexity—is to be correlated with the in<U+FB02>uences exercised
by food, and is not a distinctive inheritance.
   Secondly, the implantation of teeth in bony sockets is a mammalian.
character which is not less well marked in the Crocodilia and some
extinct orders of Reptiles.               The implantation in mammals with
single    roots   to  the molars    di<U+FB01>ers  in no way from the conditions which
I have observed in Theriodont Reptilia. There are some exceptions
among mammals to the location of teeth in sockets, since in certain
Cetacea the teeth are in a groove at the posterior end of the series.
And the Ornithorhynchus may be regarded as another exception, since
it has three teeth on each side closely united together into one long
ovate mass which is contained in a groove.                 The teeth are closer
together      than   those of   Ichthyooaurus,   and there is no more de<U+FB01>nition
of the groove        into separate    sockets   than in that genus; but there is
nothing else in common, since the base of the dental plate of Ornitho
rlzynchus can scarcely be said to have roots.                  Frederick Cuvier
described these teeth as horny,1' and many writers have been disposed
to regard them as horny plates rather than true teeth.               Sir R. Owen
quotes a French analysis of the tooth substance as yielding 99'5
horny matter and 0'3 calcareous matter;                 This may be true of the
long anterior horny plates on the jaws, but it can hardly apply to the
posterior teeth which are in a socket-groove. If the dental plate is
extracted from the jaw and examined against transmitted light, each of
the three teeth which form it will be seen to consist of a large opaqiie
sanuadrate central portion, and an external translucent border of a
horny appearance.           I  regard the latter as representing the uncalci<U+FB01>ed
enamel of the tooth, while the central portion corresponds to the

 remainder of the tooth.    I have had an Opportunity, by the kindness of
 Dr. Garson, of examining the microscopic sections of these teeth pre
 pared by the late Professor Quekett, and preserved in the Museum of
 the Royal College of Surgeons, and they con<U+FB01>rm my previous impres
 sion that the central portion of the tooth is bony (at least in some
 specimens), and in microscopic structure it shows large haversian
 canals sorrounded by spaces and canalicnli.      I therefore regard these
teeth of Orrlifhorhynchus as true teeth.     But they seem to me to be
 teeth in course of degeneration, and in process of losing their cal
careous matter.      They have already lost their root or roots, and have
partially lost their individuality.     The long anterior dental ridges
appear to have carried this change one step further and have become
dental layers formed of vertical parallel plates of horn in which there
is no division into separate teeth, which are not imbedded in the jaw,
but are a horny super<U+FB01>cial substance.      It is not without interest to
remark that some other animals which have lost their teeth, like birds,
and presumably Chelonians, which use the jaws for biting, also have
them sheathed in horn ; for the condition in Ornitho'rhg/mhm suggests
that the horny substance         may represent the lost substance of
teeth.
    Thirdly, mammalian teeth are commonly distinguishable into dif—
ferent kinds, which when fully developed vary in the forms of their
crowns, and are thus recognised as incisors, canines, premolars, and
molars.    This diiferentiation is almost entirely absent from the denti
tion of Cetacea and Edentata ; and it is well known that in di<U+FB01>erent
orders, canine teeth, or incisor teeth, or both, may be absent.       These
conditions can be frequently correlated     with  food.   But  just  as the
grouping of the teeth in mammals may approach in simplicity the
condition in reptiles, so the teeth of some reptiles in di<U+FB01>erent parts
of the jaws may parallel the divisions found in the jaws of mammals
which show considerable diiferentiation.
    The fourth mammalian character is the cnspidate condition of the
crown of the tooth. This results from a folding of the substance out
of which the tooth is formed, and among the molar teeth of many
mammals shows a specialisation which is unparalleled among reptiles.
But on the other hand the complexity of some hinder-molars becomes
simpli<U+FB01>ed in the premolar region, and among Edentatcs and Cetaceans
the tooth crowns are simpler than among some reptiles.           In several
orders of mammals it is obvious that the direction in which the folds
of tooth substance are disposed is at right angles to the direction of
movement of the lower jaw ; and therefore it may be a fair inference
that the transverse widening of molar teeth, no less than their diverse
cuspidate character, is to be attributed to the increased work which
food has given them to do in the molar region; and that development
or suppression of a cusp in allied genera of mammals depends upon this

  1888.]          of Reptilian Character in Mammalian                  Teeth;       133
 cause.      With simplicity of function there is simplicity of detail           in the
 crown of the tooth.          Some of the simplest teeth are found among the
 Edentata, where the tooth is often sub-cylindrical, but as the crown
 is worn down, its original form is not seen.                  Tatusia, however, is an
  Edentate with successional teeth, and while the crown is still within
 the jaw it has a form which is as reptilian in aspect as the molar tooth
  of a Teius. The crown of the tooth of a Cachalot is a short curved
  cone.     Hence it is manifest that the molar teeth of mammals are not
  necessarily cuspidate, and that in simplicity of crown there may be
  no character to distinguish a mammal from a reptile. From which it
  is probable that some primitive fossil mammals may also have a rep
 tilian type of dentition. The recent discovery of a set of teeth in the
 jaws of Omithor/zgnchus, hitherto unknown, raises the question whether
  those teeth are mammalian.                Mr. Ponlton has only contributed a
  vertical transverse section of one of these teeth,‘ which shows elevated
  external and internal cusps.           l have no other knowledge of those teeth,
  but the condition <U+FB01>gured is suggestively similar to a corresponding
  section of' a molar teeth of the lizard genus Te'iusi Professor Mivart
  quotes: from Mr. Poulton a passage, which I do not <U+FB01>nd in that
  gentleman’s paper, describing the tooth, and from that description it
  would appear to correspond generally with the tooth of the adult
  Omithorhynchus. I have already considered some characters of those
 teeth, and allowing for their degeneration, they seem to me to
 approach as close perhaps to the form of crown in lizards like Teius
 as to any of the larger bats.
     Fifthly, mammalian teeth are often remarkable for the wear of the
 crown. This attrition appears to depend upon the form of the crown,
 the apposition of crowns, the development of enamel, and the nature of
 food.     It is exceptionally well seen among Elephants, Ungulates, and
 Edentates; but almost all mammalian teeth show some change of
 aspect with wear.         This condition is much less general among reptiles;
 but in the extinct Ornithischia the serrated crowns of the teeth are
 as well worn as in any mammal.                The long teeth of Hyperodapedon§
 appear to be well worn down to the palate.                     Exceptionally teeth of
.Ichthyosaurus and Polyptychodon show both vertical wear and lateral
 wear, and there are specimens in the W'oodwardian Museum from the
 Cambridge Greensand in which teeth of these genera have the crown
worn away transversely almost down to the root; so that neither
wear nor its absence has any importance as a class character,

but this condition    of teeth varies in every order with the habitual
food.
    Finally, the succession of the teeth has been regarded as a mam
malian class character. It is exceptional, and an individual peculi
arity, for more than two sets of teeth to be cut in a mammal. though
evidence has been brought forward that this reptilian condition is
occasionally present in man.        But even in those mammals which cut
a second set of teeth there are commonly some molars which have
no predecessors, and are a single series throughout life.               So far as is
known, most Edentata and Cetacea           have  but   one  set  of teeth, which is
never renewed; and according to Professor Flower, Tatueia is the
only Edentate in which successional teeth are known to be developed.
I have seen no evidence of a successional tooth in any Dicynodont
reptile.    Sir R. Owen has found no evidence that the Theriodontia
possessed “a milk series of teeth.“            When a successional tooth is
present in mammals it usually originates below the tooth in wear, or
behind it as in the elephant. This condition is seen in some reptiles
as in the Ornithischia.      But the typical condition of reptilian succes
sion is for the germ of the new tooth to be on the inner side of the tooth
in wear. This is the condition in Ichthyosaurs and most of the extinct
 Reptilia, and is often though not invariably seen in Crocodiles.              It is,
 therefore, interesting that Mr. Poulton describes the new-found teeth
 in Ornilhorhynchus as possibly on the inner side of the so-called
 horny plates, though in the lower jaw they are certainly below those
 plates. Hence, if those germs are successional teeth their relative
 position would not be inconsistent with reptilian or mammalian
 type.
     From this discussion    I conclude    that in all morphological relations
 the teeth of mammals may be so simpli<U+FB01>ed as to approach closely to
 conditions which would be regarded as typically reptilian.
     I have next to show that the prevalent conception of the reptilian
 type of tooth is equally inde<U+FB01>nite.       The di<U+FB01>erentiation is less striking
 than among mammals, but in almost all morphological characters
 reptiles suggestively approach mammals, though these characters
  seem to me most remarkable in the grouping of the teeth into ana
  logues of molars, premolars, canines and incisors, and in the
  characters of the crown in molar and other teeth.             It is rather among
  the oldest extinct Reptilia that we should expect to <U+FB01>nd the nearest
  approach to mammalian dentition, and so it is; but evidences of a
  similar di<U+FB01>erentiation may be detected among Crocodiles and Lizards.
     The form of the crown varies very little from front to back among
   Crocodiles, though some teeth are relatively large, and the smaller
  posterior teeth are a little compressed transversely; but when the
  teeth are drawn from the jaw the alveoli show modi<U+FB01>cations which

might be regarded as mammalian.             This character has been <U+FB01>gured
from the lower jaw, and in 1878 it was remarked'l “among Croco
diles, I recognise in the well-known wavy outline of the jaws a
demarcation of teeth into regions which have a fair right to be
named incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, and constitute a
dentition as Theriodont in principle, but not so specialised, as is seen
in the South African fossil group. In the Crocodile the regions
are easily recognised by the form, size, and characters of the tooth
sockets when all the teeth are drawn, especially in the lower jaw.
The incisors occupy a <U+FB02>at or slightly concave region below the
premaxillary bone.       Then at the head of the crest is the large
canine placed between the premaxillary and maxillary bones.                    Next
succeeds a portion of jaw with concave outline occupied by small
                                                                                      '
teeth, which sometimes become larger from before backward; these
are the premolars.        And, lastly, there are teeth in another con
cave region     which  have   the position of molars; these may, in the
young animal, all be contained in a groove, with sockets scarcely
better indicated than among Ichthyosaurs or some Cetaceans.                        In
 many    Teleosaurs   and   Plesiosaurs    the   incisor   teeth    are   relatively
large, and the succeeding molars are smaller; and in the Ornitho
saur Dimorphodon the incisor teeth are exceptionally large, as com
pared with the molars.       The teeth of South African reptiles termed
Theriodontia di<U+FB01>er from such types chie<U+FB02>y in the development of large
 canines.' The incisors remain large, the canines are larger, and the
 molars relatively small. as may be seen in such genera as Cynodmco
 and Lycosaurus. In this group the incisors have both crown and root
 compressed from side to side.          The crown often has a prominent
 sharp chisel-like external cusp, and a small internal cusp which gives
 the tooth a mammalian aspect.           This character is well seen in the
 Russian genus Deuterosaurus           as   <U+FB01>gured by Eichwald and by
 Mr. Twelvetrees, the latter specimen being in the National Collection.
 A similar condition, but with the inner cusp less conspicuous, is seen
 in a new genus from South Africa allied to Deuterosaurus, here
 <U+FB01>gured, which may be named Glaridodon. In this tooth, besides the
 elevated outer and inner cusps, there are on both sides elevated lateral
  borders to the crown, so that it includes a concave area, which in
 mode of formation of the concavity may be compared to the concave
 crown of the molar tooth of Ornithorhynchus, though the proportions
 of the tooth are dissimilar.      Yet if a tooth of this type is supposed to
 lose its root by degeneration, it might show a close approximation to
 the tooth of such a mammal as Ornithorhynchus.                  The canine teeth
 in Theriodonts, like those of some of the lower mammalian orders,
 appear to be placed in the maxillary bone, and not in the suture
 between that bone and the premaxillary, as in the higher mammals.

As Sir Richard Owen          has shown, these teeth in size, form, and serra
 tion are altogether like canines of carnivorous mammals.                 The molar
 teeth of Theriodonts are usually but little specialised, and are small
and often simple cones. Even in Galesaurus the crowns of the molars
are compressed from side to side, and they have a central cusp no
 more developed than in a lizard, with a smaller cusp on each side,
 much as in some seals and porpoises, and as among porpoises there is
                                        FIG. 8.

    An American         genus, Empedias, from Permian or Triassic rdcks,
referred by Professor Cope to a distinct order, the Pelycosauria, shows
an unusual specialisation of the molar teeth.                They are compressed
from front to back, so as to have a great transverse extension on the
palate, which is absent from the premolars.                There is a contraction
 below the crown which is quite mammalian, and the root is single.
The crown may be described as having three cusps.                       The median

central cusp is the most elevated, and is the only one which shows
evidence    of wear, but the external and internal limits of the crown
are both elevated above the level of the concave spaces which divide
them from the middle cusp.           Hence the tooth offers some evidence of
three cusps in parallel series as a reptilian character, and so far helps
to approximate reptilian and mammalian types.                    This dental con
dition in Empedias has its chief interest in an approximation which

138       Prof. H. G. Seeley.       0n the Nature and Limits      [.Apr. 26,
it makes    to the Golden Cape Mole, Chrysochloris aurea.     Its teeth are
rather more numerous in the premolar region, but otherwise the
molars in the mammal similarly have one root; they have the same
transverse extension with three cusps, of which the middle one is
similarly well-developed, so that the chief di<U+FB01>erences are that in
Chrysochloris the crown is wide on the outer margin and narrows
internally as a wedge, while the external cusp is subdivided into two.
The lower jaw teeth of Empedias resemble those in the skull, but in
Clzrysochloris the mandibular teeth are bicuspid, except that the <U+FB01>rst
two molars have the inner cnsp divided longitudinally.               In the
accompanying <U+FB01>gures these genera are contrasted; and if Galesaum
suggests a primitive mammalian type allied in dentition to seals,
Empedias as strikingly resembles an insectivorous mammal.

 genera with characters snggestively mammalian both in the grouping
 of the teeth and forms of the crowns.
    In the Frilled Lizard, Ch lamydomums, there is one canine teeth at
 each anterior angle of the lower jaw, and these teeth -are separated
 from each other by small incisors. In the skull there are on each
 side in corresponding positions two canine teeth placed side by side
 laterally in succession to each other.

    In   most lizards, as in many mammals, canine teeth are absent;
and sometimes there is          a more or less marked gap in the positions in
which they might occur.
    The teeth which are in the position of molars may exhibit modi<U+FB01>ca
tions in the forms of the crown which correspond to premolars and
molars.      Thus. in species of Teius, there are <U+FB01>ve or six bicuspid teeth

  140     Prof. H. G. Seeley.      On the Ahture and Limits       [Apr.  26,
  are about seven teeth with single cusps which correspond to the outer
  cusps of the posterior part of the series. In this genus there is a longi
 tudinal channel between the cusps of the molar teeth. Seen from the
 palatal aspect the crown of a tooth is sub-quadrate, and the external
 cusp is the more elevated, so that the tooth has an aspect which is
 insectivorous rather than edentate.      Both cusps are compressed so as
 to form sharp longitudinal cutting edges.        At their bases they are
 connected on both the anterior and posterior borders of the tooth by
 low transverse concave ridges.        In my specimen these transverse
 ridges are suf<U+FB01>ciently marked in the skull; but are stronger in the
 lower jaw, where their surfaces are not quite smooth.      If the anterior
 and posterior ridges were stronger, the crown of this tooth in quadrate
 form, external and internal cusps and elevated border, would be su<U+FB01>i
 cieutly similar to the tooth of Omiiho'rhynnhus to give some ground
for regarding that tooth as reptilian in plan. And it has already been
 seen that in degeneration of the fang, which induced Sir R. Owen to
compare the teeth to those of the reptile genus Placodus, and in
implantation in a groove in the jaws there is no departure from
reptilian types.     If the tooth of the Ornithorhynchzw as a whole
cannot be exactly paralleled in any other animal, it is at least evident
that the teeth are as reptilian as the skeleton ; and if the corre
spondence is not closer, the reason may be found in the degeneration
which has replaced the enamel of the tooth with horny matter.
    Modern lizards are not a group of animals in which theoretical
considerations would suggest a search for mammalian characters in
the teeth, but they happen to be the only group of Reptilia which is
at all well known in which the teeth show a diversity which is in any
degree comparable with the diversity of mammalian teeth.          Whether
those characters have been inherited from remote ancestry, or spon
taneously developed in their possessors under varying conditions of
existence, as seems probable, is a matter of small moment, for in
either case they throw illustrative light on the classi<U+FB01>cational value of
teeth of mammalia.      If the different forms of cusp development found
in lizards could be combined, teeth would result with crowns like the
cuspidate crowns of many mammals.           Thus, in Cnemidophorus there
are two cusps arranged       longitudinally ; in Ameiva the tooth may
have one large cusp with a small cusp by its side, or in the fore-part
of the jaw there may be a small cusp on each side. If this kind of
serration were combined with the transversely bicuspid teeth of Tez'us
or of Empedias crowns would result which would have mammalian
patterns. In Amblyrl/ynchus cristaius the external part of the crown
is deeply cleft so as to be divided much as in some seals into a median
denticle, <U+FB02>anked by a lateral denticle on each side; but on the internal
side the base of the crown thickens, forming a large <U+FB02>attened oblique
area, which is evidently an undivided internal cusp, like the internal

           Teeth of Ambl/yrllyncbus.             Two molar teeth of Ameiva.
    The   teeth  of Iguana are serrate and acuminate, but if they were
  supposed to lose the acuminate character by all the denticles growing
 to the same height from a depressed base, then the parallel vertical
 serrations would reproduce the incisors of Galeopithecus;             and that
 the incisors have originated        in   some such way is suggested by the
 premolars in that genus being acuminate and serrated. The grooved
 tooth of Plagiaulaa: and Hyps'ipry'mnus         is equally suggestive of the
 origin of complicated molars from a simpler form such as may be
 found in reptiles. It is well to remember, as showing how dif<U+FB01>cult it
 is to recognise class characters in the form of a tooth crown, that a.
naturalist so familiar with mammals as de Blainville was of opinion
 that the small mammalian jaws from Stones<U+FB01>eld, known as Amphi
 therium, were the jaws of reptiles before Sir R. Owen demonstrated
 that the molar teeth possessed two roots. But whether the molar
 teeth of mammals were evolved out of simple reptilian types of teeth
 such as have been discussed as consequences of other changes in the
 skull, or are due to the in<U+FB02>uence of habitual food on inherited struc
 ture, it is to be anticipated that the primitive mammals possessed
 teeth of reptilian type, less di<U+FB02>ierentiated than the molar teeth of
 some existing lizards.

   The late Mr. A. G. Bain sent to the British Museum a bone,
No. 36,250, which the author regards as a right humerus.               It is
32 cm. long.       The crests at its proximal end are compared with
those in the corresponding bone of Saurischia, Ornithosanrs, and
Anomodonts; and they show a strong general resemblance to the
crests seen in Monotremes, though their direction may be more
reptilian.   The distal end of the bone is entirely mammalian in plan.
Its resemblances are about equally strong to Edcntata and Monotre
mata, and there are evidences of more distant relationship with
Insectivora, with certain Marsupials, seals, and other Carnivora.        On
the whole     the   evidence  is  insu<U+FB02>icient   to  refer the fossil to the
Monotremata.       It is named Propuppus mnocra-hw. The author pro
poses to associate with it Siereorrwhis of Professor Gaudry, in an
order named Gennetotheria. While the humerus of Stereerachis only
diifers from Monotremes in generic characters, and conforms in plan
to the monotreme rather than the edentate type, the shoulder-girdle is
intermediate between Echidna and the Anomodont Keirognathus, and
the dentition resembles that of reptiles like Irycosaur'us and other
Theriodonts.

   This specimen was collected by Mr. Thomas Bain at Klip Fontein,
 Fraser's Berg, and registered in the British Museum as 49,413.

 of the teeth, shows no di<U+FB01>'erence of importance from the skulls attri

    The shoulder-girdle is described and restored, and found to consist
of   interclavicle, clavicles, sternum, coracoids, pre-coracoids, and
scapules.    The scapula is in plan like Kisteeephalus.         The nearest
approach to the coracoid and pre-coracoid is found among the mono
treme mammals.        The clavicle extended along the anterior margin
of the scapula, and made an angular bend, so as probably to meet the
interclavicle.    The interclavicle appears to meet the lateral margins
of the coracoids and not to overlap them in front.         It approximates
in form to the bone in Ornithorhynch'us,       Ichthyosaurus,   and certain
lizards, but is relatively much larger, and is larger than the inter
clavicle of Stereorachis.   The sternum, which is transversely extended,
is better compared with that of a lizard or Dinosaur.         The shoulder
girdle as a whole is intermediate between monotreme mammals and
known reptiles, but with the former type predominating.
    The bones of the fore-limb are described in detail, and found to be
relatively long and slender and generically unlike Dicynodon.          The
carpus is complicated. There are only two phalangeal bones in.each
digit, the second bone being a well-developed claw.

                                 (Abstract)
    The phylogenetic development of the <U+FB01>rst visceral arches shows us
some most interesting changes of function, which we can follow
upwards from the lower Selachians to the highest Mammals.
    Originally entirely devoted to respirationas gill-bearing structures,
the whole hyoidean arch becomes soon a factor in the alimentary sys
tem.     Its proximal half forms the hinge of the masticatory apparatus,
its distal half remains henceforth connected with the process of deglu
tition.    Then this suspensorial arrangement is superseded by a new
modi<U+FB01>cation; the hyomandibula is set free and would disappear (it
does nearly do so in Dipnoi and certain Urodela), unless it were
made use of for a new function; with its having entered the service of
the conduction of sound, it has entered upon a new departure, and it
is saved from degeneration. The whole system of the one to four
elements of the middle ear, which all have the same function as con
ductors of sound, is to be looked upon as one organ of one common

  origin, namely, as a modi<U+FB01>cation of the hyomandibula, the primitive
  proximal paramere of the second visceral arch.
  Successive  Modi<U+FB01>cations   of the   Mandibular   and   Hyoidean Visceral
                                    Arches.
     I. Primitive condition (Notidanidaa).       The palato-quadrate bar
 alone carries the mandible.    The second arch is indilferent.  Hyoman
 dibula and quadrate (the palatine part is an outgrowth) are both
 attached to the cranium.
     II. The hyomandibula gains a <U+FB01>bro-cartilaginous connexion with
 the mandible, the masticatory apparatus becomes amphistylic and
 occasionally hyostylic (Rajidae, most Selachians).
    The hyoid gains a cranial attachment (many Rajidaa).
    III. The quadrate- or autostylic suspensorium becomes preponde
rant; the hyomandibula is, as in Teleosteans, divided into a proximal
and into a distal (symplectic) element.     The proximal part is received
into a fenestra of the otic capsule, and is converted into a stapes, whilst
the distal half either remains (Proteus, Siren, Menqwma.) or is lost
 (other Urodela).    The whole hyomandibula would have been lost
owing to its excalation from suspensorial functions, unless it had
entered the auditory service.
    IV. The autostylic arrangement prevails. The whole hyomandibula
remains, gains an attachment on the “ tympauum,” and di<U+FB01>erentiates
itself into several conjointed pieces, notably stapes or columella
proper, and extra-columella or malleus.
    The extra-columella gains connexion with the parotic cartilage; this
connexion frequently remains, but in Anura alone it contains a special
element of probably parotic origin.
    The quadrate forms an important part of the tympanic frame.
    IVa. Collateral departure of the Anura. The connexion between
the tympanal part of the hyomandibula with the mandible is lost.
    V. The quadrate still forms the principal suspensorial part of the
mandible. The extra-columella, or malleus, retains for a long time its
previously acquired connexion with Meckel’s cartilage (Amniota).
   Va. The top end of the hyoid is attached to the cranium (Geckos,
Mavmmalia),     and is occasionally fused with the extra-columella
(Hatteria).
    Vb. Or, the proximal portion of the hyoid is removed from the skull
and remains otherwise well developed (most Lizards); or its proximal
portion becomes reduced and lost (Chelomln, O'rocodilia, Oph'idia, Aves).
   V0. The extra-columella gains an attachment to the quadrate,
squamosal, or pterygoid, whilst its connexion with the mandible
(Ophid'ia, Ghamceleon), and the tympanum, is lost.
   VI. The quadrate gradually loses its articulation with the man
dible; the latter gains a new outer articulation with the squamosal;

the quadrate acts almost entirely as a tympanio frame. Incus and
malleus fuse sometimes with each other, and lean on to the parotic
region. The masticatory joint is doubly concave-convex (llIonotremata).
   VII. The quadrate is converted into the principal part of the tym
panic frame, viz., annulus tympanicus.           The mandible has lost its
articulation with the quadrate, and the masticatory joint is a single
concave-convex    one, the convexity belonging to the mandible (Mono
delphia).

 II.   “ On the Relations of the Diurnal         Barometric Maxima 'to
         certain critical Conditions of Temperature, Cloud, and
         Rainfall.”    By HENRY F. BLANFORD, F.R.S.          Received
         March 30, 1888.
                                  (Abstract)
     The author refers to an observation of Lamont’s that the diurnal
barometric variation appears to be compounded of two distinct ele
 ments, viz., a wave of diurnal period, which is very variable in dif
 ferent places, and which appears to depend on the horizontal and
 vertical movements of the atmosphere and changes in the distribu
 tion of its mass, and a semi-diurnal element which is remarkably
 constant and seems to depend more immediately on the action of the
 sun. Then, referring to the theory of the semi-diurnal variation,
 originally put forward by Espy, and subsequently by Davies and
 Kreil, the author points out that the morning maximum of pressure
 approximately coincides with the instant when the temperature is
 rising most rapidly. This is almost exactly true at Prague. Yarkand,
  both in winter and summer, and in the winter months at Melbourne.
  At the tropical stations, Bombay, Calcutta, and Batavia, and at Mel
  bourne in the summer, the barometric maximum follows the instant
  of most rapid heating by a shorter or longer interval; and the author
  remarks that this may probably be attributed to the action of convec
  tion, which must accelerate the time of most rapid heating near the
  ground surface; while the barometric e<U+FB01>ect, if real, must be deter_
  mined by the condition of the atmosphere up to a great height. With
  reference to Lamont’s demonstration of the failure of Espy’s theory,
  a condition is pointed out which alters the data of the problem, viz.,
  the resistance that must be o<U+FB01>ered to the passage of the pressure
   wave through the extremely cold and highly attenuated atmospheric
   strata, whose existence is proved by the phenomena. of luminous
  meteors.
      With respect to the evening maximum of pressure, it is pointed out
   that very generally, and especially in India, and also at Melbourne,
  there is a strongly-marked minimum in the diurnal variation of cloud
   between sunset and midnight, which, on an average, as at Allahabad

 1888.]            Eject of Chlorine on a Voltaic Couple.                           151
and Melbourne, coincides with the evening maximum of the barometer.
A   similar coincident minimum, even more strongly marked, charac
terises the diurnal variation of the rainfall at Calcutta and Batavia
in their respective rainy seasons.           In the author’s opinion these facts
seem to point to a. compression and dynamic heating of the cloud
forming strata, and he points to the existence of a small irregularity
in the diurnal temperature curves of Prague, Calcutta, and Batavia,
which may possibly be due to such action. It is further remarked
that the evening maximum about coincides with the time when the
evening fall of temperature, after a rapid reduction between 6 or 7
and 10 ML, becomes nearly uniform in rate, and it is suggested that
the former may possibly be determined by the check of the rate of
collapse of the cooling atmosphere.              But it is observed that both the
morning     and  evening     waves   of pressure probably involve other ele
ments than the forced waves, and are in part rhythmic repetitions of
previous waves.
III.   “ Effect of Chlorine on the Electromotive Force of a. Voltaic
      Couple.” By G. GORE, F.R.S. Received April 7, 1888.
   If the electromotive force of a small voltaic couple of nnamal
gamated magnesium and platinum in distilled water, is balanced
through the coil of a moderately sensitive galvanometer of about
100 ohms resistance, by means of that of a small Daniell’s cell plus
that of a. suf<U+FB01>cient number of couples of iron and German silver of a.
suitable thermoelectric pile (see ‘ Proceedings of the Birmingham
Philosophical Society,’ vol. 4, p. 130), the degree of potential being
noted; and su<U+FB01>iciently minute quantities of very dilute chlorine
water are then added in succession to the distilled water, the degree
of electromotive force of the couple is not affected until a certain
de<U+FB01>nite proportion of chlorine has been added; the potential then
suddenly commences to increase, and continues to do so with each
further addition within a certain limit. Instead of making the ex
periment by adding chlorine-water, it may be made by gradually
diluting a very weak aqueous solution of chlorine.
   The_minimnm proportion of chlorine necessary to cause this sudden
change of electromotive force is extremely small ; in my experiments
it has been 1 part in 17,000 million parts of water,‘ or less than a
7000th part of that required to yield a barely perceptible opacity in
ten times the bulk of a solution of sal-ammoniac by means of nitrate
of silver. The quantity of liquid necessary for acting upon the couple
   ‘  As 1 part of chlorine in 17,612 million parts of water had no visible client, and
1 in 17,000 millions had a distinct effect, the in<U+FB02>uence of the di<U+FB02>‘erence, or of 1 part
in 500,000 millions, has been detected.

is small, and it would be easy to detect the e<U+FB01>‘ect of the above pro
portion, or of less than one ten-thousand-millionth              of a grain of
chlorine in one-tenth of a cubic centimetre of distilled water by this
process.     The same kind of action occurs with other electrolytes, but
requires larger proportions of dissolved substance.
    As the degree of sensitiveucss of the method appears extreme,              I
add the following remarks :—The original solution of washed chlorine
in distilled water was prepared in a dark place by the usual method
 from hydrochloric acid and manganic oxide, and was kept in an
opaque, well-stoppered bottle in the dark.           The strength of this liquid
was found by means of volumetric analysis with a standard solution
of argentic nitrate in the usual manner, the accuracy of the silver
 solution being proved by means of a lmown weight of pure chloride
of sodium.       The chlorine liquid contained 23 milligrammes, or
003565 grain of chlorine per cubic centimetre, and. was just about
 three-fourths saturated.
    One-tenth of a cubic centimetre of this solution (“No 1”), or
 0'003565 grain of chlorine was added to 9'9 0.0. of distilled water and
 mixed. One cubic centimetre of this second liquid (“ No. 2”), or
 00003565 grain of chlorine was added to 99 0.0. of water and mixed;
 the resulting liquid (“No.3”) contained 0000003565 grain of chlorine
 per cubic centimetre. To make the solution (“ No. 41") for exciting
 the voltaic couple, successive portions of one-tenth or one-twentieth
 cubic centimetre of “ N0. 3 liquid were added to 900 0.0. of distilled
                                ”
 water and mixed.
    I  have employed the foregoing method for examining the states
 and degrees of combination of substances dissolved in electrolytes,
 and am also investigating its various relations.
  IV. “ Electro-chemical Effects         on Magnetising       lron.   Part II.”‘
        By THOMAS ANDREWS, F.R.S.E., F.C.S. Communicated by
        Professor G. G. STOKES, P.R.S. Received April 9, 1888.
     The novel electro-chemical e<U+FB01>ects observed between a magnetised
  and an unmagnetised bar when in circuit in certain solutions, recorded
  in the <U+FB01>rst part of this research, were of such an interesting character
  that  I thought it desirable to extend the investigation.         The present
  memoir contains the results of a further study of these magneto
  chemical phenomena, which were found to be more marked and
  characteristic when experimenting with some of the reagents herein
  described. The method of eXperimentation was generally similar to
  that pursued and described in Part I, though it was necessary to

modes   of experimentation hereafter referred to. Fig. 3 shows the
form of apparatus, coil of 750 wraps, 600., used with the larger iron
and steel bars.    In this apparatus the ends of each pair of bars were
deeply immersed in the solution contained in the vessel D, below the
coil; liability to possible temperature errors from any heating of the
coil was thus obviated. The unmagnetised bar B was made shorter
than the bar A in the coil, so as to avoid partial magnetisation from
outside induction of the coil, which would have been more liable to
occur had the bar stood in full length parallel with the coil. This
arrangement was found preferable when using large steel bars, as
induced magnetism to any considerable extent of the bar B would
have detracted from the full e<U+FB01>ect.     In some instances, however, this
precaution was not adopted.      The apparatus, coil, &c., used with the
smaller iron and steel bars is shown in <U+FB01>g. 4. A single-cell bichrc
mate battery was employed in connexion with the coil for magnetisap
tion during all the experiments recorded in this memoir.

    The small iron and steel bars were drawn through a wortle, the
large iron and steel bars were rolled rods.
    The chemical reagents employed as electrolytes consisted of solu
tions of bromine, ferric chloride, and chlorine-water, ferrous sulphate,
ferric chloride, eupric chloride, cupric sulphate, cupric nitrate, cupric
acetate, cupric bromide, nickel chloride, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid,
and potassium chlorate.
    In the experiments with the smaller rods 9. pair of bars in each
experiment were immersed in the solution in the U-tube, in circuit
also with a. delicate galvanometer, and after a suitable time had
elapsed in every case for normal galvanic equilibrium to obtain, the
bar A in the coil was magnetised, and the magneto-chemical e<U+FB01>ect
recorded. It was found to vary with the nature of the metal and
solution employed, and also with the extent of the magnetic saturation
of the metals.           The strength of the magnetism was practically the
same in many of the experiments, and it was generally observed that
difference in the strength of the solutions affected the results.                 In
other experiments with a uniform strength of solution, but in which
the magnetism of the metals was varied or reduced, the magneto
chemical effect became proportionately altered.                The possibility of
error from temperature causes arising from any slight internal heat
i ng of the coil has been referred to and dealt with in Part              I  (‘ Roy.
Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 42, pp. 462—3).            The apparatus, <U+FB01>g. 3, used in some
of the present experiments was also conducive to accuracy in this
respect.       Moreover, the early and extensive development of the
magneto-chemical e<U+FB01>ect, noticed in most cases, especially in the

 1888.]      Electra-chemical  Efects on Magnetising Iron.             155
experiments with bromine, HNOS, and the copper salts, a<U+FB01>ords
su<U+FB02>icient indication that the liability to error from temperature
causes was slight.    To demonstrate that the magneto-chemical effect
was not in these observations due to variation of temperature conse
quent on possible heating of the coil, a further set of experiments
(Table C, Cole. 10 and 11, Divisions II) was made with solutions of
ferrous sulphate and also of ferric chloride in another form of
apparatus, wherein the unmagnetised bar B was surrounded by a
slightly higher temperature (about 5° to 10°         during the observa
tions than the magnetised bar A. This was accomplished by surround
ing the limb of the U-tube containing the bar B, during the observa
tion, with a specially constructed water-bath containing water at a
temperature of about 5° to 10° F. above the temperature of the
solution in the coil tube A, the difference of temperature was ascer
tained by small thermometers respectively placed in limbs A and B of
the U-tube, another thermometer being in the water-bath.              The
magnetised bar was, however, able to maintain its positive position,
notwithstanding     the higher temperature around the unmagnetised
one.    The present memoir contains the results of many repeated
experiments, each record in the tables being the average of a
considerable number of observations. In Parts         I   and He. total of
about 592 iron and steel bars have been experimented upon, 346 bars
being required for the experiments of Part II.

   Bromine and Potassium Bromide, Col. 2, Divisions I, II, and III.-—
It was found that pure bromine for various reasons was too powerful a
reagent to use in these experiments; a strong solution was therefore
prepared of the following composition. Bromine, 1066'4 grains, potas
sium bromide, 520 grains, and 3% ozs. of water. This solution was
very energetic in its action on the metals, and considerable care was
required in conducting the experiments therewith; but with due pre
cautions admirable results were obtained.         The magneto-chemical
effect was very great with this reagent, the E.M.F. between the mag
netised and unmagnetised bars sometimes            reaching as high as
one-twentieth of a volt. The highest E.M.F. appeared to be manifested
at or near the time of the energetic e<U+FB01>ervescing attack on the metal;
though the E.M.F. between the bars was always considerable from
the earliest commencement of the magnetisation of bar A in the coil.
Experiments were made on both wrought-iron and steel bars. The
experiments, Col. 3, Divisions     I  and II, were made with a much
weaker bromine    solution, though   of similar general composition.

    Ferric Chloride and Chlorine Water, Col. 4, Divisions     I  and II.—
 This solution consisted of 250 <U+FB02>uid grains of a concentrated solution
of FegCls and 750 <U+FB02>uid grains of saturated chlorine water. In these
 experiments the electro-negative position assumed by the magnetised
 bar formed an exception to the general rule, which,        I  think, may
 probably to some extent be explained on the supposition of the dia
 magnetic properties of the dissolved chlorine; the magnetised bar
 being somewhat less attacked by the free chlorine than the unmag
 netised rod.    When the chlorine had exhausted its action on the
 metal, the electro-chemical reaction became gradually reversed, and
 the magnetised bar then assumed the electro-positive position (see
 Col. 4, Division II), as in the case of normal ferric chloride solution
 only. To show that the above negative e<U+FB01>ect was due only to 'mag
 netic in<U+FB02>uence, various experiments with FegCls and chlorine water
 were made, in which it was found that on ceasing to magnetise the
 bar A for a few moments, the E.M.F. decreased, and the magnetised
 bar A assumed a less negative position, but on again connecting the
 battery to the coil, the magnetised bar therein assumed a more
 electro-negative position.

containing varied proportions of HNO3 and K20103, are con<U+FB01>rmatory
of the results obtained in Part I, and also indicate that these magneto
chemical e<U+FB01>ects are greater in stronger solutions.        On ceasing to
magnetise the    bar   A,  in  course of any of these experiments, the
needle of the galvanometer fell to zero, and on remagnetising the bar
A its electro-positive position was re-asserted.
   Ferrous Sulphate, Col. 10, Divisions I, II, III, and IV, a saturated

   Division I.—This set of experiments was conducted on the large
polished wroughtdron bars, f-inch diameter, with apparatus <U+FB01>g. 3,
the magnetisation of bar A being continuous to the end of each
observation.
   Division IL—These experiments were made with small iron bars in
apparatus, <U+FB01>g. 4, the solution containing the unmagnetised bar being
maintained at a temperature of about 5° to 10° F. above the tempera
ture of the solution in which the magnetised bar was immersed.
   Division IIL—In these observations large steel bars %-inch diameter
were employed in the arrangement of apparatus delineated in <U+FB01>g. 3.
The bar A in the coil was magnetised for a few minutes only at the
commencement, and, as the metal was steel, it retained a permanent
residual magnetism, which was allowed to complete the result. The
magneto-chemical e<U+FB01>ect was not so great in these instances, owing to
the magnetism of the bar being less than when the action of the
powerful coil was prolonged thereon, as in the other experiments

  This   class of observations indicated that the results were in<U+FB02>uenced
by the extent to which the metal was magnetised; the latter fact was
more distinctly shown in course of experiments with bromine and the
salts of copper.
    Division IV.—These experiments were made on the small steel bars
with apparatus, <U+FB01>g. 4; the general results were similar to those
obtained with the larger bars, though somewhat less in extent.        The
bar A in the coil was magnetised for a short time only at the com
mencement, and the induced permanent magnetism allowed to com
plete the result.

    Ferric Chloride, Col. 11, Divisimw I,   and III, was a saturated solu
tion of the salt in water. The experiments in Division     I   were made
in apparatus, <U+FB01>g.    4:, equality  of temperature obtaining   between  the
two limbs of the U-tube. The observations of Division      II   were made
in the water-bath apparatus previously alluded to, with a di<U+FB01>erence
of temperature of about 5° to 10° F. in favour of the unmagnetised
bar; the magnetic in<U+FB02>uence was, however, suf<U+FB01>cient to overcome this
temperature obstacle, and even under, such conditions the magnetised
bar maintained its electro-chemical position, though not to the full
extent. On ceasing to magnetise a bar in the above reagent, the
E.M.F. steadily diminished, and on again applying magnetisation
the magnetised bar resumed its positivity.           The observations in
 Division  III  were made on pairs of the small steel bars under equal
temperature conditions.        At the end of forty hours there was a per
ceptibly greater deposit of <U+FB02>occulent oxide of iron in the tube con
taining the magnetised bar.
    Cupm'c Chloride, Col. 12, Divisions
                                     I      and II, consisted of   concen

trated solution of the salt in water, such as    is   usually employed in
 dissolving out the metallic iron in the carbon determination of iron
 analyses.    The magneto-chemical e<U+FB01>ect with this reagent was of con
 siderable magnitude, a powerful eifect commencing from <U+FB01>rst magnet
 isation of the bar A, and largely though steadily increasing. On ceasing
 to magnetise the bar A the galvanometer de<U+FB02>ections were reduced;
but on again bringing the magnetising coil into action, the magnetised
 barA steadily re-asserted its strong positive position in course of a
 few moments.      These magnetic e<U+FB01>ects were not of such nature as
                                                                a
 to produce a   very violent <U+FB02>ing of the galvanometer, but manifested a.
 steady and permanent character, though in most instances de<U+FB02>ections
 commenced at once on magnetising the bar A, and afterwards con
 tinued steadily to increase till the maximum point was reached.        On
 the completion of an experiment, both bars were of course covered
 with electro-deposited metallic copper; but in many instances the
 colour of the solution in the limb of the U-tube which had contained
 the magnetised bar, was of rather lighter tint, showing that a some

 and the observations in Division          II  were made on pairs of the small

 of the wrought-iron than with the steel bars.

 more extensive when employing the latter salt.

     Cup'ric  Bromide, Col. 16, consisted of a saturated solution of the
salt in water.         Highly interesting and very marked results were
noticed in the experiments with this reagent.              The observations in
Divisions      I  and  II  were made with small rods of wrought iron and
steel in apparatus, <U+FB01>g. 4, the results recorded in Divisions            III  and
IV being obtained with large iron and steel bars 38—inch diameter, and
using apparatus, <U+FB01>g. 3. A weaker solution of cupric bromide was
employed for the iron bar experiments in Division III, and the bars
were not immersed so deeply in the' solution.               The electro-positive
position of the coil-bar A was dependent on the extent of its magnet
isation, in these as in the other experiments, and the effects with
cupric bromide were generally similar to those obtained with cupric
chloride.
    Nickel Chloride, Col. 17, Divisions         I anal II, was a concentrated

    Sulphate of Iron—A pair of steel bars were left in a yellow
oxidised solution of sulphate of iron in apparatus, <U+FB01>g. 4, for twenty
four hours, the bar A having been magnetised for a short time at
commencement         only, the residual magnetism being allowed to com
plete   the   e<U+FB01>ect;   an E.M.F. of 0011 volt was gradually reached, the
magnet bar being in the positive position.

    In casting about for        an  explanation    of these   magneto-chemical
phenomena, it seemed probable that the e<U+FB01>ect might possibly be con
nected with the local currents which are shown below to develop in a
magnetised       bar between the more highly and less magnetised parts
thereof,     when the rod was immersed in suitable solutions acting

chemically    upon it.   I  therefore made the following experiments
which demonstrate the interesting fact, that when a magnetised bar is
thus immersed a local galvanic current is set up between the polar
terminals and central equator or less magnetised portion of the bar,
the more magnetically-neutral        zones acting electro-negatively   in
relation to the poles.     Under these induced conditions it becomes
obvious that a magnetised bar, forming one element of a galvanic
 couple, would be more acted upon than an unmagnetised one, forming
the other element in the same solution.      Hence, one explanation is
afforded of the electro-chemical positive position generally manifested
by the magnetised bar in course of the research.      The experimental
demonstration of these local currents in a magnetised rod was con
ducted as follows :—
   A pair of polished soft-iron bars, 6% inches long, 0'261 inch
diameter, out adjacently from a larger rod, were each covered with
black india-rubber tubing, a small portion, one quarter of an inch at
each end of one bar (the <U+FB02>at disk at the end being coated with black
varnish) and half an inch in the centre of the other rod, being the
only portions exposed, and an equality of surface exposure being thus
obtained.    The two rods were placed in the tube containing the
solution, and were connected in circuit with the galvanometer.       The
tube containing them was placed in the coil, and on magnetising the
rods by means thereof, the rod whose polar terminals were exposed to
the action of the solution became electro-positive to the other bar.
Similar results were obtained when either a north pole or a south
pole was exposed singly as one element in connexion with a central
equator as the other. Many repeated experiments were made with
apparatus shown on <U+FB01>g. 5, and about forty-six india-rubber-covered
bars were used in this part of the investigation.       The results are
given in Table D (p. 166).
   Nitric Acid and Potassium Bichromate, Col. 3.—On ceasing to
magnetise the bar A in course of any experiment the galvanometer
de<U+FB02>ections almost immediately fell to zero, and on again magnetising'
the bar A de<U+FB02>ections went up, the polar terminals resuming their
positive position.    In this experiment the central equator had an
exposed   surface  of % inch and each polar terminal    i inch; another
experiment was made in which the exposed part of the central
equator was only 1 inch and each polar terminal 5 inch ; the results
were the same though of less extent.      Similar results were obtained
on ceasing at any time to magnetise the bars in the cupric chloride
solutions, Cols. 1 and 2, though less extensive.

    During an investigation of the possible electro-chernical eli'ect
between the polished end disks or polar terminals only, of straight
round steel magnets, there were indications, under certain conditions
and when the magnets were immersed as elements in some electro
lytes, of a tendency on the part of the N. terminal plane of the
magnet to become from some cause electro-positive to the S. terminal
plane, when the magnets were placed parallel some distance apart in
an upright position.     The lower end of each magnet exposed in the
Solution was covered with black indie-rubber tubing, so that the <U+FB02>at
polished disks at the terminals only were exposed to the action of the
electrolyte. This apparent tendency seemed somewhat singular, and
further experimentation is required before arriving at de<U+FB01>nite con
clusions; it seemed desirable however to allude to this apparent
indication.
   I hope to make other observations in this direction, and in course
of these to utilise some valuable experimental suggestions which
Professor Stokes has kindly made.

1888.]       Electra-chemical    Efects on Magnetising Iran.                  167
   The Electra-chemical E<U+FB01>'ect in Relation to the Passive State of Iron.
   Soon after commencing Part         I  of this research    I  conceived that
the passive state  of  iron  in strong    nitric  acid would either to some
extent be affected, or perhaps overcome, by magnetic in<U+FB02>uences of a
similar nature to those in the experiments on which             I   am engaged.
Preliminary    experiments    were  made   and   interesting   results   obtained
in connexion with the in<U+FB02>uence of magnetisation on the action of
strong nitric acid on iron and steel.         I have obtained, under certain
conditions, currents <U+FB02>owing from a magnetised bar to an unmagnetised
one in strong nitric acid (sp. gr. 1'42).          The currents representing
an E.M.F. varying, according       to circumstances, from about 0011 volt
and upwards. 'Aftcr considerable experimentation              I  feel convinced
that induced local currents of the nature of those shown above in
Table D were instrumental in causing the magnetised bars to be more
acted upon than the unmagnetised ones in the strong nitric acid
(sp. gr. 1'42), and such currents are essential in reducing the
passivity of iron in nitric acid.
   I hope to have further communications to make with respect to
this interesting part of my research.
   In Parts   I  and  II  of this research, the results of a quantitative
study of these magneto-chemical phenomena have been recorded, the
e<U+FB01>eot in connexion with a considerable variety of typical reagents
having been carefully observed.         With some reagents the eiIect was
found to be comparatively small, in other instances it was very con
siderable, as in the case of bromine, many of the salts of copper,
nitric acid, and similar strong corrosive solutions. The result was
dependent both on the strength of the solution and on the extent of
the magnetisation of the metal.            In most cases with powerfully
oxidising reagents the e<U+FB01>ect was of an electro-positive nature, but
in a few other instances (such as H2804, HCl dil., FesCls with
chlorine) the reaction partook of a negative character in relation to
the electro-chemical position of the magnetised bar. It is not easy to
account for these variations in the nature of the e<U+FB01>ect;          I  think, how
ever, it may be surmised that          in   these exceptional instances the
results were possibly to some extent in<U+FB02>uenced by the diamagnetic
properties of some of the solutions, or of the gases evolved therein.
 In some of the compound solutions, such as Fe2013 and chlorine water,
a species of magnetic selection apparently occurred.            In the experi
ments with FegCls solution without chlorine, the magnetised bar was
electro-positive; but when using this reagent combined with chlorine
water (see Table C, Col. 4, Divisions        I  and II), the magnetised bar
became electro-negative, possibly owing to the diamagnetic property
of the free chlorine in<U+FB02>uencing its action on the magnetised bar.
 When, however, the free chlorine had exhausted its direct action on

 the metal, there remained only asolution of FeQCls, in which the mag
 netised bar A gradually assumed its normal electro-positive position ;
 this reaction is exempli<U+FB01>ed by the results in Table C, Col. 4, Divi
 sion II. The comparative non-activity of HCl on magnetised bars is
 very singular, and at present unaccountable. In conclusion,        I may
 state that this research has shown that a current <U+FB02>ows from a mag
 netised bar towards an unmagnetised one, when the two are immersed
 in suitable solutions, and that the result was dependent both on the
 nature and strength of the solution, and also on the extent of the
 magnetisation of the metal.     It has also been demonstrated that when
 a magnetised rod constitutes one element in a suitable electrolyte
 acting upon it, local currents <U+FB02>ow from the more highly magnetised
 polar terminals towards the less magnetised or neutral equatorial
 portions. These conditions would cause the magnetised rod to be
more generally acted upon by the electrolyte, the composition of the
solution surrounding it being thereby also affected, and to a con
siderable extent this might account for its electro-positive position
compared with the unmagnetised rod, otherwise under the same
conditions.    Observations have also been made on the in<U+FB02>uence of
magnetisation in relation to the passive state of iron in nitric acid,
with interesting results. In the present state of the inquiry it is

preferable to con<U+FB01>ne oneself to a simple record of facts ; think, how
ever, it has been clearly demonstrated in course of the numerous and
varied experiments of this reSearch, that the magnetisation of iron
and steel in<U+FB02>uences the action of reagents upon the metal.
  V. “Report on the Capacities, in respect of Light and Photo
       graphic Action, of two Silver on Glass Mirrors of different
      Focal Lengths.” By the Rev. C. PRITCHARD, D.D., F .R.S.,
       Savilian Professor of Astronomy, Oxford. Received April
      18, 1888.
    In May of last year,    I was requested by a Committee on stellar
photography,    appointed by the Council of the Royal Society, to
examine the     comparative photographic capacities of two silver on
glass mirrors,  each having an aperture of 15 inches, but of di<U+FB01>erent
focal lengths,   viz., 80 inches and 120 inches respectively.      In the
present report these will be designated by the symbols git-inch and
Tli’gdnch. The mirrors in question were provided by the generosity of
Dr. Warren de la Rue.         Various unforeseen dif<U+FB01>culties incidental to
pioneering in a science still in its infancy have intervened, unavoid
ably impeding the progress of the enquiry.        The chief among these
have been :—-1. The comparatively imperfect automatic mechanism
of the driving apparatus attached to the telescope carrying the

  1888.]     Silver on Glass  Mirrors of di<U+FB02>'erent Focal Lengths.         169
  mirrors;    2. The  di<U+FB02>iculty of adjusting the     camera  or plate holder
  perpendicularly to the axis of the mirror, on a temporary mounting,
 and distant from the workshop of the optician ; 3. An abnormal sky
  which has continually perplexed astronomers during many months.
     It must not be overlooked, that even the considerable precision,
 necessary or desirable in the clock motion of a telescope used for
 micrometrical measures,      is comparatively useless for astronomical
 photography; for in this latter case the momentary swerving of the
 telescope through even a second or two of arc, may be fatal to the
  circular form of the star images impressed on the plate; and, more
 over, it is necessary to maintain this accuracy of steady motion, not
 merely for a very few minutes at a time, but occasionally for half an
 hour, or a full hour, or even more.     It is true that resort may be had,
 and in fact must always be had, to the old method of supplementing
 the driving machine by the occasional assistance of eye and hand;
 but unless that machinery is approximately perfect, the strain upon
 the observer’s attention becomes practically insupportable.             This
 perfect steadiness of motion is also necessary from another point of
 view, because in its absence, it will not be easy to distinguish
 between the effects of unsteady motion and any optical defect of the
 mirror.     Happily these dif<U+FB01>culties have been at length overcome; and
 in the month of January last, by the aid of an improved screw, worked
on a new engine by Sir H. Grubb, and a subsidiary electrical control
connecting the driving apparatus with a seconds pendulum,              I had
the pleasant satisfaction of hearing from Mr. Jenkins, the assistant
chie<U+FB02>y engaged in the present operation, that he now felt no severe
strain or stress of attention in watching and occasionally aiding the
 motion, during the space of an hour or more on the rare occasions
when the variability of the sky permitted such long exposures.
I am not here speaking of my own experience alone, but have          I
reason to know that the same troubles have been shared to a greater
or less extent by all the few eminent observers who are in this
country employed in a similar pursuit.              A modi<U+FB01>cation of the
ingenious contrivance by which the desired etfects have been pro
duced has been recently exhibited by Sir H. Grubb at the Royal
Astronomical Society and at the Society of Arts in London.
    The mirrors referred to above, were mounted in succession on the
tube of the large equatorial in the Oxford University Observatory,
and they proved to be of that excellent optical quality which might
be expected in Mr. With’s best performance.
    The points to which I chie<U+FB02>y directed my attention in the examina
tion of these mirrors were as follows :—
       I. The general character of the stellar images impressed      by the
            two mirrors, absolute and comparative.

4 inches square, for both mirrors, and thus in the 3,;%-inch mirror have
the opportunity of examining a <U+FB01>eld of about nine square degrees;
but it was found impossible, inasmuch as the images, even towards
the centre of the plate, were found to be impressed with a white centre.
To a certain extent, these malformations were predicted in a paper by
                          ‘
General Tennant in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
 Society.’
   This phenomenon necessitated the abandonment of so large a plate
 with its circular carrier of seven and a half inches diameter, for a.
 smaller plate and smaller carrier having an angular <U+FB01>eld of 1° 56' or
nearly four square degrees.         With this plate the images became
round in the centre, and continued so to a distance of about 40'
from the centre. Then they became decidedly elliptical, having their
extremities remote from the centre fainter than the opposite extremi
ties.   At the edge of the plate, the <U+FB01>gure of the star on the side
remote from the centre appeared to be not closed at all, but presented
the appearance of a fan.           I
                                  have, however, not observed the focal
lines at right angles to each other, as seen and described by the
Astronomer Royal.         In the {fig-inch mirror and 4-inch plate, which
presents   also a  <U+FB01>eld  of  nearly four square degrees, the phenomena
here described   are generally very much less pronounced, and commence
at a greater distance from the centre.
   The conclusions which I feel disposed to draw from the foregoing
remarks, are the general unsuitability of mirrors of short focal
length, and the impossibility of obtaining a large angular <U+FB01>eld in
such mirrors, of a character serviceable for charting the heavens by
means of photography.        How far this dif<U+FB01>culty may be obviated in
refractors suitably corrected, and of comparatively short focal length,
it is beyond my experience to indicate.           Before instituting this
trial, 1 had some hope, that with so simple an optical appliance
as a mirror, 9. much larger available <U+FB01>eld might have been practically
secured than has proved to be the case.          I
                                                apprehend, however, that
in point of light, that      having regard alone to the faintness of the
                             is,
stars which, caster-is paribue, can be photographed, the advantage            is
practically on the side of the re<U+FB02>ector.
   Another point of some importance in the character of the images

1888.]        Silver  on Glass  Mirrors of dzferent Focal Lengths.     171
impressed by these mirrors is the tendency of those formed from
bright stars, to spread themselves over a larger portion of the <U+FB01>lm in
the short focus mirror, and consequently to increase the di<U+FB01>culty of
bisection.       In the smaller stars, this peculiarity is not so apparent.
I am     here, contrary to my wont, unable to appeal to numerical     data,
so essentially necessary in discussions of this description, and where
mere estimates and impressions are apt to mislead the judgment.
 The impossibility of procuring photographs of the same star from the
 two mirrors under exactly similar circumstances, and therefore of
eliminating the relative amount of sensitiveness of the plates em
ployed, the character of the night, and many other circumstances
which occur in stellar photography, render the test of numbers im
practicable.       I state here the experience gained from the examination
of many photographs; and in immediate connexion with this point
of experience, I may mention that the conclusion has been forced
upon me, that the images formed from a de la Rue metallic mirror
are harder and less extended than those formed from equal exposures
                                      I
on a silver on glass mirror. If were to hazard an opinion, expressed
not without reserve,        I  should say that the di<U+FB01>erence between the
action of a metallic mirror and a silver on glass mirror, may not
nn<U+FB01>tly be compared to the difference between the action of a metallic
mirror, and the action of such photographic object-glasses as have
come under my own observation.
 II.   The Relative Luminosity of the Images of Stars, formed by the Two
                                     Mirrors.
    The mirrors were originally silvered by Mr. Browning, about
 March 19th, 1887. They were in constant use until January 26th,
 1888, and on that date the fig-inch mirror was examined as to its
 light-re<U+FB02>ecting capacity.        The secondary plane re<U+FB02>ector was silver
 on glass. The method of determination was the comparison of the
 places of extinction in the wedge photometer of three stars viewed
respectively in the Tlf'<U+FB01>-inch mirror, in the l2i-inch Grubb refractor,
and in the 4-inch <U+FB01>nder attached to the latter. Each star was
extinguished <U+FB01>ve times in each observation.           The method of compu
 tation adopted in the light comparison was that explained in the
 ‘
   Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society,’ vol. 47.
    The results are as follows :—

 <U+FB01>dence, inasmuch      as these small discrepancies are well within the
  limits of the errors of observation.
     The conclusions to be drawn from these results thus obtained are:
 1. The very slight deterioration of the mirrors after nine months’
constant use and exposure.          2. The very considerable amount of
 light re<U+FB02>ected by these mirrors when compared with that transmitted
by the Grubb object-glass, amounting in fact to this, that a mirror of
 15 inches aperture a<U+FB01>'ords an image of a star as brilliant as that
formed by an object-glass (of the particular quality presented) of
1335 inches aperture. 3. A slightly increased, but only a slightly
increased, luminosity of image is caused by the adoption of the focal
length of 80 inches instead of 120.         The result, referred to above
in 2, is in conformity with the remark made by Dr. Robinson, in
‘
   Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 151, to the e<U+FB01>ect that in respect of the luminosity
of the image, Newtonian re<U+FB02>ecting telescopes of attainable aperture
would probably surpass refractors of attainable dimensions, on
account of the increasing absorption of light, by reason of thickness,
unless indeed the trauslucency of glass can be sensibly improved.
    It is to be noticed that with an exposure of half an hour in the
%%-inch mirror, the existence of nebulosity in the neighbourhood of
Maia is distinctly traceable on the photographic plate. With the
exposure of an hour it is observable in form.      No trace of the fainter
nebulosity near Merope has been impressed.
III.   The Angular Extent of Apparently Undistorted Field, and        the
                  Amount of Distortion where Exists.

    The determination of these elements        of the utmost importance
                                              is
in  the formation of charts of the heavens by the aid of photography,
 inasmuch as on the super<U+FB01>cial extent of the reliability of the photo
 graphic <U+FB01>eld depend the time, labour, and cost of charting the
 heavens.    A general idea of this extent of reliable <U+FB01>eld may be
 gathered from the quality of the stellar images impressed at different
 distances from the centre of the plate. Thus in the case of the
g%-inch mirror at about forty minutes from the centre of the plate
the star images cease to be suf<U+FB01>ciently circular, although for a short
distance beyond, distances between these stellar disks may still be
measured, though not possessing the utmost reliability. In the case
of the T‘g‘v-inch mirror, this angular extent of measurable <U+FB01>eld extends
beyond <U+FB01>fty-one minutes from the centre. This very perceptible supe
riority of the {96-inch mirror arises, partly, no doubt, from its longer
focus, and it  may also be in<U+FB02>uenced by the e<U+FB01>ects of the intervention
of the plate holder; but be the causes what they may, the superiority
longer focus is  unquestionable in respect of extent of <U+FB01>eld.
   But an equally important element remains to be investigated,
namely, the amount of distortion which exists at di<U+FB01>erent distances

preliminary    examination   of the  optical quality   of  the  <U+FB01>eld, by the
method which      I have described in vol. 47 of the ‘Memoirs of the
Royal Astronomical Society’ (p. 238).             This method consists in
shifting the images of the same pair of stars to widely diiferent
localities in the <U+FB01>eld of view, and it was argued that so long as the
measured angular distances between these pairs remained sensibly
the same, 'i.e., within the known and unavoidable limits of observa
tional error, so long might the optical <U+FB01>eld of view be relied upon as
sensibly accurate.

by which this same pair was removed to (b).              This process was
repeated again and again in northerly, easterly, and westerly direc
tions, till after thirteen exposures this same pair of stars was
dotted about the plate as in the diagram.           This same process was
repeated on three plates on the same night (March 3, 1888). The
distances between each pair were then measured, and the means of
<U+FB01>ve measures of each pair were taken as the adopted measures for each
pair respectively.    The results are as follows :—

   When it is remembered that the unavoidable error of "such measures
is about O”'2 (where 0'0001 in. is equivalent to 0' "17), the only conclu.
sion to be drawn is that to the extent of the <U+FB01>eld impressed on this
plate of 1° 55' square, there is no perceptible or measurable distortion
in the apparent distance of these pairs, and in fact that small
measured distances may be relied upon throughout the <U+FB01>eld; and
thus, if a few stars are scattered about the plate with known co
ordinates, those of all the rest may be conveniently determined with
great accuracy.

The distance of (2:) and (z) from the centre of the plate was approxi

    It  should be observed              here, that while the linear discrepancies of
measured distances are the same as those with the {i‘E-inch mirror,
they indicate larger angular discrepancies in the ratio of 3 : 2.
Nevertheless, the examination of these angular discrepancies exhibits
evident traces of distortion, su<U+FB01>icient to render extreme accuracy of
measures unattainable without the great dif<U+FB01>culty of an extensive
tabulation; in other words, the comparative short focus of this
mirror is not well adapted to the purposes of accurate measurement.
Perhaps      I  ought here to refer to the very careful examination of the
<U+FB01>eld of the Grubb refractor of 121> inches aperture and 176 inches
focal length, recorded in the ‘Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical
Society,’ vol. 47, p. 238, in which it appears that no absolute reliance
could be assigned to measures extending beyond 12 minutes from the

 and, inasmuch as the measures actually made use of hitherto have
 never exceeded 075 inch from the centre of the <U+FB01>eld, this correction
 (admitting its reality) indicates an uncertainty of about 0"‘16.
 In the method employed for parallax determinations with this instru

 the avoidance of all but di<U+FB01>erential measures.
 IV.  The Photographic Capacities of the Two Mirror: in respect of the
      Faintest Stars impressed 0n Plates with Exposures of given
      Duration.
    The method employed was that described in the ‘ Proceedings of the
 Royal Society,’ N o. 247 (read May, 1886). It consisted in taking
 with each of the two mirrors three plates of the Pleiades exposed for
 5, 30, and 60 minutes respectively.          The diameters of a. few stars
 whose magnitude had been well determined by the wedge photo
 meter were measured <U+FB01>ve times on each of the plates, and then by the
 means indicated in the above-mentioned paper, the following results
 were obtained :—
                                Mirror T‘<U+FB01>-inch.
   Exposures of    5, 30, and 60   minutes, respectively, gave—
       5 min.  :—log   mag. required    = log  11'14 (mag)    — 00204   8.
      30 min. :—log mag. required       =  log 13'55 (mag)   — 00203 5.
      60 min. :——log mag. required = log       14'79 (ms-g.) -— 00193   5.
   In  the  above   formula    log 14'79 indicates the magnitude of the
faintest star just beginning to be impressed on the photographic plate
during its exposure of 60 minutes.        This number and the coef<U+FB01>cient
of 6 were obtained in the manner already referred to above, where 5
is the measured diameter of the star whose magnitude is sought",
expressed in seconds of arc.
   In like manner, the magnitude of the faintest star, during an
exposure of 30 minutes, was 1355 magnitude, and during an exposure
of 5 minutes, was 1114: magnitude.
                                Mirror  %%-inch.
   A similar investigation applied to this mirror        gave the  following
results after exposures of similar duration :—
                                                             -

        60 min. :—log mag. required = log 15-13 — 00197           8.
   From this it appears that the photographic capacity in respect
the faintness of the   light impressed is slightly in favour of the shorter

    Attention may here be drawn to the precision of the results
 obtained by measures so independent of each other. As an accidental
 result of these recent measures of the photographic magnitude of the
 stars, it may be mentioned that in May, 1886, the photographic
 magnitude of Star 22 in the Pleiades was 0.35 magnitude less
 than the photometric as obtained from very many measures, and               I
 attributed this di<U+FB01>’erence to the probable actinic peculiarity of the
 star in question, but inasmuch as no such perceptible diEerence exists
 in the more recent measures of the photographic and photometric
 magnitudes, resulting as they do from so many independent deter
 minations, the question of the variability of this star is suggested as
 very probable. Pleione also in the measures of 1886 exhibits a
 di<U+FB02>‘erence between the photometric and the photographic magnitude.
 Inasmuch as the same difference in the measures has been again
 exhibited in the recent measures, it seems reasonable to explain the
 fact by the peculiar actinic action in the light of this star.
    As a further example of the power and applicability of this
 de<U+FB01>nite method in reference to faint stars not suitable for determina
 tion by the wedge photometer,           I  may add here the following
 comparison of the resulting measures made by the photographic
 method, set side by side with the magnitude as estimated by Wolf

   It  has been more than once proposed to estimate or to measure the
photographic magnitudes of stars, by means of the breadth and
character of their traces on the photographic plates. This method
would involve an unnecessary consumption of time in procuring
                                                                 o 2

impressions made with this object in view alone.      But by the method
here adopted, the same plates which are taken for ascertaining the
co-ordinates of the stars, serve equally well for measuring their photo
graphic magnitudes.       It is perhaps unnecessary to point out that
practically the photometric and photographic magnitudes are, for the
most part, identical. The remark above will fail of application, if it
be possible to determine di<U+FB02>’erences of right ascension and of declina
tion from the traces of the stars with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy.
VI. “On the DeVelopment of Voltaic Electricity by Atmo
       spheric Oxidation.” By C. R. ALDER lVRlGHT, 1).Sc., F.R.S.,
       Lecturer on Chemistry and Physics, and C. THOMPSON,
      F.I.C., F.C.S., Demonstrator of Chemistry, in St. Mary's
       Hospital Medical School.       Received April 17, 1888.
   In   a preliminary note on this subject (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 42,
p. 212), it has been shown that when copper is immersed in an
                                                      “ aeration       ” of
aqueous solution of ammonia and opposed to an                    plate
some conducting material not otherwise acted upon, lying horizontally
on the surface of the <U+FB02>uid, a current <U+FB02>ows continuously through a
wire, 600., made to connect the two plates, the energy manifested by
which is due to the absorption of atmospheric oxygen by the aeration
plate and the indirect combination of this with the copper forming
cuprous oxide which dissolves in the ammonia. Numerous analogous
electrouiotor cells are readily obtainable by suitably varying the metal
susceptible of oxidation and the electrolytic <U+FB02>uid employed, some of
which we have submitted to close examination ; whilst another class
of voltaic cells, acting on much the same principle, we <U+FB01>nd can be
obtained by substituting for the oxidisable metal a platinum or other
incorrodible plate immersed in an oxidisable <U+FB02>uid, such as pyrogallol
dissolved in caustic soda: preferably the aération plate is arranged
in one vessel on the surface of some convenient <U+FB02>uid (not necessarily
identical with the oxidisable one), and the other plate and oxidisable
<U+FB02>uid placed in another vessel, the two being connected by a siphon
or wet wick ; or the whole may be arranged as a gravity battery, the
oxidisable <U+FB02>uid being made the heavier one so as to preserve it
from direct contact with air; or a U-tube arrangement may be
employed.      Thus, for example, a platinum plate immersed in an acid
 solution of ferrous sulphate, or in sulphurous acid solution, connected
with a vessel containing dilute sulphuric acid, and an ae'ration plate
of spongy platinum, &c., furnishes an electromotor cell in which the
production of a current is accompanied by the virtual transference
of oxygen from the aeration plate to the oxidisable <U+FB02>uid, forming

 1388.]    Development    of Electricity by Atmospheric  Oxidation.   183
ferric sulphate or       sulphuric acid respectively.     A considerable
enhancement in the E.M.F. of such an arrangement is e<U+FB01>'ected if the
uxidisable <U+FB02>uid is rendered'alkaline, and the aeration plate surrounded
by amid <U+FB02>uid, as in that case the passage of a current is also accom
panied by the mutual neutralisation of the acid and alkali to an
extent equivalent to the current <U+FB02>owing (apart from diffusion): the
heat of neutralisation of caustic soda and sulphuric acid is (Julius
 Thomsen)      31,378 gram-degrees, equivalent to 0675          volt; and
similarly in other cases. Thus, tolerany energetic aération cells are
obtained by using caustic soda solution of pyrogallol or sodium
hyposulphite (Schiitzenberger’s hydrosulphite), and a platinum sponge
aeration plate on the surface of diluted sulphuric acid; and somewhat
weaker ones if an alkaline solution of ferro-cyauide or sodium plumbate
 be used, ferri-cyanide or lead dioxide (precipitated in the solid form
 on the electrode) being the product of the oxidation thus e<U+FB01>ected,
 and the E.M.F. being upwards of 0'8 volt in each case.
    In all aeration cells, whether oxidisable <U+FB02>uids or metals be employed,
 one marked feature is the extremely rapid rate at which the E.M.F.
 of the cell falls if the current generated is made to exceed a very
 small limiting density relatively to the area of the aération plate.
 Of course when this plate is a. sheet of polished metal such as platinum
foil, this limit lies much lower than when it is a tray of the same
area <U+FB01>lled with spongy metal, pulverised graphite, 850., because in the
 latter case the true surface acting is much greater than the actual
 area of the tray : a number of observations led us to the conclusion
 that with the most sensitive kinds of aeration plates examined (thin
 foils or leaves of the precious metals), a measurable depreciation in the
 E.M.F. of a cell that otherwise would give a constant value, was
 speedily brought about if made to generate a current of greater
 density relatively to the aératiou plate than about 3'? micro-ampere
 per square centimetre of surface, or 1 micro-ampere for a plate
 5 centimetres square, exposing 25 square centimetres of surface (one
 side only reckoned);        but with aiiration plates of spongy metal
 currents of many times this density produced little or no depreciation
 even after <U+FB02>owing some time. Even with the most favourable kinds
 of plates, however, the tendency towards depreciation was so far
marked as to render it evident that but little hope could be enter
tained of utilising the principle of atmospheric oxidation for the
production of cheap currents of suf<U+FB01>cient power for practical use,
excepting when plates of enormous area are employed, so that the
density of the current should still be small, even when the current
itself was of moderate magnitude. Admitting, however, that a. large
super<U+FB01>cial area (e.g., a lake or arti<U+FB01>cial reservoir) of <U+FB02>uid were avail
able, and that the cost of a proportionately large system of aeration
plates were not prohibitive,      it  does not seem absolutely impossible

 184         Dr. C. R. A. Wright and Mr. C. Thompson.            [May 3,
that the production of currents by atmospheric oxidation might be
practically e<U+FB01>ected on the large scale.
    We found it di<U+FB01>icult to obtain sharp and concordant valuations of
the E.M.F. actually set up in cells containing oxidisable <U+FB02>uids, the
more so, as the numbers appeared to vary, not only with the nature of
the aeration plate and the <U+FB02>uid in contact therewith, but also with the
character of the incorrodible plate immersed in the oxidisable <U+FB02>uid, and
with the nature and strength of that <U+FB02>uid also.     With cells containing
oxidisable metals, however, and electrolytic <U+FB02>uids in which the oxides
formed were soluble, we found no di<U+FB02>iculty in obtaining far more
concordant and approximately constant values than would at <U+FB01>rst sight
have appeared likely, or even possible with combinations in which one
ingredient was so unstable an element as a <U+FB01>lm of gaseous matter
attracted to the surface of a condensing solid, and simultaneously
in contact with a <U+FB02>uid capable of dissolving the gas. Obviously,
mechanical disturbances, rapid alterations of temperature, and such
like causes would be likely to cause large variations from time to
time in the readings of any one particular cell; whilst unavoidable
di<U+FB02>ferences in the conditions of surface of otherwise duplicate plates
(.such as variations in degree of polish, &c.) would render it likely
that the average readings of any two duplicate cells would occasion
ally exhibit considerable divergence; we succeeded, however, in
reducing these sources of <U+FB02>uctuations to comparatively small limits, by
setting up the cells in an apartment where the temperature varied but
little, and only slowly, the readings being mostly taken in the morn
ings after standing at rest all night ; whilst alteration of the <U+FB02>uid by

in the same vessel, each one, B, being connected (by means of a

switch connecting the required mercury cup with the rest of the
circuit.
   On <U+FB01>rst setting up such an arrangement and taking readings
alternately with any one of the plates opposed to the oxidisable metal,
and a Clark’s cell, the total resistance in circuit being the same
(usually several megohms to reduce the current density suf<U+FB01>ciently)
values were obtained generally exhibiting progressive alteration
(sometimes increase, sometimes decrease) as time elapsed; but after
periods varying in different cases from an hour or two to several days,
sensibly steady readings were obtained exhibiting little or no variation
for days and even weeks together; what variations were observed
were generally traceable either to temperature <U+FB02>uctuations or to slight
shaking or mechanical disturbance whilst renewing the opposed
oxidisable plate, or to slight dilferences in the latter. If, however, in
cells set up with dilute sulphuric acid air had free access, more or less
considerable alteration was often brought about after some time
through evaporation or attraction of moisture from the air, altering
the <U+FB01>lm of <U+FB02>uid in contact with the aeration plate; and this was still
more the case with cells set up with caustic soda solution through
absorption of carbonic acid, and with ammonia cells through vola
tilisation of ammonia.
    The result of a large number of observations with cells of various
kinds was to show that the following general proposition holds :—
    If a cell set up with a given <U+FB02>uid, oxidisable metal, and aeration
plate generate an E.M.F. = e1, then the effect of substituting
another aeration plate for the <U+FB01>rst             to alter the E.M.F. to

   The spongy metals used were prepared as follows :—-Silver sponge
(from acetate) by gently igniting in the air crystallised silver acetate ;
that from chloride by boiling well-washed silver chloride with sugar
and caustic soda until reduction was nearly complete.             Spongy
palladium and platinum by gentle ignition of the ammonio-chlorides
of palladium and platinum respectively; and spongy gold by gentle
ignition in the air for a long time (so as to burn o<U+FB01> carbon) of cincho
nine auro-chloride.     The graphite was a very pure natural specimen
from Ceylon; when used it was coarsely powdered, and spread over
the surface of porous earthenware like the spongy metals. As regards
the leaves and foils of silver, gold, and platinum, no discernible
differences could be distinguished between the values given by the
thinnest leaves and comparatively thick foils (up to 01 mm. in thick
ness) in any of the three cases, saving that the latter took a much
longer time before steady readings were obtained. Carbon (A) was
a piece of electric light rod ground down to a thin <U+FB02>at plate; (B)
part of the carbon for a Leclanché cell similarly treated.
   It may be noticed that some aeration plates composed of spongy
platinum with a top-layer of platinum-black (precipitated from the
chloride by boiling with caustic soda and alcohol) gave <U+FB01>gures pretty
close to those furnished by platinum sponge; as also did other plates
consisting of porous earthenware painted over with platinochloride
of ammonium made into a paste with gum-water, ignited, and the
<U+FB01>lm of spongy platinum left on the surface burnished bright.

    When dilute sulphuric acid was the <U+FB02>uid, however, the platinum
black plates gave values upwards of a decivolt higher than sponge,
and the burnished pots about as much lower than sponge.
    A large number of observations Were made with sets of aeration
plates and oxidisable metals in contact with caustic soda solution of
one strength subsequently changed for a different one, and so on, only
those readings being taken into account when steadiness was attained ;
thus the following <U+FB01>gures were obtained where the plates were read
<U+FB01>rst in 1'75Na20,100H20, then in 3'45Na2,100H20, then in 7'15Na20,
1001120, and then in the <U+FB01>rst again, and so on several times, so that
each plate was read several times in each strength of <U+FB02>uid.           In all
cases the stronger the solution the higher the value, but the effect of
 a giVen increment in solution-strength was very different with dif

condition of steadiness, if opposed to a piece of freshly brightened
pure lead, somewhat irregular readings were obtained for a few
 minutes owing to the effect of the alkali on the polish of the lead;

solution-strength, but not to so great an extent, since the (negative)

somewhat less steadiness, and wider limits of <U+FB02>uctuation between the
mean values of duplicates, than cells containing caustic soda; but the
numbers obtained were suf<U+FB01>ciently concordant to show that, cater-is

increases with the solution-strength, and that practically no di<U+FB01>er

    In   the   case      of the cadmium              cells, the                 rises with the
 solutionvstrength          as   it    does   in the copper cells, and             more rapidly
because K2 is positive and                also  rises;   but  in   the case   of  the    zinc cells,
 the EMF. falls as the solution-strength rises, because K2 is here
 much smaller with the stronger solution.

                            Electra-copper       as Ozidisable Metal.
    It  was found impossible to keep any one cell of this kind under
anything like constant conditions as regards the nature of the <U+FB02>uid
on account of the loss of ammonia, experienced to a large extent
even when covered              with     a jar,  &c.; accordingly,        the   following values
can only be        regarded as approximate,                 especially in       the case of the
stronger solutions.              The strength of the <U+FB02>uid was ascertained by
sampling and analysis from time to time, and consequently inter
polation was sometimes requisite in order to reduce the values
obtained with different sets of plates to the same mean strength. On
the whole, however, the <U+FB01>gures indicate that with solutions of pure
ammonia, the E.M.F. rises with the strength of the solution; and
similarly with liquids containing sal-ammoniac                        as well.

platinum     foil   being    exceptional when opposed to zinc, the E.M.F. here

magnitude of the E.M.F. generated when a given kind of aeration
plate is opposed to a given oxidisable metal, depends on the nature,

                       the    Chemical Action going         on therein.
  In the     case of cells      with caustic soda as electrolytic <U+FB02>uid, the nett
chemical change           is   the oxidation of the oxidisable metal to form

  oxide (or hydroxide) which in the case of zinc and lead further dis
  solves in the alkaline liquid forming zincate or plumbate; the heat of
  solution of zinc and lead oxides in caustic soda being unknown, the
  total heat development cannot be exactly calculated. According to
  Julius Thomsen, Zn,O = 85430, and Pb,O = 50300 gram-degrees,
  corresponding with the E.M.F’s. 1837 and 1081 respectively<U+FB01>" where
  fore the E.M.F. due to the chemical action (including formation of
  zincate and plumbate) must be higher still; on the other hand, the
  highest values observed in any aératiou cell were only 1'645 and
 0954 respectively (spongy silver-acetate), whilst values of from 1 to
 4 decivolts lower still were observed with other plates.                Hence the
  E.M.F. actually generated in these cells falls very considerably short of
 that corresponding with the chemical change, even under the most
 favourable circumstances, i.e., when producing only an in<U+FB01>nitesimal
 current; whilst when producing a somewhat greater current, but still
 of only small density (not exceeding a fraction of a micro-ampere
 per square centimetre of aération plate surface in some cases),
 running down and marked depreciation of E.M.F. is rapidly brought
 about.
     Much the same remarks apply to cells set up with sulphuric acid
 and with ammoniacal <U+FB02>uids; in the former the nett chemical change
 is the oxidation of the metal and solution of the oxide in the acid
 forming the sulphate. Julius Thomsen gives the heat values—
     Zinc    ......     Zn,0,SOaaq = 106090 gram-degrees =' 2 '28] volts.
     Cadmium.        .  Cd.O,SO3aq = 89500              ,,       = 1'924 ,,

     Silver ..... Ag2,O,SOSaq =          20390          ,,       =  0 '438    ,,
Whilst       the highest observed values in the case of the <U+FB01>rst three metals
fall     short of these by 4 to 5 decivolts, and with less active aeration
 plates the de<U+FB01>ciency is much greater. Silver, however, when employed
as oxidisable          metal, does not show this falling OK, but rather the
 reverse,      the     highest value observed (platinum black) being about
0'58, and the next highest (platinum sponge) about 0'46, both
 exceeding the E.M.F. calculated from the heat value; obviously this'
is due, not to anything connected with the aeration plates, but rather
to the large negative value of the thermo-voltaic constantf pertaining
to silver in contact with sulphuric acid, evidenced also by the circum
stance observed by us, that when silver is substituted for zinc in a
 Grove's cell, instead of the E.M.F. being depressed by an amount
    “ Taking    J   = 41'5 x 10", and the unit C.G.S. current as evolving 0'0001036
gram     of hydrogen per second, whence the factor for converting gram-degrees into
 volts is sensibly 4300 x 10-8 = 0 '000043 per gram-equivalent.

 corresponding with the difference in heat of formation of zinc and
 silver sulphates (85700 gram-degrees = 1843 volts) it is only
 depressed by an amount short of this by some 5 or 6 decivolts.
 Similarly in the ammoniacal cells where (as in the caustic soda cells)
 the action consists in the oxidation of a metal and the solution of the
 oxide formed in the ammoniacal liquor, Julius Thomsen gives the
 heat values—
              Zinc   ..........          Zn,O  =    85430       = 1'837 volt.
              Copper ........            Cu2,O =    40810       = 0877 ,,
              Silver ..........          Ag,,0 =        5900    = 0‘127 ,,
Whence the E.M.F. corresponding with the total chemical change
must somewhat exceed these amounts by the quantity representing
the respective heats of solution_in ammonia liquor of the metallic
oxides: the highest values observed with zinc and copper fall dis
tinctly short      these amounts, whilst the numbers obtained with
                     of_
many    kinds of  aération plates in weaker solutions exhibit a large
de<U+FB01>ciency; on the other hand, cells containing silver as oxidisable
metal show no large falling off, and in the case of the highest values
an actual excess of E.M.F., again indicating a somewhat large negative
value for the thermo-voltaic constant applicable to silver in contact
with ammoniacal <U+FB02>uids.

K2 in no case differ very widely from those equivalent to the di<U+FB02>‘cr

differences, indicating as before that silver exhibits a high negative
value for its thermo-volt-aic constant in each case, viz., —O'5 to '—0'6
in contact with dilute sulphuric acid, and near to —0'4 in contact
with ammoniacal <U+FB02>uids, this latter value being close to those found
previously for-silver in contact; with neutral solutions of its sulphate,
nitrate, and acetate (loo. cit).
    On the whole, except when=an oxidisable metal is used exhibiting
a. high negative value for its thermo-voltaic             constant, the E.M.F. of
a cell containing        an aeration plate and an oxidisable           metal always
falls short, and        sometimes    largely short, of that equivalent to the

chemical changes going on therein even under the most favourable
conditions when generating only an in<U+FB01>nitesimal current, the de
<U+FB01>ciency being still more marked when the current density is not so
minute: in other words, the modus operandi of cells of this class is
such as necessarily to render a large fraction of the energy non
adjuvant so far ns-current is concerned.                 Just the same remarks
apply, as far as our experiments have gone, to cells in which the
oxidisable substance is in solution, an extreme case of which is
exhibited by cells set up with a solution of sulphurous acid and a sub
merged platinum foil plate, -opp0sed to an aératiou plate of platinum:
sponge on the surface of dilute sulphuric acid.                 Such cells give an
E.M.F. (when generating only extremely small currents) of from 0'2
to 03 volt, whilst the heat of oxidation of sulphurous acid solution,
 SOQaq,O,       is 636341 gram-degrees, according to Julius Thomsen,
corresponding with 1‘368 volt, or upwards of a-volt more'than that
actually produced? , Analogous diminutions in EM. F. are brought
about in many other cases, to extents depending not only on the
nature of the aération plate but also on that of the oxidisable <U+FB02>uid.
   " A large part of the depreciation in this case is due to the fact that sulphurons
acid solution and platinum constitute an oxidisable portion of ucell behaving as
magnesium and aluminium do in cells where they replace zinc, i.e., giving a much
smaller  E.M.F. than that    due to the heat corresponding with the chemical change =
thus, if a. cell be set up with zinc or dilute sulphuric acid opposed to platinum in
sulphuric chromic acid solution, and the zinc and sulphuric acid be then replaced
by platinum and sulphurous acid solution, the E.M.F. falls by an amount
greater by 04-5 to 0'5 volt than that corresponding with the differences in heat evolu

aeration cells could be e<U+FB02>'ected by substituting tolerably pure oxygen
for atmospheric air, we carried out a number of observations with

Readings were <U+FB01>rst taken for a few days with ordinary air in the jar;
oxygen was then admitted and pasmd through till gradually all air
was displaced, and after a day or two when the readings had become
constant another series of readings for some days was taken. The
oxygen was then displaced by air and another series taken, and so on
alternately several times. The following average values were ulti
mately obtained showing a small, though decided, increment in

 cally impossible to have an acting E.M.F. as high as 1 volt, even with

    Much the same result was obtained on opposing to one another
 two platinum sponge aeration plates, one in an atmosphere of
 hydrogen or coal-gas, the other in contact with air; in no case
 could any current capable of depositing a few milligrams of silver
per day be obtained with an E.M.F. as great as 1 volt; i.e., a total
 depreciation of upwards-of 0'5 volt was occasioned, or more than
one- third of the energy due to the chemical change, viz., oxidation of
hydrogen to water, representing 68360 gram-dcgrees, or 1'470 volt.

I. “On     the Electromotive Properties of the Leaf of Dionwa in
     the Excited and Unexcited State. No. II.” By J. BURDON
     SANDERSON, M.A., M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Physiology in
     the University of Oxford.      Received April 17, 1888.
                                (Abstract)
    The author   has continued his experimental enquiries, of which the
results were communicated to the Royal Society under the same title
in 1881. In the introduction to the paper he gives a summary of his
previous observations, which led to the conclusion that the property,
by virtue of which the excitable structures of the leaf respond to
Stimulation, is of the same nature with that possessed by the similarly
endowed structures of animals.      He then proceeds to state that the
main purpose of his subsequent investigations has been to determine
the relation between two sets of phenomena which might, in accord
ance with the language commonly used in animal physiology, be
 termed respectively those of the “resting current ” and of the “action

 current   of the leaf, i.e., between the electrical properties possessed
 by the leaf when stimulated, and those which it displays when at
rest. Assuming the excitatory response in the leaf to be of the same
nature as the excitatory variation or “ action current " in muscle and
nerve, the question has to be answered, whether in the leaf the
response is a sudden diminution of a previously existing clectromotive
action (according to the pro-existence theory of dn Bois-Reymond),
or the setting up at the moment of stimulation of a new electromotive
action—in short, whether and in how far the two sets of phenomena
are interdependent or the contrary.
   An observation recorded in his former paper suggested proper
methods. It had been shown that by passing a weak voltaic current
through the leaf for a short period in a particular direction, its
electromotive properties could be permanently modi<U+FB01>ed without loss
of its excitability.   If it could be shown that the in<U+FB02>uence of this
modi<U+FB01>cation extended to both orders of phenomena, those of rest and
of excitation, and that both underwent corresponding changes of
character under similar conditions, this would go far to prove that
an essential relation existed between them.
   Acting on this suggestion, the author has had recourse to modes
of experiment similar to those which have been employed during
the last few years in the investigation of the newly-discovered
“secondary electromotive” phenomena         of muscle and nerve (sec
‘
  Oxford Biological Memoirs,’ vol. 1, part 2). The details of these
experiments, made in 1885, are given in the <U+FB01>rst three sections of the
paper. They relate to (1) the more immediate effect of the current as
seen in the records of successive galvnnometrio observations made at
regular intervals; (2) the more permanent in<U+FB02>uence of the current on
the electromotive properties of the nnexcited leaf, and on its electrical
Wish-I109;    and (3) the concomitant modi<U+FB01>cation of its behaviour
when stimulated.
   The general result of these experiments is to show that the two
orders of phenomena, the excitatory and those which relate to the
resting state, are so linked together that every change in the state of
the leaf when at rest conditionates a corresponding change in the
way in which it reacts to stimulation—the correspondence consist
ing in this, that the direction of the response is opposed to that Of the
previous difference of potential between the opposite surfaces, so that
as the latter changes from ascending to descending, the former
changes  from descending to ascending.
   The author considers that this can only be understood to mean
that the constantly operative electromotive forces which <U+FB01>nd their
expression  \in  the persistent di<U+FB01>erence of potential between the
opposite surfaces, and those more transitory ones which are called
into momentary existence by touching the sensitive <U+FB01>laments or by

20L                     Zlfagnetic Qualities of Nickel.           [May 17,
other modes of stimulation, have the same seat, and that the opposi
tion between them is in accordance with a principle applicable in
common to the excitable structures of plants and animals, viz., that
the property which renders a. structure capable of undergoing emcitatory
change is expressed by relative positivity, the condition of discharge by
relative negativity.
    \Vith reference to the mode of action of the voltaic current, the
effect produced in the unexcited leaf is compared with that observed
in the unexcited electric organ of the‘skate or the torpedo, in both of
which, as in the leaf, it is observed that, although the after-effect of a
current led across the disks or plates is to increase the di<U+FB01>erence of
potential between its two surfaces, whichever way the current is
directed, the effect is much greater when the direction of the external
current coincides with that of the normal electromotive action of the
organ than in the opposite case.
    It is further shown that the electromotive changes concerned in
“ modi<U+FB01>cation ” and “ excitation ” have their seat at the upper surface
of the lamina.      If, as the author believes, all these changes depend on
difference of physiological activity between adjacent excitable cells or
strata of cells of which the protoplasmic linings are in continuity, it
must be supposed that when the leaf is at its prime, the most super
<U+FB01>cial strata are positive to those subjacent, and that as the former
lose their pristine susceptibility of excitatory change, the physio
logical, and consequently the electrical, difference between them is
diminished, annulled, or reversed.
    The fourth section of the paper is devoted to an investigation made
in 1887, of the events of the <U+FB01>rst second after excitation made with
the aid of a pendulum-rheotome specially adapted for the purpose.
The <U+FB01>fth contains the description of the records obtained by photo
 graphing the electric phenomena of the excitatory reaction, as ob
 served with the aid of the capillary electrometer, on rapidly moving
plates.    Both of these series of observations serve to con<U+FB01>rm and
complete the results obtained by other methods.
 II. “Magnetic        Qualities of Nickel.”      By J. A. EWING, F.R.S.,

     The experiments described in      the paper were made with the view
 of extending to nickel the same lines of enquiry as had been pursued
 by one of the authors in regard to iron (‘ Phil. Trans,’ 1885, p. 523).
 Cyclic  processes of magnetisation were studied, in     which a magnetising

 force of about 100 c.g.s. units was applied, removed, reversed, again
 removed, and re-applied, for the purpose of determining the form of
 the magnetisation curve, the magnetic susceptibility, the ratio of
residual to induced magnetism, and the energy dissipated in conse
 quence of hysteresis in the relation of magnetic induction to magnet
ising force. Curves are given, to show the “character of such cycles for
nickel wire in three conditions: the original hard-drawn state, annealed,
 and hardened by stretching after being annealed.                   The e<U+FB02>'ects of
 these have also been examined (1) by loading and unloading magnet
ised nickel wire with weights which produced cyclic variations of
longitudinal pull, and (2) by magnetising while the wire was sub
jected to a steady pull of greater or less amount.                    The results
con<U+FB01>rm    and   extend   Sir  William     Thomson’s    observation       that longi
tudinal pull diminishes magnetism in nickel.                This diminution is
surprisingly great: it occurs with respect to the induced magnetism
 under both large and small magnetic forces, and also with respect to
residual magnetism.        The e<U+FB01>ects of stress are much less complex
than in iron, and cyclic variations of stress are attended by much less
hysteresis. Curves are given to show the induced and residual mag
netism produced by various magnetic forces when the metal was
maintained in one or other of certain assigned states of stress; also
the variations of induced and residual magnetism which were caused
by loading and unloading without alteration of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
Values of the initial magnetic susceptibility, for 'very feeble magnet
ising forces, are stated, and are compared with the values determined
by Lord Rayleigh for iron, and the relation-0f the initial susceptibility
to the stress present is investigated.         The paper consists mainly of
diagrams   in  which   the ‘results .are   graphically exhibited by means of
curves.

IV. “ On       the Rhythm of the Mammalian Heart.”                  By J. A.
        MCWILLIAM, M.D., Professor of the Institutes of Medicine
        in the University of Aberdeen.            Communicated by Pro
        fessor M. FOSTER, Sec. R.S.          Received April 26, 1888.
    The following are some of the general conclusions arrived at from a
prolonged investigation of the rhythm of the mammalian heart. The
experiments were conducted on the cat, dog, rabbit, rat, hedgehog, and
guinea-pig, the cat being the animal most commonly used.                  The
animals were anmsthetized,          arti<U+FB01>cial respiration was kept up, the
thorax was laid open, and the action of the heart was recorded by
various adaptations of the graphic method :—
    1. Minimal stimulation of the quiescent cardiac muscle is at the
same time maximal; a stimulus which is strong enough to excite con
traction at all excites a maximal contraction.            The strength of an
arti<U+FB01>cially     excited  beat  does   not  depend   on  the  strength of the
stimulus; it is equally strong with maximal and minimal excitation.
I have tested this point in various ways :—
    (1.) On the excised heart which has ceased contracting spon
taneously, but is still quite capable of being arti<U+FB01>cially excited to
beat.
    (2.) On the intact heart reduced to a state of quiescence by vagus
stimulation.
    (3.) On intact hearts which beat slowly in consequence of cooling
and other circumstances; the stimulations were applied during the
quiescent period intervening between two spontaneous contractions.
    2. The condition of <U+FB01>brillar contraction or heart-delirium induced
in the ventricles of excitable hearts by the application of interrupted
currents and other means can be recovered from even after long
periods (three-quarters of an hour,             under the combined in<U+FB02>uence
of arti<U+FB01>cial respiration, rhythmical compression of the ventricles, and
the administration of pilocarpin.
    When the excitability of the cardiac muscle has been much depressed
(by pilocarpiu, certain phases of exhaustion, &c.), the application of
interrupted currents does not induce <U+FB01>brillar contraction, but merely a
series of rhythmic beats in the case of a quiescent organ, or an accelera
tion of the rhythm already present in a heart which is beating spon
                                        I
 taneously.                                                             .
    3. The spontaneous rhythmic power possessed by the terminal parts
of the great veins, the auricles, and the ventricles, seems, in some Cun
 d‘itians at least, to be myogenic.
    4:. In the intact heart the auriclcs and ventricles         do not beat in
 virtue of their own independent rhythmic power, but in obedience to

1888.]          On the Rhythm    of the Mammalian Heart.               207
                                                           ”
impulses reaching them from the terminal or “ostial           parts of the
great    veins.  For  though   both  auricles and  ventricles  possess an
inherent rhythmic tendency, the ostial parts of the great veins possess
a higher power of spontaneous rhythm, and hence dominate the
rhythm of the whole heart. The rapidly recurring contractions
arising in the ostial regions are propagated over the whole organ; the
more rapid rhythm of the ostial parts supersedes and renders latent
the less rapid inherent rhythm of the auricles and ventricles.          In
support of this view there can be adduced many facts. Among
others—
    (1.) The independent rhythm of the auricles and ventricles appears
to be decidedly slower than that of the terminal or ostial parts of the
veins.
    (2.) Slight 'heating -of the ostial part of a great vein (e.g., the
termination of the vena cave-superior) causes a marked acceleration
in the rhythm of the whole heart, while a similar heating of the
 ventricular wall causes very little change, or (more commonly) none
 at all.
    Weak faradio and galvanic currents induce similar results in this
respect.
    (3.) In the dying heart the power of spontaneous rhythmic con
traction survives longest in the ostial parts of the veins. This is
analogous to whatiobtains in the hearts of cold-blooded animals, where
the greatest vitality is exhibited by the sinus venosus, the part pos
sessed of the highest spontaneous rhythm, 'i.e.§ the leading or dominant
 part of the organ.
    5. The normal sequence of the ventricular contraction upon the
auricular contraction in the intact heart is essentially determined by
fervous in<U+FB02>uences. It is not dependent on—
    (l.) The distension of the ventricles with blood pumped in from
 the auricles.
    (2.) The mechanical relations normally obtaining between the
 auricles and ventricles through the medium of the auriculo-ventricular
 valves and the chordse tendineee; or                                -
     (3.) The occurrence of an electrical change (current of action) in
 the auricular muscle as one of the phenomena of its contraction.
    6. The nervous in<U+FB02>uence determining the ventricular sequence is
 probably of an intermittent character.
    7. The propagation of the contraction      within the walls of the
 auricles and ventricles is not dependent on the action' of the nerves
 lying near the surface of these parts.
    The contraction continues to be propagated quite well when the
 surface (e.g., of the ventricles)       has been washed with strong
 ammonia.
    8. In the auricles at least, the ordinary beat is not the result of a

simultaneous motor discharge from a nerve centre to all the muscular
<U+FB01>bres ; the contraction is, on the other hand, a progressive process
passing over the auricular walls in a wave-like fashion.
   9. A reversal of the normal sequence of the heart’s contraction can
be induced and kept up for a considerable time by applying to the
ventricles a series of single stimulations (6.9., induction shocks) at a
rate somewhat more rapid than that of the spontaneous rhythm of the
organ.
V. ,“ Inhibition     of the Mammalian Heart.” By JOHN A.
      MGWILLIAM, M.D., Professor of the Institutes of Medicine
      in the University of Aberdeen.            Communicated by Pro
      fessor M. FOSTER, Sec. R.S.        Received May 3, 1888.
   The following conclusions are based upon a long series of experi
ments performed upon the cat, dog, rabbit, rat, hedgehog, and guinea
pig, the cat being the animal commonly used.             The animals were
aumsthetized, usually   with  chloroform;   artificial respiration was kept
up ; the thorax and often the pericardial sac were laid open, and the
action of the heart was examined with the aid of the graphic
method.
                            Section of the Vagi.
   The results of section of both vagi vary according to the conditions
obtaining at the time the nerves are cut—according to the amount of
controlling in<U+FB02>uence exercised by the medullary cardio-iuhibitory
centre upon the heart. When the cardio-inhibitory centre is inactive,
section of the vagi causes no appreciable change in the heart’s action.
On the other hand, section of the nerves at a time when the con
trolling in<U+FB02>uence of the medullary centre is acting to a decided extent,
is followed by very pronounced results—by an increase not only in
the rate of the cardiac beat, but also in the contraction force of both
the auricles and the ventricles.     There is a marked augmentation in
the strength of the beats; the change in the energy of the auricular
contractions is usually more extensive than that occurring in the case
of the ventricles.
                     Stimulation of   the Vagus  Nerve.
   The latent Ikriod of vagus stimulation varies remarkably in different
conditions; there is often a period of many seconds before the heart
stands still.
   When the vagus nerve is stimulated so as to slow the heart, it is
usually seen that the inhibitory in<U+FB02>uence is not of maximal intensity
at its <U+FB01>rst manifestation, but goes on increasing for some time.

                 E<U+FB01>'ecis of  Vague Stimulation on the Auricles.
     1. The vague     appears as a rule to in<U+FB02>uence the auricles more
 readily  and  more powerfully than the ventricles.
     2. Vague stimulation leads to a slowing or an arrest of the rhythmic
 beat, and a very marked weakening of the contraction force.
     The recommencing auricular beats that occur when the period of
 inhibition is passing away are very weak ; and any contractions
  excited by direct stimulation (e.g., with induction shocks) during the
 period of standstill are strikingly enfeebled.
     3. Vagus stimulation causes a pronounced depression of the excita
 bility of the auricular tissue to direct stimulation.
    During the period of inhibition resulting from vagus stimulation it
 is much more dif<U+FB01>cult than usual to excite an auricular beat by direct
 excitation; a much stronger stimulus is necessary to elicit any con.
 traction at all.
    4. The tone of the auricular muscle appears to be markedly dimi
'
 nished.
     5. These results occur when the vagus is stimulated, even when the
 superior and inferior vcnaa cavse have been clamped, so that the
 cavities of the heart are no longer <U+FB01>lled with blood.
    6. The vagus nerve seems to exert a powerful in<U+FB02>uence of a more
 or less direct nature on the muscle itself,th merely by inhibiting or
 weakening the motor impulses which are-commonly assumed to pass
 from nerve centres in the heart to the muscular <U+FB01>bres. For if it were
 true that the vagus acted simply by depressing the motor centres of
  the heart, it is very di<U+FB01>icult to conceive how the responsiveness of the
  auricular muscle to direct stimuli should. be so greatly diminished,
  and how the contraction force should be so strikingly reduced when
  the auricular muscle is made to contract by induction shocks applied
  to the auricular tissue.
     It would seem that whatever changes-the vagus may induce in the
  nerve-cells and ganglia occurring plentifully in the auricles, it can
 also exert an important in<U+FB02>uence on the contractile tissue itself.
     7. Upon the whole, the in<U+FB02>uence of the vagus nerve upon the mam
  malian auricles presents a close parallelism to what holds good in the
  auricles of many cold-blooded animals.
                E<U+FB02>ects of Vague Stimulation on the Ventricles.
     Besides causing slowness or standstill, the vagus can cause other
  important changes in the ventricular part of the heart.
     1. The contraction force is markedly diminished. When a period of
  standstill has ended, the recommcncing beats are usually weak; and
 beats excited by direct stimulation (e.g., single induction shocks)
  during the period of standstill are of diminished size.

210                    Prof.   J. A. McWilliam.               [May   17,
    When vagus stimulation does not cause complete standstill, but
only a marked slowing, the strength of the slow ventricular beats is
usually much less than the normal.
   The reduction in contraction force does not bear any constant rela~
tion to the degree of slowing. While all the slow beats are weakened in
some degree, a beat occurring after a long pause is sometimes decidedly
stronger than one occurring after a shorter pause; on the other hand,
the converse more often holds good—a beat occurring after a long
pause is weaker than a beat occurring after a shorter pause.
   The depression of contraction force does not appear to depend on
over-distension of the ventricles during the slowing or standstill ; nor
upon the fall of arterial pressure that occurs and involves a dimi
nished resistance to the ventricular systole and a change in the coro
nary circulation.
   The force-depressing elfects of vague stimulation can still be seen
(1) when the superior and inferior veme cavae have been clamped; or
(2) when the pulmonary artery or (3) the aorta has been clamped; or
(4) when all these vessels have been clamped before the vagus stimu
lation.
   2. When slowing or arrest of the ventricular action oceurs as a
result of vagus stimulation, there is a marked change in the shape and
duration of the ventricular curves; the degree of change stands in
close relation to the length of the pause preceding each beat.       The
curves become broader near the top, and their duration is increased.
The longer the interval preceding a curve the broader the curve is,
and the more markedly is it prolonged. These features are not
abolished when the superior and inferior venaa cavaa have been clamped
before the vagus stimulation; nor when the aorta or the pulmonary
artery, or all these vessels, have been clamped.
   3. The vague appears to inhibit the spontaneous rhythmic tendency
inherent in the ventricles; the ventricular standstill does not appear
to be due simply to the standstill of the rest of the heart.
   4:.At the same time the absence of auricular beats of any consider
able strength is  usually a necessary condition for the occurrence of a
protracted   ventricular  standstill. -It commonly but not invariably
happens that if   the auricles are arti<U+FB01>cially excited to contract during
the period of cardiac standstill, the ventricles beat also in sequence to
the arti<U+FB01>cially excited auricular contraction.
  5.   When the heart begins to beat after a period of inhibition, the
order of contraction most commonly seen         is    that which obtains
normally—ostial parts of the'vgreat veins; auricles; ventricles.      But
sometimes the Ventricles recommence,        and give one or more beats
before any contract-ion occurs in the other parts of the heart.
  6.  There are sometimes seen evidences of the occurrence under
 vagus in<U+FB02>uence of a   block in the propagation of the contraction from

  1888.]               Inhibition of the Mammalian      Heart.             211
  auricles to ventricles.       At certain phases of vagus stimulation the
  ventricles often fail to respond to auricular beats, while at the same
  time there is evidence to show that this is due not to a. depression of
  the ventricular excitability, but to a break in the transmission of the
  contraction from the auricles.
     7. The maximum intensity of the inhibitory in<U+FB02>uence exerted by
  vagus stimulation often obtains at the same time in the auricles and
  the ventricles.     But frequently the auricles become greatly depressed,
  while the ventricular beats are of ‘nndiminished size, or are only
 beginning to be affected; in rare cases the ventricular contraction
 force becomes reduced more suddenly than the auricular.
     8. The effects of vagus stimulation on the ventricles may be in
 some measure counteracted by the application to the ventricular surface
 of a series of stimulations (e.g., single induction shocks) at about the
 normal rate of the heart’s action. An arti<U+FB01>cially excited series of
 beats is thus caused; these beats give curves of approximately normal
 form and duration, and they are much stronger than any slowly occur
 ring spontaneous beats that appear after the standstill has lasted for
 some time; they are also much stronger than single beats excited (by
 induction shocks) at long intervals during the standstill. The beats of
 the arti<U+FB01>cially excited series (at normal rate) are still decidedly
 weaker than normal beats.
         On. the Existence  of a Local
                                        “ Inhibing Area ” in   the Heart.
    By stimulation of a certain locality on the dorsal aspect of the
 auricular surface, certain striking eifects are obtained. In the cat and
 dog the area in question is elongated in shape, and is situated over
the inter-auricular septum, its long axis running parallel with the
plane of the septum. It extends downwards to within a short distance
of the coronary sinus. At the right side of the area lies the termina
tion of the vena cava inferior.
    Many nerves course downwards through this region ; there are also
numerous nerve-cells and ganglia.           These. however, are not con<U+FB01>ned
to the area in question, but occur in considerable number over the
dorsal aspect of the left ventricle, especially in its septal half. The
nerves appear to be derived to a considerable extent from the left
vague.       The majority of the <U+FB01>bres are non-medullated, but medullated
<U+FB01>bres are also present (cat).          Ganglia Occur in special abundance
near the auriculo-ventricular groove.
    Stimulation of this area with an interrupted current gives results
that stand out in sharp contrast to those obtained by stimulating
other parts of the auricular wall, e.g., the appendix.         Stimulation of
the latter causes an acceleration of both      auricles  and ventricles.  The
auricles contract with great rapidity, so that they present a peculiar
    VOL.  XLIV.                                                       Q

<U+FB02>uttering appearance;       the ventricles beat much more rapidly than
before, though they do not keep pace with the auricles.
    On the other hand, stimulation of the inhibitory area, while it
 causes a rapid <U+FB02>uttering action of the auricles, induces either a very
 marked slowing, or a complete standstill in the ventricles.            This
 result is a mixed one—ventricular inhibition, resulting from stimula
 tion of certain structures in the inhibitory area, and auricular accelera
 tion, in all probability due to an escape of the stimulating current to
 the excitable auricular tissue.                                      4
    The inhibitory e<U+FB01>ects on the ventricle much resemble               those
.caused by vagus stimulation.        There is depression of the ventricular
 contraction force, and changes in the shape and duration of the ven
 tricular curves similar to those occurring under vagus in<U+FB02>uence.
 Stimulation of the inhibitory area and of the vagus are both rendered
 inelfective by the administration of atropine.
    But there are certain points of di<U+FB01>erence :—
    (1.) The strength of current necessary to inhibit the ventricles is
 very much less when the current is applied to the inhibitory area
 than when it is applied to the vagus.
    (2.) Stimulation of the inhibitory area remains e<U+FB01>ective in arrest
ing the ventricular action, after curare has been administered in such
amount as to cause stimulation of one or both vagi in the neck to be
 entirely without inhibitory result.
    (3.) In many instances when the vagi have become exhausted, or
 have lost their inhibitory power from less de<U+FB01>nite causes, the inhibitory
 area remains effective.
    It seems clear from the very di<U+FB02>i'ercnt relation borne by the inhibi
 tory  area to certain poisons, to the strength of stimulating current
 necessary,   to exhaustion, &c., that in exciting this area we are dealing
 with   structures   of a more or less special nature, differing markedly
 in their character from the ordinary inhibitory <U+FB01>bres running in the
 trunks of the vagus nerves.
    The important structures of the inhibitory area are situated super~
 <U+FB01>cially; they may be readily paralysed by the application of a few
 drops of a 4 per cent. solution of cocaine hydrochlorate, or of strong
ammonia.
    The region in question       does not contain a motor centre for the
 heart muscle. Destruction of this area does not arrest the spontaneous
 rhythm of the organ (which indeed originates in parts some distance
 removed from the inhibitory area, viz., in the ostial parts of the great
veins, especially the vena cava superior and the pulmonary veins).
Nor is the propagation of the contraction from one part of the heart
to another in any way deranged or interfered with.
    The inhibitory area probably contains structures to which many at

intimate relation with the cardiac mechanism.
Effect of Stimulation of Ostial Parts of Great Veins in certain Abnormal
                                 Conditions.
   At certain stages of the process of asphyxia, and in the dying heart,
there is often seen a very remarkable alteration in the behaviour of
the ostial parts of the great veins towards direct stimulation with
interrupted currents.     In such circumstances, an inhibition of the
spontaneous rhythmic action of these parts may often be seen as a
result of direct stimulation, whereas in the normal state such a stimu
lation is productive of immediate and striking acceleration.

   This paper gives    an account of the structure of the cup-shaped
bodies, which, as mentioned in      a     previous paper read 26th April,
 1888, make up the      electric organs of certain members of the skate
 family.    The structure of these electric cups has been already
 studied in three species of skate, viz.: Raia fullonia, R. radiate,
 and R. circulam's.     The present paper only deals with the electric
 organ of R. circularis.       It shows that the cups in this species
are large, well-de<U+FB01>ned bodies, each resembling somewhat the cup of
                “
the familiar      cup and ball.”       The cup proper, like the disks of
R. batis, consists of three distinct layers, (1) the lining, which       is
almost identical with the electric plate of R. batis; (2) a thick
median striated layer; and (3) an outer or cortical layer. The lining
or electric plateis   inseparably connected with the terminal branches
of the numerous nerve-<U+FB01>bres, which, entering by the wide mouth in
front, all but <U+FB01>ll the entire cavity of the cup, and ramify over its
inner surface, the intervening spaces being occupied by gelatinous
tissue. This electric layer, which   is   richly nucleated, presents nearly
as large a surface for the terminations of the electric nerves as the
electric plate which covers the disk in R. batis and R. clavata.       The
striated layer, as in R. batis, consists of numerous lamellie, which
have an extremely contorted appearance, but       it   di<U+FB01>ers from the cor
responding layer     in  R.  batis, in  retaininga   few corpuscles. The
cortical layer very decidedly di<U+FB01>ers in appearance from the alveolar

and sometimes has short blunt processes projecting from its outer
surface.   These short processes apparently correspond to the long
complex projections which in R. batz's give rise to an irregular net
work, and they seem to indicate that the cortical layer of R. circularis
essentially agrees with the alveolar layer of R. baits, differing chie<U+FB02>y
in the amount of complexity. Surrounding the cortex there is a
thin layer of gelatinous tissue in which capillaries ramify.        This
tissue evidently represents the thick gelatinous cushion which lies
behind the disk in R. batis, and <U+FB01>lls up the alveoli.
   The stem of the cup is usually, if not always, longer than the
diameter of the cup. It consists of a core of altered muscular sub
stance, which is surrounded by a thick layer of nucleated protoplasm
continuous with the cortical layer of the cup, and apparently also
identical with it.
   The cups are arranged in oblique rows to form a long, slightly
 <U+FB02>attened spindle, which occupies the posterior two-thirds of the tail,
being in a skate measuring 27 inches from tip to 'tip, slightly over
8 inches in length, and nearly a quarter of an inch in width at the
 widest central portion, but only about 2 lines in thickness.
   The posterior three-<U+FB01>fths of the organ lies immediately beneath
the skin, and has in contact with its outer surface the nerve of the
lateral line. The anterior two-<U+FB01>fths is surrounded by <U+FB01>bres of the
outer caudal muscles.     It is pointed out that while the organ in
R. circularis is larger than in R. radiata, it is relatively very much
smaller than the organ of R. batis.

         On ZEolotropic Elastic Solids.” By C. CHREE, M.A., Fellow
       of King’s College, Cambridge. Communicated by Professor
       J. J. THOMSON, F.R.S. Received May 1, 1888.
                              ( Abstrac   t.)
   This paper treats of elastic solids of various non-isotropic kinds.
Its object  to obtain solutions of the internal equations
           is                                              inascending
integral powers of the variables, and apply them to problems of a
practical kind, some of them already solved, but in an entirely
di<U+FB02>erent way, by Saint-Venant.
   On the multi-constant theory of elasticity the equations connecting
the strains and stresses contain 21 constants. As shown by Saint
Venant these reduce for one-plane symmetry to 13, for three-plane
symmetry to      and for symmetry round an axis perpendicular to a
                9,
plane  of symmetry to  5.
   Part of this paper deals with one-plane symmetry. A solution
       I                                                              is
obtained of the internal equations of equilibrium complete so far as

1888.]               On 1Eol0tropic Elastic Solids.                   215
it  goes.  It is employed in solving the problem, already treated by
Saint-Venant, of a beam, whose length is perpendicular to the plane
of symmetry, held at one end, and at the other acted on by a system
of forces, whose resultant consists of a single force along the axis of
the beam, and of a couple about any line in the terminal section
through its centroid.      The cross-section may be any whatever,
including the case of a hollow beam, provided it be uniform through
out.    The case when the cross-section is elliptical, and the beam
exposed to equilibrating torsional couples over its ends is also treated.
Results are obtained con<U+FB01>rmatory of Saint-Venant’s.           They are also
extended to the case of a composite cylinder, formed of shells of
di<U+FB01>erent materials Whose cross-sections are bounded by concentric
similar and similarly situated ellipses, the law of variation being the
same for all the elastic constants of the solution.      The limiting case
of a continuously varying structure is deduced.
   It is found when a beam is exposed to terminal traction, whether
uniform or not, that the strain consists in part of a shear in the plane
of the cross-section which is proportional to the traction; and the
position of the lines in the cross-section, which being originally at
right angles remain so, is determined. These lines are called principal
axes of traction.   If there are in addition two planes of symmetry
through the axis of the beam, these principal axes are the intersec   ’
tions of the planes of symmetry with the cross-section.
   When a beam of circular section is exposed to torsion, it is proved
that warping will ensue proportional to the moment of the twisting
couple. Only two diameters in the cross-section, and these mutually
at right angles, remain perpendicular to the axis of the beam.       These
are called principal axes of torsion.    If to denote displacement parallel
to the axis of the beam, and r,  ()5denote the undisturbed polar co-ordi
nates of a point in the cross-section, referred to its centre as
origin, and one of these axes as initial line, the law of warping       is
given by—

                                         2   ¢.
   There  is in general no connexion between the positions of the prin
cipal axes of traction and of torsion, as the expressions giving their
inclination to the axes of coordinates contain wholly di<U+FB02>r'erent elastic
constants; but for three-plane symmetry of the kind already men
tioned they coincide. When the material          symmetrical round the
                                                  is
axis .of the beam, the shear and the warping of course are found to
vanish.    It pointed out how by means of these various properties
               is
the nature of the material may be investigated experimentally.
   Part  II treats of a material symmetrical round an axis, that of      z,

posing no bodily forces to act.       The solution involves arbitrary con
 stants, and consists of a series of parts, each composed of a series of
terms involving homogeneous         products of the variables, such as
a“ y'" z"_'_'", where l, m, n are integers, and a is greater than 3.  The
 case n  =   7 is worked out numerically as an illustration.    The terms
involving powers of the variables, the sum of whose indices is less
 than 4, are then obtained by a more elementary process, and these
alone are required in the applications which follow.          These terms
arrange themselves in groups associated with certain constants in the
expression found for the dilatation.
                                                                          "
   The <U+FB01>rst application of the solution is to “ Saint-Venant’s problem
for a beam of elliptical cross-section.       The problem is worked out
Without introducing any assumptions, and a solution obtained, which
is thus directly proved to be the only solution possible if powers of
the variables above the third be neglected.            Certain groups of
associated constants    vanish completely,  and  the  remaining arbitrary
constants express themselves very simply in terms of the terminal
forces, all the constants of one group depending on one only of the
components of the system of forces.
   Part   III  consists of an application of the second portion of the
solution of Part    II to the case of a spheroid, oblate or prolate, and
of any eccentricity, rotating with uniform angular velocity round
its axis of symmetry, oz, which is also the axis of symmetry of the
material.     The surface of the spheroid is supposed free of all forces.
   The terms depending on two only of the groups of associated con
stants suf<U+FB01>ce, along with a particular solution on account of the
existence of what is equivalent to the occurrence of bodily forces, to
satisfy all-the conditions of the problem, and the strains are deter
‘mined explicitly.
  ‘The limiting form of the solution when the polar axis of the
spheroid is supposed to diminish inde<U+FB01>nitely, while the equatorial
remains unchanged, is applied to the case of a thin circular disk
rotating freely about a perpendicular to its plane through its centre.
The solution so obtained is shown to satisfy all the conditions required
for the circular disk, except that it brings in small tangential surface
stresses depending on terms of the order of the thickness of the disk.
According to this solution the disk increases in radius, and diminishes
everywhere in thickness, especially near the axis, so as to become
biconcave. All, originally plane, sections parallel to the faces become
very approximately paraboloids of revolution, the latns rectum of
each varying inversely as the square of the angular Velocity into the
original distance of the section considered from the central section.
   Again, by supposing the ratio of the polar to the equatorial
diameter of the spheroid to become very great, a surface is obtained
which near the central plane, z = O, of the spheroid di<U+FB01>ers very little

from that of a right circular cylinder.   The corresponding form of
the solution obtained for the spheroid, when the ratio of the polar to
the equatorial diameter becomes in<U+FB01>nite, may thus be eXpected to
apply very approximately to the portions of a rotating cylinder not
too near the ends, and thus for a long thin cylinder to be for all
practical purposes satisfactory.   This is veri<U+FB01>ed directly, and it is
shown that this solution is in all respects as approximately true as
that universally accepted for Saint-Venant’s problem. According to
the solution the cylinder shortens, and every cross-section increases
in radius but remains plane. The shortening and the increase in the
radius are, of course, proportional to the square of the angular
velocity.
   Part IV treats of the longitudinal vibrations of a bar of uniform
circular section and of material the same as in Part II. Assuming
strains of the form—

¢(r) is found in terms of y/(r) by               means of the equations established
in Part     II.
             From these equations is deduced a di<U+FB01>erential. equation
of the fourth order for \[r('r), and for this a solution is obtained con
taining only positive integral even powers of 'r. A relation exists
determining all the constants of the                    solution in terms of the co
ef<U+FB01>cients a0 and a2 of r0 and 03. In                    applying this solution to the
problem mentioned, terms containing                     powers of 1- above the 'fourth
are neglected, and it is shown to what                 extent the results obtained are
approximate.      I             _

in these cases between the results of experiment and those of the
accepted theory, even as amended by Lord Rayleigh.          This divergence
will increase rapidly with the order of the harmonic, and though very
small for a long thin bar will increase rapidly as the ratio of the
diameter to the length is increased.       Since in dealing with the condi
tions at the curved surface, terms of the order (a/l)5 were neglected,
the same remarks apply, though to a smaller extent, in the case of the
“ <U+FB01>xed-<U+FB01>xed ” vibrations.
   From the values of u and 10, which are obtained explicitly, it is
shown that the hypothesis made by Lord Rayleigh is true as a <U+FB01>rst,
and only as a <U+FB01>rst, approximation.

 the wire on one side of the junction is heated, no current is obtained,
 but he observed a current in all cases Where there was dyssymmetry.”
 When repeating these experiments,     I   was led to commence a research
 on the effect of occluded gas by the following curious phenomenon.
 Two pieces of platinum wire of 0'9 mm. section, and of 925 mm. length,
 were stretched with weights only just heavy enough to keep them
 straight.  They were placed at right angles to each other, the centres
 being in contact, and the ends bending down into mercury cups (see
 <U+FB01>g. 1). Each wire after being carefully annealed was joined up to a
                                  FIG.  1.
galvanometer, and the absence of currents from strain proved by
heating with a small <U+FB02>ame.       When both wires were found to be
perfectly free, they were brought together in the middle, and one end
of each connected with the galvanometer. On heating the wires near
the point of contact thermo-electric currents were produced, but after
heating the junction of the wires to a bright red for a little time and
allowing it 'to'cool, the currents produced by heating the wires on
either side were opposite in direction to those produced before.    After
resting from Saturday until Monday the change in the wires, produced
by heating the point of contact, was found to have disappeared, and
the currents produced by heating the wires to be the same as at
<U+FB01>rst.
   This naturally suggesting that some kind of temporary change took
place in the (wire, when heated in a Bunsen lamp, and that this might
possibly be produced by the gas absorbed by the platinum at a high
temperature,   I  was induced to commence a series of experiments on
the effect of occluded gases on the electrical properties of bodies.
A piece of platinum wire about 18 inches long was bent in the
middle, and one-half protected by being covered with glass tube and
made water-tight at the lower end.       After annealing the free portion
and testing until perfectly free from all strain effects, it was placed,

After being dried it was tested with a small <U+FB02>ame at distances of
1 cm. along its whole length.         The result was a current from the
free wire towards that part on which hydrogen had been produced,
greatest at the junction of the free wire and the saturated
wrre.

    “Then wires of palladium were used more powerful effects of the
same    kind were produced. Thus when two wires were used as the
electrodes in decomposing acidulated water, dried and gently heated
in contact, a current towards the hydrogen was observed. If heated
by a Bunsen <U+FB02>ame complications arose from the hydrogen in the wire
taking <U+FB01>re. The <U+FB02>ame produced could easily be seen 4 or 5 mm. away
from the Bunsen <U+FB02>ame.
    Carbon rods were next tried.     Gas-carbon was <U+FB01>rst tried, but was I
unable to get two rods su<U+FB02>iciently similar in composition to be of use,
 their own thermo-eleetric currents being large enough to cover all
changes produced by gases.       1 had, however, no dif<U+FB01>culty in getting
rods made for are lamps    to answer my purpose.        They were heated to
 a red heat to expel gases, and the ends were <U+FB01>led <U+FB02>at.
    It was found that when one of these rods was heated and placed
against the other (see <U+FB01>g. 3), the current was always from cold to hot
below 200° 0.
    They were then used as the electrodes in decomposing dilute
 sulphuric acid, dried carefully until no current was produced on placing

 a current was produced from hydrogen to oxygen across the hot
junction.
   The same effect was obtained by decomposing hydrochloric acid
solution, in which case we get chlorine instead of oxygen, and the
current <U+FB02>ows from hydrogen and chlorine.

containing oxygen or chlorine.
   Resistance.—-In the <U+FB01>rst experiments made to try if any change of
resistance took place when wires are saturated with gas, a platinum
wire about a yard in length was formed into a spiral, and each end
soldered to an insulated copper wire. The junctions were covered
with wax, and the wires, carefully insulated with wax, passed through
two holes in a cork into a bottle containing dilute sulphuric acid.
Through the same cork there passed a thermometer and two glass
tubes. The whole was placed in a large vessel of water. After
having saturated the wire with hydrogen, the acid was drawn OE,
and air drawn through for some time. The resistance was found to
increase slightly on testing.
   To get rid of possible error from change of temperature, two wires
of equal length and section were used and balanced against each
other (see <U+FB01>g. 4:).
                                   FIG. 4.
   These were placed in water, and a current passed from the one to
the other, allowed to remain in the acid a little to cool if necessary,
and afterwards removed, dried, and placed in an empty glass vessel
surrounded with a considerable quantity of water.       There they rested
until the temperature became    the  same  as the water. When measured

the resistance of the wire containing the hydrogen was found to have
increased about one-thousandth part. It is not necessary to try the
effect of hydrogen on palladium, as the resistance is known to be
increased considerably by the absorbed gas.
    Carbon.——Two thin rods about 2 mm. diameter were electroplated
at the ends and soldered to insulated copper wires. After protecting
 the plated portion with marine glue, the whole ‘was <U+FB01>xed to a
convenient frame, and placed in dilute sulphuric acid. As was done
in the case of the platinum wires, the rods were balanced against each
                                                                          '
other in order to eliminate changes of temperature, &c.
   When used as the poles of a battery the change of resistance was
considerable, but greater on the rod that had been the positive pole.
 By using a platinum electrode, hydrogen or oxygen was produced
at will upon the same red, the other rod remaining unchanged. It
then appeared that oxygen increased the resistance much more than
hydrogen, rising in some cases as high as nine times; that when
oxygen was liberated twice or thrice in succession, the resistance
increased each time. This continued increase was probably due to
chemical changes produced by the active oxygen. Hydrogen gave an
increase of resistance, not continuing beyond a certain point, and not
becoming greater on repeated charging with the gas.
    Generally also the e<U+FB01>ect of the hydrogen was temporary, disappear
ing, wholly in some cases, partially in others, when short circuited.
    The following series of observations a<U+FB01>ord an example of this :—
    1. When     rod A was charged with oxygen       its
         resistance was   ........................      4'15    ohms.

    Superpositimi. 0f Polarisations.—Part   of the change in the carbon is
evidently produced by the mechanical action of the gases eVOlved,

 and by the chemical action of the oxygen; both of these will, however,
 produce permanent changes.       That only part of the action is to be
 explained in this way is shown by the previous experiments. It is,
 however, further demonstrated by using two carbon rods in decom
 posing acidulated water; after passing the current for one minute,
 reverse it for one-tenth of a second and immediately join up to a
 galvanometer. Ashort but violent de<U+FB02>ection appears for the latter
 contact, gradually falling to zero and passing to the other side, where it
 remains for a considerable time, though with much decreased quantity.
    The   same    thing was obtained with platinum electrodes.         The
 second    contact must be very short, or the former polarisation
 disappears.     I have not yet succeeded in obtaining more than one
 reversal, although I have no doubt that more may be got with very
 thick  electrodes.
    Resistance—Copper and iron absorb hydrogen and silver occludes
 oxygen, but no change in their thermo-electrie properties could be
 detected.     Carbonic oxide is absorbed by iron, and is said to produce
 great changes in its properties.       In this case, however, only the
 resistance was measured.
    A piece of iron wire, about 3 yards in length, was twisted into
 a spiral and placed in a porcelain tube; the ends projecting about
 3 inches, were      connected with one side of a bridge and balanced
 against an equal spiral of the same wire. After exhausting the
 tube about 1 foot of the central portion was heated to a bright red
 ness and then allowed to cool. Next day the resistance was measured,
 and the experiment repeated twice. On the third heating, carbonic
 oxide was allowed to enter the porcelain tube, and readings of the
 resistance taken on cooling as before. This was also repeated.
    This series was again repeated with new wires, and lastly, the wire
_was raised to a bright red in vacuo and allowed to cool, the object
 being to remove the carbonic oxide gas in order that another measure
 ment might be taken after these repeated beatings. The resistance
 fell, clearly proving that part of the previous increase was due to the
 presence of the gas.        N0 measurement of resistance was taken on
 the same day that the wires were heated, but at least 15 hours were
 allowed to elapse.

   These experiments appear to prove that absorbed gases increase
the resistance of conductors, and that hydrogen renders metals more
negative (thermo-electrically) whilst carbon becomes more positive.
   I  have introduced the experiment (<U+FB01>g. 1) which caused this work
to be undertaken, although I do not think that it is entirely caused
by the occlusion of gases, where the best results are'obtained by
electrolysis which produces them in a nascent or more energetic
state.
       Thermo-eleot-ric and other Properties of Graphite and Carbon.
   In making the previous experiments,          I had occasion to place the
heated end of one carbon rod in contact with the cold end of another.
The temperature of the hot end was varied from 30° C. to a red heat,
whilst the cold   end was kept at about 17° C.
   Currents of electricity were of course produced. When the tem
perature of the hotter rod was raised but slightly, the current was
from cold to hot through the point of contact, but when it was raised
to ared heat the current passed from hot to cold; between these
temperatures the direction of the current varied, appearing at <U+FB01>rst
sight to obey no rule, and as nothing was known that would explain
these results,  I was led to examine the matter more carefully.
   There were several di<U+FB02>iculties to be overcome before any satisfac
tory results could be obtained.
   Firstly, it was necessary to get two rods of such pure material, that
they would not produce a current when placed in contact end to end
 and heated, or at any rate weak enough to be neglected in presence
of that produced by the contact of the two rods at different
temperatures.
   I tried several specimens of gas-carbon, but as no two pieces were
found to ful<U+FB01>l the condition before mentioned, they were useless.           ,
I  was more fortunate with the rods prepared for are lamps in electric
lighting, readily <U+FB01>nding two that answered my purpose.
   A small portion of one of them gave on combustion less than one
part of incombustible matter ’in 200 of carbon.          They were heated
repeatedly to a red heat and allowed to cool slowly.       The ends were
<U+FB01>led  <U+FB02>at to  prevent   di<U+FB02>'crence of shape producing  any current.
   WVheu placed in contact end to end and heated, one rod was
slightly positive to the other, but not suf<U+FB01>ciently to prevent the
experiments from succeeding.
   Secondly, the manner of making contact caused the currents to
vary much in strength, and the surface of the heated rod required
<U+FB01>ling at intervals, in order to preserve a clean <U+FB02>at face.
   It was found also that the heat of the hot rod passed so quickly to
the cold one that even after a very short contact the current fell, so
that the rods could be placed together once only and for a very short

time; after which they require to   be brought back to their original
temperature.
   Lastly, to avoid any possible e<U+FB01>ect from the coal-gas, the end to be
heated was inclosed in an iron tube lined with asbestos.
   The temperatures were measured in various ways. In some
experiments an ordinary thermometer was used for temperatures
below 250° C. ; thermo-electric couples of platinum and copper, silver
and copper, were tried, but, although much more tedious, found the                     I
method of platinum wire much less liable to error.
   The wire was given to me by Mr. H. F. Callendar, M.A., and was
from the same piece as that used by him in his experiments on “ The
Practical Measurement of Temperature ” (see ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 178
(1887), p. 161).
   The following equations for this wire were used in determining the
temperature, and are those obtained by Mr. Callendar in his experi
ments :—

number of experiments with various bodies, among which is gas
carbon. The hot junction was 100° C., at which temperature the
de<U+FB02>ection produced by a couple (carbon and copper) was negative,
the same as copper-platinum, but a little larger.           He does not appear
to have worked at higher temperatures (‘ Annales de Chimie,’ vol. 8,
1866, p. 415).
   Knott and MacGregor also worked with gas-carbon, and in 1879
published a paper in the ‘Transactions               of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh,’    vol.   28,  in which    a    line  for  carbon is given.      The

and l-inch bore, closed at one end, was suspended over the junction
and allowed to cool gradually.
   From 230° downwards the line is parallel to that of platinum.
Above 230° it appears somewhat uncertain; they speak of it thus :—
“For a small range of temperature (to 230° C.) it is possible to
express the de<U+FB02>ection in terms of the <U+FB01>rst and second powers of the
temperature, the following formula holding good: 8 = —8'29 +
0'604t + 0'000385152; above 230° C. it does not, perhaps because of
chemical changes, produced by heat. Carbon appears to be an excep
tion to the general law.”        “The above formula and the graphic
treatment enable us at a higher temperature to determine its posi
      ”
tion    (see <U+FB01>g. 8).   The position and slope of the lines are opposite to
those now used.
   Such a result did not appear to agree witlr the experiments
already described, and as I had found gas-carbon a very unsuitable
body for use where two pieces were required having anything like the
same thermo-electric power, it appeared probable that good results
might be got with the other rods ; and as carbon and platinum form
for 230° parallel lines   I  decided to use a couple consisting of these
two bodies.
   Nine series of observations were taken, using three different
methods, of which it will be suf<U+FB01>cient to describe the last.
   Near one end of a carbon rod a hole, about 5 mm. in diameter, was
drilled, and into this the end of a platinum wire was inserted and
<U+FB01>xed by being wedged with a piece of rod carbon.                 The whole was
thoroughly    covered   with   Indian    ink,   which,   when   dry, was again

wires, and they from each other by thin sheet asbestos and mica, by
which means it was insulated from the vessel in which it was placed,

   The colder junction was at 17° C.
   The resistance of the Pt-C couple was found to vary, increasing
to 600°, after which it decreased.             This result being caused by the
increased resistance of the platinum being partly neutralised by the
diminution of the resistance of the carbon, to which must be added
the improved contact obtained by the expansion of the platinum in
the carbon, which is greater than the expansion of the carbon, thence
the pressure increases and the contact improves.
   The numbers were at 220° C. 0'88 ohm, 340° to 500° C. 0'92 ohm,
620° C. 103, 700° C. 100.
   These experiments agree perfectly with the diagram given by
Knott and Macgregor (<U+FB01>g. 8) as far as they carried it experimentally.
When, however, they commence deducing results for higher tempera
tures, our experiments are not in accord; there being no indication
of the carbon line crossing the platinum line, but only a very slight
indication in one of the series of an approach above 230°.
   Assuming the platinum line for our Wire to be the same as that
given in Tait’s diagram (Fleeming             J enkin, p. 178) we get a diagram
for carbon (<U+FB01>g. 8A), in which the line is fairly parallel to 250° 0.,
after which it gradually increases its distance.
  Other Changes 'in the Properties of the Body at the same Temperature.
   This change in the thermo-electric power of carbon is accompanied
by other changes.          The resistance, the expansion, and the speci<U+FB01>c
beat all appear to undergo a corresponding alteration.
   Resistance—Accurate measurements of the resistance of carbon
at high temperatures are very di<U+FB01>icult to obtain, owing to the
changes that take place in the connexions.              It is desirable, if possible,

232             Dr. J. Monckman.       Occluded Gases and      [May 31,
that the whole rod should be exposed to the same temperature.           If
the rods are thick the changes in the contacts, even at ordinary tem
peratures, become great in proportion to the resistance of the rods;
and if thin there“ is great danger of them being changed by the heat.
   We found the method of electroplating with copper very good up
to 500° or 600°, after which it completely broke down, and we were
not able to get any other method to stand. Thus the experiments
were stopped there, although we expected other changes at 800° to
1000°, from the numbers obtained for the speci<U+FB01>c heat by Weber.
    The <U+FB01>rst method tried was that used by H. Muraska (‘Annalen
der Physik und Chemie,’ vol. 13, 1881, p. 310), in which a hole is
drilled in each end of the carbon rod, and after electroplating with
copper, a copper rod is pushed in tight and brazed in.           The ob
jections to this method were : 1st, requires a thick rod ; 2nd, better
contact formed as the temperature rises, tending to produce error in
the same direction as the results of the experiments.
    Second. Forming a contact that would be liquid at all tempera
tures above 100°. This was done by drilling vertical holes near the
ends of the rods, and <U+FB01>lling them with fusible metal.     Required thick
rods, gave way.
    Third. Used thin rods so that the change in contact resistance
might not hear so large a proportion to that of the rod itself. Glass
 vessels shaped as in <U+FB01>g. 11 were prepared, and the rod packed at A
                                  Fm.   11.
 and B with asbestos.     Fusible  metal or solder was melted     into the
 glasses, and the rod protected by a glass tube B.
     Fourth. An attempt was made to form contacts by inserting         the
 thin rod into cavities drilled into thick rods of carbon, and joining
 by Indian ink, sugar and graphite, &c.
     Lastly, the rod was incased in thin sheet asbestos, well coated with
 wet clay between each layer.         The ends were electroplated with
 copper and tinned.       They projected beyond    the asbestos covering
                                   FIG. 12.

to cover this with a glass tube at the portion AA. Out of a large
series of readings we give four.

   This  method cannot lay claim to absolute accuracy, as there is in 5
cases an increase of resistance by the change in the contact of co
with carbon, which appears when the rod cools as in Experimel
This, however, takes place at the higher temperatures, and ten:
decrease the numbers obtained at those temperatures, and a correc
if one could be applied, would only increase the results obtaine
the previous experiments.

   Method.—As we wished to raise the rod to 500° or 600° C., it
impossible to expose the whole rod to that temperature, and at
same time to read the changes of position of a mark or point a
end of it with a microscope; nor did it appear probable that 001
 could be made by rods of other materials.
    It was decided, therefore, to heat the central portion of a
 keeping the end portions cold. We had thus one hot portion
 colder, and two others at a constant temperature.             A rod, 8
 36 inches in length and 1%inch in diameter, was used.          One end
 electroplated and then soldered into a cavity in a brass rod n
 was <U+FB01>rmly clamped to a vertical iron one <U+FB01>xed to a stone table.
 a small hole'in the other end a <U+FB01>ne needle was <U+FB01>xed whose chan
 position was read by a microscope.
    The central portion of the carbon was covered with a thin 00
 of clay, then with paper to consume the oxygen, outside that a
 tube packed with asbestos inside of a porcelain tube.
    Ten inches of the centre of this was heated in a gas furnace.
 temperature was taken with a platinum thermometer (<U+FB01>g. 5)
 giving the temperature of the hottest part, AB and CD those 0
 portions between the hottest and the constantly cold portion.

   EF was 10 inches, AB and CD 7 inches each, total 24 inches.
Outside the rod was kept cool with water.
   In calculating the portion of the expansion due to the parts AB
and CD the numbers obtained in Experiment 4 are used.                                      The

from this is used for the cooler portions AB and CD up to 98°;

                                (Abstract)                                            ..
      In
      a previous paper we showed how the luminosity of diiferent
spectrum colours might be measured, and in the present paper we
give a method of measuring the light of the spectrum re<U+FB02>ected from
coloured bodies such as pigments in terms of the light of the                   i,
spectrum re<U+FB02>ected from a white surface.         To e<U+FB01>ect this the <U+FB01>rst          i'
named of us devised a modi<U+FB01>cation of our previous apparatus.
Nearly in contact with the collimating lens was placed a double image           {1
prism of Iceland spar, by which means two spectra were thrown on
                                                                                 \
the focussing screen of the camera (which was arranged as described
in the Bakerian Lecture for 1886), each formed of the light which
enters the slit. The light was thus identical in both spectra.       The        ,
two spectra were separated by about of an inch when the adjust
                                        i,-
ments were complete.      A slit cut in a card was passed through
this spectrum to isolate any particular portion which might be
required.    The rays coming from the uppermost spectrum were                    0‘
re<U+FB02>ected by means of a small right-angled prism in a direction nearly                 ‘
at right angles to the original direction on to another right-angled
prism. Both prisms were attached to the card.       From this last prism
the rays fell on a lens and formed on a white screen an image of the
face of the spectroscope prism in monochromatic light. The ray of the
same wave-length as that re<U+FB02>ected from the upper spectrum passed
through the lower half of the slit, and falling on another lens
formed another imageof the face of the prism, superposed over
the <U+FB01>rst image.    A rod placed in front of the screen thus cast two
shadows,    one illuminated by monochromatic rays from the top
spectrum, and the other by those from the bottom spectrum.
The illumination     of the two shadows was equalised         by means
of rotating sectors which could be closed and opened at pleasure
during the time of rotation.    The angle to which the sector required
to be opened to establish equality of illumination of the two shadows
gave the ratio of the brightness of the two spectra.       When proper
adjustment    had  been  made  the relative  brightness  was   the same
throughout the entire spectrum.
   To measure the intensity of any ray re<U+FB02>ected from      a   pigment, a
paper was coated with      and placed adjacent to a white surface, and
                           it
it was so arranged that one shadow of the rod fell on the colonred
surface and the other on the white surface.      The illuminations were

238                         Colour Photometry.                  [May 31,
then equalised by the sectors and the relative intensities of the two
re<U+FB02>ected rays calculated. This was repeated throughout the spec
trum.     Vermilion, emerald-green, and French ultramarine were <U+FB01>rst
measured by the above method and then sectors of these colours
prepared, which when rotated gave a grey matching a grey obtained
 by rotation of black and white. The luminosity curves of these three
colours were then calculated and reduced proportionally to the angle
that each sector occupied in the disk. The luminosity curve of the
white was then reduced in a similar manner, and it was found that the
sum of the luminosities of the three colours almost exactly equalled
that of the white.      The same measurements were gone through with
pale-yellow chrome and a French blue, which formed a grey on rota
tion, with like results. It was further found that the sum of the in
tensities of vermilion, blue, and green varied at different parts of the
spectrum, and the line joining them was not parallel to the straight
line which represented white for all colours of the spectrum and
which itself was parallel to the base.      Since a straight line parallel
to the base indicated degraded white, it followed that if the intensity
of the rays of the spectrum were reduced proportionally to the height
of the ordinates above a line tangential to the curved line (which
represented the sum of the intensities of the three colours at the
different parts of the spectrum) and were recombined, a grey should
result. A method was devised of trying this, and the experiment
proved that such was the case. The same plan enabled the colour of
any pigment to be reproduced from the spectrum on the screen.
The combination of colours to form a grey on rotation by a colour
blind person was also tried, and after the curve of luminosity of the
colours had been calculated and reduced according to the amount
required in the disk, it was found that the sum of the areas of the
curves was approximately equal to the white necessary to be added
to a black disk to form a grey of equal intensity as perceived by him.
The spectrum intensity of gaslight in comparison with the electric
light was also measured, and the amount of the different colours
necessary to form a grey in this light was ascertained by experi
ment.
   As  before, it was found that the calculated luminosity of the colours
was equal to the white which combined with black formed a grey of
equal luminosity.
   The question of the coloured light re<U+FB02>ected from di<U+FB01>erent metals
was next considered, and the method of measuring it devised, as was
also the method of measuring absorption spectra.          The luminosity
curves obtained by the old method were compared with those ob
tained by the present method, and so close an agreement between them
was found to exist, as to give a further con<U+FB01>rmation that our former
plan was accurate.        A number of pigments that can be used for

    This paper is conveniently divided into three parts.     In part (i) an
account is given of the effect of <U+FB01>nely divided particles on the rate of
evolution of gases resulting from chemical changes; in part (ii) the
phenomenon of initial acceleration, as also the effect of variation of
pressure on the evolution of gases, is discussed; in part (iii) the case
of the decomposition of formic acid into carbonic oxide and water is
investigated under constant conditions, other than those of the mass
of reacting substances and of temperature.
    Part I.—It is found that the addition of <U+FB01>nelygdivided chemically
inert particles increases the rate of evolution of gases from liquids in
which they are being formed. The effect of these particles on the
following chemical changes is investigated:             the decomposition
of formic acid yielding carbonic oxide; (ii) the decomposition of
ammonium nitrite in aqueous solution yielding nitrogen; (iii) the

    Part II.—It   is observed that, conditions of temperature remaining           5
the same, the rate of evolution of a gas from a liquid is at <U+FB01>rst slow,           a i
then gradually increases until it reaches a maximum and for some                i
time constant rate.      From this point the rate decreases proportionally      t
to the diminution of mass.      Thisis observed in the cases of the decom
position of formic acid, potassium ferrocyanide, and of oxalic acid by                 :
concentrated sulphuric acid, and in that of ammonium nitrate.            It I          i    .
has   previously been observed       in the case of the decomposition of                \
ammonium       nitrite  in  aqueous    solution.  The same phenomenon
repeats  itself when   the  temperature is temporarily lowered and then              \
raised to its former point, and also to a more marked degree when,                  a
temperature remaining the same, the superincumbent pressure is                      a

   Part III.——The case of the decomposition of formic acid
carbonic oxide and water by diluted sulphuric acid is studied \
the aid of an apparatus by means of which the temperature is l
constant within one-twentieth of a degree.   It is shown that the
of evolution of carbonic oxide is expressible by the following ec

t is the interval  of time from the moment of commencement,

end of each observation, and c is a constant.   The results 08.10111!

    Since our last communication on this subject, we have made many
additional observations on the spectrum of magnesium under various
circumstances, and have arrived at some new results.            Speaking
generally, we <U+FB01>nd that diiferences of temperature, such as we get in
the <U+FB02>ame of burning magnesium, in the arc, and in the spark,
produce less di<U+FB01>erences in the spectrum than we had before attri
buted to them.        For instance, the lines which previously we had
obserVed only   in  the spark discharge, we have since found to be deve
loped in the are also, provided the discharge occur between electrodes
of magnesium.“ In making these experiments we used thick electrodes
of magnesium, and brought them together inside glass globe about
                                                           a
6   inches in diameter, <U+FB01>tted with    aplate of quartz in front and <U+FB01>lled
from time to time with various gases.        The are was an instantaneous
<U+FB02>ash which could not be repeated more than twice without rendering
the sides of the vessel opaque with     a complete coating of magnesium.
It was therefore analogous to an explosion of magnesium vapour.
 The strong blue line X4481, two pairs about X3895, 3893, and X3855,
 3848, the strong pair about X2935, 2927, and the two weaker lines of
 the quadruple group, namely, X2789'9 and 2797, all come out in the
 are given by a Siemens’ dynamo between magnesium electrodes in
 air, in nitrogen, and in hydrogen.      We have observed most of them
 also when the arc    is  taken in carbonic acid, in ammonia, in steam,
 in hydrochloric acid, in chlorine, and in oxygen.           The relative
 intensities of these lines, as compared with one another and with the
 other lines of the spectrum, vary considerably under di<U+FB01>erent cir
 cumstances, of which temperature           is doubtless one of the most
 important; but none of the spark lines seem to be absent from the
 arc, and even the blue line X4481, so characteristic of the spark,
 which we never found in the electric are taken between carbon poles
 in a crucible of magnesia even on addition of magnesium,            some is
 times quite     as  strongly  shown   in   the are between magnesium
  electrodes.  There are still several lines of the are which we have
 never observed in the spark, such as the series of triplets         wave pf
 length less than 2770, but their presence may be dependent more on
  the large quantity of incandescent matter in the arc than upon its
  relative temperature.     The observations, however, render doubtful

the correctness of the received opinion that the temperature of the
spark discharge is much higher than that of the arc.     The greater
mass of the incandescent matter in the are my be expected to give
a greater number of lines, because the gradations of temperature
will be less steep than in a smaller mass, and we shall have from
the outer part of the mass the light which is emitted at compara
tively low temperatures, while from the inner part we shall get those
rays which are only produced by the highest temperatures. More
over, compounds which may be dissociated in the interior of the mass
may be re-formed in the outer part, and produce their characteristic
emission or, in some cases, absorption spectra. Heat, however, is not
the only form of energy which may give rise to vibrations, and it is
probable that the energy of the electric discharge, as well as that
due to chemical change, may directly impart to the matter a<U+FB01>ected
vibrations which are more intense than the temperature alone would
produce.
                             The Bands Qf the Oxide.
   The set of seven bands in the green, beginning at about X50064 and
fading towards the violet side of the spectrum, which we have before
attributed to the oxide of magnesium, have been subjected to further
observation, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of our
former conclusion that they are due either to magnesia or to the
chemical action of oxidation.      On repeating our experiments with
the spark of an induction coil between magnesium electrodes in
di<U+FB01>erent gases at atmospheric pressure, we could see no trace of
these bands in hydrogen, nitrogen, or ammonia, whether a Leyden
jar was used or not. Nor could we see them at all in carbonic oxide,
but in this case the brightness of the lines due to the gas might
prevent the bands being seen if they were only feebly developed.       On
the other hand, the bands come out brilliantly when the gas is
oxygen or carbonic acid, both with and without the use of a
Leyden jar. In air and in steam they are less brilliant, but may be
well seen when no jar is used.       When a jar is used they are less
conspicuous,  because in air the lines of nitrogen come out strongly in
the same region, and in steam the F line of hydrogen becomes both
very bright and much expanded!         It seems, therefore, that it is not
the character of the electric discharge, but the nature of the gas
which determines the appearance of the bands; and the absence of
  * Neither the arc of   a Siemens’ dynamo, nor that of a De Meritens’    magneto
electric mhchine, when taken in a crucible of magnesia, shows these bands, even if
metallic magnesium be dropped into it.         A stream of hydrogen led into the
crucible with a view to cool it does not elicit them.  When the arc is taken in the
open air, and metallic magnesium dropped through    it,the bands appear moment
arily, but that  probably the result of the burning of the magnesium vapour out

the bands in the absence of oxygen, and their increased brilliance in
that gas, leave little room for doubt that they are due to the oxide, or
to the process of oxidation.      It may be assumed that at a suf<U+FB01>ciently
high temperature magnesia will be decomposed, but magnesia is a
very stable compound, a great amount of heat is developed in its
formation, and it probably requires a temperature far above that of
burning magnesium for its complete dissociation. This is consistent
with the appearance of the bands in the spectrum of the <U+FB02>ame of the
burning metal, as well as in the condensed spark when the other
conditions are favourable for the formation of the oxide, or for its
stability when formed. In our earlier observations, we obtained in the
visible region nothing but a continuous spectrum from magnesia
heated with the oxyhydrogen blowpipe; neither the b group, nor
X4570, nor the triplet near L appeared, but at the same time X2852
was not only strong, but was strongly reversed.         We now <U+FB01>nd that
this result, so far as it was negative, was a consequence of using too
large a mass of magnesia to be adequately heated by the <U+FB02>ame.           If
the piece of magnesia is very small, such as a fragment of the ash of
burnt magnesium ribbon, most of the spectrum of burning
magnesium      is developed in the <U+FB02>ame for a short distance from
 the piece of magnesia.     It was not very easy to make these experi
 ments successfully.     About 3 inches of magnesium ribbon were
 burnt in air, and the ash carefully heated in the upper part of the
 oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame to render it dense. The thread of magnesia so
  obtained was held horizontally with its end projecting into the oxy
 hydrogen <U+FB02>ame so as to approach the boundary of the inner cone, and
 if the current of gas were not too strong all that was further
 necessary was to move up the thread horizontally as the end was
 worn away.      When the magnesia was placed as described, the whole
 upper part of the <U+FB02>ame was of a <U+FB01>ne azure-blue colour. Under these
 circumstances, the <U+FB02>ame shows the I; group and the magnesium
 hydrogen series close to   it,the bands in the green, the triplet near   L,
 the triplet near M of the <U+FB02>ame of burning magnesium, with the
 group of bands in that region, and the line k2852.       It remarkable
                                                                is
 that the proportions in which the oxygen and hydrogen are mixed
 affect the relative intensities of different parts of the spectrum.    In
 general, both the metallic lines of the     group and the bands of the
                                              b
 oxide are easily seen; but   if the oxygen be in excess the bands of the
 oxide come out with increased brightness, while the        group fades or

its maintenance in the metallic state.            As regards temperature, it
should be observed that while substances merely heated by the <U+FB02>ame,
and not undergoing chemical change, are not likely to rise to a tempe
rature above the average temperature of the <U+FB02>ame, it will be
otherwise with the materials of the <U+FB02>ame itself and other substances
in it which are undergoing chemical change, and have at the instant
of such change the kinetic energy due to the change.
    In a recent communication to the Society, “ Researches on the
 Spectra of Meteorites,” Mr. Lockyer has directly connected the
 appearance in nebulua of these bands, namely, “the magnesium <U+FB02>uting
          " with the
at 500                   temperature of the Bunsen burner (‘ Roy. Soc.
 Proc.,’ vol. 43, p. 133). That the bands are persistent through a large
 range of temperature there is no doubt, but we cannot help thinking
 that Mr. Lockyer is mistaken in supposing them to be produced at
the temperature of a Bunsen burner.            It does not follow because the
bands are seen when magnesium is burnt in a Bunsen burner that the
molecules which emit them are at the temperature of the <U+FB02>ame.                In
the combustion of the magnesium the formation of each molecule of
magnesia is attended with a development of kinetic energy which, if
it all took the form of heat and were all concentrated in the molecule,
must raise its temperature to very nearly the point at which magnesia
is completely dissociated.       The persistence of the molecule of magnesia
when formed will depend upon the dissipation of some of this energy,
and one of the forms in which this dissipation occurs is the very
radiation which produces the bands.            The character of the vibration
depends on the motions of the molecules, which in the case in question
are not derived from the heat of the <U+FB02>ame, but from the stored energy
of'the separated elements, which becomes kinetic when they combine.
The temperature of complete dissociation of magnesia is very far
higher than any temperature which can reasonably be assigned to the
Bunsen burner.
    Nor do the observations we have made on magnesia in the oxy
hydrogen <U+FB02>ame appear to us to be inconsistent with the conclusion
that the spectrum of the oxide is produced only at a high temperature,
as we have a decompoaition of magnesia                by the hydrogen at the
highest    temperature    of the  blowpipe   <U+FB02>ame,   and when hydrogen is in
 excess  little but  the  metallic  lines is visible, because the re-formation
 of magnesia  is,  for the most part, the reversal of the former action, and
 occurs in the cooler part of the <U+FB02>ame by the interchange of oxygen
 between steam and magnesium with scarcely any rise of temperature.
 On the other hand, when the oxygen       is    in excess the reduced magne
 sium carried up into the <U+FB02>ame combines for the most part directly
 with oxygen, and individual molecules thereby acquire a motion of
 far greater intensity than they could derive from the average heat of
the <U+FB02>ame.

    In fact. when chemical     changes are occurring   in a. <U+FB02>ame  it cannot
be taken for granted that the temperatures of the         molecules are all
alike, or that the vibrations which they assume are the result of heat
alone.     On the other hand, the temperature of the metal separated
from magnesia by the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame cannot, we suppose, he at a
temperature higher than that of the hottest part of the <U+FB02>ame. We are
therefore inclined to think that the metallic lines (1)) are manifested at
a lower temperature than the bands of the oxide; and the appearance
of a line in the position of the <U+FB01>rst hand without any trace of the
second band (which is nearly as bright as the <U+FB01>rst), and without any
trace of the b group, is quite su<U+FB02>icient to create a suspicion of mis
taken identity when Mr. Lockyer ascribes the sharp green line in the
spectrum of nebqu to this band of magnesia.           This suspicion will be
strengthened when it is noticed that the line in question is usually in
the nebulae associated with the F line of hydrogen, if it be borne in
 mind that the spark of magnesium in hydrogen does not givethe
bands, and that the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame hardly produces them from
 magnesia when the hydrogen is in excess.
    In Mr. Lockyer’s map of the spectrum of the nebula in Orion
 (loo. cit, p. 1341), he has represented three lines in the position of the
edges of the <U+FB01>rst three of these hands.          If these three lines were
really seen in the nebula, there would be less room to doubt the
 identity of the spectra; but the authorities quoted for the map (loo.
 cit, p. 142) mention only a single line in this position.
    When the <U+FB02>ame of burning magnesium is viewed with a high
 dispersion these bands are resolved into series of <U+FB01>ne, closely set
 lines. Seven such series may be counted, beginning at the approxi
 mate wave-lengt-hs 5006'4, 4995'6, 419854, 4973'6, 4951'6, 4948'6,
 4934'4, respectively.       When a condensed spark is taken between
 magnesium electrodes in oxygen mixed with a little air, the pair of
 strong nitrogen lines may be seen simultaneously with the bands, and
lying within the <U+FB01>rst band, the bright edge of the band being some
 what less refrangihle than the less refrangible of the two nitrogen
 lines.
     When the bands are produced by the spark discharge between
 magnesium electrodes in oxygen or other gas, we have not been able
 to resolve them into lines, but the whole amount of light from the
 spark is small compared with that from the <U+FB02>ame, and besides it is
 possible that the several lines forming the shading may be expanded
 in the spark, and thus obliterate the darker spaces between them.
                      Triplet near M and  adjacent Bands.
     Our former account of the spectrum of the <U+FB02>ame of burning magne
 sium included a description of a triplet near the solar line M, and a
 series of bands extending from it beyond the well-known triplet near

246               Profs. G. D. Liveing and    J. Dewar.        [May 31,
 L. As we had not observed these features in the spectrum of the
spark or arc, and could not trace their connexion with any compound,
we concluded that they were produced by magnesium only at the
comparatively low temperature of the <U+FB02>ame.        We have since found
that they are not produced by the metal at that temperature only, but
are exhibited as strongly, or even more strongly, in the are between
 electrodes of magnesium. In the latter case they appear concurrently
with the line at 448i and other lines which seem to belong to high
temperatures.      We must therefore regard them as not only produced
at the temperature of <U+FB02>ames, but as persistent at temperatures very
much higher.
    The different circumstances under which we have observed this
triplet are as follows :—
    In the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame when a very small piece of magnesia is
held in it. In this case the outer two lines of the triplet are much
stronger than the middle line (X3724 about), which in some of our
photographs does not show at all. It should be noticed that the least
refrangible of the three lines (X3730 about) is in general more diffuse
and not quite so bright as the two more refrangible lines.     Magnesia
in the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame also gives rise to some bands close to and
more refrangible than the triplet, and to another still more refraugible
but less bright triplet, in which the lines are set at nearly equal
distances from each other, with the approximate wave-lengths 36337,
36262, 3620'6.      These additional bands and triplets are not really
absent from the <U+FB02>ame spectrum, for traces of them may be seen in
some of our photographs of the magnesium <U+FB02>ame, but they seem
relatively brighter in the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame with magnesia, and the
longer exposure of the photographic plate in the latter case helped to
bring them out.      They seem to come out more strongly under the
conditions which make both the green bands of the oxide and the
b group show well.
    The triplet near M is also produced when magnesium oxychloride
and when magnesium chloride is substituted for magnesia in the oxy
hydrogen <U+FB02>ame, and in the former case the more refrangible triplet is
developed as well.                                                _
    When carbonic oxide and oxygen are substituted for hydrogen and
oxygen, both triplets are developed in the part of the <U+FB02>ame near the
magnesia, and in this <U+FB02>ame the middle line of the triplet near M
(X3724 about) is as strong as it is in the <U+FB02>ame of burning magne
sium.
    The proper adjustment of the thread of magnesia in this <U+FB02>ame is a
much more delicate matter than in the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame.          In fact,
we made many experiments which were failures before we succeeded
in getting satisfactory results; and latterly, in order to be certain of
success, we had to <U+FB01>ll a gas-holder with a mixture of carbonic oxide

  1888.]       Investigations on the Spectrum            of Magnesium.             247
 and half its volume of oxygen and burn the gases as they issued from
 the holder.
     We have not noticed the more refrangible triplet (X36337 to
 3620'6 about) under other circumstances, but the triplet near M is
 produced when magnesia. is held in the <U+FB02>ame of cyanogen burning in
 oxygen, in the <U+FB02>ash of pyroxylin with which magnesium <U+FB01>lings have
 been mixed, or which has been treated with an alcoholic solution of
 magnesium chloride.
    It is not only very strongly developed, but shows strongly reversed
 on our photographic plates, in the spectrum of the are from a Siemens’
 dynamo taken between electrodes of magnesium in oxygen; and most
 of the accompanying ultra-violet bands of the magnesium <U+FB02>ame
 spectrum are at the same time reversed.                   It is less strongly, but
 distinctly, reversed    in   the  spectrum     of  the   same  are taken in air, in
 carbonic acid gas, and in sulphurous acid gas.                  It appears also if
 the arc is taken in ordinary nitrogen unless great precautions are
 taken to exclude all traces of oxygen or carbonic acid, when it com
 pletely disappears.       It is developed also in the <U+FB02>ash produced when a
 piece of magnesium ribbon is dissipated in air by the discharge through
 it of the current from 50 cells of a storage battery. Also in the
 spark in air at atmospheric pressure between magnesium electrodes
 connected with the secondary wire of an induction coil when the
 alternating current of a De Meritens’ magneto-electric machine is
 passed through the primary.
    In two cases, but only two, we have found this triplet, or what
 looks like one or both of the more refrangible of its lines, developed
 in vacuons tubes. In both tubes the gas was air. One had platinum
 electrodes and a strip of magnesia from burnt magnesium disposed
 along the tube ; the other had fragments of the Dhurmsala meteorite
 attached to the platinum electrodes.             The discharge was that of an
 induction coil worked in the usual way without a Leyden jar.                       In
 each case it is only in one photograph of the spectrum that the lines
in question appear.         In other photographs taken with the same tubes
 they do not show.
    On the other hand, this triplet does not make its appearance in the
 are from a dynamo between magnesium electrodes in hydrogen, coal
 gas, cyanogen,‘ chlorine, hydrochloric acid, or ammonia; nor in the
   ' In taking the arc in this way in cyanogen our photographs show the whole of
the  <U+FB01>ve bands of cyanogen between K and L well reversed.             We have before
noticed (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 33, p. 4) the reversal of the more refrangible three
of these bands against the bright background of the expanded lines of magnesium
when some of that metal was dropped into the are between carbon electrodes, but in
taking the are between magnesium electrodes in an atmosphere of cyanogen the
bright wings of the expanded magnesium lines near L extend beyond the cyanogen
bands, and the whole series of the latter are well reversed—May 23.

in vacuous tubes with magnesium electrodes when the residual gas is
either air, oxygen, hydrogen, carbonic acid gas, or cyanogen. Nor
does it appear, except in the one instance above mentioned, in the glow
discharge in highly rare<U+FB01>ed air in a tube containing either magnesia
or a strip of metallic magnesium.
    A review of all the circumstances under which the triplet near
M and its associated bands appear, and of those under which they
fail to appear, leads pretty conclusively to the inference that they are
due not to merely heated magnesium but to the oxide, or to vibra
tions set up by the process of oxidation.
    With reference to this triplet, Mr. Lockyer (Zoe. cit, p. 122) has
referred to us as his authority for the statement that at the tempera
ture of a Bunsen burner as ordinarily employed the ultra-violet line
_visible is that at 373.   We do not agree to this as a statement of
observed fact, and we cannot imagine how the passage to which
Mr. Lockyer refers (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 32, p. 202) can be sup
posed to warrant it. The <U+FB02>ame we mention in that passage is not
 that of a Bunsen burner but that of burning magnesium, which may
 be very dilferent from the former even when the magnesium is
 burning in the air which is mixed with coal gas in the Bunsen burner.
 Moreover, whatever the temperature of the <U+FB02>ame may be, we have
 never observed the triplet at X3730 unaccompanied by other ultra
 violet lines. In the <U+FB02>ame of burning magnesium, as we state (loo.
 cit, p. 189), “photographs show, besides, the well-known triplet in
 the ultra-violet between the solar lines K and L sharply de<U+FB01>ned, and
 the line for which Cornu has found the wave-length 2850 very much
 expanded and strongly reversed."
    We have expended a vast amount of time and trouble over
 vacuous tubes, and our later experiments do but con<U+FB01>rm the opinion
 which we had previously formed that there is an uncertainty about
 them, their contents and condition, which makes us distrustful of
 conclusions which depend on them.       Photographs of the ultra-violet
 spectra given by such tubes tell tales of impurities as unexpected as
  they are di<U+FB01>icult to avoid. Every tube of hydrogen which we have
 examined exhibits the water spectrum more or less, even if metallic
 sodium has been heated in the tube or the gas dried by prolonged
 contact with phosphoric oxide. Indeed the only tubes which do not
  show the water spectrum have been <U+FB01>lled with gases from anhydrous
  materials contained in a part of the tube itself; and even when tubes
  have been <U+FB01>lled with carbonic acid gas from previously fused sodium
  carbonate and boracic anhydride the water spectrum is hardly ever

absent.      The last traces of the ultra-violet bands of nitrogen are
almost as dif<U+FB01>cult to be rid of with certainty.             Frequently unknown
lines or bands make their appearance, and the same tube will at
different times exhibit wholly different spectra.              This is especially
the case    with  tubes   of  rare<U+FB01>ed   gases  which  oppose much resistance to
the passage of the electric discharge such as oxygen.
     It is no easy matter to prepare tubes for the observation of ultra~
 violet rays to which glass is opaque.             Our plan is to <U+FB01>t a sort of
 stopper of quartz      to  an   “end-on”     tube  (<U+FB01>g. 1). This stopper is a
 slightly conical piece of rock-crystal with the truncated ends of the
 cone ground plane and polished.              It is <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>tted to the tube by
 grinding     and  then    cemented     in with  some vitreous substance more
 fusible than glass.        Formerly we employed sodium metaphosphate
 which answered fairly, but latterly we have used fused silver nitrate
 which is easier to manipulate. In any case it is very dif<U+FB01>cultto prevent
 the tubes cracking under variation of temperature, but if the tube
 does not crack it is as effectually closed in this way as if it were all
 of one piece of glass. It is obvious that nitrogen, oxygen, and silver
 ,might be derived from silver nitrate used as cement and might add
 their spectra to those of the other contents of the tube.               But the
 stopper    does  not lie  in  the  direct course  of the discharge, and we have
 not found that the silver nitrate is in general decomposed.            The pro
 ducts of decomposition would at any rate give well-known spectra.
  The unknown and variable rays we are inclined rather to attribute
  to substances derived from the glass, either products of decomposition
  under the action of the electric discharge, or to matters adherent to
 the surface which become detached under some electric conditions,
  and adhere again when those conditions are changed.                   We have
  photographed the spectrum of one tube which had been <U+FB01>lled
  with oxygen several times and exhausted, and which gave a well
  marked spectrum containing a number of rays unknown to us. After
  a time other photographs of the same tube showed an entirely
  different spectrum, and after a further interval the spectrum was
  found to be again entirely changed, and <U+FB01>nally after a further
  interval the original spectrum reappeared. Changes in the surface
  tension between the glass and some adherent <U+FB01>lm may in this case
  have facilitated the disengagement of the matter of the <U+FB01>lm and its
  after re-adherenee.        Whatever the cause, such changes of the spectra
  are none the less confusing and suggestive of caution in drawing our
  inferences from the phenomena of vacuous tubes.
      The ultra-violet magnesium lines which we have observed in
  vacuous tubes with magnesium electrodes, when the induction coil,
  without jar, is employed, are the triplets at X3837, and the lines
  X2852, 2802, and 2795.           These appear whether the residual gaser
   air, oxygen, hydrogen,       or carbonic acid. When a jar is used we have

250              Profs. G. D. Liveing and   J.  Dewar.         [May 31,
obtained also the triplets at P and S, the pair about X2935 and 2927,
all the quadruple group near X2802 and the quadruple group beyond,
and in one case only, in oxygen, the group near 5, described below,
and the <U+FB02>ame-triplet near M. When no jar is used sometimes only
X2852 is to be seen, sometimes       X2852 and the strong pair near
12802, and sometimes also the triplet near L.      We infer, therefore,
that this is the order of persistency of these lines under the cir
cumstances.
   We have before remarked upon the necessity of avoiding all rubber
connexions in the construction of pumps employed in the exhaustion
of tubes for spectroscopic observation, and we described a modi<U+FB01>cation
of the Sprengel pump which we had constructed for this end (‘ Roy.
Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 30, p. 499). The warnings of unexpected impurities
given by photographs of the ultra-violet spectra of vacuous tubes
have shown the necessity of preventing the contact of the mercury
employed with the dust and moisture of the atmosphere.         Hence we
have used in the experiments described in this paper a mercurial
pump constructed wholly of glass, and in which the same mercury is
used over and over again without being exposed to any un<U+FB01>ltered air.
For this pump we are indebted to the ingenuity and skill in glass
blowing of Mr. Lennox of the Royal Institution. The anne'xed
<U+FB01>gure       represents its construction.  A is a reservoir which com
municates by the tube aa, which ascends vertically some distance in
order to prevent any mercury being driven into the exhausted tube,
through the spiral tube as, with the tube to be exhausted.       B is the
reservoir of mercury, to the bottom of which the tube gee pases
through the sealed joint d. The upper part of B can be put in com
 munication through the three-way cock E, either with the vessel C or
 with the outer air through the tube D which is <U+FB01>lled with calcium
 chloride.   C forms a mercury valve, and at its upper part communi
 cates through the stopcock F with an exhaust pump by which the
 pressure of the gas in C can be quickly reduced to a few millimetres
 of mercury.     When this has been done, the three-way cock E is
 turned so as to cut 05 the communication between B and C and open
 that between B and D. The pressure of the air <U+FB01>ltered through D
 forces the mercury in B up the tube 0 until it <U+FB01>lls A and the whole
 apparatus, as high as the bend e, driving all gas before it through the
       f
 tube and through the mercury valve C, whence it is carried 05 by the
 exhaust. The tube g is very narrow so as to oppose resistance to the
 passage of the mercury whereby A is <U+FB01>lled with mercury as quickly
 as g. As soon as the last bubble of gas has been driven out of f, the
 three-way cock E is turned so as to shut the communication with D
 and open that between B and C. As the pressure of the air on the
 surface of the mercury in B diminishes the mercury falls both in A
 and in f, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above it, and, as soon as it

1888.]         Investigations on the Spectrum   of Magnesium.             251
has fallen  below the end of the tube a, the gas in the tube to be ex
hausted expands into A. The same process is then gone through
again and again, whereby the whole gaseous contents of A are each
time removed, and if the volume of A be large compared with that
of the tube to be exhausted, the pressure of the gas in the latter is
very quickly reduced. The bends bbb retain a, little mercury when A
is exhausted, and prevent any diffusion from 0 into A, and from   intof
0.  Each time the mercury <U+FB01>lls the apparatus a small quantity <U+FB02>ows
over into C, but when it has risen above the opening of the tube
connecting C and B, it passes back into B, when the cock E is turned
so as to open the communication between C and B.

252           Investigations on the Spectrum   of Magnesium.   [May 31,
                                 Group near 8.
    In their list of lines in the spectrum bf magnesium (‘ Phil. Trans.,’
1884,   p. 95)    Messrs.  Hartley   and Adeney have given two lines,
X30716      and  130460,   which  we  had not heretofore observed either
in the spectrum of the <U+FB02>ame, are, or spark of magnesium; but in our
recent observations we have noticed in many cases a well-marked line
which, by interpolation between neighbouring iron lines, appears to
have a wave-length about 3073'5, and a pair of narrow bands sharply
de<U+FB01>ned on their less refrangible sides at wave—lengths about 3050'6
and 30467, and fading away on their more refrangible sides.
    We have little doubt that the lines we have observed are identical
with those given by Messrs. Hartley and Adeney, notwithstanding
that there is a much greater discrepancy between the wave-lengths
assigned by them and by us than there is between the wave-lengths
we have respectively found for the iron lines in the same neighbour
hood.
   We    have   noticed the occurrence of this group in the spectrum of
the are   from   a Siemens’ dynamo between magnesium electrodes in a
variety   of  gases, in all in fact in which we have examined the are,
except in sulphurous acid gas which is opaque to rays of this re
frangibility. Also in the are from a De Meritens’ magneto-electric
machine between magnesium electrodes in air, in the <U+FB02>ash of a mag
nesium ribbon dissipated by the discharge of a storage battery, in the
spark of an induction coil worked in the usual way in air and in
hydrOgen at atmospheric pressure, and in one instance in the spectrum
of an oxygen vacuons tube with magnesium electrodes when a Leyden
jar was connected with the secondary wire of the induction coil.
    On the other hand, we do not see this group in the spectrum of
other vacuous tubes with magnesium electrodes or with magnesia in
the tube, nor in the spark from an induction coil in air or hydrogen
at atmospheric pressure when the coil is worked with a De Meritens’
machine on the primary wire,nor in the <U+FB02>ame of burning magnesium,
 nor in the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame with magnesia or magnesium chloride,
 nor in the are between carbon electrodes in a crucible of magnesia.
    The circumstances under which this group is seen and is not seen,
 do not seem to indicate that its emission is connected with any par
 ticular temperatures so much as with the character of the electric
 discharge, and perhaps also with the density of the magnesium
 vapour.

     The theory to account for the coagulation of the blood which is
 most generally accepted at the present day is that of Hammarsten;
 he teaches that coagulation is dependent upon the conversion of a
 proteid substance, <U+FB01>brinogen, which exists in solution in the plasma,
 into <U+FB01>brin by means of a ferment liberated by the disintegration of
 the white blood corpuscles which occurs when the blood leaves the
 living blood-vessels.          This theory has replaced the older one of Al.
 Schmidt, who taught that <U+FB01>brin is formed by the union of two <U+FB01>brin
 generators, one of which is the <U+FB01>brinogen just mentioned, and the
other of which he called <U+FB01>brinoplastic substance or paraglobnlin ; this
 union, moreover, occurs under the in<U+FB02>uence of a third factor, the
<U+FB01>brin ferment.“ Hammarsteu'f showed that paraglobulin, or as it is
now more generally called serum globulin, is not necessary for the
formation of <U+FB01>brin.
    The present research was directed to determining the nature of the
ferment that produces this change in <U+FB01>brinogen.                 The result at which
I  have arrived     is suf<U+FB01>ciently de<U+FB01>nite      to  warrant a preliminary statement
of the facts observed; the             full details  of the experiments, as well as
those of certain others which are at present in progress, will be
reserved for a later communication.

for their object   a separation and recognition of the various proteids
contained in lymph cells.       An animal (generally a cat) was chloro
formed and killed by bleeding from the carotids; the thorax was
quickly opened, and a cannula inserted in the aorta; a stream of salt
solution      per cent.) at considerable pressure was passed through the
               (:2-
vessels by this means, in about      minute the large veins entering the
                                              a
heart were opened and the mixture of blood and saline solution
allowed to escape. When the <U+FB02>uid came through perfectly colourless,
the abdominal glands were removed, freed from their capsules, cut
into small pieces, and ground up in      mortar with saline solution; any
                                                  a
portions of the gland capsules which still remained were removed, and
the <U+FB02>uid with the cells suspended in      was poured into test-tubes, the
                                                  it
cells settled, and the process of settling was hastened by centrifuge.
lising, the supernatant liquid was poured OE, and the cells again
washed with saline solution in the same way.         By this method the
cells were quickly freed from any lymph that might still have been in
contact with them.
    Microscopical examination showed that they still possessed their
normal appearances, except for a small amount of shrinkage.            The
supernatant saline liquid was found to contain in small quantities the
proteids which were afterwards found in the cells,        certain amount
                                                                  a
of their proteid constituents having thus entered into solution.
    The liquid which was found best for dissolving the proteids of the
lymph cells thus obtained was prepared by mixing a saturated solution
of magnesium sulphate with nine times its volume of distilled water;
and the proteids present in such an extract were as follows :—
     1.A mucin-like proteid similar to that described by Miescher“ in
pus which swells up into a jelly-like substance when mixed with solu
tions of sodium chloride or magnesium sulphate.
       Two globulins.
     3. 2.
       An albumin.
    It will be convenient to take these proteids one by one, and describe
the chief properties of each.
     1.The Mucin-Zike Proteid.—If the cells are extracted with          per       a   5
cent. sodium chloride or magnesium sulphate solution, the result                          is
                                                                                           a
 slimy mass, resembling mucus in appearance.          The proteid which
causes this appearance may be obtained pure by pouring this mixture
into a large excess of distilled water; this peculiar proteid then
extends in cohesive strings throughout the water, which in time con
tract and <U+FB02>oat on the top, and may be then thoroughly washed With
distilled water. The following are its chief properties;          insoluble
                                                                        it   is
in water, slightly soluble in     per cent. saline solution, as shown by
                                         it
of   a committee    appointed by the British Association to investigate the physiolog          of
the lymphatic         systemBrit. Assoc. Rep,’ 1887, p. 145).

the fact that such a solution becomes slimy when the proportion of
salt is increased to 5 per cent.     It is also slightly soluble in the sodium
sulphate   solution  used.    When    this proteid is suspended in water or
salt solution the mucus-like strings shrink at about 50° 0., and can be
easily <U+FB01>ltered off. In the case of sodium sulphate extracts of the
glands, it is apparently carried down with the globulin that coagulates
at that temperature. Saturation with neutral salts, sodium chloride,
magnesium sulphate, and especially ammonium sulphate, causes also
shrinkage of the swollen masses, and renders <U+FB01>ltration easier.                 It is
precipitable by    absolute  alcohol,  basic   lead  acetate,   and by  solution  of
tannin.    It is precipitated by   acetic  acid   in  strings like mucin; like
mucin also it is soluble in baryta or lime-water, from which solution
it is again precipitable by acetic acid, and only soluble in considerable
excess of that reagent.
   This substance, however, is not mucin, as prolonged boiling with
sulphuric acid does not cause it to yield any reducing sugar. It is
also not nuclein of which the cell nuclei are made up, as the nuclei
are not attacked by such reagents as 4} per cent. sodium chloride in
which this substance is slightly soluble. It, however, like uuclein,
yields an ash which is rich in phosphorus; it dissolves in 0"2 per cent.
hydrochloric acid, and on adding pepsin to this solution an insoluble
residue rich in phosphorus separates out. Otherwise this substance
has the nature of a globulin, but one which is much more readily
precipitated by neutral salts than most globulins are ; a proportion of
5 per cent. of sodium chloride for instance in its solutions rendering
it insoluble; but the precipitate so produced is not of the usual <U+FB01>ne
<U+FB02>occulent character, but a slimy mucus-like one.               In all these points
this proteid resembles in its characters a class of proteids which have
been recently named “nucleo-albumins"              by Hammarsten.‘          He has
separated these    mucin-like   globulins   from    the  bile,  and from   synovial
<U+FB02>uid where they have long been mistaken for mucin, and from the
cells of the submaxillary gland, which contain, hOWever, true mucin
in addition.
   2. The Globulins.-—There is a small quantity of a globulin which
enters into the condition of a heat coagulum at about 50° C.                    The
most abundant globulin             however, one which resembles serum
                                        is,
globulin in its heat coagulation temperature (75° C.), and in the way
in which    it   precipitated by saturation with salts, or by dialysing out
                 is
the salts from its solutions.
   The term serum globulin'is hardly applicable to                proteid existing
                                                                      a
in lymph cells; hence         itnecessary
                                   is        to  multiply    terms,  and to desig~
uate this globulin by     a. new  name, viz., cell globulin.         It has, more
over, certain characteristic properties which will be fully dealt with
later on.

     3. The Albumin   resembles serumv albumin in its properties.    It
coagulates at  73° C.    It is present in very small quantities. It may
be provisionally termed cell albumin.
    In concluding this account of the proteids of lymph cells, may          I
 add that no substance like myosin or <U+FB01>brin can be obtained from the
 cells; there     is,
                   however,   a formation of sarkolactic acid after death as
 in muscle; and       the glands be left, especially at the temperature of
                        if
 the body, for some hours after death,       a  process of self-digestion takes
 place, the pepsin   present  in  the  glands as it   isin most tissues (Briicke)
 becoming active when      the   reaction  of the  tissue  becomes acid; under
 these circumstances there         is  in addition to the proteids already
 enumerated    a  small and varying amount of albumoses and peptones.
    Having thus recognised the various proteids that occur in the cells
of lymphatic glands, my next endeavour was to ascertain what action,
if  any, these exerted on the coagulation of the blood. My experi
ments in this direction have been mostly performed with salted plasma.
The blood    is received into an approximately equal volume of saturated
sodium sulphate solution. By this means coagulation                  isprevented,
and the corpuscles settle.       On subsequently removing the supernatant
salted plasma, and diluting       itwith four or <U+FB01>ve times its bulk of water,
coagulation    occurs  after   the  lapse  usually of several hours; but if,
instead of   water,   a  solution of <U+FB01>brin ferment be used, coagulation
occurs in  a  few minutes.
I     <U+FB01>rst tried to prepare <U+FB01>brin ferment from the lymphatic glands;
these were freed from blood, chopped small, and placed under absolute
alcohol for some months; they Were then dried over sulphuric acid,
powdered, and the dry powder extracted with water. The water was
found to contain the <U+FB01>brin ferment. It hastened very considerably the
coagulation of salted plasma.         This activity was destroyed at a tem
perature between 741° C. and 80° C. The watery extract gave, more
over, the xanthoproteio reaction        ;   it contained also some sodium
chloride and phosphates which           it  had dissolved out of the dried
glands.
   A watery or saline extract of fresh glands also had very considerable
clotting powers     that;* to say, the addition of
                             is                       few drops of such
                                                            a
an extract caused diluted salted plasma to clot in         few minutes,
                                                                a
which otherwise did not clot until after the lapse of 12—241 hours.
The activity of this extract was not altered by heating to 70°;      was    it
therefore independent of the nucleo-albumin which          disintegrated
                                                                is
at about 50° 0., or of the globulin which coagulates at that tem
perature. Its activity was destroyed, however,       heated above 75° C.
                                                           if
These facts show that the extracts of both dried and fresh glands
contain  asubstance which has the same properties as <U+FB01>brin ferment,
' I    <U+FB01>nd that this fact has been previously    noted by   Rauschenbach,   ‘Inaug.
Dissert,’ Dorpat, 1882, p. 26.

   and which, moreover, is rendered inactive at the temperature at
   which <U+FB01>brin ferment, as ordinarily prepared from serum, loses its
  activity.
      The next question which       I  investigated was whether the ferment
  action was dependent upon, or independent of, the presence of the
  proteids of the cells.      An extract of the cells was made with sodium
  sulphate solution, and saturated with ammonium sulphate; the pre
  cipitate of the proteids so produced was <U+FB01>ltered off ; the proteid-free
  <U+FB01>ltrate dialysed till free from excess of salt,‘ and it was then found
  to have no power of hastening coagulation.               The precipitate which
  contained all the proteids was washed by saturated solution of ammo
  nium sulphate, and redissolved by adding distilled water (Solution A);
  this solution hastened the coagulation of salted plasma very con
  siderably.      This experiment showed either that the ferment was
  identical with or precipitated with the proteids in the extract.               It
  was, moreover, destroyed at a temperature at which these proteids
  were coagulated, viz., about 75° C.; there are, however, in Solution A
  two proteids which are coagulated at about this temperature, viz.,
  the cell globulin and the cell albumin.             These were separated by
  saturating the solution with magnesium’ sulphate ; the globulin was
  precipitated, washed, and redissolved by adding water (Solution B).
  The <U+FB01>ltrate from this precipitate was dialysed till free from salt
  (Solution C). Solution B was dialysed until nearly free from salt,
  but not suf<U+FB01>ciently free to cause precipitation of the globulin ; it was
  divided into two equal parts, B’ and B”; B’ underwent no further
  treatment. B” was dialysed till the globulin was precipitated; the
  globulin was then <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with distilled water, the pre
  cipitate dissolved in 0‘3 per cent. sodium chloride solution (Solu
 tion D). The solution B" minus the globulin precipitated by dialysis
 still contained a small quantity of globulin; this may he called
 Solution E.
     The in<U+FB02>uence of each of these solutions on dilute salted plasma was
 then investigated.       The results may be summarised as follows :—
      Solution 0' (containing only cell albumin) did not hasten the coagu
 lation of salted plasma, but in some cases even caused delay.
     Solution B’ (containing only cell globulin) hastened very considera
bly the coagulation of such plasma.
     Solution E (containing very little cell globulin) hastened the coagu
lation to a slight extent.
     Solution D (containing the cell globulin precipitated from Solu
tion B by dialysis) hastened the coagulation considerably.
     These experiments show that it is not the albumin but the globulin
    .  This experiment, and the others in which dialysis was employed, were carried
Out in the cold winter months, and thyme] was always added to prevent putre

which     has the properties of <U+FB01>brin ferment.        It might be urged that
the ferment is not identical with the globulin, but is only closely
 associated with it. Such an objection seems to me to be a mere splitting
of hairs. If the ferment is so closely associated with the globulin
that none of the methods used of preparing the globulin pure are
capable of separating it from the ferment, and                 if,moreover,    the
 activity   of  the  ferment  is  destroyed  when   the  distinctive   characters
 of the globulin are destroyed, as by heating to 75° C., then we are not
justi<U+FB01>ed in saying that the globulin          is different from the ferment,
until some method       is shown by which they may be separated.
   After   I   had performed the experiments just related, the question
naturally arose,   is   this cell globulin the same thing as what has been
termed <U+FB01>brin ferment when prepared from serum              P   The experiments
that  I   performed in attempting to <U+FB01>nd an answer to this question
were as follows :—
   A large quantity of cat’s serum was taken, and to                  was added
                                                                     it
10 to 15 times its volume of absolute alcohol.           The resulting precipi
tate was allowed to stand under the alcohol for about three months                  ;
the alcohol was then <U+FB01>ltered off, and the precipitate dried over sul~
phuric acid and powdered. 'On extracting this powder with water.
especially with warm water, a very active preparation of <U+FB01>brin ferment
 was obtained.      Like all preparations of the <U+FB01>brin ferment,          gave the
                                                                          it
xanthoproteic      reaction, but  suf<U+FB01>cient proteid  was  not  present  to  enable
one to identify it. The extract      was  therefore  concentrated    at 410° C.;    it
was then found to contain         aproteid which was coagulated by heat at
 75° C. It was precipitated by dialysing out the salts from its solutions,
and   it was also precipitated by saturation with magnesium sulphate                ;"
the precipitate produced by magnesium sulphate was collected, washed
with    saturated solution of magnesium sulphate, and redissolved by
         a
the addition of water, the      adherent salt rendering       soluble. This
                                                               it
solution has very marked ferment properties;           hastened the coagu

                             it
it  also hastened the coagulation of pure plasma obtained from the
jugular vein of the horse.           This last-mentioned experiment        of  is
especial  importance,  as  here  the  plasma  was unmixed   with any foreign
substance.     The jugular vein of      a  horse was removed after being
ligatured in two places to prevent the. blood escaping; the “living
test-tube” was suspended in a cold place over night, and in the
morning the corpuscles had subsided; the plasma above these was
almost free from corpuscles; and when removed from top of the vein

 the ferment globulin had been added coagulated in about two
 minutes.
    The question will be asked, how is it if the ferment is a globulin it
 can be extracted by means of distilled water from the ferment powder ?
 The answer to that question is that the water is enabled to dissolve
 the globulin by a. portion of the salts, especially sodium chloride, in
 the ferment powder entering into solution at the same time. That
 this is the correct answer was shown by the following experiment :—
 A quantity of the ferment powder was subjected to prolonged washing
 with warm (40° C.) distilled water; it was then suspended in water,
 and dialysed for three weeks, thymol being added to prevent decom
 position.    At the end of this time it was dried over sulphuric acid;
 it was then found that warm water was able to extract only the
 faintest trace of proteid from the powder, and that this extract had
 little or no ferment action, while an extract of the same powder with
 a 0‘3 per cent. sodium chloride solution contained much more proteid
 and had powerful ferment properties.
     Serum globulin prepared from sheep’s and horse’s serum by re
 peated precipitation with magnesium sulphate, and <U+FB01>nally by dialysis,
 was found to possess powerful ferment properties; this entirely con
 <U+FB01>rms Al. Schmidt’s statement that he has been unable to prepare
from serum “<U+FB01>brinoplastic substance” free from ferment)                  This is
 easily explained when one considers that serum globulin as prepared
from serum contains a certain admixture of cell globulin derived from
 the disintegration of white blood corpuscles; and this is precipitated
 with the globulin which pre-existed in the blood plasma.          On the other
 hand, serum globulin prepared from a liquid like hydrocele <U+FB02>uid which
 does not coagulate spontaneously, has no such ferment properties.
This con<U+FB01>rms Hammarsten’s statement that he has obtained from
hydrocele <U+FB02>uid a pure paraglobulin free from ferment, and which
exerted no <U+FB01>brinoplastic activity.
    I will here quote a typical experiment which brings out the <U+FB01>brino
plastic properties of globulin prepared from serum, and the absence
of such properties in the globulin prepared from hydrocele <U+FB02>uid :—
    Ox sodium sulphate plasma was diluted with four times its volume
of liquid in each of the succeeding experiments; the diluted plasma
 was then divided into two parts, one part was kept at the temperature
of the air (141° 0.), the other at the temperature of 40° C. in an incu
bator.
    Thus the plasma which was diluted with a saline solution of globulin
from hydrocele <U+FB02>uid, coagulated at approximately the same time as
that in which the saline solution alone was employed as the diluent,
   'I   have also con<U+FB01>rmed  Schmidt’s statement that serum globulin (Schmidt’s
<U+FB01>brinoplastic  substance) which is precipitated by a stream of carbonic acid, has
ferment properties.

  difference in the action of the serum globulin as derived from these
  two sources   isperfectly clear in the light of the foregoing researches
  in the ferment powers of cell globulin.
     The serum globulin from hydrocele <U+FB02>uid contains no ferment,
 because  it contains pure serum globulin and no cell globulin.
     The serum globulin obtained from serum contains in addition to
 the serum globulin that existed in the blood plasma, a certain quantity
 of cell globulin formed by the disintegration of white corpuscles.
    Both Schmidt and Hammarsten have recognised the fact that the
 amount of globulin in the serum was greater than in the plasma, and
 that this extra amount was derived from the white blood corpuscles.
 The object of this paper      to point out that this extra globulin derived
                                 is
 from the white corpuscles         in reality <U+FB01>brin ferment.

 mention that examination of the ash of this substance shows that                                   it
contains no phosphorus.
    Preparations of serum from which the globulin had been removed
by saturation with magnesium sulphate, and the excess of salt by
dialysis, were found to have no ferment activity at all.             Schmidt
 found that serum minus its globulin (precipitated by a stream of car
bonic anhydride) has very little ferment activity; the explanation of
its still possessing any     that carbonic acid does not completely pre
                                is
cipitate the globulin.     When, however, the globulin
                                                                                 is is

removed by magnesium sulphate, all ferment activity              completely
removed also.
    An extract of “washed blood clot” was found by Buchanan‘ to
hasten the formation of <U+FB01>brin.        Gamgce<U+FB01> on repeating Buchanan’s
experiments, concluded that the substance in saline extracts of <U+FB01>brin
which had the powers of <U+FB01>brin ferment was a globulin; and this view
entirely coincides with the conclusions         have arrived at.
                                                        I           In a few

 the properties of <U+FB01>brin ferment, which coagulates              at 75° C., and agrees
 in all other particulars with the      substance     I  have named cell globulin.
 It  is derived doubtless from the white corpuscles entangled in the
 clot. Lea and Green,‘ who repeated Gamgee’s experiments, came to
 somewhat opposite conclusions; they, however, never obtained the
 ferment free from proteid, but they concluded it was not a globulin
 as it was soluble in distilled water; they admitted, however, that it
 was much more soluble in saline solutions; reading these experiments
 in the light of a more recent paper by one of them,T it is evident that
 they were dealing in large measure with calcium sulphate, a salt
 which has considerable powers of aiding the activity of the <U+FB01>brin
 ferment.
    The <U+FB01>nal conclusions that are to be drawn from these researches
 are as follows :—
    1. Lymph cells yield as one of' their disintegration products a glo
bulin which may be called cell globulin. This has the properties that
 have hitherto been ascribed to <U+FB01>brin ferment.
    2. Fibrin ferment as extracted from the dried alcoholic precipitate
of blood serum is found on concentration to be a globulin with the
properties of cell globulin.
    3. The <U+FB01>brin ferment as extracted by saline solutions from “washed
             ”
blood clot is a globulin which is also identical with cell globulin.
    4. Serum globulin as prepared          from hydrocele <U+FB02>uid has no <U+FB01>brino
plastic properties.       It may perhaps better be termed plasma glo
bulin.
    5. Serum globulin as prepared from serum has marked <U+FB01>brinoplastic
properties.     This is because it consists of plasma globulin, and cell
globulin derived from the disintegration of white blood corpuscles,
 which are in origin lymph cells.
    6. The cause of the coagulation of the blood is primarily the dis
integration of the white blood corpuscles; they liberate cell globulin
which acts as a ferment converting <U+FB01>brinogen into <U+FB01>brin.                       It does
not apparently become a constituent part of the <U+FB01>brin formed.
    This con<U+FB01>rmation and ampli<U+FB01>cation of Hammarsten’s views con
cerning the cause of the coagulation of the blood is in direct opposi
tion to the theories of Wooldridge.           My methods have not been the
same as those adopted by Wooldridge,            but the <U+FB01>nal conclusions are so
di<U+FB01>erent,    that it is necessary I should state my reasons for not
accepting his views, nor adopting his methods. \Vooldridge’s theory
may be stated as follows:I—The coagulation of the blood is a phe
nomenon essentially similar to crystallisation;               in the plasma there
are three constituents concerned in coagulation, A, B, and C <U+FB01>brinogen.

A and B <U+FB01>brinogen           are compounds of lecithin and protcid, and <U+FB01>brin
results from the transference of the lecithin from A <U+FB01>brinogen to B
<U+FB01>brinogen.          C <U+FB01>brinogen is what has hitherto been called <U+FB01>brinogen;
A     <U+FB01>brinogen is a substance which may be precipitated by cooling
“
   peptone plasma,” and on the removal of this substance coagulation
occurs with great di<U+FB01>iculty.‘ The precipitate produced by cold con
sists of rounded bodies resembling the blood-plates in appearance.
He further found that other compounds of lecithin and proteid to
 which he has extended the name of <U+FB01>brinogen exist in the testis,
thymus, and other organs, in the <U+FB02>uid of lymph glands, and in the
stromata of red corpuscles; these substances may be extracted from
the organs by water, and precipitated from the aqueous extract by
acetic acid, and on redissolviug this in a saline solution, and injecting
it into the circulation of a living animal, intravascular clotting occurs
which results in the death of the animal.                 This form of <U+FB01>brinogen (?)
that acts thus he looks upon as the precursor of A <U+FB01>brinogen. From
these points of view the <U+FB01>brin ferment and the white corpuscles are
looked upon as of secondary import in causing coagulation, though it
is admitted that <U+FB01>brin ferment converts C <U+FB01>brinogen into <U+FB01>brin.
    In a more recent paper' these <U+FB01>brinogens are somewhat dilferently
lettered; B <U+FB01>brinogen seems to have disappeared, and C <U+FB01>brinogen
now receives that name.
     I have been carefully through all Wooldridge’s papers, and have            I
 by examination of the statements made therein, and by a few test
 experiments of my own, come to the conclusion that the theory is
untenable;        I  will take up the chief facts upon which the theory
rests, one by one.
    1.   The   Ia<U+FB02>uence. of Lecithin         in   the   Coagulation of   the  Blood.—
 Lecithin     hastens the coagulation of blood-plasma, which has been pre
vented from clotting by the injection into the circulation of a certain
quantity of commercial peptonesl'                 The term “ peptone plasma ” is a
 convenient one to retain, though it must be remembered that it is
 not the peptone in it that has the action in question, but the albu
 moses, and especially heteroalbumose.1                  VVooIdridge§ also found by
 receiving the blood of a dog into a thick emulsion of lecithin coagu
 lation occurred more quickly than when it was received into a corre
 sponding quantity of saline solution.
     It is upon these experiments that the theory that lecithin is the
 essential cause of the coagulation depends.                I am very little inclined

    I  Pollitzer, ‘Journ. of Physiol.,’ vol. 7, p. 289. Pollitzer also found that these
 proteids also delayed the coagulation of blood after it was shed.    I have found them
 to cause a similar delay in the clotting of dilute salted plasma.

to place reliance on the experiments on dog's blood just quoted, as he
<U+FB01>nds it necessary to use an emulsion as thick as milk to produce the
eifect, and it is well known that contact with any foreign matter, espe
cially if it is <U+FB01>nely divided, will hasten coagulation, and it cannot be
supposed that suf<U+FB01>cient lecithin is normally concerned in forming <U+FB01>brin
as to cause athick emulsion like this.       Moreover, addition of lecithin
does   not  cause  the clotting of pericardial <U+FB02>uid, of hydrocele <U+FB02>uid, of
solutions of <U+FB01>brinogen,‘ of dilute salted plasmad' and I am not aware
that it has been tried on pure plasma obtained by the living test-tube
experiment.       It then simply hastens the coagulation of peptone
plasma,    and  peptone plasma, as I shall show more fully in the next
section, di<U+FB01>ers so much from normal plasma, that it is impossible
to draw correct conclusions from experiments performed with it,
unless they be supported by con<U+FB01>rmatory evidence on solutions of
<U+FB01>brinogen and pure plasma, such as one obtains from a vein, or from
the pericardial sac.
    The solutions of lecithin used were admittedly impure; and it is
possible that there was present a certain amount of calcium sulphate,
even if there was no <U+FB01>brin ferment.       But supposing it was the
 lecithin and not the impurities that hastened the coagulation in
question,  it must be remembered      that many other organic and
inorganic substances act similarly; thus Nauck§ has shown that
small quantities of glycin, uric acid, &c., as well as lecithin hasten
coagulation, and Green" that calcium sulphate does so also. kBut it is
not concluded from these observations that these are the chief agents
in bringing about the coagulation of the blood.     I have found that
cell globulin contains no phosphorus, and Wooldridge admits<U+FB01>l that
Schmidt’s ferment is free from lecithin.     On the very same page.
however, he accounts for the loss of the activity of <U+FB01>brin ferment,
which was observed to take place by Hammarsten when it was kept
long under alcohol, as being due to removal of lecithin.M
                                       ”
    The supposition that “ <U+FB01>brinogen A acts by giving up its lecithin
to “<U+FB01>brinogen B" to form <U+FB01>brin, seems, therefore, to be a pure
assumption, and so far as I can <U+FB01>nd is unsupported by any analytical
evidence.   Wooldridge has certainly shown that the <U+FB01>brinogens (?) he
obtains from tissues contain phosphorus, but to this point I shall
return later.

    2. The Precipitate produced by cooling Peptone Plasma (Wooldridge's
 <U+FB01>brinogen A).—The occurrence of this precipitate is evidently
 regarded by Wooldridge as one of the most important facts upon
 which his theory is founded. Here, again, I am willing to concede
 the fact observed, but differ from Wooldridge with regard to its
 interpretation.   The chief point I wish to urge is that this precipitate
 is obtained  on cooling peptone plasma only, and from no other form of
 plasma. I have repeatedly attempted to obtain such a precipitate by
 cooling to 0°C. pure plasma from the veins of the horse,“I salted plasma,
prepared by mixing blood with various proportions of di<U+FB02>r'erent salt-s,
hydrocele <U+FB02>uid, and perioardial <U+FB02>uid, but in all cases with a negative
result.   It, therefore, occurs in peptone plasma alone; and that it is
due to the peptone is supported by the fact that if one takes an aqueous
solution of “ Witte’s peptone” and cools it to 0° C., a precipitate is
formed consisting of rounded granules, which were mistaken under
 the microscope by several friends in the laboratory for blood-tablets.
I, moreover, found that this precipitate consists of heteroalbumose,
and when that substance (which as Neumeistert has shown is more
soluble in water than has been hitherto supposed) has been removed
 by dialysis and <U+FB01>ltration, the remaining albumoses and peptones are
 not precipitated by cold. The precipitate of heteroalbumose, which
 is obtained by dialysis of saline solutions of “ Witte’s peptone,” also
 consists of similar rounded granules.
    Peptone plasma, it may be said, does not contain peptono or
                                                                   “
 albumoses ; or rather that it is dif<U+FB01>cult to discover them in       pepto
nised blood.”     It is undoubtedly dif<U+FB01>cult, because they are present
in such small proportion that they are obscured by the overwhelmingly
large amount of globulin and albumin present. But as N eumeistei-I
has shown that they are, after injection into the circulation, excreted
by the kidneys, we must also conclude that they exist as such for a
time in the blood.
    How their presence there prevents coagulation it is di<U+FB02>ieult to
say; it is possible that they may cause by their presence a change in
the normal proteids of the blood that prevents the formation of or
the action of the <U+FB01>brin ferment.      That peptone blood does di<U+FB01>er in
one other important particular from normal blood, viz., in the heat
coagulation temperatures of its proteids, was shown by Wooldridge
  'I    have found that if the plasma is completely frozen, that on subsequently
thawing     it,
            coagulation sets in very quickly (in 10—20 seconds)  ;   thisisprobably
due to the crystals of ice breaking up the white corpusclcs, many of which still <U+FB02>oat
in the plasma. Nnuek also has noted this and gives similar explanation (loo. 017.,
                                                       a
p. 20). After removing these by centrifugalising for two hours in vessels surrounded
by ice, no such phenomenon occurs, and clotting does not set in for fully <U+FB01>fteen
minutes after thawing.

 be of the nature of criticism only. No doubt the crude and impure
 substance (for there is no attempt at puri<U+FB01>cation, separation, or iden
 ti<U+FB01>cation) introduced into the veins produces intravascular clotting ;
 but I must protest against the extension of the name <U+FB01>brinogen to
 such substances. It seems to me it would be just as correct to call a
 piece of iron wire introduced into the sac of an aneurysm to produce
 coagulation there, a <U+FB01>brinogen.
     Some of Wooldridge’s experiments under this head have been
 repeated by Kriiger ; T he <U+FB01>nds, in opposition to Wooldridge, that
 leucocytes themselves produce intravascular clotting (which would
 agree perfectly well with the cell globulin theory), and also that the
 stromata of red corpuscles, which probably contain the same con
 stituents in great measure as the white corpusoles, act similarly;
 other experiments have led him to the conclusion that it is the cor
 puscular elements that play the chief part in the coagulation, both
 within and without the body. He entirely negatives the statement
 of Wooldridge that the <U+FB02>uid of the lymph gland produces this effect,
 and any slight action it may have is accounted for by the presence of
 some lencocytes, which are exceedingly dif<U+FB01>cult to remove completely,
even by centrifugalising.
    To return, however, to these tissue <U+FB01>brinogens of Wooldridge, I
think we may venture to offer a suggestion as to their real nature, or,
at any rate, as to the nature of one of their constituents. From the
last paper published by Wooldridgegt we <U+FB01>nd that they are imper
fectly soluble in water, readily precipitated by acids, and soluble in
excess of those reagents.         That they yield on gastric digestion a sub
stance which is insoluble and which is rich in phosphorus.                From
these details of their properties, I think, we may draw the conclu
sion not that they contain lecithin, as Wooldridge af<U+FB01>rms, but that
they belong to the group of proteids described in the former part of
this paper under Hammarsten’s name of nucleo-albumin.                   N ucleo
albumins yield when poured into water a stringy precipitate resem
bling mucin, and in a former paper Wooldridge§ speaks of the preci

that when a saline solution of such a substance was injected into the

the vessels, and that these would form the starting-point for the'

      In  the course    of an investigation which we are making into the
 cortical representation of the muscles of the mouth and throat, we
.have experienced considerable dif<U+FB01>culty in describing correctly the
 movements of these parts, especially when there was any question of
 bilateral action occurring.
  '
      On referring to text-books we failed to <U+FB01>nd any solution of this
 dif<U+FB01>culty, and we therefore determined to make a few observations of
 the movements evoked by stimulating the several cranial nerves
 supplying this region in the monkey‘l' so as to have a. de<U+FB01>nite basis
 whereon to ground our observations of the movements obtained by
 stimulating the cortex.                                                               -
     In the course of this work we have observed several facts which do
 not harmonise with the views hitherto generally received.
     The results are summarised as follows :—
                               Method of Investigation.
     The foregoing summary of our experiments is based almost
 entirely upon the results obtained by exciting the respective nerves
 at the base of the cranial cavity after separating them from the
bulb.
     We have also stimulated the nerves outside the skull in the neck
both before and after division.

    In every  case the animal was narcotised with ether.              _
    (1.) For the exposure of the nerves at the base of the cranial
 cavity it was found possible to rapidly remove a cerebral hemisphere,
 clamping the carotid and other arteries, then to divide the tentorium
 and to remove the major part of the cerebellar hemisphere of the
same side, so as to admit of prolonged and numerous observations
before the animal died.    In all we have made eight experiments, and
in every case we have operated on the same kind of monkey, i.e.,

    (2.) For the exposure of the nerves outside the skull we found it
easy to lay bare the upper cervical nerves and those of the cranial
division in the anterior triangle by turning forward a triangular
<U+FB02>ap of skin, ligaturing and removing the external jugular vein, and
dividing and turning aside completely the sternomastoid muscle.
Finally, the parotid gland and digastric muscle (posterior belly) were
drawn up with hooks. the head being turned to the opposite side.
    The chords. tympani was readily exposed without injury, in the
tympanic cavity, before the dissection of the triangle by cutting away
the posterior wall of the external auditory meatus and the posterior
half of the tympanic ring. The facial nerve was subsequently exposed
in the stylomastoid foramen and aqueduct.
   The nerves were in each case raised up from their position and
stimulated in the air by the faradic current through <U+FB01>ne platinum
electrodes, the area of the operation having been gently dried.
   The current employed was from the secondary coil of an ordinary
dn Bois-Reymond inductorium, supplied by a 1 litre bichromate cell.
The experiment was carefully begun with the secondary coil at a
distance of 30 cm. from the primary, this interval being very rarely
diminished to more than 15 cm. (zero being of course the point where
the secondary coil completely overlaps the primary).
      Further Observations respecting the Examination of each Nerve.
                           A. Cranial Division.
    Vth Nerve.—Excitation of the motor root of the trigeminus evoked
 powerful closure of the jaws, and although the muscles of one side
 only were in action, the teeth were approximated without any lateral
 deviation of the lower jaw.
     VIIth Narnia—The motor distribution of the facial nerve has for
 the most part been well known for some time.       However, we consider
 that, unfortunately, a very  fundamental    error respecting this distri
 bution has crept into the text-books, it being supported by one
 anatomical authority following another, and, moreover, having been
 accepted by clinicians as an important aid in the differential diagnosis
 of facial paralysis. We refer to the supposed supply of motor <U+FB01>bres

from the facial to the levator palati through the super<U+FB01>cial petrosal
nerve.
    This idea,"ll upon which so much stress has been laid, is entirely
hypothetical, as might have been shown at any time by stimulating
the facial nerve in the skull, and observing the soft palate.
    “’e have found that stimulation of the peripheral end of the
divided facial nerve in the internal auditory meatus failed to cause
even with most powerful currents the slightest movement of the
soft palate, although the face was thrown into violent spasm.                         The
true motor nerve supply of the levator palati is, according to our
observations, the XIth nerve (vide infra).
    IXth Nerve. Glossopharyngeul.—In exciting this nerve, in addi
tion to the movements of the pharynx, which we attribute to the
contraction of the stylopharyngeus, and possibly to the middle con
strictor of the pharynx, we have observed certain movements of the
palate, as follows :-—(I.) Stimulation of the nerve while beneath the
stylohyoid ligament and uncut, gave in two instances elevation of
the palate on the same side, and in one instance on both sides.                        We
suppose that everyone will consider with us this movement to be
re<U+FB02>ex in origin, but we must add (II) that in one case we saw eleva
tion of the palate to the same side when exciting the peripheral end
 of the cut nerve.          In this latter case, perhaps, the result may be
 explained by the close neighbourhood of the pharyngeal plexus and
 the possible escape of current thereto, and under any circumstances
 this is but a single exceptional observation, so that we lay no stress
 upon it. Finally we never saw movement of the soft palate when
 the glossopharyngeal nerve was stimulated within the cranial
 cavity.
    Xth    Nerve.     Vagus.—In stimulating the uncut nerve outside the
 skull,     below the level of its junction with the hypoglossal,
 rhythmical movements of swallowing were produced, which occurred
 at the rate of twenty-<U+FB01>ve times in thirty-<U+FB01>ve seconds.
     In one observation all the constrictors of the pharynx were thrown
 into action, when the peripheral end of the cut nerve was stimulated
 outside the skull.
     The rhythmical movements of swallowing obtained by stimulating
 this nerve must be due to, of course, the simple re<U+FB02>ex, the stimulus
 acting on the nerve in the centripetal direction, and that this was
 the case is proved by the fact that no movement was obtained when
 the peripheral end of the cut nerve was stimulated inside the skull.
    ‘  Without de<U+FB01>nitely supporting this view, Guskell (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 43,

 p. 390) shows that some large“ somatic         nerve-<U+FB01>bres leave the facial nerve between
 its origin from the bulb   and  its exit from    the stylomastoid fommen.     He suggests
 that  some   of them  may   possibly  form  a  nerve to  supply the levator palati, but he
 leaves their real destination  undetermined.

      The superior laryngeal branch on being stimulated        gave rhythmical
  movements of swallowing at the rate of seventeen times in <U+FB01>fteen
  seconds, but when the nerve was out and its peripheral end stimu
  lated, only very slight movement was produced in the larynx,
  evidently by contraction of the cricothyroid muscle.
      XIth Nerve. Accessory to Vagus.——ln discussing the motor func
 tions of the VIIth nerve, we stated that the hitherto received idea
 of the soft palate being supplied by the facial nerve was, according
 to our observations, entirely erroneous.          We <U+FB01>nd that the levator
 palati is supplied entirely by the XIth nerve)“ When the peripheral
 end of the cut nerve was stimulated inside the skull, elevation of the
 soft palate on the same side was invariably seen.                The path by
 which the <U+FB01>bres from this nerve reach the palate is probably through
the upper branch of the pharyngeal plexus.
     XIIth Nerve. Hypoglossul.~—When the entire nerve was excited
  outside the skull, just below the point where it is joined by the
 <U+FB01>rst cervical nerve, the tongue was <U+FB02>attened posteriorly on the same
 side, and the tip protruded also on the same side, while in no case
 was there any heaping up of the tongue.
     At the same time the depressors of the hyoid bone were thrown
into action, and in some cases this dragging downwards of the hyoid
 completely prevented the tongue from being protruded.
    The movements described above were repeated without alteration
 when the peripheral end of the cut nerve was excited at the same
place.
     It must be particularly noted that the movements of the tongue
 were purely uni-lateral, and this was proved to be the case beyond
 doubt by two experiments, in which the tongue was divided longi
 tudinally in the middle line to the hyoid bone when the movements
 were seen to be entirely con<U+FB01>ned to the side stimulated.
     When the cut nerve was excited within the skull a different result
was obtained,- the tongue was <U+FB02>attened behind, and protruded
towards the same side, but there was no action in the depressors of
the hyoid.
     It has always been held that the depressors of the hyoid bone
receive their motor nerve supply from the hypoglossal through the
dcscendens      noni, but, as will be shown further on, according to our
observation, these muscles are supplied by the <U+FB01>rst and second
cervical nerves, and it is only when the hypoglossal is stimulated
below the point where it is joined by the branch from the <U+FB01>rst
cervical nerve, that any movement is produced in the depressors of
the hyoid.

     Our observations of the motor functions of      the <U+FB01>rst three cervical
  nerves as regards their in<U+FB02>uence on the hyoidean muscles have been
  made when the nerves have been excited—

     (1).) In the neck immediately upon their exit from between           the
           vertebral transverse processes.
     The nerves in the spinal canal were separated from the spinal
  cord and thoroughly dried, the e<U+FB02>icacy of the precautions taken
  against spread being evidenced by the difference in result obtained
  by exciting each root.
     The effects obtained by the methods a and b were identical.
     Ist Cervical Nerve. Branch of Union with the Hypoglossal.—In the
  description of the XIlth cranial nerve, we have stated as the result
  of our experiments that the depressors of the hyoid bone are not
  thrown into action when this nerve is stimulated within the skull.
  ()n carefully dissecting out the branch from the let cervical nerve to
  the hypoglossal we <U+FB01>nd on excitation of it that there is no movement
 in the tongue, but the depressors ofthe hyoid bone are strongly
 contracted.     Of these muscles the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid
 were always especially a<U+FB01>ected, while           the omo-hyoid was less
 frequently-seen to contract and in some cases not at all.           In- the
 cases where this muscle contracted, in one experiment the anterior
 belly alone acted, and when both bellies contracted the movement in
 the anterior was in excess of the posterior.
    [Ind Cervical. Branch to the Descendens Noni—On stimulating
 this nerve the depressors of the hyoid were thrown into action, but
 the muscles involved were not
                                    a<U+FB01>'ected
                                              in the same way as was the
 case with the lat cervical nerve.          The muscle which was most
 constantly set in action by excitation of the Ilnd cervical nerve was
 the omo-hyoid and especially its posterior belly.        The sterno-hyoid
 and sterno-thyroid also took part in depressing the hyoid bone, but
 it was especially remarked in half the cases, that their action was
 notably less powerful than that of the omo-hyoid. In one experiment
 in which a very weak current was employed, the omo-hyoid was
 alone seen to contract.      We are consequently led to conclude that
 while the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and omo-byoid muscles are all
 set in action by excitation of the Ist and IInd cervical nerves, the
 <U+FB01>rst two muscles .are relatively supplied by the former nerves,
 while the 11nd nerve is especially connected with the omo-hyoid
'muscle.
    Descendem     Noni—We prefer to mention           here the results of
 exciting this nerve, inasmuch as we regard its motor <U+FB01>bres to be
 derived entirely from the lat and _IInd cervical nerves.       This nerve

(ordinarily regarded        as a branch            of the XIIth cranial), when
stimulated above its junction with the branch from the Hnd cervical
nerve, produced contraction of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid
muscles, and where the current employed was weak there was no
contraction of the omo-hyoid, but this movement was superadded on
increasing the strength of the current.
    We ought here to mention the opinion held by Volkmann (loo. cit,
infra) that <U+FB01>bres ascend to the hypoglossal from the spinal rami com
municantes by the descendens noni.
   IIIrd Cervical Nerve—On stimulating the branch from this nerve,
which forms the 11nd cervical nerve just before the ansa. thus formed
is connected to the descendens noni, there was no action seen in the
depressors of the hyoid bone; it therefore seems certain that these
muscles are supplied with motor <U+FB01>bres solely by the branches from
the Ist and Hnd cervical nerves.

  II.   “ An Additional Contribution to the Placentation of the
       Lemurs.”           By Professor Sir WM. TURNER, Knt., M.B.,
       LL.D., F.R.S. Received May 21, 1888.
     In   1876      I  contributed to the Royal Society a memoir “ On the
  Placentation of the Lemurs,” which was published in the ‘Philoso
                              ’
  phical Transactions of that year (vol. 166, Part 2). The gravid uteri
  which     I   examined and described were from specimens of Propithecrw
  diadema, Lemur 'ru<U+FB01>pes, and Ind/ris brevicaudatus.                        The examination
  showed in these Lemurs that the placental villi were diffused over the
  greater part of the surface of the chorion, so as to approximate in
  general plan with the arrangement in the Pig, Mare, and Cetacean,
  though of course with special, characters of their own; that there
  were also distinct areas on the choriou free from_ villi; that the
  uterine mucous membrane possessed multitudes of crypts, from out
  of which the villi were easily drawn ; that smooth patches of mucous
  membrane devoid of crypts, and corresponding to the non-villous
  parts of the choriou were present, towards which the stems of the
  uterine glands converged in a remarkable manner, and on the surface
  of which they opened by obliquely directed months in considerable
  numbers. Further, it was pointed out that the choriou occupied both
  horns of the uterus, though the part which was prolonged into the
.non-gravid horn was only a short diverticulum, and that the allantois
'f01-n1ed a large persistent see, which, like the sac of the amnion, did

not extend into the diverticulum of the chorion.          The specimens
were at different stages of gestation, but none was at the full time,
though the foetus of Propithecus was well developed, and measured,
without including the tail, 5 inches in length.
    In April of the present year I received from F. E. Beddard, Esq.,
Prosector to the Zoological Society of London, the gravid uterus of a
Lemur, which he informs me was Lemur manthomystax.            The animal
had died during labour.        On examining the specimen the uterus
showed no signs of in<U+FB02>ammation, but its posterior wall was ruptured
immediately above the line of re<U+FB02>ection of the peritoneum from the
rectum on to it. The caudal end of the foetus occupied the upper
third of the vagina, the membranes having been torn so as to allow
the passage of the hinder part of the trunk out of the uterus. The
uterine vessels were then <U+FB01>lled with a carmine and gelatine injection,
and the vessels of the chorion were partially <U+FB01>lled with a blue injec
tion through the umbilical trunks.
    The uterus was somewhat smaller than that of Propithecus diadema,
described in the memoir above referred to. As in that specimen it
seemed on external examination as if it were a single uterus, but
when opened into it was seen to possess a largely dilated left cornu,
containing the head of the foetus, and a short right cornu, dilated to
about the size of a walnut, both of which freely communicated with
the cavity of the corpus uteri ; 8. depending fold of mucous membrane
not half an inch deep separated the cornua from each other. The
vagina was about 60 mm. long, and with a smooth mucous membrane.
The 0s uteri was de<U+FB01>ned by a circular fold of mucous membrane.
Each ovary was only about half the size of a common pea, and the left
one contained a highly vascular corpus luteum.
    The folds and sulci of the mucous membrane both of the corpus
and cornua uteri with their numerous crypts, corresponded generally
 with those previously described and <U+FB01>gured by me in P. diadema.
 The largest area of smooth mucous membrane was immediately above
 the 0s uteri; that next in size was situated around the ori<U+FB01>ce of the
 left Fallopian tube, whilst a smaller one surrounded the opening of
 the right tuba. Smooth areas were interspersed amidst the mucous
 folds; they were much less vascular than the folds and crypts, but as,
 both in their appearance to the naked eye and their relation to the
 openings of the uterine glands, they corresponded closely to what      I
 have previously described in P. diadema and Lemur ru<U+FB01>pea, I need not
 further describe them. The epithelial contents gave to the uterine
 glands a yellowish colour; but it was dif<U+FB01>cult to individualise in them
 the separate cells, the contents of which were granular, and the out
 lines indistinct.  It seemed indeed as if the cells were in process of
 degeneration,   owing  to the period of gestation having come to an end,
 and as parturition  had   begun, the glands w'ere no longer required to

take a part in the nutrition of the foetus.     The gland-layer of the
mucous membrane was readily distinguished subjacent to the crypt
la er.
  5'rl‘he folds and crypts surrounding  the smooth areas of the mucosa
were highly vascular. The crypts opened freely on the surface, and
to some extent smaller secondary crypts branched o<U+FB02> from the larger
depressions.      The distribution of the compact capillary network in
the walls of the crypts resembled the arrangement previously <U+FB01>gured
in P.   diadema.
  I  drew the chorion away from the uterine mucosa by gentle traction,
and in the process of detachment the villi came out of the crypts
with great case. A considerable area of chorion next the 0s uteri,
some of which had been torn in the descent of the foetus, was free
from villi and not very vascular.      As one traced the chorion from the
05, short scattered villi in the <U+FB01>rst instance projected from       it,
                                                                      to he
succeeded still further away by longer and broader villi arranged
either in tufts or rows, the size and arrangement of the villi being
adapted to the crypts in the mucosa.        Opposite the uterine opening
of the left Fallopian tube an area of the chorion about 33 mm. in its
longest diameter was smooth and free from villi:           it was placed at
the end of   the chorion   furthest removed   from  the  0s uteri. A much
smaller non-villous area of chorion corresponded to the opening of the
right tuba, and was much nearer to the us than was the case with the
non-villons area opposite the left tuba; in the right cornu the villi
were arranged in low ridges, and the ridges and furrows in the
uterine mucous membrane were shallow. Owing to the shortness of
the right uterine cornu, the chorion lodged within         it formed only a
 slight projection  of the  general bag of the  chorion.    Smooth  patches
of chorion, in apposition with the corresponding smooth areas of the
mucosa, were interspersed amidst the rows and tufts of villi which
covered so large a proportion of the free surface of the chorion.
    The blue injection which had been passed into the umbilical
 trunks had <U+FB01>lled the vessels ramifying in the deeper layer of the
 chorion, which could be seen both in the villons and non-villous parts
 of the membrane not unfrequently having a tortuous course.        Opposite
 the bases of the villi these vessels gave off small branches which
 entered the villi and formed in them close network of capillaries.
                                        a
    The large sacs both of the amnion and allantois in L. manthomystax
 closely corresponded in arrangement with those previously described
by me in Lemur     mg<U+FB01>pes.
  The    foetus was 19 cm. long from the     tip of   the nose to the root of
the tail, and the tail was 14 cm. long. It was evidently quite mature
and the hairs and nails were well developed.    The lower incisors had
partially cut the gum.    Both in this specimen and in the Propithecus
diade'ma, previously described the breech was the presenting part, and.

 the head was near the Fallopian tube belonging to the more dilated
 of the two uterine cornua. In three specimens of Lemur mfipes
 described in my previous memoir, the head was in proximity to the
 es, and the caudal end of the foetus was in the more dilated horn.
 It would appear, therefore, that in the Lemurs, either the head or
 breech may be the part of the animal <U+FB01>rst to be born.

 Edwards“ and had arrived independently in our previous investiga
 tions, that the placenta in this important group of animals is diffused
 and non-deeiduatc, and that the sac of the allantois is large and
 persistent up to the time of parturition.          In these important respects,
 therefore, the Lemurs are, in their placental characters, as far
 removed from man and apes as it is possible for them to be.
    Although    I  am not disposed to attach too much weight to the
placenta as furnishing a dominant character for purposes of classi<U+FB01>ca
tion, yet   I  cannot but think that animals which are megallantoid,
non-deciduate, and with the villi diffused generally over the surface
of the chorion, ought no longer to be associated in the same order
with animals in which, as in the apes, the sac of the allantois early‘
disappears, and the villi are concentrated into a special placental area,
in which the foetal and maternal structures are so intermingled that
the placenta is highly decidnate. Hence               I am of opinion that the
Lemurs ought to be grouped apart from the Apes in a special order,
which may be named either with Alphonse Milne Edwards Lemnria,
or with Victor Carus and others Prosimii.

    After  the fcetus had been mounted for preservation in spirit, deli
cate   <U+FB02>akes of a translucent cuticular-looking             membrane were seen
partially to <U+FB02>oat off from the surface of the abdomen and from the
ventral surface of the limbs. In the groins and axillsa the membrane
was very distinct, and formed an almost complete covering for the
surface of the limbs external to the hairs, which, though of some
length, were few in number, and scattered over the surface of the
skin. On the dorsal aspect of the foetus, both on the head, trunk, and
limbs, where the hairs were longer and closely set together, the <U+FB02>akes
were much more fragmentary and over considerable areas were
absent.     The appearance presented was such as to lead to the impres
sion that <U+FB02>akes of a cuticular membrane, subjacent to which the hairs
had been developed, were in process of being shed.

    A number of years ago, Professor Hermann Welcker, of Hallo,
described by the name of Epit'richium a cuticular membrane, situated
super<U+FB01>cial to the hairs, which formed a complete envelope to the
foetus of Bradypus tridaotylus, Cholopus              didactylus, Myrmecophaga
didactylo, and Dicotyles.           He <U+FB01>gured it in loco both in Bradypus
and Dicotyles.*         It was obviously quite distinct from the amnion.
     In a memoir “ On the Placentation of the Sloths,” published in
1873,      I described and <U+FB01>gured the epitrichium in Oholopus ho<U+FB01>'manm'<U+FB01>
and stated that          I had also seen a similar arrangement in a faatus of
Bradypus tridactylus. In a. subsequent dissection of the gravid uterus
of Bradyp'us tridactylus         I have recognised that this membrane in its
relations to the foetus corresponded with Welcker’s <U+FB01>gure and descrip
tion. In these animals the epitrichium formed a complete covering
of the foetus, and closely followed the contour of the head, trunk,
 and limbs, immediately external to the hairy coat which was situated
in the interval between the epitrichium and the skin; though the
epitrichium was perforated at the muzzle by the long tactile hairs
which grew from the lips. It was adherent to the cuticle of the
margins of the eyelids, of the ori<U+FB01>ce of the nose, mouth, external
auditory meatns, and anus, and was also attached to the soft cuticle
around the roots of the claws. It was entirely distinct from the
amnion, and from its relations to the hairy coat was obviously the
layer of the epidermis situated super<U+FB01>cial to the hairs, and which had
become elevated as a. distinct and continuous membrane as a result of
their development and growth.
     From its relation to the hairy coat, the onticular membrane on the
foetus of Lemur xanthomystarc was without doubt a similar structure
to the epitrichium investing the fcntus of the Sloths, but with this
difference, that instead of forming a. continuous envelope around the
head, body, and limbs of the foetus, it was broken up into <U+FB02>akes or
patches, which were the best marked where the hairs were scattered,
and had almost disappeared in' the mature foetus, where the hairy
 cost was thick and abundant.
     The recognition of this membrane in Lemur wanthomystaz led me
to examine the fcetus of Propithecus diadema, referred to in my
memoir “On the Placentation of the Lemurs,” with the view of
seeing if a corresponding             structure was present.             I found on
immersing the foetus in water, or in spirit, that similar membranous
<U+FB02>akes <U+FB02>oated o<U+FB01> from the surface of the hair.                    In some localities
they      were  so  loose  as to make  it  di<U+FB02>icult  to  say   what    their original
relation to the hairs had been, but in other places the membrane had
not been disturbed, and the hairs were situated between it and the

quite distinct from the amnion.
   The epitrichium, therefore, is present both in the Lemurs and in
the Sloths, but in the former it does not, after the hairy coat is
developed, form a complete envelope for the fmtus, but is broken up
before the termination of the period of gestation into more or less
detached <U+FB02>akes of membrane.
III.   “Note     on the Coagulation of the Blood.” By L. C.
     VVOOLDRIDGE,      M.D., M.R.C.P., Co-Lecturer on Physiology at
     Guy's     Hospital.       Communicated by Professor VICTOR
     HORSLEY,     F.R.S.,   &c. (From the Laboratory of the Brown
     Institution.)     Received    May 24, 1888.
   In a paper read before the Royal Society, April 26th, 1888, Dr.
Halliburton oiIers some criticism of my views respecting the coagu
lation of the blood.       In this note I shall brie<U+FB02>y summarise and
traverse the objections Dr. Halliburton raises to my theory and expe
riments.
   I. Dr. Halliburton suggests that the substance I call A-<U+FB01>brinogen
—which      I  obtained by cooling peptone-plasma—~is             not a normal
constituent    of  the  blood  plasma,   but  that  it  is   a  precipitate of a
hemi-albumose, supposed by           him   to  be  present     in  the peptone
which is injected into an animal for the purpose of obtaining peptone
plasma.     I do not use VWitte’s peptone, as Dr. Halliburton appears to
have done, on account of its recognised impurity, but that obtained
from Dr. Gruebler’s well-known laboratory in Leipsic.              This peptone
is prepared according to Henuiger’s method.            A 10 per cent. solution
of it in -k per cent. solution of sodium chloride is quite clear after
<U+FB01>ltration.
   It gives no precipitate on cooling to zero.
   It disappears wholly from the blood within one or two minutes
after injection.
   Finally, A-<U+FB01>brinogen has properties absolutely different from the
peptone injected.
   Dr. Halliburton     appears to think that this substance,       A-<U+FB01>brinogen,
exists only in peptone plasma.
   I  stated in a paper read before    the Royal Society in 1885, “ On a
New Constituent,” &c., that it was also present in salt plasma, and I
gave details concerning it in the Croonian MS., which is in the archives
of the Royal Society.       I explained at length in the paper referred to
by Dr. Halliburton, and published in Ludwig’s
                                                           ‘

why there are, as has long been known, two varieties of salt plasma,
namely, one containing, as I showed, no A-<U+FB01>brinogen, this being not

    spontaneously coagulable, the other containing it, and therefore
    being spontaneously coagulable.
        II. Dr. Halliburton further asserts, that whereas in the abstract
    of the Croonian Lecture,'1 described a body, B-<U+FB01>brinogen, in the
                            ‘
    paper in Ludwig’s Festschrift,‘ published shortly afterwards, this
    body was not mentioned, or had become identical with the <U+FB01>brinogen
    of Haminarsten.      This statement is totally incorrect, for on page 228
    of Ludwig’s ‘Festschrif't’ there will be found a paragraph headed
    “ B-<U+FB01>brinogen,” and on the
                                        following page this passage occurs:
    “Man sieht also dass das Fibrinogen von Hammarsten in Plasma
    einen Vorg'alnger hat, welche andere Eigenschaften besitzt, und ich
    bezeichne diese Snbstanz als ‘ B-<U+FB01>brinogen.’
                                                      " The
                                                            differences between
    the two bodies here referred to are precisely those mentioned in the
    abstract of the Croonian lecture, and are shortly as follows :—
       (a.) B-<U+FB01>brinogen does not clot with <U+FB01>brin ferment, but it does clot
               with leucocytes and other animal and vegetable cells.
       (b.) It clots with substances which can be obtained from these
               animal and vegetable cells in large quantities, by extraction
               with water. These substances I call tissue <U+FB01>brinogens.
       (0.) It further clots with lecithin.
       Hammarsten’s <U+FB01>brinogen, in remarkable contrast with the properties
   of this body, does not clot with leucocytes or other animal or vegetable
   cells, nor does it clot with the‘substances called tissue <U+FB01>brinogens
   nor with lecithin.
       I would here add that the <U+FB01>brinogen in most transudation <U+FB02>uids is
   similar to Hammarsten’s <U+FB01>brinogen. I have clearly indicated these
   differences in previous publications.
      III. With regard to Dr. Halliburton’s remark on the relation of
   lecithin to clotting,  I   may say that it not only gives rise to clotting in
  ‘peptone plasma     and     cooled plasma, but in a solution of <U+FB01>brinogen
   isolated from salt plasma and in the plasma obtained from the blood
  after the injection of tissue <U+FB01>brinogen.           In discussing the experi.
  ments on the behaviour of cooled blood towards lecithin, Dr. Halli
  burton does not recount the details of the experiments, and hence he
  conveys a. misleading impression of the same.             It is necessary for
“ these
           experiments to use a <U+FB01>nely particulate and yet thick emulsion
  of lecithin, for the following very obvious reasons.           The lecithin is
  insoluble in the salt solution into which the blood is received, and a
  large quantity of blood being received into a relatively small quantity
  of the salt solution, the lecithin does not come into contact with all
                                                                                '
  the plasma unless a <U+FB01>ne thick emulsion be used.
      The fact that <U+FB02>uids free from lecithin produce clotting, in _no way
  disproves the contention that lecithin is an essential factor in coagu
 lation, since every variety of <U+FB01>brinogen contains lecithin.           Lecithin

 is, next to proteid, the most widely distributed substance in the
 animal organism.        As Hammarsten has well said, “ it has been found
wherever it has been looked for.” Whenev r I have stated that lecithin
is present in any <U+FB01>brinogen, I have prepared it and tested for it in
the way       I  have previously repeatedly described in the papers Dr.
 Halliburton     quotes.
     IV. The criticisms which Dr. Halliburton        passes upon my dis
covery that tissue <U+FB01>brinogens cause intravascular clotting when
injected into the living circulation, can hardly be regarded seriously ;
for he asserts that the tissue, <U+FB01>brinogen is a slimy mass, and causes
clotting by mechanically plugging the vessels, whereas if he had
repeated my experiments he would have found (1) that the <U+FB01>brinogen
is not at all slimy, and (2) that it can hardly be supposed to cause
clotting mechanically, since it passes through the right heart, then
the capillaries of the lungs, next the left heart and aorta, and <U+FB01>nally
the capillaries of the alimentary canal before it <U+FB01>rst causes clotting,
'i.e., in the portal vein in the dog.

       J.  BURDON SANDERSON, F.R.S.          Received May 29, 1888.
    Dr. Haycraft has recently proposed a method for the volumetric
determination of uric acid in urine (‘Brit. Med. Journ.,’ 1885, 2,
p. 1100) which has great advantages over all former methods in that it
is much quicker and easier to manage.         The uric acid from 25 c.c. of
urine is precipitated by silver       nitrate  after previous addition of
sodium carbonate (to prevent reduction) and ammonia (to dissolve
silver chloride, &c.); this precipitate is then collected, washed, and
dissolved in nitric acid, and the amount of silver present in this solu
tion ascertained by Volhard’s method, 'i.e., titration with ammonium
sulphocyanate; from this the amount of uric acid can be calculated.
“ In order to test the accuracy of the process," he say s, “ I prepared
 several solutions of acid urate of sodium of known strength. To
 these    I added various quantities of common salt, magnesium sulphate,
 and phosphate of soda in order to imitate as far as possible the
 urinary secretion.      On estimating the uric acid in these solutions,  I
 obtained wonderfully correct results. In all cases not much more
 than a milligramme was lost during the process, and may be simply
 accounted for by the fact that no salt of uric acid is absolutely in
soluble. . . . . In order further to test its accuracy, 50 c.c. of
 urine were divided into two equal portions; to the <U+FB01>rst 25 c.c. of a
  solution of acid urate of sodium of known strength were added; to

1888.]           Volumetric Determination     of Uric Acid.           285
the second 25 c.c. of water were added.         When estimated the two
<U+FB02>uids should show a di<U+FB01>erence equal to the quantity of salt added.”
Results very closely corresponding to this were obtained.
    These results do not agree with results obtained by Salkowski
(P<U+FB01>iiger's ‘ Archiv,’ vol. 5, 1872, p. 210) and Maly (P<U+FB02>iiger’s
‘
  Archiv,’ vol. 6, p. 201).     Salkowski proposed a volumetric method
for the determination     of  uric acid, very similar to that proposed by
 Dr. Haycraft ; in this he added excess of silver nitrate and estimated
the excess of silver present. He gave up this method, however, as
on examining the silver precipitate iobtained from urine, after com
plete precipitation of the phosphates by magnesia mixture, he found
that it contained magnesium as well as silver, and that the proportion
of magnesium to silver varied considerably in precipitates from
different urines, though constant for the same urine.        Haycraft con
siders that the presence and variation in amount of magnesium in.
these precipitates may be due to varying quantities of magnesium
ammonium phosphate in them. This is, however, impossible, as the
 phosphates were precipitated by Salkowski previously. and the urine
allowed to stand for twenty-four hours before <U+FB01>ltration to ensure their
complete separation.       Salkowski’s results were con<U+FB01>rmed by Maly,
who found that if in the presence of salts of calcium, magnesium,
potassium, and ammonium, a solution of a urate be precipitated by
 silver nitrate, the precipitate contains these metals as urates as well as
 silver urate.
                                                       I
    As a. test of the accuracy of Haycraft’s method, examined samples
 of various urines both by his method and by Salkowski’s method,
 which is universally acknowledged to be the most reliable, and the
 accuracy of which has been proved by experimental evidence.          This
method consists in taking 250 c.c. of urine, adding 50 c.c. of magnesia
 mixture to precipitate phosphates, and then adding to 240 c.c. of the
 <U+FB01>ltrate (which are equivalent to 200 c.c. of the urine) silver nitrate
to precipitate the uric acid.         This precipitate of silver urate is
 decomposed by snlphuretted hydrogen after being suspended in water.
 The liquid is then acidi<U+FB01>ed, <U+FB01>ltered hot, and evaporated to small bulk,
 and the uric acid allowed to crystallise out. These crystals are then
 dried and weighed.     The following results were obtained :—

   The results obtained by Heycruf't’s method were always con
siderably higher than those obtained by Selkowski’s.       The reason of
this   that
        is  Dr. Haycraft  has assumed  that the silver  precipitate from
urine consists of an nrate containing only      atom of silver in the           1
molecule, whereas the proportion of silver in this precipitate                                                         is
always larger, and varies in amount in different urines. If we assume
that the precipitate contains   atoms of silver in2    molecule of urate              a
and divide the results obtained by Haycruft’s method by two, we see
that in two cases they are about equal to, in the rest less than those
obtained by Salkowski's method.       The proportion of the results
obtained by one method to those obtained by the other varies. This
agrees with the results of Salkowski's researches, from which one
would expect that the results obtained by Haycraft’s method would
not bear a. constant relation to the results obtained by Salkowski's,
and that the halves of the results by the former method                                                 would be
lower than, in most cases, those obtained by the latter.

V. “ On the Effects of Increased Arterial Pressure on the Mam
     malian Heart.” By JOHN A. MOW ILLIAM, M.D., Professor
     of the Institutes of Medicine in the University of Aberdeen.
     Communicated by Professor M. FOSTER, Sec. R.S. Received
     May 30, 1888.
   The following is a short preliminary statement of some of the main
facts elicited in the conrse of a recent investigation.   The experiments
were conducted on chloroformed cats. The thorax was laid open,
arti<U+FB01>cial respiration being maintained, and the action of the auricles
and ventricles was recorded by means of the graphic method. The
contraction of the heart in ordinary circumstances having been
observed and registered, the arterial pressure was raised by constrict
ing or clamping the last part of the thoracic aorta—usually for a
period of 4-—8 seconds.         Clamping for longer periods was often
accompanied by convulsive movements of the animal.
   The results may be brie<U+FB02>y summarised as follows :—
   They fall into one or other of two categories according as to whether
the medullary cardio-inhibitory mechanism is (I) functionally active
in controlling the heart’s action, or is (II) incapable of affecting the
cardiac beat.       The latter condition is one that may result from
various causes,    such as (a) section of the vagus nerves or paralysis of
their function through the in<U+FB02>uence of drugs, &c.; (b) depression or
paralysis of the medullary cardio-inhibitory centre, brought about by
drugs or by other causes.
   I. In the <U+FB01>rst-mentioned condition, when the cardio-inhibitory
mechanism is in a position to control the heart’s action, a marked
                                                                           '
rise of the arterial pressure (such as results from compression of the
descending aorta) causes, as Marcy has shown, a slowing of the cardiac
rhythm.
   I <U+FB01>nd that the rise of blood~pressure also causes marked changes in
the contraction force of the cardiac muscle.      For a short time (a few
seconds, 1, 2,  3,  &c.), after  clamping  of the  descending aorta there
occurs an augmentation in the strength of the beat— especially of the
ventricular beat; meanwhile the rhythm has become slower than
before (<U+FB01>g. 1).
   Then there occurs a more or less sudden change. The auricular
contractions undergo a striking diminution in force. They remain
enfeebled until the compression of the aorta has been discontinued
and the blood pressure has fallen; then they gradually recover,
though the process of recovery may not always begin at once (<U+FB01>gs. 1
and 2).              .

  the descending aorta do not run parallel with those occurring in the
  auricles.    The ventricles, while they beat more sl nvly than before,
  usually beat much more strongly even when the auricular contraction
  has become markedly weakened (<U+FB01>g. 1).      Depression of the ventricular
  force may occur, but it comes considerably later than the auricular
  depression, and is very much slighter in degree (fig. 3). The slow
  strong ventricular systoles are able to empty the cavity of the left
  ventricle when systoles of less strength fail to do so—as indicated by
  the fact that the recording lever often fails to descend to the ordinary
  level in the interval between the contractions (<U+FB01>g. 1). When the
  descending aorta has been released and the pressure has fallen, a
  period of marked cardiac acceleration often succeeds; during this
  acceleration, the individual ventricular beats are much diminished in
  force (<U+FB01>g. 3).
     The above-mentioned cardiac changes attendant on a sudden rise of
  arterial pressure are brought about through the medullary cardio
  inhibitory centre and the vagus nerves.      They are of such a nature
  that while the ventricles are contracting slowly and powerfully in
  such a way as to be able to discharge their contents in spite of the
  increased arterial pressure, there occurs a striking change in the
  action of the auricles involving a great reduction in the amount of
  blood pumped into the ventricles and the ‘degree in which the latter
  are distended just before their systole.   Hence the quantity of blood
  thrown out by the left ventricle into the systemic arteries is much
  diminished, and the rise in the blood-pressure is in some measure
  counteracted and controlled.
     II. In conditions where the medullary cardio-inhibitory mechanism
  has ceased to exert any controlling in<U+FB02>uence upon the heart (e.g.,
  after section of both vagi), the effects following a sudden rise of
  arterial pressure are entirely di<U+FB01>erent from those above described.
     Marcy showed that there was no very constant relation between
  the rate of the heart’s action and the height of the blood-pressure
  after section of the vagi; some degree of acceleration was commonly
'
  observed.
     Examining the cardiac changes in the way already mentioned,          I
  <U+FB01>nd that after section of the vagi or paralysis of the medullary
  cardio-inhibitory mechanism, a sudden rise of arterial pressure causes
  no very striking or constant change in the heart’s rhythm ; frequently
  there is slight acceleration. There is a complete absence of the cha
  racteristic changes in the contraction force above described (under I).
  As regards the strength and character of the cardiac action, there are
  two conditions to be noted.
     (1.) The heart may at each systole be able to discharge its contents
  in normal or approximately normal fashion. In such circumstances
  the principal change to be observed in a vigorous heart is a marked

    The following Papers were read :—
I. “The Minimum-point of Change of Potential of a Voltaic
      Couple.” By G. GORE, F.R.S. Received May 26, 1888.
   In a previous communication on “The Effect of Chlorine on the
                                                 ”
Electromotive Force of a Voltaic Couple              (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
                    I
May 3rd, 1888), described a phenomenon which             I now venture to
term the “ Minimum-point of Change of Potential of a Voltaic
Couple.”      In that description a “ thermo-electric pile ” is mentioned
as having been used for the purpose of balancing the electromotive
force of the couple, whilst <U+FB01>nding the “ minimum-point of change.”
As very few persons possess a thermo-electric pile suitable for the
            I
 purpose, have devised and employed the following arrangement by
 means of which the use of the pile may be dispensed with.
    Take a voltaic couple, composed of an unamalgamated strip or
stout wire of zinc or magnesium (the latter is usually the best), and
a small sheet of platinum, immersed in distilled water; balance its
electric potential through an ordinary galvanometer by that of a pre
 cisely similar couple composed of portions of the same specimens of
the same metals, immersed the same moment as the other pair in a
separate quantity of the same water, and gradually add to one of the
 two cells suf<U+FB01>ciently small and known quantities of an adequately
 weak solution of known strength in a portion of the same water, of
 the substance to be used, until the balance is upset, and take note of
 the proportions of the substance and of water then contained in that
 cell.   It is more easy to successively dilute than to successively

1888.]          Change   of Potential of   a Voltaic Couple.             295
strengthen the solutions, and thus arrive at the “minimum-point.”
The method is a little less accurate than the one in which a thermo
pile is employed.
    By means of this method, using a couple composed of magnesium
platinum in distilled water, I have found the following
                                                               “ Minimum
points of Change of Voltaic Potential,” in solutions of potassic
chloride, potassic chlorate, hydrochloric acid, and chlorine.     I selected
these substances because they were representative ones, suitable to
yield results for comparison, and because they gave extreme and
intermediate magnitudes of the effect.          The results are compared
with those obtained with a Mg + Pt couple and the thermopile.
                            Potassic Chloride, K0l.
                           “
    Solution at 18° 0. ; minimum-point” lay between 1 part in 3875
and 4650 parts of water; and by the aid of the thermopile, with
the solution at 17° 0., “minimum-point” between 1 in 3875 and
4305.
                          Potassic Chlorate, KClOa.
                        “
    Solution at 19° 0.; minimum-point” between in 1 in 4650 and 5166
and with the pile, solution at 18° 0., between 1 in 4920 and 5470.
                          Hydrochloric Acid, H01.
                           “
    Solution at 17° 0.;      minimum-point” between 1 in 516,666 and
664,285; and by      aid  of  the pile, solution at 19° 0., between 1 in
516,666 and 574,074.
                                 Chlorine, Cl.
                         “
    Solution at 18° 0.; minimum-point” between 1 in 15,656,500,000
 and 19,565,210,000; and with the pile, solution at 125° 0., between
 1 in 17,000 millions and 17,612 millions.
    These results show the great degree of delicacy of each method, and
 the extremely large difference of proportion of-diffcrent substances
 required to upset the balance.      The two methods agree.
    By employing a great variety of dissolved substances,            I  have
 found that nearly every such substance has a minimum proportion
 be10w which it has no apparent effect upon the electromotive force of
 a MgPt or ZnPt couple in distilled water; and this proportion
 appears to be a constant number, dependent only upon very simple
 conditions, viz., unchanging composition of the voltaic couple and
 liquid, a uniform temperature, and employing the same galvanometer.
 The apparently constant numbers thus obtained may probably be
 used as tests of the purity or of the uniformity of composition of
 dissolved substances.
    The “minimum-point” and          degree  of  sensitiveness varies with,

296      Mr. G. Gore.       On the Change   of Potential of  a   June 14,
let, the chemical composition of the liquid; 2nd, the kind of positive
metal; 3rd, to a less degree with the kind of negative metal; 4th,
the temperature at the surface of the positive metal, and at that of
the negative one; and 5th, with the kind of galvanometer employed.
    The order of the degree of sensitiveness or magnitude of the
 “                  ”
                       is manifestly related to that of degree of chemical
   minimum-point
energy   of the liquid,  and, therefore, also to the atomic and molecular
weights of the dissolved substances, and to the ordinary chemical
groups of halogens. With certain exceptions, it is also distinctly
related to the amounts of chemical heat.        The greater the degree of
free chemical energy of the dissolved substance, and the greater its
action upon the positive metal, the smaller the proportion of it
required to upset the balance.         The proportion necessary for this
purpose probably represents a <U+FB01>xed amount of voltaic energy in all
cases, viz., the amount necessary to overcome the mechanical inertia
of the needle of the particular galvanometer employed.
    As the “ minimum-point” of a chemically active substance dis
solved in water is usually much altered by adding almost any soluble
substance to the mixture, measurements of that point in a number of
liquids at a given temperature with the same voltaic pair and galvano
meter, will probably throw some light upon the state of combination
and degree of chemical freedom of substances dissolved in water.

     " On the Change of Potential of a Voltaic Couple by V aria
      tion of Strength of its Liquid.”             By G. GORE, F.R.S.
      Received May 31,        1888.

Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 4, p. 130) convenient in detecting and measuring
small changes of voltaic potential (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ May 3rd, 1888).

method of balance the above phenomenon in various liquids.
    The following are a few examples of measurements thus made of

   By regularly increasing the strength of    the solution, the electro
motive force at <U+FB01>rst increased very rapidly, then with decreasing
rapidity, and <U+FB01>nally remained uniform.         The total increase was
038 volt.      The smallest proportion of bromine required to upset.
the balance lay between 1 in 77,500,000 and 84,545,000 parts of
water.
   With each of these substances, and with all others which I have
examined, a gradual and regular increase of strength of the solution
from the weakest up to a saturated one, was attended by a more or
less irregular change of electromotive force.
    By plotting the quantities of dissolved substance as ordinates t0
the electromotive forces as abscissee, each substance or mixture of
substances in every case yielded a different curve of variation of
electromotive force by uniformly changing the strength of its solu
tion. With a given voltaic couple at a given temperature, the curve
was constant and characteristic of the substance.      As the least addi
tion of a soluble foreign substance greatly changed the “minimum
point,” and altered the curve of variation of potential, both the
curve and the minimum proportion of a substance required to upset
the voltaic balance may probably be used as tests of the chemical
composition of the substance, and as means of examining its state of
combination when dissolved. By varying the strength of the solution
at each of the metals separately, 9. curve of change of potential
was obtained for each positive metal, but not for every negative
one.

     the ‘ Minimum Point and Change of Potential of a Voltaic

    In  a communication to the Royal Society, May 3rd, 1888, on “ The
Effect of Chlorine upon the Electromotive          Force of a Voltaic
 Couple,” and in a subsequent one on “The Minimum Point of
 Change of Potential of aVoltaic Couple,”        I have shown that by
 oppOSiug to each other two currents of equal electromotive force from
 two perfectly similar couples      of magnesium-platinum        or zinc
 platinum in distilled water, and gradually adding to one of the cells
 suf<U+FB01>ciently minute quantities of a suitable substance, such as
 chlorine, hydrochloric acid, or a soluble salt, &c., the voltaic balance
 is not disturbed until a certain de<U+FB01>nite proportion of the substance
 has been added, and that the proportion required to be added is
 excessively small (about 1 in 17,000 millions) in the case of chlorine

1888.]       and the JlIinimum-point, (fro,    of a Voltaic Couple.          301
with a magnesium-platinum           couple, and extremely different with
unlike substances.
    In the present paper my object      is to describe a few similar experi
ments, made to examine      the in<U+FB02>uence of liquids of di<U+FB01>erent chemical
composition, upon this phenomenon and upon the degrees of electro
motive force produced by further additions of the substances.                 All
the solutions were made with distilled water, and the substances
employed were of considerable degree of purity.              The voltaic cell
consisted in each case of zinc and platinum in distilled water, and its
electromotive force was balanced by that of a suitable thermo-electric
pile (see ‘Proceedings of the Birmingham Philosophical Society,’
vol. 4, p. 130), and the measurements made under that condition.
    The electromotive force of a zinc-platinum couple in ordinary
distilled water at 16° 0. is about 1088 volt; provided the zinc is free
from oxide, and the platinum contains no absorbed hydrogen. The
presence of hydrogen (not removable by rubbing but removable by
heating to redness) may reduce the electromotive force to 0'91 volt,
and a <U+FB01>lm of oxide. upon the zinc may reduce it 1 or 2 per cent,
whilst carbonic acid absorbed by the water from the air, 860., may
increase it about 2 per cent.          In all cases, therefore, where very
 exact measurements of electromotive force are necessary, these cir
cumstances have to be considered.          In the present case the measure
ments are su<U+FB02>iciently accurate for the purposes intended.
    A series of measurements were made with a zinc-platinum couple
in water, adding uniform quantities of hydrochloric acid up .to
 0'15 grain per 465 grains of water, and heating the platinum to
redness previous to each measurement. The variations of electro
motive force obtained were nearly the same as when the platinum was
not heated, the only material difference being that the electromotive
force throughout was about 0'10 volt higher.
    The following are the results of the experiments made upon the
in<U+FB02>uence of the chemical energy of the liquid.             The numbers are
corrected for the in<U+FB02>uence of hydrogen absorbed by the platinum.

494 parts of water.    The increase of  electromotive force by increased
strength of the solution was nearly regular, as may be seen by
plotting the quantities of substance as ordinates to the electromotive
forces as abscissw.   In order to remove any trace of free iodine, the
iodate was previOusly kept at 100° C. during one hour; it was then
perfectly white and free from odour.

  Eight other solutions, all of different strengths below                            1'2006, gave
the same electromotive force as water. The smallest proportion of
bromate required to upset the balance lay between 1 in 3441 and
387 parts of water. The increase of electromotive force by increase
of strength of the solution was extremely irregular.
   The effects obtained with solutions of potassic chlorate have already
been given in the paper on “The Change of Potential of a Voltaic
 Couple by Variation of Strength of its Liquid.”             The smallest
proportion   of the  salt required  to   disturb the voltaic   balance lay
between 1    in 221  and  258 parts   of  water.  Three solutions, each
weaker than 1‘8 grain in 465 grains of water, viz., 0‘09, 0'009, and
00009 grain, gave the same electromotive force as water.

   The great solubility of the salt rendered several groups of measure
ments necessary in order to include the entire range of solution. The
salt was odourless and colourless, but slightly alkaline.                  The smallest
proportion     of  the   iodide    necessary   to change     the  balance   lay between
1 in 15,500       and 17,222 parts of water. The variation of electro
motive force with strength of solution was very irregular.                            The

680 to 700 grains of the salt.

    By comparing these numbers with those in Table IV, it will be
perceived that each of the haloid salts acted much more powerfully
than either of the oxygen ones, and that the order of degrees of
activity in the two series was reverse.

a stOppered glass <U+FB02>ask with continual agitation; it contained 1 part

   Four other solutions, weaker             than 0‘000075 grain, gave each

balance lay between 1 part in 3,100,000 and 3,521,970 parts of water.

    The mode by which the chlorine-water was prepared and its strength
 ascertained       has been already described               (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 44,
  1888, p. 151, ‘Nature,’ vol. 38, p. 117).                     The minimum proportion
 of chlorine necessary to upset the balance was found more nearly by
 adding very small quantities of an exceedingly dilute solution of it
 to the water until the required strength was attained, thus avoiding
 the risk of error attending more numerous dilutions.                           The proportion
 lay between 1 in 1264 million and 1300 million parts of water.                                 The

    This series of numbers suggests a quantitative relation of the
 “ minimum                  " to the atomic and molecular
                proportions                                     weights of the
 substances.
    On comparing these numbers with those of the two previous
 groups of bodies, we <U+FB01>nd that the proportion of substance required to
 upset the voltaic balance was largest with the oxygen salts, inter
 mediate with the haloid ones, and least with the free elementary
 bodies.     It was smaller the greater the degree of chemical energy of
 the substance; thus it was about 400 times less with chlorine than
 with iodine. And it was smaller the greater the degree of freedom
 to exert that energy; thus it was about 5,416,000 times smaller with
 free chlorine than with potassic chlorate, or 1,570,000 times less than
 with the combined chlorine of the chlorate; and about 185 times
 smaller than with potassic chloride, or 88 times less than with the
 combined chlorine of that salt.
    At the lowest potentials, the rate of increase of electromotive force
 per grain of substance is usually larger the smaller the proportion of
 substance necessary to disturb the potential.          Iodine is'an exception
 to this, but probably only an apparent one, because on substituting
 magnesium for the zinc, the addition of iodine caused an increase of
 potential as usual.
    The curve of variation of potential was different with the solution
 of each substance, and was apparently characteristic of the body in
 each case; and a great number of such representative curves might
 be obtained by change of strength of solution, in nearly all electrolytes,
with a zinc-platinum or other voltaic couple.

   The <U+FB01>rst part of this paper is chie<U+FB02>y devoted to a comparison of
the electric organs of Raia radiate, R. butts, and R. circularis.          It is
shQWn that the organ in the species radiate di<U+FB01>ers in many respects
from the organ in the two other species, and that an exhaustive

  study of its structure and development is likely to throw considerable
  light on the nature of electric organs generally, and also on the
 structure of the motor plates of muscles.                While R. batis may reach
 a length of over 180 cm., R. radiata seldom measures more than
 415 cm. from tip to tip, and is thus only about half the size of a large
  R. circular-is.    In R. radiate the electric organ is absolutely and rela
  tively extremely small. In R. batis the electric organ may be 60 cm. in
  length and 7 cm. in circumference at the centre, and extend from
  the skin to the vertebral column, but in an adult R. radiate the organ
  is seldom over 13 cm. in length and 8 mm. in circumference, and the
  posterior two-thirds is con<U+FB01>ned to a narrow cleft between the skin
 and the great lateral muscles of the tail.                 Further, the organ of
  R. radiate. consists of minute shallow cups, which only remotely
 resemble the large Well-formed electric cups of R. circularis.             In the
  latter species the various layers of the electric cup are readily com
 parable to the more important layers of the electric disk of R. batis,
 but in R. radiata the electric cup is little more than a muscular <U+FB01>bre,
  with one end expanded and slightly excavated to support a greatly
 enlarged motor plate, in which terminate numerous nerve-<U+FB01>bres.
 The striated layer of R. butts and R. clrcularis, which consists of cha
 racteristic lamellaa having an extremely complex arrangement, is
 entirely absent from R. radiata, the electric layer is indistinct, and
 instead of a thick richly nucleated cortex, the cup is merely invested
 by a slightly thickened sarcolemma.                Further, the tissue forming
 the shallow, thick-walled cup, both in its appearance and con
 sistency, closely resembles an ordinary muscular <U+FB01>bre, while the long
 stem usually remains distinctly striated to its termination.
     In the second part of the paper an account is given of the develop
 ment of the electric cups of R. radiate.             It is shown that the rate of
 development compared           with  R. circular-2's,   but more especially with
 R. batis, is extremely slow. The young R. radiata is nearly double the
 size of the R. baits embryo before the muscular <U+FB01>bres reach the “ club
                                                                                 ”
 stage, and the long nearly uniform clubs, instead of at once developing
 into rudimentary cups as is the case in R. batis, assume the form of
 large Indian clubs. When the young skate reaches a length of about
 35 cm., the long secondary (Indian) clubs begin to expand anteriorly,
and this expansion continues until a. fairly well moulded cup, mounted
on a. long delicate stem is produced. But the process of conversion is
scarcely completed when the skate has reached a length of 40 cm.,
i.e., when it has nearly reached its full size, for in the species radiata
a length of 50 cm. is seldom if ever attained.
     The cup-stage having been eventually reached, the stem, which for
a time may        still increase in length, is often compressed by two or
more     cups being closely applied together, and part of the rim of the
cup may be slightly everted or projected forwards, but even in the

largest specimens of R. radiate examined there was never any
indication of retrogressive changes.
   The small size of the electric organ, together with the shallowness
of the minute cups of which it consists, seems at <U+FB01>rst to indicate
that in R. radiata we have an electric organ in the act of disappearing.
But when the organ of the species radiate is carefully compared with
the organ of the species batia and circularr'a, the evidence seems to
point in an opposite direction, and the view that the cups of R. radiate
are in process of being elaborated into more complex structures, such
as already exist in R. circularis, is apparently con<U+FB01>rmed by the develop
mental record. Were the electrical organ of R. radiata a mere vestige
of a larger structure which formerly existed, we should expect to
<U+FB01>nd the motor (electric) plate incomplete, or only occupying a portion
of the electric cup and the nerves proceeding to              either few in
                                                               it,
number or undergoing degenerative changes.          But instead of this we
have a relatively large bunch of extremely well-developed nerves pro
ceeding to the electric plate, which   is  not only complete, but extends
some distance over the rim of the cups.       Further, there      no indica
                                                                     is
tion of the walls of the cup having ever consisted of extremely com
plex lamelhe, such as we have in R. circular'is.         They consist of a.
nearly solid mass of muscular tissue, scarcely to be distinguished
from the unaltered adjacent muscular <U+FB01>bres. The electric cup of
R. radiate may in fact, when its structure alone         considered, be said
                                                          is
to be a muscular <U+FB01>bre which has been enlarged at one end to support
a greatly overgrown motor plate. But the development of the electric
cups  is even more suggestive than their structure.       Had the muscular
<U+FB01>bres in R. radiata assumed the form of clubs before the young skate
escaped from the egg capsule      ;    had the clubs been rapidly trans
formed into electric cups; and had the cups soon after reaching com
pletion begun to disappear, the evidence in favour of degeneration
would have been complete. But, as has been indicated, the conversion
of the muscular <U+FB01>bres into an electric organ         late in beginning, and
                                                     is
the clubs having appeared, pass slowly through a prolonged series of
intermediate stages before they eventually assume the cup form.
Further, as has already been mentioned, in the largest specimens of
R. radiate examined no evidence was found of retrogressive changes,
either in the cup proper, or in the numerous nerves passing to its
electric plate. Hence    it  may be inferred that the electric organ of
R. radiata, notwithstanding its apparent uselessness and its extreme]             y

  In         papers
         these          have consideredI  incidentally the advantages
gained by differentiating  and integrating with regard to the quanti
ties which are independent of the leading variable.     In the present
communication              I
                   enter upon this subject more systematically, as it
evidently admits of wide extension.

                                             (Abstract)
   The results of this paper may be summarised as follows :—
   The author examines critically certain rules given by Mr. C.
Meldrnm for handling ships during hurricanes in the South Indian
Ocean, by means both of published observations and from personal
inspection of many unpublished records in the Observatory at
Mauritius.   The result con<U+FB01>rms the value of Mr. Meldrum’s rules;
and the author then develops certain explanations, which have been
partially given by Meldrum, adds slightly to the rules for handling

 1888.]    for  handling   Shipsin   the Sout/zern  Indian  Ocean.       315
ships, and correlates the whole with the modern methods of meteor
ology.
   As an example, a hurricane is taken which blew near Mauritius on
February 11, 12, and 13, 1861, and the history of every ship to which
the rules might apply is minutely investigated.        The result, dividing
Meldrum’s rules shortly into three parts, is as follows :—
   Rule 1. Lie to with increasing south-east wind till the barometer
has fallen 6-lOths of an inch.      Seven cases, rule right in every case.
   Rule 2. Run to north-west when the barometer has fallen 6-10ths
of an inch. Three cases, two failures, one success.
   Rule 3. Lie to with increasing north-east or east wind and a falling
barometer.     Seven cases, rule right in every instance.
   Rule 2 was exceptionally unfortunate in this case, as the path of the
central vortex moved in a very uncommon and irregular manner. At
the same time, in any case, it appears to be about equally hazardous to
follow this rule or to remain hove to.
   The following statements are then examined in detail :—
   The shape of all hurricanes is usually oval, not circular.      An elabo
rate examination is made of hurricanes on 60 different days, in 18
different tropical cyclones in \ arious parts of the world, with the
following results :—
   1. Out of 60 days, cyclones were apparently circular on only four
occasions, and then the materials are very scanty.
   2. The shape was oval on the remaining 56 days, but the ratio of the
longer and shorter diameter of the ovals very rarely exceeded 2 to 1.
   3. The centres of the cyclones were usually displaced towards some
one side.    No rule can be laid down for the direction of displacement,
and in fact the direction varies during the progress of the same
cyclone.    The core of a hurricane is nearly as oval as any other
portion.
   4. The longer diameter of the ovals may lie at any angle with
reference to the path of the cyclone ; but a considerable proportion lie
nearly in the same line as the direction of the path.
   5. The association of wind with the oval form is such that the
direction of the wind is usually more or less along the isobars, and
more or less incurved.      This is the almost invariable relation of wind
to isobars all over the world.
   From an examination of the whole it is provred conclusively that
no rule is possible for determining more than approx/malely the position
of the central 'vorfez of a cyclone by any observations at a. single slalion.
   The relation of ahurrieane to the south-east trade is then discussed,
and it is shown that there is always what may hecalled “ a belt of inten
                    ”
si<U+FB01>ed trade wind      on the southern side of a cyclone, while the hurri
cane is moving westwards.        In this belt a ship experiences increasing
south-east winds and squalls of rain, with a falling barometer, but is not

  316     <U+FB01>feldrum’s Rules for  the Southern   Indian Ocean.   [June 14,
 within   the true storm <U+FB01>eld.   The dif<U+FB01>culties and uncertainties as to
 handling a ship in this belt are greatly increased by the facts that
 the longer diameter of the oval form of the cyclones usually lies east
 and west, and that there is no means of telling towards which side
 of the oval the vortex is displaced.
    The greater incurvature of the wind in rear than in front of hurri
 canes in the Southern Indian Ocean is next considered, and then facts
 are collected from other hurricane countries con<U+FB01>rmatory of Meldrum’s
 rules for the Mauritius.
    Knipping and Doberck in the China Seas <U+FB01>nd little incurvature of
 the wind in front, but much in rear of typhoons.
    Mr. Wilson <U+FB01>nds in the Bay of Bengal that north-east winds
 prevail over many degrees of longitude to the north, i.e., in front of
a cyclone; and this is analogous to the belt of intensi<U+FB01>ed trade so
characteristic of Mauritius hurricanes.
   Padre Vi<U+FB01>ez <U+FB01>nds at Havana that the incurvature of hurricane
winds is very slight in front, and very great in rear.
   The author then details further researches on the nature of cyclones,
which bear on the rules for handling ships.
    1. Indications derived from the form and motion of clouds.      It is
shown that the direction of the lower clouds is usually more nearly
eight points from the bearing of the vortex than the surface wind;
but as the direction varies with the height of the clouds, and as this
height can only be estimated, this fact is not of much value.
   2. Looking at the vertical       succession of wind currents in the
Southern Indian Ocean, if the march of the upper clouds over the
south-east trade is more from the east, then the cyclone will pass to
the north of the observer; but if the upper clouds move more from
the south than the surface wind, then the hurricane will pass to the
south of the observer.
   3. As to the form and position of clouds; so soon as the upper
regions commence to be covered, the direction in which the cirrus
veil is densest gives approximately the bearing of the vortex. Later
on, the characteristic cloud bank of the hurricane appears, and the
greatest and heaviest mass of the bank will appear sensibly in the
direction of the vortex.
   The irregular motion of the centre of a cyclone is next discussed,
and it is shown that the centre often twists and sways about, in some
cases even describing a small loop.
   From all the facts relative to the nature of cyclones adduced in
this paper it is shown that the attempts which have been made—
   1. To estimate the track of a cyclone by projection ;
   2. To estimate the distance of a ship from the vortex, either by
taking into account the entire absolute fall, or by noting the rate of
fall, can lead to no useful result.

  A    series of revised rules for handling ships in hurricanes in any
part   of the world is given. Comparing these rules with the older ones
it will be remarked—
    1. That the rule for <U+FB01>nding approximately the bearing of the vortex
is slightly modi<U+FB01>ed.
                                                 ”
    2. That the great rules of the “laying to      tacks remain unaltered.
    3. That the greatest improvement is the recognition of the position
and nature of the belt of intensi<U+FB01>ed trade wind on the dangerous
side of a hurricane, where a ship experiences increasing wind, without
change of direction, and a falling barometer.       The old idea. that such
conditions show that a vessel is then necessarily exactly on the line
of advance of a hurricane is erroneous. She may, but she need not
be; and under no circumstances should she run till the barometer has
 fallen at least 6—10ths of an inch.
   41.  There are certain rules which hold for all hurricanes; but every
 district has a special series, due to its own local peculiarities.   Those
for   the  Southern  Indian Ocean  are  given in this paper.

   The experiments comprise determinations of the curve of magneti
sation at various temperatures, the magnetising force being increased,
that     to say, they are con<U+FB01>ned to a determination of the ascending
         is
curve of' magnetisation.   The temperature was always produced by
enclosing the object to be tested in    double copper casing with an
                                           a
air space between the two shells of the casing, and by heating the
casing from without by       bunsen burner.
                             a                 The temperature was
measured by determining the electrical resistance of a coil of cepper
wire.    The copper was <U+FB01>rst roughly tested to ascertain that its
                                                                   2   B   2

318                         Mr.   J. Hopkinson.                   [June 14,
temperature coef<U+FB01>cient did not deviate far from 00388 per degree
centigrade of its resistance at 20° (3.;       I was unable to detect that
the coef<U+FB01>cient deviated from         this  value in either direction.   The
temperature may therefore be taken as approximately accurate.
   The nickel had the form of a ring—<U+FB01>g. 1.               On this ring was
wound in one layer 83 convolutions of N0. 27 B.W.G. copper wire
carefully insulated with asbestos paper to serve as measurer of
temperature and as secondary or exploring coil. Over this again, a
layer of asbestos paper intervening, was wound a coil of 276 cou
volutions in <U+FB01>ve layers of No. 19 B.W.G. copper wire to serve as the
primary coil.
   The method of experiment was simply to pass a known current
through the primary, to reverse the same and observe the kick on a
ballistic galvanometer due to the current induced in the secondary.
At intervals the secondary was disconnected, and its resistance was
ascertained for a determination of temperature.               Knowing the
current it is easy to calculate the magnetising force, and knowing the
constants of the galvanometer it is easy to calculate the induction
per square centimetre. The practice was to begin by heating the
ring to a temperature at which it ceased to be magnetic, then to
lower the gas <U+FB02>ame to a certain extent and allow the apparatus to
stand for some time, half an hour or more, to allow the temperature
to become steady, then determine the temperature, then rapidly make
a series of observations with ascending force, lastly, determine the
temperature again. The ring was next demagnetised by a series of
reversals with diminishing currents. The <U+FB02>ame was further lowered,
and a second series of experiments was made.           It was then assumed
that the previous magnetisation would have a very small effect on
any subsequent experiment. .As the substance turned out to be far
from pure nickel, it is not thought worth while to give actual
readings. The results are given in the accompanying curves, Nos. 1
to 14, in which the abscissa; represent the magnetising forces per
linear centimetre, the ordinates the induction per square centimetre,
both in C.G.S. units. Curves l5 and 16 give the results of Professor
Rowland“ for pure nickel at the two temperatures at which he
 experimented.     In curves 17 to 20 are given the inductions in terms
 of the temperature for stated intensities of the magnetisiug force,
 the ordinates being the inductions, the abscisste the temperatures.
    An inspection of these curves reveals the following facts :—
    1. In my impure nickel much greater magnetising forces are
 required to produce the same induction than are required in Professor
 Rowland’s pure nickel.
        The portion of the curve which is concave upwards in my
 sample is less extensive and less marked than in his.

  3.   The magnetisation        of   my impure   nickel   disappears          about
310° C.
   4!. A little below the temperature of 310° C. the induction
diminishes very rapidly with increase of temperature.
   5. At lower temperatures still the induction increases with rise of
temperature for low forces, diminishes for high forces. This fact has
been observed by several experimenters.
   Speci<U+FB01>c Heat—The object here was simply to ascertain whether or
not there was marked change at the temperature when the nickel
ceases to be magnetic.    It appeared that this question could be best
answered by the method of cooling, and that it mattered little even
if it were roughly applied. A cylinder of nickel (<U+FB01>g. 2, Plate 13)
was taken, 5‘08 cm. diameter, 5'08 cm. high, having a circumferential
groove, 15‘9 mm. deep and 6'35 mm. wide. In this groove was wound
a copper wire, well insulated with asbestos, by the resistance of which
the temperature was determined. The cylinder was next enveloped in
many folds of asbestos paper to insure that the cooling should be slow,
and that consequently the temperature of the nickel should be fairly
 uniform and equal to that of the copper wire.     The whole was now
heated over a. bunsen lamp till the temperature was considerably
above 310° (1.; the lamp was next removed, and the times noted at
which the resistance of the copper wire was balanced by successive
values in the Wheatstone’s bridge. If 0 be the temperature, and t be
time, and if the speci<U+FB01>c heat be assumed constant, and the rate of
loss of heat proportional      to the excess of temperature,   In

VIII.    “
          Experiments on Carbon at high Temperatures and under
       great Pressures, and in contact with other Substances.”
       By the Hon. CHARLES A. PARSONS. Communicated by the
       Right Hon. the EARL OF ROSSE, F.R.S. Received June 13,
       1888.
   The primary object of these experiments was to obtain a dense
form of carbon which should be more durable than the ordinary
carbon when used in arc lamps, and at the same time to obtain a
material better suited for the formation of the burners of incandescent
lamps.
     There were a considerable number of experiments made in which
the conditions were somewhat alike, and many were almost repetitions
with slightly varying   pressures and temperatures.    They may, how
ever be divided into two distinct classes: the <U+FB01>rst in which a carbon
rod surrounded by a <U+FB02>uid under great pressure is electrically heated
by passing a large current through        it,
                                         the second in which the liquid
is replaced by various substances such as alumina, silica, lime, dzc.
   The arrangement of the experiment was as follows :—A massive
cylindrical steel mould of about        inches internal diameter and
                                         3
6  inches high was placed under     hydraulic press; the bottom of the
                                     a
mould was closed by spigot and asbestos-rubber packing—similar
                        a
to the gas-check in guns; the top was closed by a plunger similarly
packed; this packing was perfectly tight at all pressures. 1n the
spigot was a centrally bored hole into which the bottom end of the
carbon rod to be treated <U+FB01>tted, the top end of the carbon rod was con
nected electrically t0 the mould by a copper cap which also helped to
support the carbon rod in central position.
                             a                   The bottom block and
spigot were insulated electrically from the mould by asbestos, and the
loading wires from the dynamo being connected to the block and
mould respectively, the current passed along the carbon rod in the
interior of the mould.
                                 '
    The <U+FB02>uid was run in so as to cover the rod completely. The plunger
was then free to exert its pressure on the liquid without injuring the
carbon. The pressure in the mould was indicated by the gauge on
the press.

                            Emperimmls.         Class   I.
  Among the liquids tested were benzene, para<U+FB02>in, treacle, chloride
and bisulphide of carbon.
   The pressures in the mould during the several experiments were
maintained at from to 15 tons per square inch the initial size of the
                      5                                      ;
rod was in all cases i-inch, and the current from 100 to 300
amperes.

 1888.]       Carbon at high Temperatures and great Pressures.       321
    Results.—In some of these experiments a considerable quantity of
ga was generated, and the press had to be slightly slacked back
during the experiment to accommodate it and maintain the pressure
 constant.
    In all cases there was a soft friable black deposit of considerable
thickness on the carbon.
    In no case was the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the carbon rod increased by
this process. There was no change in appearance of the fracture, ex
cepting when chloride of carbon had been the <U+FB02>uid; it was greyer in
this   case.
    The rate of burning of samples placed in arc lamps was not
diminished by the process.       Various rates of deposition were tried,
but with the same result, and the conclusion seems to be that under
very high pressures, such as from 5 to 15 tons per square inch, the
deposit of' carbon by heat from hydrocarbons, chloride of carbon,
bisulphide of carbon, treacle, &c., is of a sooty nature, and unlike the
hard steel-grey deposit from the same liquids or their vapours at
atmosphcric or lower pressures.
                          Experiments.  Class II.
    In  these experiments the asbestos-rubber packing was omitted, the
plunger and spigot being an easy <U+FB01>t in the mould. A layer of coke
powder under the plunger formed the top electrical connexion with
the rod.
    No. 1. Silver sand or silica was run around the carbon rod, and
pressures of from 5 to 30 tons per square inch applied; the rod was
usually about i-inch diameter, and currents up to 300 ampéres
passed.
    Results—The silica was melted to the form of a small hen’s egg
around the rod.        When the current was increased to about 250
amperes      the 10d became altered to graphite, the greater the heat
apparently the softer the graphite. There was no action between the
silica and the carbon, the surface of the carbon remained black, and
there were no hard particles in or on the carbon rod.
    Other substances, such as an hydrated alumina and mixtures of
alumina and silica, gave the same results.
    The density of the carbon was considerably increased, in some cases
from normal at 1'6 to 2'2 and 2'4; in these cases the carbon appeared
very dense, much harder than the original carbon, and about as
hard as the densest gas-retort carbon.      No crystalline structure was
visible.
    The specimens were treated with solvents, and there appeared no
indication of the surrounding substance having penetrated the rod;
the carbon was undoubtedly consolidated by 30 per cent.

saturated with oil, soft crystals of graphite exuded from specimens
that had been kept for some weeks.
     No. 2. Pure hydrated alumina, carbonate and oxide of magnesia
and lime all rapidly destroyed the carbon red, by combining with it,
the hydrated alumina forming large volumes of gas of which it
appeared to be a constituent.           On account of the great diminution of
bulk, no analysis was made; the gas issued from the mould explo
sively at from 10 to 12 tons per square inch. The alumina was found
in a crystalline crust, like sugar, around where the rod had been.
 Hardness that of corundum, almost translucent.
     No.3. The following is the most interesting experiment of the
series    :—
     On the botton of the mould was a. layer of slaked lime about
 i-inch thick, over this silver sand 2 inches, then another layer of
lime of the same thickness as the former, <U+FB01>nally a layer of coke-dust,
and then the plunger. With a pressure of from 5 to 30 tons per square
inch in the mould, and the carbon of from 11 to 1"; diameter, currents
from 200 to 300 amperes were passed.
     In, from 10 to 30 minutes the current was generally interrupted by
the breaking or fusing of the rod, or by the action of the lime in
dissolving it at the top or bottom. On opening the mould when it had
cooled a little, the silica usually appeared to have melted to an egg
shaped mass, and mixed somewhat at the ends with the lime; the
surface of the carbon appeared acted on, and sometimes pitted and
crystalline in places ; silica adhered to the surface, and beneath, when
viewed under the microscope, appeared a globular cauli<U+FB02>ower-like
formation of a yellowish colour, resembling some specimens of
“   bort."*
    After several     days’ immersion in concentrated hydro<U+FB02>uoric acid, this
formation remained partly adherent to the carbon; on the surface of
the carbon was a layer or skin about {ith of an inch thick of great
hardness, on the outside grey, the fracture greyer than the carbon,
but having a shining coke-like appearance under the microscope.
     The powder scraped olf the surface of the rod has great hardness,
and will cut rock crystal when applied with a piece of metal faster
than emery powder. It has, under the microscope, the appearance
of bort, the minute particles seem to cling together; they are not
transparent as a rule, and though some such particles are found
among them, it is not clear that such are hard.
    When a piece of the skin has been rubbed against a diamond or
other hard body, the projecting or hard portions have a glossy coke
like    appearance.
    A   piece of the    skin will continue to scratch rock crystal for some
time without losing its edge.           It will scratch ruby, and when rubbed
    '  The bort-like powder is not acted on by hydro<U+FB02>uoric and nitric acids mixed.

for   ome time against it will wear grooves or facets upon it.     When
a cut diamond is rubbed on the surface of the skin, it will cut
through it into the carbon beneath, making a black line or opening
about {inch long; the facet on the diamond, originally gig-inch
diameter, will have its corners evenly rounded, and its polished
surface reduced to about one-half its original area; the appearance of
the edges is as if they had been rubbed down by a nearly equally
hard substance.
    The subject of the last experiment is scarcely su<U+FB01>iciently investi
gated to warrant any de<U+FB01>nite conclusions.
    The substance in the several ways it has so far been tested seems
to possess a hardness of nearly if not quite the <U+FB01>rst quality.        The
minuteness of the particles, which appear more or less cemented
together, and are less cohesive after the action of acid, make it very
dif<U+FB01>cult to determine their distinctive features.
    The mode of formation is not inconsistent with the conditions of
pressure, temperature, and the presence of moisture, lime, silica, and
other substances as they appear to have existed in the craters or
spouts of the Cape Diamond Mines at some epoch.
    From the few experiments that have been made it appears that at
pressures below 3 tons per square inch, the deposit does not possess
the same hardness, though somewhat similar in appearance.
    What part the lime and silica play, whether the former only
supplies moisture and oxygen which combine with the carbon, or
whether the presence of lime is necessary to the action, is not clear.
    We may, however, observe that so far it seems as if the lime and
moisture combining with the carbon form a gas or liquid at great
pressure, which combining with the silica, forms some compound of
 lime, silica, and carbon, or perhaps pure carbon only, of great
hardness.

   The digestive apparatus of Uraster rubens (one of the Asteridea) is
brie<U+FB02>y described as follows :—The capacious mouth, found upon the
under side, leads into a short oesophagus, which opens into a wider
sacculated stomach with thin distensible walls.        There are <U+FB01>ve large
stomach sacs; each of these is situated in a radial position and passes
into the base of the corresponding ray. Each sac or pouch is kept in
its place by two retractor muscles <U+FB01>xed to the median ridge of the.
ray, which lie between the two ampullse or water-sacs. Passing

towards the aboral side, the stomach forms the well-known penta
           “                  The pyloric sac gives 05' <U+FB01>ve radial ducts, each
gonal        pyloric sac.”
of which divides into two tubules bearing a number of lateral
follicles, whose secretions are poured into the pyloric sac and
intestine.        The author has proved the nature of their secretion to be
similar to that of the pancreatic <U+FB02>uid of the Vertebrate (‘ Edinburgh,
Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ No. 125, p. 120). Recently, the secretion found in
the <U+FB01>ve pouches of the stomach (of Uraster) has been submitted to a
careful chemical and microscopical examination.            With a quantity of
the secretion, obtained from a large number of star<U+FB01>shes, the follow
ing experiments        were performed       :—
    1.   The clear liquid from these sacs was treated with a hot dilute
solution of sodium hydrate.              On the addition of pure hydrochloric
acid, a slight <U+FB02>aky precipitate was obtained, after standing seven and
a half hours.         These <U+FB02>akes when examined beneath the microscope
 (ff-in. obj.) were seen to consist of various crystalline forms, the
predominant forms being those of the rhomb.                  On treating the
 secretion alone with alcohol rhombic crystals are deposited, which
 are soluble in water.         When these crystals are treated with nitric
 acid and then gently heated with ammonia, reddish-purple murexide
is obtained, crystallised in microscopic prisms.
    2. Another method was used for testing the secretion.               It (the
secretion)       was  boiled  in  distilled  water and evaporated carefully to
 dryness.       The residue obtained was treated with absolute alcohol and
 <U+FB01>ltered. Boiling water was poured upon the residue, and to the
 aqueous <U+FB01>ltrate an excess of acetic acid was added.            After standing
 some hours, crystals of uric acid were deposited and easily recognised
 by the chemico-microscopical tests mentioned above.
     The above alcoholic <U+FB01>ltrate was tested for urea.          First of all, the
 alcoholic solution was diluted with distilled water, and boiled over a
 water-bath until all the alcohol had vaporised. The warm aqueous
 solution (A) remaining was now tested for urea, in the following
 manner :—
     (a.) On the addition of a solution of mercuric nitrate to a portion
        of the above solution, no white precipitate was obtained.
     (17.)   To another portion of the solution (A), a solution of sodium
        hypochlorite was added.             No bubbles of nitrogen were dis
        engaged.
     (c.) No crystals of urea nitrate were formed in a small quantity of
         the solution (A) [concentrated by evaporation] after the addition
         of nitric acid.
     (d.) The distillation of       a small quantity of the solution (A) with
         pure    sodium    carbonate,    in a chemically clean Wurtz’s <U+FB02>ask
         attached to a small Liebig’s condenser, failed to produce in the
                                                                                '

   The above tests clearly prove the entire absence of urea in the
secretion under examination.        N o guanin or calcium phosphate could
be detected inthe secretion, although the author has found the latter
compound as an ingredient in the renal secretions of the Cephalopoda
and the Lamellibranchiata        (‘ Edinburgh, Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 14,
p. 230).
   From this investigation,      the isolation of uric acid proves the
renal function of the <U+FB01>ve pouches of the stomach of the Asteridea.
    II.  The Salivary Glands of Sepia o<U+FB02>icinalis anl Patella vulgata.
   The author has already made a study of the nephridia and
                       ”
the so-called “livers     in both these forms of the Invertebrate. (see
the memoirs, Zoe. cit).       Since then he has studied the chemico
physiological   reactions   of  the secretion produced by the salivary
glands of the cuttle-<U+FB01>sh and the limpet, these organisms representing
two important orders of the Mollusca.
                            (1.) Sepia. o<U+FB01>icinalis.
   There are two pairs of salivary glands in Sepia o<U+FB02>icinalis.          The
posterior pair,    which   are  the   largest,  lie on  either  side of  the
(esophagus.    The secretion of the posterior glands is poured into the
(Bsophagus, while the secretion of the smaller anterior pair of glands
passes directly into the buccal cavity.        A quantity of the secretion
was extracted by using several freshly killed cuttle-<U+FB01>shes.          It was
alkaline to test-papers. A portion of the secretion was added to a
small quantity of starch, the starch being converted into glucose
sugar in 15 minutes. The presence of glucose was proved by the
formation of red cuprous oxide by the action of Fehling's solution.
The soluble zymase (ferment) contained in the secretion (which is
capable of causing the hydration of starch), was isolated by precipi
 tating the secretion with dilute normal phosphoric acid, adding lime
 water and then <U+FB01>ltering.      The precipitate produced was dissolved in
 distilled water and reprecipitated by alcohol.             This precipitate
 converts starch into glucose sugar.
    When a drop of the clear secretion is allowed to fall into a beaker
 containing dilute acetic acid, stringy <U+FB02>akes of mucin are easily
 obtained. The presence of mucin was con<U+FB01>rmed by several well
 known tests.
    Another portion of the secretion was distilled (with the utmost
 care) with dilute sulphuric acid, and to the distillate ferric chloride
 solution was added, which gave a red colour, indicating the presence
 of snlphocyanates.
    The inorganic constituent, as far as the author         could make   out,

consists only of phosphate               of calcium.’     No calcium carbonate              could
be detected.
   There is much in favour of the supposition that the diastatic ferment
in  these secretions is produced as the result of the action of nerve
<U+FB01>bres (from the inferior buccal ganglion) upon the protoplasm of the
epithelium cells of the glands.
   The author intends to examine various organs in other genera and
species of the Decapoda, especially those inhabiting the Japanese
seas.
                                      (2.) Patella vulgata.
   The two salivary glands of Patella are well-marked and situated
anteriorly to the pharynx, lying beneath the pericardium on one side
and the renal and anal papillae on the other.                    They are of a yellowish
brown    colour     and      give  05‘  four  ducts.     The    secretion   of these glands
was examined            by the same method applied to the salivary glands
of Sepia q<U+FB02>icimilis, and with similar results.
   The following table represents the constituents found in the salivary
secretions of the two orders of the Mollusca already investigated :—

                                  (Abstract.)
    Movements as signs of brain action have long been studied by the
 physiologist; but before proceeding to give an account of the visible
 evolution of voluntary movement in man, it is necessary to de<U+FB01>ne the
 di<U+FB01>erent classes of movements seen, indicating the criteria by which
 the observer may be guided in the examples before him. Movements
 may be classed according to the parts moving, the time, and the
 quantity of each movement.        These are the only intrinsic attributes
 of such acts. If the nerve-centres which send stimuli to the muscles
 are acting in equilibrio, the static outcome is seen in the postures
 resulting in the body ; hence postures are signs of the ratios of action
 in the nerve-centres, and indicate their present state or mode of
 action. Typical postures and movements are described.         A variation
 in the ratios of action in the centres leads to visible movement.
 Certain postures and movements are found by experience to corre
 spond to certain recognised brain states.       Movements may occur in
 combinations and in series ; special combinations and series of move
 ments determine the outcome of the action of which they are com
 ponent parts. It is shown that the time of action in the various
 centres thus determines the outcome of the action, and is itself con
 trolled by impressions received through the senses. When movements
 are seen, not controlled by present circumstances, they are probably
 the result of antecedent or inherited impressions; such are called
 spontaneous.
                 Section II.  Evolution of Movements in Man.
    The new-born infant presents constant movement in all its parts
while it is awake, and this is not controlled by impressions from
without.       Graphic tracings of such movements are given.          This
spontaneous      movement in the infant appears to be of great physio
                                            “ microkinesis."  It is argued
logical importance, and is here termed
that the mode of brain action which produces microkinesis is analogous
to the action producing spontaneous movements in all young animals,
and to the modes of cell-growth which produce circumnutation in

330      Muscular   .lloveme'nts in  Man and their Evolution.    [June 21,
young seedling plants. It is argued that as circumnutation becomes
modi<U+FB01>ed by external forces to the modes of movement termed
heliotropism, geotropism, &c., so microkinesis in the infant is replaced
by the more complicated modes of brain action as evolution proceeds.
    The conditions of movement are then described, as seen at succes
sive stages of development of the child, and it is shown that they
become less spontaneous, and more under control of stimuli acting
upon the child from without, while the phenomena termed memory
and imitation are evolved.
   Section  III.   Properties of Nerve-centres  and their Modes of Action.
     From observations made, descriptions are given of the modes of
action and properties of nerve-centres in adult age, such descriptions
being given in terms implying visible movements. Impressionability,
imitation, and retentiveness are thus described.          Nerve-centres are
                     ”
said to be “ free when only slightly stimulated. Delayed expression
of impressions are seen when the visible outcome is delayed after
the stimulus which produced it. Double-action is said to occur when
a local effect and a distant one, occur from one impression.           Com
pound cerebral action is said to occur, when the study of the visible
movements indicates that successive unions of centres are in action,
leading to a visible outcome well adapted to the primary stimulus
which produced the series. When a slight stimulus leads to a spread
ing area of movements producing considerable force, the phenomenon
is termed reinforcement.
    From observations made, two hypotheses are put forward. It is
 suggested that when a well co-ordinatcd movement follows a slight
 stimulus, the impression produces temporary unions among the
 centres, preparing them for the special combinations and series of
 actions which are seen to follow.        Such unions among nerve-centres
 appear to be formed when a period of cerebral inhibition, produced
 by a word of command, is seen to be followed by a co-ordinated series
 of acts.    A graphic tracing indicating suspension of microkinesis to
 the stimulus of sight and sound is given. It is further suggested that
 the brain action corresponding to thought, is the formation of func
 tional unions among cells, whose outcome is seen in the movements
 which express the thought, or its physical representation. Properties
 similar to those described in brain centres may be illustrated in
 modes of growth.         Intelligence is then not apr0perty of the brain,
per    so, but  for  its  manifestation  certain modes of brain action are
 necessary.      In   the special postures and movements described, a
 number of physical signs of brain states are offered to the clinical
 observer.

     The experiments described in the following paper were undertaken
 in continuation of those made by Dr. Main in the winter 1886—87,
 and described by him in a paperf read before the Royal Society
 the following summer. The investigation is by no means complete,
 but the results hitherto obtained seem to us suf<U+FB01>ciently novel and
important to be worthy of being put on record, while we hope to

    Main found that a bar of ice, which had been formed in a mould,‘
yielded slowly but continuously to tension, though kept at a tempera
ture some degrees below freezing point.              We began work under the
impression that the rate of extension depended mainly on the tem
perature and tension, and that the chief di<U+FB01>iculty lay in keeping the
temperature constant. But by a happy chance our very <U+FB01>rst experi
ment showed us that not merely the rate, but even the very existence
of the extension depended on the structure of the ice. And this is
a matter which seems to have been quite disregarded by previous
experimentersi

took a bar cut from the clear ice formed on the surface of a bath of
water, and frdze its ends on to blocks of ice <U+FB01>tting the two conical
collars through which the tension is applied.               To avoid any question
as to the ice giving way in the collars, where it is subjected to
pressure as well as tension—the bar was pierced near either end by
a steel needle <U+FB01>rmly frozen in, and the measurements were taken
between the projecting ends of these needles.                   We found to our
astonishment that the stretching was almost nil, though the tension
was decidedly greater than that usually applied by Main. There was
a slight extension at <U+FB01>rst, but during the last <U+FB01>ve days the extension
observed was at the mean rate of only 0'00031 mm. per hour per
length of 10 cm., and this may well be attributed to the rise of
temperature which took place.             The rigidity cannot have been due
to the cold, for during the             last  24 hours the temperature was
between -—1° and —2°.i              After the experiment, the ice was ex
amined under the polariscope, and found to be a single regular
crystal showing the coloured rings and black cross very well.
The optic axis was at right angles to the length of the bar. This
experiment showed it was a very necessary precaution to take the
measurements between needles <U+FB01>xed in the bar itself.                    For whether
the   bar  extended    or not,  the movement     of the   index  H  (<U+FB01>g. 2), showed
   '  The mould produced a round bar of ice 24 cm. in length and 2'8 cm. in
 diameter, with a conical expansion at the lower end to <U+FB01>t into an iron collar C (<U+FB01>g. 2),
 through which the tension could be applied.      The other end of the bar was frozen
 on to ice <U+FB01>lling a similar collar B. These iron collars were faced with carefully
 worked brass plates, and Main determined the extension by measuring the distance
 between the plates with callipers.—July 6, 1888.

a decided separation of the collars due to the plasticity of the conical
pieces of ice therein.
   We next took a bar of ice formed in the mould, applied tension and
took measurements in the same way. The extension was at the rate
of 0'048 mm. per hour per length of 10 cm.     The crystalline structure
of this ice was highly irregular.   As one principal object of our ex
periments lay in their application to the theory of glaciers, it had
now become obviously most important to test actual glacier ice. We
therefore drove over to the Morteratsch glacier, which is now readily
accessible from St. Moritz even in the winter, and obtained some
specimens from the natural ice caves at the foot of the glacier.
   We tested three pieces, which were quite suf<U+FB01>cient to disprove the
common notions, that glacier ice is only plastic under pressure, not
under tension, and that regelation is an essential part of the process.
They showed at the same time the extraordinary variability of the
phenomenon.      The <U+FB01>rst extended at a rate of from 0'013 mm. to
0'022 mm. per hour per length of 10 cm., the variations in speed being
attributable to temperature.      The second piece began at a rate of
0'016 mm. and gradually slowed down till it reached at the same
temperature a rate of 00029 mm., at which point it remained
tolerany constant, except for temperature variations, till a greater
tension was applied. The third piece on the contrary began at the
rate of 0012 mm., increased its speed with greater tension to 0026 mm.,
and stretched faster and faster with unaltered tension, till it reached
the extraordinary speed of 1‘88 mm. per hour per length of 10 cm.
We put on a check by reducing the tension slightly, whereupon the
speed fell at once to 0'35 mm. and gradually declined to 0043 mm.
The lowest temperature reached during our experiments, except with
the intractable bath ice, was with this specimen. During 12 hours
with a maximum temperature —9° and a mean temperature probably
 —10'5°, the rate under the light tension of 1'45 kilo. per sq. cm. was
0‘0065 mm.
   These three pieces were composed of a number of crystals varying
in thickness from two or three millimetres up to thirty or even a

hundred.     These crystals are the “glacier grains     (gletscherlciimer),
which play such a large part in glacier literature.        Glacier ice is
a sort of conglomerate of these grains, differing, however, from a
conglomerate proper in that there is no matrix, the grains <U+FB01>tting
each other perfectly.   In the winter, at any rate, the ice on the sides
of the glacier caves looks quite homogeneous.       But, when a piece is
broken off and exposed to the sun’s rays, the diiferent grains become
visible to the naked eye, being separated probably by thin <U+FB01>lms of
water. Though the optical structure of each grain is found under
the polariscope to be perfectly uniform, the bounding surfaces are
utterly irregular, and are generally curved.     The optic axes too of

neighbouring grains seem to be arranged quite at random. Owing to
the structure being so complex, we failed to trace any relation
 between the arrangement of the crystals and the rapidity of extension.
 It is true that the most rigid pieceof the three was composed of
 small crystals, while the most plastic contained one very large crystal ;
but this was perhaps accidental.                Fortunately, we were able to
 obtain ice of a more regular structure, which has already thrown a
 little light on the action at the interfaces of the crystals, and o<U+FB01>ers an
 attractive <U+FB01>eld to further investigation.
  -
     Some of the ice of the St. Moritz lake is built up of vertical
 columns,“ from a centimetre downwards in diameter, and in length
 equal to the thickness of the clear ice, 11.0., a foot or more.              A hori
zontal section, exposed to the sun for a few minutes, shows the irregular
mosaic pattern of the divisions between the columns.                 The thickness
of each column is not perfectly uniform.            Sometimes indeed one thins
out to a sharp-point at the lower end.                 Each column is a single
crystal, and the optic axes are‘generally nearly horizontal.                    Some
experiments on freezing water in a bath, lead us to attribute this
curious structure to the <U+FB01>rst layer of ice having been formed rapidly,
in air, for instance, below -—6° C. We found that if the <U+FB01>rst layer had
been formed slowly, and was therefore homogeneous                    with the axis
vertical, 9. very cold night would only increase the thickness of the
ice, while maintaining its regularity.
    We applied tension to a bar of lake ice carefully cut parallel to the
columns. It stretched indeed, but excessively slowly.                During seven
days it stretched at the rate of only 0'0004 mm. per hour per length
of 10 cm., though at one time the temperature of the surrounding
air went up above zero. The tension was 2 kilos. per sq. cm.                     This
slight extension may well be attributed to the tension not being
exactly parallel to the interfaces of the columns. This experiment
corroborates our <U+FB01>rst result, that a single crystal will not stretch at
right angles to its optic axis. We next cut a bar at about 45° to the
length of the columns, and the difference was very manifest.                  During
80 hours‘nnder a tension of 2'75 kilos. per sq. cm., it extended at the
rate of 0015 mm. per hour per length of 10 cm., nearly 40 times as
fast.
    An icicle is an example of ice formed of very minute crystals
irregularly arranged. We found that an icicle under a tension of
2‘2 kilos. per sq. cm. stretched at the rate of 0003 mm. per hour per
length of 10 cm.         This is very slow, especially as the temperature
    " This was the case in all pieces obtained from one end of the    lake, where men
were cutting ice for storage purposes, whether new ice or old.    In  a part, however,
which had frozen a few days earlier, further out from the shore,      we found much
larger crystals with the axes nearly vertical but not quite parallel to each other.—

 1888.]          On the Plasticity of Glacier and other Ice.          335
 was high, averaging —1° 0., yet it is dif<U+FB01>cult to suggest any theoreti
 cal reason for an increae in the number of interfaces producing a
 decrease in the plasticity.
    We tried further two experiments on compression of ice, the
 pressure being applied to three nearly cubical pieces at once.        Of
 three pieces of glacier ice, under a pressure of 3'2 kilos. per sq. cm.,
 the mean rates of contraction during <U+FB01>ve days were respectively
 0'035 mm., 0'056 mm., and 0007 mm. per hour per length of 10 cm.
 These <U+FB01>gures show that while the plasticity varies enormously in
‘di<U+FB01>erent specimens, the rate of distortion is of the same order of mag
 nitude, whether the force applied be a pull or a thrust.
    The other experiment was on three pieces of lake ice, applying the
 pressure in a direction parallel to the columns. The contraction was
 scarcely perceptible.    Under a pressure of 3'7 kilos. per sq. cm., the
 mean rate of   the three pieces during four days was 0001 mm. per hour
 per length of 10 cm. To <U+FB01>x the blocks of ice in position, we found it
 necessary to cover their ends with paper frozen on, and the small con
 traction observed may well be attributed to the yielding of the <U+FB01>lms
 of irregular ice with which the paper was attached.         This view is
 supported by the fact that nearly the whole of the contraction took
 place in the <U+FB01>rst 36 hours.
    We have now shown by direct experiment that ordinary ice, con
 sisting of an irregular aggregation of crystals, exhibits plasticity,
 both under pressure and under tension,-at temPeratures far below the
 freezing point—in the case of tension at any rate down to —9° at
 least, and probably much lower—and also that a single uniform
 crystal will not yield continuously either to pressure or tension
  when applied in a direction at right angles to the optic axis.
 We fully intended to test a crystal under tension applied along the
 optic axis; but we were unsuccessful in obtaining a crystal longer
 in the axis than perhaps 8 cm., and when we had decided to be
 content with that length, a thaw put a stop to all further operations.
 We have, however, very little doubt that a crystal would refuse to
 yield either to pressure or to tension in whatever direction they were
 applied.
    The following reasoning seems tolerany conclusive as far as it goes.
 We <U+FB01>rst assume the axiom that, if two systems of stresses produce
 each by itself no continuous yielding, superposition of the two will
 likewise produce no continuous yielding.        This will probably be
 admitted when we add the proviso that, when the nature of the
 resultant stresses is found, their magnitude is to be reduced to the
 same value as that of the simple stresses which are known to be
 inactive. Take then a cube of ice, two of whose faces are perpen
 dicular to the optic axis. Apply tension to one of the other pairs of
 faces.   This according to our experiments produces no extension.

336              Messrs. J.  C. McConnel and D.       A. Kidd.     [June 21,
Of course we do not take into account the slight elastic yielding.
Apply an equal tension to the other pair of faces which are parallel
to the axis. There is still no extension by the axiom. Now it can
hardly be supposed that an uniform hydrostatic pressure could pro
duce continuous change of form.           Apply then a pressure of such
magnitude as to neutralise      the  two tensions. We have then remain
ing only a pressure along the optic axis, producing no continuous
yielding.
    In a similar way it may be shown that tension along the optic axis
 would produce no continuous yielding.         It is true that the reasoning
 cannot be extended to pressures and tensions oblique to the optic axis.
 But if the plasticity observed had been due to the majority of crystals
 extending, while a certain number remained unchanged, there would
 surely have been numerous cracks found in every case; while as a
 matter of fact such cracks were only found in two cases, and then
they were very slight.      Hence, while we think it desirable to experi
 ment further in the matter, we feel tolerably con<U+FB01>dent that single
 crystals of ice are not plastic, and we attribute the apparent plasticity
 of glacier ice to some action at the interfaces of the crystals.         But
 we  are  not at present inclined   to venture any   opinion as to the nature
 of this action.
    The variation of plasticity with the temperature is of great interest
both for the theory of glaciers and for the explanation of the plasticity
 itself, but it is so dif<U+FB01>cult to disentangle the temperature variations
proper from the much larger alterations due to structural changes,
that our experiments throw very little light on this point. In the case
of the glacier ice in Experiment 7 the rate seems to have become
tolerably constant except for temperature changes. While at —3'5° the
rate was 0'0029, two days before and two days afterwards it was
about 0'0020 at —5°, and a few days earlier 00013 at —8°.              In the
icicle, when the temperature variations seemed paramount, the rate at
 -2° was 00028, and at —O'2° 00034:. This is a much smaller change
than we should have expected.          In the case of compression the in<U+FB02>u
ence of temperature seems more strongly marked.                 In all three
 pieces the rate rose at —3° to about ten times its value at —5°.         An
increase which takes place in three pieces simultaneously can hardly
be attributed to structural changes independent of the temperature.
    The change in the rate of extension, produced by an alteration of
the tension, was in every case altogether out of proportion to the
magnitude of the latter.       In the following table are collected all the
instances which occurred :—

1888.]        On the Plasticity             of Glacier and other Ice.         339
   It will be interesting to make some numerical comparison between
the <U+FB01>gures we have given and the plasticity actually observed in the
motion of glaciers.     Perhaps the most striking proof of the existence
of plasticity is the great increase of velocity from the side to the
centre of a glacier. A number of measurements on this point have
been collected by Heim (‘ Gletscherkunde,’ p. 147).      The most rapid
increase he mentions among the glaciers of the Alps is on the Rhone
glacier, on a line 2300 metres above the top of the icefall.          At
100 metres from the western bank the mean yearly motion, 1874 to
1880, was 12'9 metres; at 160 metres           from the _bank it was
43'25 metres.     This gives an increase of velocity in each metre
                                                                         '

   When 6t is very small, the ratio of 'r'--'r to Etis the rate of increase
of the distance between A and B. So, if we take any two points of
the glacier at unit distance, the rate of increase of the distance
between them will be greatest when the line joining them is at 45°
to the direction of motion, and this maximum value will be equal to
one half the dilference of the velocities of two points situated abreast
of each other and also at unit distance.
   Thus the maximum rate of extension in the case we have taken on
the Rhone glacier is 00029 mm. per hour per length of 10 cm.                This,
be it remembered, is the most rapid extension selected from a large
number of measurements on di<U+FB01>erent glaciers and at diiferent times,
and yet only one of the three specimens of glacier ice showed a rate
less than this, and that was under one-third of the breaking tension.
The larger the specimen, the greater average plasticity would it dis
play; for the addition of a small piece like our second specimen, for
instance, would suf<U+FB01>ce to make a long rigid bar appear very plastic.
 Hence the glacier itself would be far more plastic than most small
specimens taken at random from its mass.             It would seem, therefore,
that neither the presence of crevasses nor a thawing temperature are
essential conditions of the motion of a glacier. But that crevasses
are found is not surprising, when we consider the rotten state of the
ice during the summer and the certainty that a crack, however small,
once formed will continue as long as the tension exists.              We believe
further that the stresses produced in a glacier by its own weight are
comparable with those employed in our experiments.
                         Description of Apparatus.
   We had two sets of apparatus in operation. The <U+FB01>rst was that
employed by Dr. Main, <U+FB01>gured and fully described in his paper.
We reproduce his <U+FB01>gure unaltered, though we made a few alterations
in the surrounding boxes. As we expected at <U+FB01>rst that our chief
dif<U+FB01>culty would be keeping the temperature constant, we made special
arrangements for overcoming this. To secure a large heat capacity we

introduced two tins, <U+FB01>lled with a strong solution of salt, into the inner
box, slightly altering its shape and increasing its size for this purpose.
A broad shallow tin occupied the spare space at the top, and a tall
tin occupied all the available space by the side of the ice between A
and L (<U+FB01>g. 2). The space between the two boxes was <U+FB01>lled with

wood shavings, except between K and M.               Here a wooden partition
P was inserted to the left of the vertical connecting rod. The space
between K and P was <U+FB01>lled with wood shavings.                To allow the lever
to move freely, it passed through a wooden tube loosely packed with
cotton-wool.    The outer space between P and M was made fairly
air-tight, and the opening through which the lower lever emerged
was also plugged with cotton-wool.
   The capacity of the inner chamber was about 60 litres, while the
two tins contained about 25 litres of solution.           The inner chamber
was thus jacketed on all sides with a layer, from 10% to 20 cm. in
thickness, of which from 4 to 6 cm. was solid wood and the rest
wood shavings.      To secure uniformity' of temperature the back of
the inner chamber was lined with thick sheet-copper.                 Originally
the front was similarly provided, a small aperture being cut for the
cathetometer readings. But after the <U+FB01>rst experiment this was found
very inconvenient and was discarded. Access to the box was obtained
from the front, the space between the doors of the two boxes being <U+FB01>lled
with a movable pad stuffed with shavings. The inner door occupied
about half the front of the ice-chamber. With these arrangements
the temperature of the interior altered very slowly, often not more
than a degreee in 24 hours, though no special precautions were taken
to keep the temperature of the room constant.
   We were not so successful in maintaining uniformity of temperature.
The minimum thermometer was hung at the back of the chamber
on a level with the middle of the ice.            The maximum was placed
 with its bulb at the bottom of the chamber at the end removed from
the tin. And we often found that the temperature at the time, shown
by the maximum thermometer, was one or one and a half degrees lower
than that shown by the minimum.           In the temperatures given in the
tables allowance is made for this.           We found, however, that the
variations in the plasticity due to the temperature were far exceeded
by others, due probably to changes in the crystalline structure of the
ice.    In explanation of the considerable variation of temperature
occasionally recorded in the tables, we must add that, in order to
raise or lower the temperature, the inner chamber was sometimes left
 wholly or partially open.     The front of the box was close by an open
 window, and was generally exposed to a decidedly lower temperature
 than the back, so that opening the doors to take the readings would
 seldom raise the internal temperature materially.
    The bar of ice for an experiment was roughly sawn out and then
 shaped more carefully with a knife.        A hole was bored near each end
 with a hot steel knitting needle.         This was found to be the only
 method of making a hole free from the risk of splitting the ice.            In
 each hole was frozen a short piece of steel knitting needle with the

ends projecting slightly. In the later experiments we used pieces of
glass tube or red for needles, to obviate any possible exaggeration of
the extension through the needle bending in the ice. The glass had
the further advantage of being a bad conductor of heat.         We found
that, when air above freezing point entered the chamber during the
taking of a reading, the steel needles were apt to work loose, although
the body of the ice had not time to materially rise in temperature.
Such readings are of course discarded. The two conical collars were
<U+FB01>lled with ice by freezing water therein.     The upper collar was taken
out and inverted, and its brass plate levelled. Then the bar' was
carefully placed in a vertical position and frozen on.        The bar was
next hung in position in the chamber and frozen on to the ice on the
lower collar 'in situ.
    In the <U+FB01>rst experiment the measurement of the distance between
the upper and lower needles was made with a cathetometer.          On the
two ends of each needle were glued pieces of paper, on each of which
<U+FB01>ne ink cross lines had been drawn.        The cathetometer was not of
the ordinary construction and merits a. short description, as, though
in practice it was not very successful, in principle it has, we believe,
several advantages over the ordinary form.           The stand consists
of a vertical rod supported by three levelling screws.         On this rod
slides a metal block, provided with a clamp and slow-motion screw.
The telescope rests on this block, being movable through ninety
degrees about a vertical axis. The bearing of the telescope is the
only mechanical part of the instrument that requires special care.
For the cross wires of the ordinary telescope is substituted a micro
meter scale. The millimetre scale is <U+FB01>xed on a separate stand as near
as possible to the bar of ice and at the same distance from the telescope
as the ice is, and is left untouched during the observations, so that it
is of no consequence, for measuring small extensions, if it be not
 quite parallel to the direction of the tension. The distance from the
telescope to the ice or to the scale was about 30 cm.      On the top of
 the telescope is <U+FB01>xed a level.      We carefully adjusted this, so that
 when the bubble was at its zero the axis of rotation of the telescope
 was in the vertical plane at right angles to the tube of spirit.    Then
 if the bubble remained in its central position in every azimuth of the
 telescope, we could be sure the axis of rotation was vertical.
    The observation was taken by reading the position, on the micro
 meter scale, of the image of the mark on the needle, then swinging
 the telescope round and reading the position, on the micrometer scale,
 of the two nearest divisions of the millimetre scale. By interpolation
 the exact height, on the millimetre scale, of the mark on the needle
 was then readily found. It will be noticed that the cathetometer need
 only remain steady while the telescope is swung round from the
 needle to the scale; whereas in the ordinary form there is a danger

of the whole stand being slightly displaced when the telescope is slid
down to its lower position.       In fact in our circumstances an ordinary
cathetometer    would  have  been   practically useless, owing to the bending
of the <U+FB02>oor and table at the slightest movement of the observer.
Observations, even with our special form, required the utmost care.
The micrometer scale had twenty divisions, each 0'12 mm. in actual
size, and corresponding to about 0'3 mm. on the other scale.              The
magni<U+FB01>cation of the telescope, as compared with the eye at 9 inches,
was about 5.     This was scarcely great enough. We intended also to
have'  the  micrometer    divisions half the size, but the maker was not
able to graduate it so <U+FB01>nely.       Indeed, as it was, the lines were rather
too thick.
   By estimating tenths of the micrometer divisions          we could read to
0‘03 mm., but the readings might easily be at least 0'06 mm. in error.
Each determination of the length between the needles depends on four
readings, the upper needle, and its corresponding scale division, and the
lower needle, and its scale division.         If the four readings happened
to have each    the  maximum     error  0'06 mm. with a suitable sign, the
total error might be 0'24 mm.            Such a combination of chances is
highly improbable, but an error of 0'1 mm. is obviously not unlikely.
The cathetometer would have been a useful instrument for measuring
a large and regular extension with accuracy, but it was not adapted
to detect very small extensions, and a system of levers, which we
adopted as a rough mode of measurement in our second set of
apparatus, proved !so much more satisfactory and suitable to our
purposes, that we almost entirely discarded the cathetometer.            This
contrivance is shown in <U+FB01>g. 3, in the form <U+FB01>nally adopted. a and b
are sections of the projecting ends of glass needles <U+FB01>xed in the ice,
cdef is a bent iron wire, “the indicator," hooked to a wire loop m
securely fastened to a, h is a wooden lever suspended by a thread 11.,
which owing to the counterpoise k, pulls the indicator upwards with a
thread fastened to awire loop at e. The indicator is kept from rising
by the connecting <U+FB01>bre, a piece of stiff wire hooked at one end to the
loop g, fastened to b, and at the other to a bend (1" in the indicator.
The lower end of the indicator gives the reading on a paper millimetre
scale I, gummed on to the mirror p.        The mirror, of course, enables the
observer   to avoid  errors of  parallax.   The stand of the mirror is glued
to the lower collar.     To appreciate the action of the levers, regard a
for the moment as <U+FB01>xed, then lowering b through a small distance r will
       f
move through a distance a = vr at right angles to mf, where w is the
ratio of the distance mf to the perpendicular let fall from m on the
line gd produced if necessary.        If md be made perpendicular to gd,
when    f  is in the middle of the scale, the multiplier v remains
practically constant. This precaution was not always taken, but
               “ This was a deeper bend than is shown in the <U+FB01>gure.

allowance is made for the resulting error. Two lever systems were
required, one for the outer ends, and the other for the inner ends of
the needles passing through the ice.     In Experiment 2 we used two
scales and mirrors which enabled the readings to be taken with great
accuracy. Afterwards we contented ourselves with one, which gave
quite suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy for any but homogeneous ice.       In the <U+FB01>rst
few experiments     we used   glass  <U+FB01>bres, both  for the indicator and
connecting <U+FB01>bre, as we feared some slight motion off might arise
from the “ elastic recovery

                                                       put to the test of
experiment. A long piece of the same kind of wire was bent sharply
at an angle, and the two ends brought nearly into contact.        It was
hung over a nail, and the distance between the ends measured from
 time to time. The effect of the gradual unbending of the angle would

 in this case, owing to the greater length of the arms, be about twice
 as great as in the extension experiments, and yet it was found to be               -
 scarcely perceptible.        For practical convenience in setting up the
 apparatus     the  wire   was  found immensely superior.         The trouble of
 <U+FB01>xing in position a delicate arrangement of brittle glass <U+FB01>bres, in an
 awkward place like the back of the ice chamber behind the bar of ice,
can hardly be realised by any one who has not tried it.
    In the <U+FB01>rst few experiments the loops m and g were not used, and
the indicator and connecting <U+FB01>bres were simply hooked over the
 needles 0. and b.        And in Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 6, no e<U+FB02>icient
precautions were taken to prevent slipping along the needle.               It is to
be    remarked,    however,    that   any  such    slipping  would    produce an
apparent contraction, and, owing to the sudden alteration of the rate
of extension, any slipping of importance could hardly escape detection.“
 Such cases are either omitted or specially mentioned. The lever h
and counterpoise were found rather troublesome, and will probably be
dispensed with next year, by putting the connecting <U+FB01>bre on the other
side of the needle.
    Our second apparatus, which we shall call the rough apparatus, was
of much simpler construction.            Instead of the collars we used two
iron plates, each about 12 cm. square with a hole 2'5 cm. square in the
centre. The bar to be tested was passed through the hole and frozen
on to a block of ice on the other side of the plate.             The upper plate
was suspended by        cords  attached   to holes  at  the corners, and from the
lower plate was suspended by similar cords a bucket, in which various
weights could be placed.           In Experiments 3 and 4, the four cords
were simply knotted together, and hung over an iron hook fastened
to a single cord.       But it was dif<U+FB01>cult in this way to ensure that the
line of action of the tension should be the central line of the bar of
ice, and we thought it likely that the bending in Experiment 4
was due to this cause, so we adopted the contrivance shown in
<U+FB01>   . 4.
  8A is the upper iron plate, -F the bar of ice attached to the block of
ice Eul' B is a wooden plate with holes at the corners and a hole at the
centre, in exactly the same relative positions as the holes in the corners
and the centre of the square hole in A. 0000 are four cords of equal
length, and D the main cord by which the whole is upheld. When the
arrangement is in equilibrium, the cords C will be vertical as well as
the cord D, so the line of action of the tension, which is the central
line of the cord D, will pass through the centre of the square hole
in A, even though the two plates be not quite horizontal. The same
remarks apply to a similar arrangement for the lower iron plate.                 If
   i  In almost  every experiment  far more readings were taken than are recorded
below.

  the bar be not attached accurately at right angles to the plates, it
  will take up avertical position and the plates will      be tilted.    This
  contrivance was successful, for the icicle, which owing to its symme
  trical formation would probably under uniform tension stretch
  equally on both sides, showed but small signs of bending.            So we
 think it fair to conclude that in the later specimens the bending
 was due to their unsymmetrical structure.
     In the later experiments (6, 8, 9 and 10) the apparatus was en
 closed in a single box of wood about 3 cm. thick.            The box was
 jacketed on the outside with a layer of hay about 5 cm. thick,
 covered with paper or felt.     The cords, leading to the support and
 the weight, passed through holes in the top and bottom well plugged
 with cotton-wool. In all cases, except when the contrary is expressly
 mentioned, the bar of ice was wrapped in gutta-percha

 the evaporation.
     The polariscope was of the simplest possible form. The light
transmitted by a sheet of .thin paper was re<U+FB02>ected at the polarising'
angle by a pile of three glass plates towards a Nicol prism supported
in the same framework.         With its aid it was easy to see the
boundaries of the various crystals in a plate or bar of glacier ice,
though not a trace of division could be detected with the naked eye,
and with some dif<U+FB01>culty the direction of the optic axes of a few of
the larger crystals could be made out. In the bath ice the homo
geneousness of the crystal could be readily tested, by watching the
unchanged position of the rings and cross while the bar was moved
across the <U+FB01>eld. In lake ice a half-inch plate, cut at right angles to the
columns and viewed in the polariscope, showed a series of irregular
polygons black, white, or grey, when the empty <U+FB01>eld was black.           The

  third column gives the extension observed, measured from the length
  at the <U+FB01>rst reading. The fourth column gives the temperature just

on the micrometer scale of the cathetometer was taken twice, the
telescope having been turned about the vertical axis in the interim.
The two generally agreed.   If not the mean was taken. On the 20th,
however, a s'econd set of readings was taken, the telescope having
been slid down the rod in the interim.      Both determinations are
given.
    The errors of a cathetometer reading have been already discussed.
 If we allow 0'11 mm. as a possible error in each determination of
the length, the observations are consistent with no real extension.
But taking the last two columns into consideration it seems probable
 that there was an extension of 01 mm. between the 14th and 16th
and none later. Even if the total extension had been 0‘2 mm., this
would have corresponded to a mean extension per hour per length of
 10 cm. of only 0000? mm.
   Experiment N0. 2.—The same piece of ice was <U+FB01>tted up with glass
indicators and glass connecting <U+FB01>bres, the needles being the same as
before.   Each indicator was provided with a mirror and scale set
close up to it, so readings on the scale could be taken to 0'2 mm.
But on the other hand there was a possibility of the indicators
slipping on the needles and thus occasioning a slight apparent con
traction.   The multiplication on the outer side was 34, on the
inner 26. Thus an extension of 0'00? mm. could be detected.       The
second, third, and fourth columns of the following table give the
extensions, measured from the length at the time of the third
observation (for a reason mentioned below), and reduced to the pro
portionate amount for a. length of 10 cm. They are probably correct to
0'004 mm.

    The temperature on the afternoon of     the 30th was not taken,   but
the   notebook contains      a statement   that it  was  colder  than the
morning.
    Since the box was left open all night, the temperature given by the
thermometer on the morning of the 31st may well have been rather
lower than that of the ice. Between the 1st and 2nd, an apparent
contraction of 0'01? mm. on one side took place without change of
temperature.      This looks as if the indicator had slipped. Making
allowance for these, the mean extension from the 31st, 9 h. 15 m., to the
5th, 16 11., follows the temperature very fairly, considering the uncer
tainty of the latter.   We have arranged the table to show this. But
during the <U+FB01>rst six hours there was an expansion on one side of
0088 mm. in actual magnitude, which we attribute to a slight yield
ing at the crack. Counting the contraction as a slip, and making no
allowance for temperature, the mean rate during the whole 150 hours
was 0'00019 mm. per hour per length of 10 cm.
    If we suppose that the extension during the last <U+FB01>ve days was
 entirely due to temperature, and that the coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion of
the glass of the connecting <U+FB01>bre was 0'000009, we have between
 —12'5° and —8'5° a coef<U+FB01>cient of linear expansion of ice of 0000034,
between —8'5° and —3'7° of 0'000060, and between —3'7° and —-1'O°
of 0000009.
    Into the complicated question of the expansion of ice with tem
 perature we do not care to enter fully. We will merely cite two
investigations.     The best observations on the cubical coef<U+FB01>cient seem
to be those of Pettersson (“On the Properties of Water and Ice,”
‘
   Vega Expedition,’ vol. 2, Stockholm, 1883).       We deduce from his
<U+FB01>gures the corresponding linear coe<U+FB01>icients, supposing ice to be
isotropic in this matter. With ice from ordinary distilled water he
obtained 0'000053 between —12° and —2°.           This ice began to con
 tract at some point between -—0'35° and —O'25°.        With ice from the
 purest water he could obtain, the coef<U+FB01>cient rose from 0'000055
 between —17° and —10° to 0000057 between —4° and —3°, and
 then decreased, till it changed sign at some point between —O'15° and
 —0'03°. Ice containing 0014 per cent. of chlorine, in the shape of
 salts, began to contract at —2'5°. In these experiments the water
 was frozen in the dilatometer, so there was no chance of the impuri
 ties being expelled by the process of solidi<U+FB01>cation as in the case of
 ice formed slowly on the surface of some depth of water. His purest
 water, however, was so good as to be seriously affected by boiling
 for a short time in a clean glass vessel.
     The coef<U+FB01>cient of linear expansion has been determined directly by
  Andrews (‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ June, 1886).           He found 0'0000505
  between —18° and —9°, and 00000735 between -—9° and -—O°.             It
  is possible that the difference between the determinations of these two

1888.]             On the Plasticity        of Glacier and other Ice.                  351
experimentalists is owing to an unequal expansion of ice in di<U+FB01>erent
directions.      At any rate, taken together, they are su<U+FB02>icient to explain
our rough results, on the supposition that the extension of the last
<U+FB01>ve days was entirely due to the rise of temperature.
   The experiment was brought to a close by the bar breaking at a
point above the upper needle, where it was not protected by gutta
percha tissue, and had become very thin through evaporation.                           The
thickness had been reduced by this cause in three weeks from
2'55 cm. to 2'2 cm.                   The temperature, at which the fracture
occurred, was between —O'5° and —1'O°, certainly not above the former.
The breaking tension was 8‘35 kilos. per sq. cm.                      There was a groove
running right         round       the   bar   near  the     middle    of its length, but
no sign of a crack could be seen in the interior of the ice. This
groove may have been caused by the outer layer cooling more rapidly
than the interior.         Under the polariscope no break in the continuity
of the crystalline structure could be detected.                       The rings and cross
were seen very plainly, and the direction of the optic axis appeared to
be the same on both sides of the crack.                   It was perpendicular to the
length of the bar and also to the needles.                        By a rough measure
of the rings we found the di<U+FB02>t'erence between the two indices of
refraction to be 00018. In quartz it is 00094:; in Iceland spar 0'172.
   Experiment No. 5. Main’s Apparatus—The specimen was a piece of
glacier ice (B). The measurements were taken with the cathetometer.
We had already found, in the other apparatus, that glacier ice would
stretch, but we thought it desirable to con<U+FB01>rm the fact with a
different mode of measurement. So in this one case we used the
cathetometer again, in spite of its disadvantages for this kind of
work. The length between the needles was about 20 cm., the area of
section 7‘3 sq. cm., and the tension 2'7 kilos. per sq. cm.                   The second

   column gives the temperature just before each observation, the fourth
   the actual extension during the interval in millimetres, the error
   probably not exceeding 0'1 mm., the <U+FB01>fth the rate per hour per length
   of 10 cm., and the two last the maximum and mean temperatures
   during the interval.
      On the 10th and 11th the ice broke at the collar, and had to be
  frozen together again. It will be noted that the rate of extension
   decreases with the time, more than can be explained by errors of
  observation, though the tendency of the temperature is to rise.
     Experiment N0. 7. llfai'n’s Apparatus.—The     same piece of ice was
  used, cut a little shorter (glacier ice C), and <U+FB01>tted with wire
  indicators.   Only one scale was used for the two indicators, so the
  readings cannot be trusted beyond 0‘5 mm. on the scale. As the
  multiplication was generally about 16, this gives an error in the
  actual extensions, when small, not greater than 0'03 mm.      \Vhen the
  extensions are large the error is greater, owing to an uncertainty of
  perhaps 10 per cent. in the multiplication.        The “needles” were
 glass tubes.    The length between the needles was 18 cm., and the
 area of section 7'3 sq. cm. The <U+FB01>rst column gives the time of each
 reading, the second the temperature at that time, the third the
 interval between two readings, the fourth and <U+FB01>fth the extension
 shown by the outer and inner indicators, the sixth the mean rate of
 extension per hour per length of 10 cm., the seventh the tension, the
 eighth, ninth, and tenth the maximum, minimum, and mean tempe~
 ratures, during that interval.
     On the 17th February the tension was increased by one-half, and
 the ice in consequence broke at the collar.      It was frozen in again,
 and the tension reduced to the original value. On the 8th March an
 hour was occupied in readjusting the wire indicators.          The sixth
 column shows a rapid decrease of speed for the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve days,
 followed by <U+FB02>uctuations due apparently mainly to the temperature,
 the rate at —4° being about double that at —-9°. An addition of one
 half to the tension increased the rate 500 per cent. for the <U+FB01>rst two
 days of the change.         This increased rate in its turn showed a
tendency    to sink, more   or less counterbalanced by the rising tempe
rature. The fourth and <U+FB01>fth columns show the curious way in which
the more rapid extension alternates from one side to the other.
    This piece of ice, taking the two experiments together, was under
tension for twenty-<U+FB01>ve days, and extended altogether about 6 mm.,
i.e., about 3 per cent. of its length.    At the close of the experiment
the divisions between two or three of the crystals at one point of the
bar almost amounted to cracks, and at that point there was a decided
twist in the bar, estimated at 10°. There were a great many bubbles
in the ice, and the crystalline structure was very complex. There
was no particularly large crystal.

The area of section was 6 sq. cm., and the tension 4 kilos. per sq. cm.
 The measurement was taken with glass indicators.              Along straight
glass <U+FB01>bre was used as indicator, bent        at  one  end  to hook under the
lower needle, and supported in a nearly horizontal position by a glass
connecting <U+FB01>bre hooked over the upper needle.                The vertical scale
 was attached to an arm projecting from the upper iron plate.
   During the <U+FB01>rst 225 hours the ice extended 3'7 mm. on the outer
side, and contracted 0‘75 mm. on the inner side.                During a sub
sequent   six hours  it extended    1'7 mm.  on  the  outer  side  and 0'6 mm.
on the inner.      The mean      rate  per hour    per length   of  10 cm. was
therefore 0046 mm.            The temperature is not known with any
certainty.    This ice was never examined under the polariscope, but
owing to the mode of formation described fully at the end of the
paper, we may be certain the structure was in the highest degree
irregular.     It was probably, however, tolerably symmetrical about
the axis, so the bending may be attributed to the eccentric application
of the pull.
   Experiment N0. 4. Rough Apparatus.—The specimen was_a piece of
glacier ice (A), composed of perhaps a dozen “grains” very
irregularly arranged, the axes of some being at right angles, of
others parallel, to the length. Distance between needles about 22 cm.
The area of the section is a little uncertain, as it was not measured
in situ, and the ice was not protected from evaporation.             It may be
taken as 6'5 sq. cm., and the tension as 1‘66 kilo. per sq. cm.            The
ice was subjected to tension for about eighty-<U+FB01>ve hours altogether,
but we only give the results for the last twenty-seven, as at <U+FB01>rst the
indicators appear to have slipped, and, after precautions had been
taken to prevent slipping the two indicators happened to come in
contact. The indicators were arranged as in the last experiment, but
the readings were improved by attaching a mirror to the scale.             The
multiplication was about 30, and the extensions may be trusted to
0‘03 mm.      The <U+FB01>rst column in the annexed table gives the time of
each reading, the second the temperature at that time, the third the
interval between two readings, the fourth and <U+FB01>fth the actual
extensions measured by the outer and inner indicators in that
interval, and the sixth the rate per hour per length of 10 cm.
   The temperatures. are somewhat uncertain, as the ice was not
enclosed in a box, and the temperature of the room was very far
from being uniform.         The last four temperatures were taken by a
thermometer hung close by the ice and on the same level.                   The
minimum of the night by this thermometer was—3'3". The high
temperature at 21 h. 15 m. was due to the window of the room having
been nearly closed.     It was then thrown wide open, so the temperature
must have soon fallen again. So the interval before this reading, O'O°,
would probably be much warmer on the average than the subsequent

the fourth   and <U+FB01>fth  columns may well have been due to eccentric
application of the tension.
   Experiment N0. 6. Rough Apparaius.—The        specimen was an icicle
trimmed   with   knife  to an
                            a uniform circular  section. The apparatus
was greatly improved.       The new mode of suspension was adopted,
specially arranged, as described above, to ensure the tension acting
along the central line of the bar. The indicators were hooked over
the top needle and bent at right angles so as to point downwards, as
in Main’s apparatus. They were of glass, and no thoroughly e<U+FB02>icient
means was taken to prevent slipping along the needle, but we do
not think any slipping can have taken place during the observations
quoted below. The whole apparatus was enclosed in a jacketed box—
which was, however, generally left open at night—and a centigrade
thermometer, graduated to tenths, was hung in the box on a level
with the middle of the ice.
   In the table the fourth and <U+FB01>fth columns give the actual extensions
during each interval, which may be trusted to 0015 mm., and the
sixth column the mean rate of extension per hour per length of
10 cm.    The second column gives the reading of the thermometer at
the time of the observation, and the last two columns the maximum
and mean temperatures of the ice during each interval.      These are
tolerably accurate, as many observations were taken besides those
here quoted.     The ice was not protected from evaporation, so the

1888.]          On. the Plasticity of Glacier and other Ice.              357
section gradually diminished, and the tension consequently increased,
as given in the seventh column.                The mean section was about
~L'l sq. cm.  The ice was under tension for twenty-four hours previous
 to the observations given below, but during this time the indicators
seem to have slipped.
    The weight was removed for twelve hours on the 14th owing to
 the thaw. It is curious to notice how irregularly the extension is
 divided between the two sides; the ice bends <U+FB01>rst one way then the
other. The <U+FB02>uctuations in the mean rate of extension seem mainly
due to the temperature.          During thirteen hours at a temperature
between —1'5° and —3'O° the rate was 0‘0028, while during thirty
eight hours at a temperature above —0'7° the rate was 00034.              The
ice was full of minute bubbles, though not in suf<U+FB01>cient quantity to
 make it quite opaque.      The component crystals were very small, less
than a millimetre in diameter, and with optic axes arranged quite
irregularly.
   Experiment No. 8. Rough Apparatus.—The specimen was a piece of
glacier ice            The wire indicators and connecting <U+FB01>bres were
hooked through wire loops <U+FB01>rmly fastened to the glass needles em
bedded in the ice, so there was no possibility of slipping.               The
multiplication   was   about  '22,  so  the  small extensions are accurate to
0'02 mm.     The area of section was 6'3 sq. cm. The table is arranged
as in the last experiment
   Thus the whole extension in three and a half days was more than
41 per cent. of the length.        At 20 h. 15 m. the inner indicator had
moved o<U+FB01> the scale against a stop, so the extension was probably
rather greater, certainly not less than that given.        The extension at a.
particularly low temperature, mentioned in the general summary, was
between February 18th, 21 h., when the temperature was ——9'O°, and
February 19th, 9 h. 15 m.        There was a contraction on the outer side
during this interval of 001 mm., and an extension on the inner side of
0‘23 mm., so the mean rate per hour per 10 cm. was 0‘0065 mm.
    It should be mentioned that the points on the glass needles, where
the indicators were attached, were not quite close to the ice, but at
the distance of a centimetre perhaps.           Hence, while the mean rate is
correctly given,    the  extension     on  the  inner side of the bar is ex
aggerated, and that on the outer side made too small. Taking the
ice as 2'5 cm. thick, this consideration leads to the result that the
total extension of the outer face of the bar was 2'9 mm., of the inner
face 9'7 mm.
    This experiment shows how completely the plasticity depends on
changes in the internal structure of the ice.          Thus, for the <U+FB01>rst two
days    we <U+FB01>nd,  under   a slight    stress, a  moderate  rate showing some
tendency to decrease more rapidly than can be easily attributed to
the fall of temperature.        An increased tension produces as usual a

  to say, impressed a gradual retardation in spite of a rising tempera
  ture.    It would thus appear that in this case, while a rapid extension
  increased the plasticity, a gradual extension had the e<U+FB01>ect of diminish
  ing it.    This is an anomalous result, but it must be remembered
  that we are measuring the sum of a large number of independent
  actions. The behaviour of the whole is probably much more com
  plicated than that of any one of the individuals.
     Being curious to see the e<U+FB01>ect of great tension, we applied 4‘2 kilos.
  per sq. cm. This brought the experiment to an end, for after half
  a minute the ice gave way.       It was found broken both at the lower
  collar and at a point below the upper needle, where we had previously
  noticed a crack extending part of the way across the bar. At which
  point it broke <U+FB01>rst we cannot say.        The bar was examined at the
  end of the experiment.       It was nearly straight in spite of one side
  having extended so much more than the other.                  It contained
  several large bubbles, one perhaps 2 cm. long, drawn out into very
 irregular shapes, which seemed to show this piece had su<U+FB02>’ered great
  distortion while it still formed part of the glacier.   It contained part
 of a very large crystal which composed, perhaps, one third of the
  whole bar, and ran three quarters of the length between the needles.
  This crystal occupied one of the angles adjacent to the inner face,
 which extended so much. Its optic axis was inclined at perhaps 70°
 to the length of the bar.
     Experiment N0. 9. Rough Apparatiw.—The specimen was a bar of
 lake ice, with the crystalline columns parallel to the length of the
 bar. The section was 8 sq. cm. in area. 'I‘he arrangements were the
 same as in the last experiment              The extensions are so small
 that the deduced rate during each interval would be very inaccurate.
 We have therefore given, in the second, third, and fourth columns of
 the table, the extensions measured from the length at the time of the
 <U+FB01>rst reading and reduced to the proportionate value for a bar
 10 cm. long.      They are probably correct to 0'01 mm. The <U+FB01>fth
column gives the temperature shown by the thermometer at each
reading; and the next three the maximum, minimum, and mean
temperatures of the ice during each interval, estimated from a large
number of observations not quoted.
    Previously to 15 h., February 28th, the ice must have been thawing,
probably for about an hour. The weight was removed for the next
three hours. The total extension during 208 hours per length of
10 cm. was 0145 mm. on the outer side, and 0048 mm. on the inner,
giving a mean rate per hour of 0000456 mm. The mean rate during
the <U+FB01>rst 168 hours was 0'00039 mm., and during the last 40 with the
heavier weight 0'00076 mm., notwithstanding a slightly lower mean
temperature.      But these rates were so small as to be beyond our
means of accurate measurement.

5'5 sq. cm.    The indicators, &c., were arranged as before.     The tem
perature at the time of observation, and the minimum temperature
were observed; the maximum and mean temperatures are estimated.
The fourth and <U+FB01>fth columns give the actual extension during each
 interval.  They are probably correct to 002 mm., as the multiplica
tion was 35.
    The rate shows     a decided tendency to decrease, only slightly
 checked by the rise of temperature.      The glass needles were put at
 right angles  to the columns  as  well as to the length of the bar.

1888.]         On the Plasticity    of Glacier and  other Ice.         363
   We shall now describe the experiments on compression.         An oblong
piece of thick plate glass was laid on the table, and on it    were placed
three square blocks of ice, at the angles of an equilateral triangle
about 9 cm. in the side.      On the ice was laid a second piece of plate
glass  similar to the <U+FB01>rst,  and  pressure applied by means of a lever at
a point immediately over the centre of the triangle.         Measurements
were taken with callipers of the distance between the plates at three
points on the edge, such that each point lay on a line through the
centre and one angular point of the triangle.       By drawing a diagram
to scale, it was not dif<U+FB01>cult to deduce from these measurements the
yielding of each block of ice.         To prevent slipping, we found it
necessary   and  suf<U+FB01>cient  to  freeze a slip of paper on each end of a
block of ice. A    maximum     thermometer    was placed on the table close
by the plates, and covered over with the same cloth, so that it
 probably gave the temperature of the ice within a degree.             The
 horizontal section of each block was 7'5 sq. cm. in area.      The fourth,
 <U+FB01>fth, and sixth columns give the actual contraction of the blocks
 during each interval.      They are correct probably within 0'02 mm.
 Each measurement with the callipers was repeated, and the two
 readings seldom di<U+FB02>’ered more than 0'02 mm.
    Pressure had been applied for one day previous to those here given,
 but owing to an accident, its magnitude was rather uncertain. The
 remarkable diiference between the plasticity of three specimens
 of glacier ice is well shown, though in this case all three pieces
 were from the same lump. After the experiment they were examined
 under the polariscope. All three were composed of smallish grains
 averaging perhaps 7 mm. in diameter. The increase of plasticity for
 a rise in temperature from —6° to ——3° is very striking in all three
 pieces.
    Experiment No. 2 on Compression—In this three pieces of lake ice
 were arranged as in the last experiment. The crystalline columns
 were vertical, so that the pressure was applied in a direction parallel
 to them. The horizontal section of each piece was 7 sq. cm.            The
 fourth, <U+FB01>fth, and sixth columns of the table give the contractions
 during each interval, calculated from the readings actually taken, as
 explained in the description of the last experiment. They are pro
 bably accurate to 0'02 mm.        It may be mentioned that the totals are
 calculated to an extra place of decimals, which explains the slight
 discrepancy observable.

    Thus the yielding of one piece was well within the errors of obser
vation, of the other two only just perceptible with the instrument
employed, and this small yielding may well have taken place entirely
in the thin layer of irregular ice with which the paper was attached.
    In the early part of the winter we made, as already mentioned, a
large number of experiments on obtaining ice in the mould“ free
from air bubbles.       We were ultimately successful, and, though our
experiments proved to be of little use for their immediate object,
they are of some permanent interest as tests of various methods of
obtaining air-free water, so we shall describe a few typical ones.
 Main, the previous winter, boiled the water and let it freeze, then
melted it in the mould, boiled     it,and let     freeze again.
                                                  it              The result
was clear ice, except    for  “ a small core of  minute  bubbles up the axis
of the cylinder.”     By Main’s advice we procured an air-pump adapted
 to exhaust the air from the mould.           Between the pump and they
mould was a good stopcock, which would maintain the vacuum for
several hours. When in good order the pump would boil water at
40° C., or below.     We found that this degree of exhaustion was far
from removing all the air, even when applied for <U+FB01>ve hours. Boiling
 for half an hour, cooling sub vacuo, and freezing at atmospheric
pressure under oil was more successful, but not satisfactory.             We
 froze the water at atmospheric pressure to make the bubbles small,
 having placed  a  layer of oil on the top to prevent air entering.      The
 next method proved much more e<U+FB01>ectual. We kept water sub vacuo
 for twenty-four hours at about 70° C., and let          cool sub cacao, only
                                                           it
 admitting air after the freezing had begun.             There were     a few
 exceedingly small bubbles visible at one end of the rod of ice.
 Thawing this sub vacuo and keeping          itagain for twenty-four hours
 sub vacuo  at  70° C., we   got  rid of the last traces of air in the rod,
  though there were a few in the large cone of ice.

  till most of the dissolved air has escaped, and then left for a con
  siderable time without permitting any air to have access to its
  surface. Boiling should be repeated at intervals to remove the air,
  which gradually escapes from the water and mingles with the
  aqueous vapour in the space above.        It probable that a high tem~

   The utter irregularity of the crystalline structure of the mould ice
is  an obvious consequence of the mode of formation.       The <U+FB01>rst ice
formed, no doubt, is    layer on the surface, but the centre of this

soon broken though by water forced up from below, owing to the
expansion in freezing. So what we observed in its various stages was

a  ring of  ice formed at the surface, which gradually extended down
the sides and towards the centre, till we had a long tube of ice thinning
out towards the lower end joined on to a case of ice, lining the inside
of the cone.     The tube grew thicker and thicker, till it became a solid
bar.     When a piece of sheet indie-rubber was laid on the surface
(to prevent air entering), it was frozen <U+FB01>rmly to the sides of the
mould, while the centre was pushed upwards into the shape of a bee
hive, till at last it burst. It was curious to <U+FB01>nd the india-rubber
with the middle part drawn out into a long tube with torn edges,
<U+FB01>rmly imbedded in the ice at some little distance from the end.

callipers, and much other apparatus, which he has generously placed

 new light upon Corda’s two genera Z ygopte'ris and Anachoropteris, as
 they are adopted by M. Renault, but which specimens show that
 both these genera can no longer be retained, even by those who
 approve of such multiplications of ill-de<U+FB01>ned genera.       He proposes,

   The following etfects upon the minimum change of potential of a
voltaic couple in water (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ May 26, 1888), and upon
the change of potential attending variation of strength of its exciting
liquid (ibid., May 31, 1888), were obtained by varying the kind of
positive (and of negative) metal of the couple, and by employing
different galvanometers.     The measurements      were made by the
method of balance, with the aid of a thermo-electric pile‘ll‘ (‘ Birming

the astatic galvanometer the minimum proportion of acid required to

   Notwithstanding the electromotive force of magnesium is so much
larger than that of zinc in the very dilute acid, the minimum propor
tion of the acid required to destroy the balance was very much
smaller with zinc than with magnesium, and the increase of electro
motive force was more rapid with zinc than with magnesium. The
minimum proportion of acid required to change the potential with
magnesium (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,' May 26, 1888), or with zinc, was
nearly the same, whether the couple was balanced by a precisely
similar one or by the thermo-electric pile. The order of variation of
electromotive force by change of strength of the liquid was very
similar with zinc to what it was with magnesium, and the curves
generated by plotting the results were much alike.

   Sixteen diEerent solutions, varying in strength from 10695 grain
 to 0'03 grain, with a constant di<U+FB01>erence of 00693 grain, gave each
the same potential, viz., 2'7336 volts. Much gas was set free at the
magnesium, but only in the stronger solutions. Owing to the extreme
 sensitiveness of this couple to chlorine, several series of measure
 ments were necessary in order to determine the minimum point with
approximate accuracy, and include the entire range of solution.

the proportion of the same exciting liquid, necessary to disturb the
potential of a voltaic couple in water, and the order of variation of                      -
potential    caused     by change of strength of liquid, vary with each
different positive or negative" metal. The numbers in Tables IV, VIII,
XII and XXI, show that the more positive or more easily corroded
the positive metal, or the more negative and less easily corroded the
negative one, the smaller usually was the proportion of dissolved
substance required to change the potential.                 In the case of chlorine,
   ‘ If the negative metal is not at all corroded, the order of change of potential   by
change of negative metal is not much atectcd.

as well as  in that of bromine, the magnitudes of the minimum pro
 portions of substance necessary to change the potential of magnesium
platinum,     zinc-platinum, and cadmium-platinum           couples,  varied
directly as the atomic weights    of the positive metals.
    The experiments also show that the degree of sensitiveness of the
 arrangement for detecting the minimum-point of change of poten
 tial depends largely upon the kind of galvanometer employed.           As a.
 more sensitive galvanometer enables     us to detect a. change of potential
 caused by a much smaller proportion of material; and as the propor
 tion of substance capable of detection is smaller the greater the free
 chemical energy of each of the uniting bodies, it is probable that the
 electromotive force really begins to increase with the very smallest
 addition of the substance, and might be detected if our means of
 detection were suf<U+FB01>ciently sensitive or the free chemical energy was
su<U+FB02>iciently strong.

   The paper is a supplement to one with the same title by Professor
Ewing and Mr. G. C. Cowan, which was read at a recent meeting of
the Society. It describes experiments, conducted under the author’s
direction by two of his students, Mr. W. Low and Mr. D. Low, on the
effects of longitudinal compression on the magnetic permeability and
retentiveness of nickel. The results are exhibited by means of curves,
showing the relation which was determined between the intensity of
magnetisation of the metal and the magnetising force, when a nickel
bar, reduced to approximate endlessness by a. massive iron yoke which
formed a magnetic connexion between its ends, was magnetised under
more or less stress of longitudinal compression.     Corresponding curves
show the relation of residual magnetism to magnetising force, for
various amounts of stress; and others are drawn to show the relation
of magnetic permeability to magnetic induction.        Initial values of the
permeability, under very feeble magnetising forces, were also deter
mined.    The experiments were concluded by an examination of the
behaviour of nickel in magnetic <U+FB01>elds of great strength.       Magnetising
forces ranging from 3000 to 13,000 c.g.s. units were applied by
placing a short bobbin with a narrow neck made of nickel between the
poles of a large electromagnet, and it was found that these produced a
practically constant intensity of magnetisation which is to baa-accepted
as the saturation value.

   In continuation of our investigations of      the thermal properties of
pure liquids,   we  have  now   determined   the vapour-pressures, vapour
densities, and expansion in the liquid and gaseous states of propyl
alcohol, and from these results we have calculated the heats of vapo
risation at de<U+FB01>nite temperatures. The compressibility of the liquid
has also been measured.         The range of temperature is from 5° to
280° (1., and the range of pressure from 5 mm. to 56,000 mm.

alcohol; determinations of its speci<U+FB01>c 'gravity at 0°, and at 10°'72;
and of the constants mentioned above.
   The approximate critical temperature of propyl alcohol is 263°‘7;
the approximate critical pressure is 38,120 mm., and the approximate
volume of one gram is 3'6 0.0.       The <U+FB01>rst two of these constants must
be very    nearly correct ; the third cannot be determined with 'the same

                                  (Abstract)
   This paper is a continuation of the previous ones on the same
subject.    In it the author gives an account of the action of alkalis on
phyllocyanin so far as regards the first stage of the process, and of
the products thereby formed.          Phyllocyaniu when acted upon by
alkalis yields in the <U+FB01>rst instance a well-crystallised substance of a.
peacock- or steel-blue colour, to which he gives the name of Phyllo
tannin.    He describes its properties and those of some of its com
pounds.     When hydrochloric acid gas in excess is passed through a
solution of chlorophyll in alcoholic soda, a compound crystallising in
lustrous purple needles is formed, which seems to be the ethyl ether
of phyllotaonin.     By substituting methylic for ethylic alcohol a very
similar compound is obtained, which the author considers to be the
corresponding methyl ether.        Though these compounds readily yield
phyllotaoniu by saponi<U+FB01>cation with alcoholic potash or soda, the
author did not succeed in reproducing them by the combined action
of alcohol and hydrochloric acid on phyllotaouin.

   The paper contains an account of' experiments made to determine
the value of the resistance of a column of mercury, 1 metre long and
 1 sq. mm. in cross section, in terms of the B.A. unit.    The method
employed differed very slightly from that of Lord Rayleigh and
Mrs. Sidgwiek (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1883).      Tubes of about 1, 2, and
3 sq. mm. in cross section were calibrated and <U+FB01>lled with mercury.
They were then immersed in melting ice, and their resistance com
pared with that of the BA. standards, using Carey Foster’s method
and the BA. bridge. The length of the mercury column, occupying
nearly the whole of the tube, was measured, and the mass of the same
determined. From this the average cross section is obtained, and hence
the value of     the resistance of
                  7',               column  a  metre long,

     The paper contains a discussion of the above results. It is shown
  that probably Lord Rayleigh’s value of 1' may be too high by as much
  as 00002, in consequence of the fact that the mercury in his terminal
  cups was 5“ or 6°C., but no complete explanation of the di<U+FB02>ierences
  between his result and those of Rowland, Koblrausch, and ourselves,
  has been found.        The di<U+FB02>iculty of working with tubes such as those
  used by the Lorentz, 1—2v metres in length, and 1, 2, and 3 cm. in
  diameter, may perhaps account for his value for the ohm, viz., 105'93.

     The author examines the structure of the skull in the Dicynodontia,
  and discusses the interpretations of its elements and a<U+FB02>inities given
  by Sir Richard Owen, Professor Huxley, and Professor C0pe, and
 arrives at the conclusion that the interpretation of the bones of the
  palate may be varied.           The quadrate bone is found, though it is
  absent from many specimens owing to loose articulation, and the
 mallens is recognised as a normal element in the skull. which
'articulates with the quadrate and is free, except at its extremities.
  The palatine bones are internal to the pterygoids, and the ptery
.goids extend forward to the maxillary.                      The colnmella is found
  in more than one specimen.                    Many new specimens are described
  which further elucidate the structure of the skull.                        The <U+FB01>rst of
  these shows that the upper part of the foramen magnum is formed

 by the supra-occipital bone, and that the element which has appeared
 to be a supra-occipital is the inter-parietal.      Evidence is given of
 the form of the brain case, which is found to be high and narrow.
  Details are given of the structure of the squamosal bone, and of its
 relation to the quadrate and other cranial elements; and it appears
 that the squamosal usually embraces the quadrate, so as to extend in
 front of it, and sometimes to hide it, so that both the quadrate and
 squamosal    sometimes   contribute to form the articulation for the
 lower jaw.     Evidence is o<U+FB02>‘ered of the sutures which divide the bones
of the skull from each other. The sub-nasal element, found in
Pareiasaurus, is met with in Dicynodonts, sometimes below the
 marine, and sometimes within its <U+FB02>oor in the position of a turbinal.
A new type of quadrate bone, which is regarded as Anomodont, is
described, and found to di<U+FB01>’er from the usual form in being perforated
in the antero-postcrior direction.     A summary of the structure of the
                                                                      '
skull is illustrated by a restoration showing its sutures.
    Further contributions are made to a knowledge of the vertebral
column. The cervical vertebrae are described, the atlas and axis are
regarded as anchylosed, and succeeded by an intercentrum which
has no neural arch.      The cervical ribs are comparatively long, and
articulate by a long fork with the neural arch, as well as with the
centrum.      Further evidence is given of the structure of dorsal
vertebrae, showing that the rib is attached to a single transverse
process of the neural arch.      The caudal vertebrae of Platypodosaums,
eleven in number as preserved, are described; and some observations
are made on the mode of ossi<U+FB01>cation of the intervertebral substance.
Additional materials further elucidate the Anomodont scapular arch,
and examples of scapula and coracoid are described; but the only
additional pelvic bone described is the pubis of Titanos'uchus.
   An account is given of the limb bones, which are elucidated by
large bones associated with the skull fragments described by Sir
R. Owen as Tifanosuchus feroz. They contribute to a knowledge of
the femur, humerus, and <U+FB01>bula in that type, and are associated with
small bones of the extremities which are probably metacarpals. The
ulna is described, which was referred by Sir R. Owen to Pareiasaurus,
and evidence is given that it possessed terminal epiphyses of different
form to any which are known in fossil reptiles, the proximal epiphysis
having much the character of the olecranou of a mammal. A massive
Anomodont tibia, also referred by Sir R. Owen to Pareizwaums, is
described, and found to possess a distal talon of mammalian pattern.
   Further observations are made upon the Theriodontia, as restricted
to the genus Galesaurus, the skull of which is further elucidated. The.
author also describes new material, making known the structure of
the skull, palate, and scapular arch of Provolophon; from which it
appears that the pre-coxacoid is exceptionally well developed, and

T-shaped form of the bone in Ichthyosaurus.
   Procolophon has teeth on the vomera and pterygoid bones, and the
structure of the palate and the post-orbital region show that the
Procolophouia forms a distinct division of the Anomodontia.                  Obser
vations are made on the relations of the European and South African
Anomodonts, and on the relation of the Anomodontia to the Pelyco
sauria and to Cotylosauria.            Comparison is made with Placodus,
which genus has two exoccipital condyles, comparable to those of
mammals, and-appears to have lost the basi-occipital condyle.                  Com
parisons are made      with  other extinct reptilia to show the relation of
the Anomodonts to the Saurischia, and other reptilian types. Obser
vations are o<U+FB02>'ered on the theory of the Anomodont skull, and on the
e<U+FB01>ect of the articulation of the lower jaw with the squamosal in
causing a diminished growth of the malleus and quadrate, converting
them into the malleus and tympanic.
   The larger groups included in the Anomodont alliance are regarded
as the Pareiasauria and Procolophonia;            Dicynodontia, Gennetotheria,
and Pelycosauria;        the Theriodontia, Cotylosauria, and Placodontia
are regarded as coming under the- same sub-class, which at one end of
the series exhibits characters which link reptiles with amphibians,
and at the other end of the series link reptiles with mammals.

    The quantitative determination of oxygen, simple as it appears at
<U+FB01>rst sight, is found in practice beset with many di<U+FB01>iculties.               Liebig‘s
method with pyrogallic acid and potassium hydrate, though con
sidered as yielding correct results, takes too much time, and is un
satisfactory in some respects, so that the eudiometer has become of
general use for the estimation of oxygen.               I  shall not attempt to
describe   the  various   forms of   eudiometer,    but it may be assumed that
Regnault, so well known for the care he bestowed on his investiga
tions, had adopted a very correct kind of eudiometer in the researches
he undertook with Reiset on the chemical phenomena of respiration.'*
 Other eudiometcrs have been made since then, such as the ingenious
instrument of Dr. Frankland for gas analysis, which has proved most
 serviceable. I claim for the present form of eudiometer that it is
correct and reliable in its working, simple in construction, and easy
of manipulation. The main objects of an eudiometer must be the easy
 introduction of the air to be analysed, the ready mixture of that air
 with a known volume of pure hydrogen gas, and the correct reading

 mnl tenths of 00., like a common burette.             The upper end of this
tube is closed air-tight with a steel cap, from which lateral tnhcs
 [H'l'jl—ct right and left; these tubes are bent V-shaped, or rather in the
inrm ofa lyre. At the junction of the lateral tubes with the cap,
there is a three-way stop-cock allowing of the passage of air or gas
 in four different directions, viz., <U+FB01>rst through the tubes cut off from
ti 1: hmly of the cudiomcter; secondly, into the eudiometer, which is
done by raising it in the mercury trough; thirdly, out of the endio
motor, on the side opposite that from which it was introduced, which
is effected by depressing the tube in the mercury; fourthly, through
the tutu-s and eudiometcr simultaneously.             The eudiometer is held
tightly by two claws projecting        at   different  heights from a vertical
iron rml connected with a rack and pinion movement.               The iron rod,
inguilll'l' with tho eudiometer, is immersed in mercury contained
in a straight cylindrical glass vessel.
    The hydrogen used for the explosion is prepared for that special
ohjl'ut from zinc and sulphuric acid in the ordinary way, and washed
through an alkaline solution, rather than obtained condensed in iron
lmtthm from the manufacturers, and it is collected in a bell-jar
Mlspumlml over water.        The bell-jar   I  use holds 11 litres of gas; it is
balanced by a counterpoise, and its weight, as it moves up and down
in water, is regulated by another counterpoise hanging from a cycloid,
m that the gas in the holder is always under atmospheric pressure;
an oil-gauge <U+FB01>xed to the holder shows at any time the pressure in the
hell-jar.      Should the gas fail to be absolutely under atmospheric
pressure,     the equality of pressures may be ensured by the use of the
adjusting instrument I have described in a former communication.
It consists of a clamp <U+FB01>xed to the rim of the tank, and made to grasp
at will the cord holding the counterpoise; a screw in connexion with
the clamp enables the cord, and consequently the bell-jar, to be
drawn up or down. For the actual requirements of the analysis, a
receiver for the hydrogen holding only one litre of gas would suf<U+FB01>ce,
but it is better to have a larger gas-holder in which to store up the
hydrogen for future determinations.
    Moreover, the cycloid arrangement for regulating the weight of the
bell-jar, though very convenient, may be dispensed with, as the gas in
the receiver can be brought approximately under atmospheric pressure

accurately placed under atmospheric pressure.
   The analysis is made as follows :—
   We suppose that air for analysis has been shaken with barium
hydrate in a glass jar of a capacity of about 10 litres, and made
according to the form adopted by Dr. Angus Smith" for the
determination of carbonic acid in air by Pettenkofer’s method. This
j'ar is closed by a tight-<U+FB01>tting india-rubber cap, which               I
                                                              cover with
several coats of copal   varnish; from this cap  two short india-rubbcr
tubes project, each of these tubes being clamped by a pinch-cock.
After the agitation is over, and when all the carbonic acid is taken
 Up by the alkaline solution, the <U+FB02>uid is poured out from the jar into
 a glass-stoppered bottle holding about 100 0.0.     This can be done
 easily without letting any air into the jar, as the india-rubber cap
 will collapse somewhat while the <U+FB02>uid is allowed to run out through
one of the india-rubber tubes in the cap. a very small quantity of
<U+FB02>uid only being left in the jar. The indie-rubber tube is again
clamped, and the bottle holding the barium hydrate is sealed with
para<U+FB02>ine and left undisturbed for the precipitation of the carbonate
and subsequent analysis.
   The glass jar full of air free from carbonic acid, and absolutely
saturated with moisture, is placed under a funnel supported on a
<U+FB01>lter stand, and the funnel is connected with one of the indie-rubber
tubes projecting from the cap, while the other tube has a short piece
of glass tubing inserted into    to which
                                it,        longer indie-rubber tube

<U+FB01>xed.
   Everything  is now ready for the determination of the oxygen of the
air contained in the glass jar. After turning the stop-cock in the cap
of the eudiometer, so as to allow the hydrogen gas to wash out the
steel tubes and top of the eudiometer, the latter           lowered in the
                                                             is

 cation with the external air; the eudiometer is then rapidly depressed
 and closed. In this position the tube from the hydrogen can be rinsed
 again, independently of the eudiometer, so that the washing may be
 considered as complete and thorough.
     The eudiometer being brought into connexion with the hydrogen is
 again raised, and 18 c.c. of hydrogen gas are taken in under atmo
 spheric pressure.
     The hydrogen kept over water is saturated, and a thermometer
 with its bulb in the bell-jar gives the temperature of the gas, which
 is very nearly that of the laboratory; so that by the time the gas
 is ready to be measured in the eudiometcr it shows no tendency
 either to contract or dilute.       The eudiometer now contains the
 volume of hydrogen required for the analysis, and the stop-cock is
 turned shutting o<U+FB01> the gas from the holder, and opening the V
 shaped tubes through and through in readiness for washing out with
 the air to be analysed.
    The air from the large glass jar is introduced into the endiometer
 in the following way. Having <U+FB01>lled the funnel referred to above
 with water, the latter is let into the jar by opening slightly the
 pinch-cock closing the funnel; at'the same time the glass jar having
been connected with the V-shuped tube of the eudiometer by india
rubber tubing, is opened towards the instrument, when the air
 displaced by the water added rinses out the indie-rubber and steel
tubings.     There is plenty of air in the jar, so that no necessity occurs
to be saving; when the tubes are rinsed the eudiomcter is raised in
the mercury up to about 45 c.c., carrying a column of mercury with
it; then the two-way stop-cock is very carefully turned so as to
admit the air to be analysed, which is aSpired by the mercury as it
subsides.      Thus some 27 c.c. of air are introduced. The aspiration
must be fairly rapid, and the fall of mercury in the tube should be
stopped by turning the stop-cock before the mercury has quite
reached its level in the trough, otherwise there is a risk of a recoil of
                                  ”
the mercury, and a “pumping          which it is important to avoid. The
mixed gases are left undisturbed for two or three minutes, and their
volume is read o<U+FB01> under atmospheric pressure, the eudiometer being
next moved up and down in the mercury by a few centimetres, so as
to effect the perfect mixture of the gases.        The instrument is now
slightly raised, carrying with it a short column of mercury, and the
gases are ignited by the electric spark under reduced atmospheric
pressure.      This mode of proceeding, recommended          by McLeod,*

fect safety.     Immediately after the explosion the gas in the eudio
meter is brought approximately under atmospheric pressure.

1888.]                   A   new  Form of Eudiometer.                            387
   A   slow contraction now takes place as the heat produced by the
explosion is radiated from the instrument; it is advisable to wait
about twenty minutes, until the contraction is complete, and the
volume of the gas is read o<U+FB01> under atmospheric pressure.
   The instrument should be sheltered from any draught, or from the
direct radiation of a <U+FB01>re, and indeed be kept from any change of
temperature, and with that object I <U+FB01>nd it advisable to shelter it with
a cardboard tubular shield sliding up and down the mercury trough.
   If air taken directly from the atmosphere is to be analysed, in order
to ensure its being saturated it will be advisable to pass it through a
tube full of wet horse-hair, and obtain it directly from the tube into
the eudiometer. In the above account of the manipulation required,
the hydrogen is introduced before the air into the eudiometer.                      I
have tried to let in the air <U+FB01>rst, but this plan was not successful
apparently because the mixture of air and hydrogen was incomplete
before the explosion.          The hydrogen being collected <U+FB01>rst in the
endiometer     will   rise from its comparative lightness as the air is
drawn in and mix with it perfectly, while the stream is suf<U+FB01>ciently
rapid to prevent any of the mixture from di<U+FB02>'using out of the tube.
It should be borne in mind that after a number of analyses the water
resulting from the explosions accumulates on the surface of the
mercury in the eudiometer, and the mercury meniscus is no longer
clearly seen. This can be easily avoided by drying the tube with
<U+FB01>ltering paper after a certain number of analyses.              The following are
a few determinations of oxygen in atmospheric air made with the
form of endiometer described above.                They are not selected, but
given in succession in the order in which they were made.                      And I
must here beg to record the valuable aid of my assistant, Mr. Charles
F. Townsend, F.C.S., in the present inquiry.

XIV. “On         the Determination of the Photometric Intensity of
          the Coronal Light during the Solar Eclipse of August 28—29,
          1886. Preliminary Notice.” By Captain W. DE W. ABNEY,
          C.B., R.E., F.R.S., and T. E. THORPE, Ph.D., F.R.S.
          Received June 21, 1888.
     Attempts to measure the brightness of the corona were made by
Pickering in 1870, and by Langley and Smith, independently, in
1878, with the result of showing that the amount of emitted light as
observed at various eclipses, may vary within comparatively wide
limits.   These observations have been discussed by Harkuess
(‘ Washington Observations for 1876,’ Appendix III), and they will be
again discussed in the present paper.   Combining the observations                                  it
appears that the total light of the corona in 1878 was 0072 of that
of a. standard candle at    foot distance, or 3'8 times that of the full
                                     1
moon, or 00000069 that of the sun.       It further appears from the
photographs that the coronal light varied inversely as the square of

18825.]    Intensity  of Coronal Light during Solar Eclipse.                 393
the distance from the sun’s limb.         Probably the brightest part of the
corona was about 15 times brighter than the surface of the full
moon, or 37,000 times fainter than the surface of the sun.
    The instruments employed by the authors in the measurement of
the coronal light on the occasion of the solar eclipse of August 28—29,
1886, were three in number.            The <U+FB01>rst was constructed to measure
the comparative brightness of the corona at different distances from
the moon's limb. The second was designed to measure the total
brightness of the corona, excluding as far as possible the sky e<U+FB01>'ect.
The third was intended to measure the brightness of the sky in the
direction of the eclipsed sun. In all three methods the principle of
the Bunsen photometric method was adopted, and in each the com
parison-light was a small glow-lamp previously standardised by a
method already described by one of the authors in conjunction with
 General Festing. In the <U+FB01>rst two methods the photometer-screen was
<U+FB01>xed, the intensity of the comparison-light being adjusted by one of
Varley’s carbon resistances: in the third the glow-lamp was main
tained at a constant brightness, the position of the screen being
adjusted along a graduated photometer bar, as in the ordinary
 Bunsen method. Full details of the construction of the several
pieces of apparatus will be given in the full paper.
    The observations during the eclipse were made at Hog Island—
 a small islet at the south end of Grenada, in lat. 12° 0' N. and long.
 61° 43' 45" VV., with the assistance of Captain Archer and Lieutenants
 Douglas and Bairnsi'ather of H.M.S. “ Fantome.”                The duration of
totality at the place of observation was about 230 seconds, but
 measurements were possible only during 160 seconds, at the expira
 tion of which time the corona was clouded over.               A careful discus
sion of the three sets of measurements renders it almost certain that
the corona was partially obscured by haze during the last 100 seconds
that it was actually visible. Selecting the observations made during
the <U+FB01>rst minute, which are perfectly concordant, the authors obtain
six measurements of the photometric intensity of the coronal light at
varying distances from the sun’s limb, from which they are able to
deduce a <U+FB01>rst approximation to the law which connects the intensity
of the light with the distance from the limb.
    The observations with the integrating              apparatus made inde
pendently      by Lientenants      Douglas    and   Bairnsfather,    agree very
closely.    It  appears  from    their  measurements    that   the total light of
the corona in the 1886 eclipse was——

   In  comparing these observations with those made during the 1878
eclipse, it must be remembered that the conditions of observation on
the two occasions were widely different.         The observations in the
West Indies were made at the sea’s level, in a perfectly humid atmo
sphere and with the sun at no greater altitude than 19°.          Professor
Langley, in 1878, observed from the summit of Pike’s Peak in the
Rocky Mountains at an altitude of 14,000 feet, in a relatively dry
atmosphere and with the sun at an altitude of 39°.
   From observations on the transmission of sunlight through the
earth’s atmosphere (Abney, Phil. Trans.,’ A, vol. 178 (1887), p. 251)
                                 ‘
one of the authors has developed the law of the extinction of light,
and, by applying the necessary factors, it is found that the intensity
of the light during the 1886 eclipse, as observed at Grenada, is almost
exactly half of that of which would have been transmitted from a
corona of the same intrinsic brightness when observed at Pike’s Peak.
Hence to make the observations of Professor Langley comparable
with those of the authors, the numbers denoting the photometric
intensity of the corona in 1878 must be halved.         The result appears,
therefore, that whereas in 1878 the brightness of the corona was
00305 of a standard candle at a distance of 1 foot, in 1886 it was
only 00124 of a candle at the same distance. Several of the observers
of the West Indian Eclipse (including one of the authors) were also
present at the eclipse of 1878, and they concur in the opinion that the
darkness during the 1886 eclipse was very much greater than in that
of 1878. The graduations on instruments, chronometer faces, &c.,
which were easily read in 1878, were barely visible in 1886.              In
explanation   of  this difference  in luminous    intensity it must  not  be
forgotten that the 1878 eclipse was not very far removed from a.
period of maximum disturbance, whereas in 1886 we were approaching
a period of minimum disturbance.

    Tay Bridge during the Passing of Railway Trains.”                    By

   The absolute methods of seismometry which have been developed
during recent    years in Japan, and have been applied to the measure
ment   of earthquakes there and elsewhere, may serve a useful purpose
in determining the extent and manner of the shaking to which
engineering structures are subject through storms of wind, moving
loads, or other causes of disturbance.     Existing forms of seismograph
are well suited for measurements of this kind, provided the frequency

of the vibrations to be measured is neither very much greater nor
very much less than is usual in earthquakes, and provided, of course,
the amplitude of vibration does not exceed the capacity of the in-                            ‘
strumeut.    For vibrations of high frequency a greater rigidity in. the
multiplying and recording apparatus would be necessary; in vibra
tions of very long period, on the other hand, the; mass whose inertia
furnishes the steady-point of reference will not remain at rest.
Between these extremes, however, there is a wide range within
which such seismographs as are now used to measure earthquakes
may be trusted to give a record that is correct in all substantial
particulars, and the vibrations to be referred to below fall within this
 range.
    The writer has recently employed his Duplex Pendulum Seismo
 graph to examine the vibration of the new Tay Bridge while railway
 trains are passing over       facilities for this examination having been
                                      it,
 kindly given by    Mr.  Fletcher   F. S. Kelsey, resident representative of
 Messrs. Barlow, the engineers of the bridge.           The results are per
haps worth publishing, not so much for any interest they have in
themselves, as because they exemplify a novel method of inquiry
which may prove of use in other cases to engineers. The duplex
 pendulum seismograph, which was designed for and applied to the
measurement of earthquakes in Japan in 1882,‘ consists essentially of
a pair of masses which are supported and connected in such            manner  a
that they   form  an  astatic   combination with freedom to move in any
horizontal direction.      One of the two          hung from above and is
                                                        is

                            is                            unstable; and the

   The seismograph was set upon the ground in the six-foot way
between the two pairs of rails at the, middle of the length of the
southernmost high girder, at             distance of about 1;}; mile from the

are there 245 feetlong, and stand at a height of about 110 feet above
the bottom of the river and 135 feet above the foundations of the
piers.    Between this and the Fife shore there are 28 piers; towards
Dundee there are 57 piers, and at that end the bridge forms a
curve of 21 chains radius by which its direction               turned through
                                                                            is

was no    wind,  and,  until  a. train came on,    the recording   index   of the
seismograph stood perfectly at rest.
   As soon, however, as a train entered the bridge—from either end—
the index began to move. The movements were at <U+FB01>rst so minute that
it   wasdif<U+FB01>cult to estimate their range with any accuracy; allowing
for the multiplication given by the lever, the movement began with
longitudinal shaking through something like T1155 of an inch.  In the
case of trains coming from Dundee this was transmitted round the
bend of the bridge and was noticed long before the train had reached
the straight part. At <U+FB01>rst the movement was wholly longitudinal, and
it was not until the train had come much nearer that lateral oscilla
tion began to be felt. The interval by which longitudinal vibrations
preceded transverse vibrations was much greater than could be
explained by di<U+FB01>erence in their velocity of transmission.   Near the

source of disturbance (as one learnt later when the train was passing
the seismograph) the lateral movement was actually greater than the
longitudinal; it appeared, therefore, that longitudinal disturbance
reached the instrument from greater distances than lateral dis
turbance, because it was transmitted along the bridge with less loss.
As the train came nearer, lateral movements became superposed on
the longitudinal ones, and the index of the seismograph described an
immense series of irregular loops, the range of which increased at
<U+FB01>rst slowly and then quickly to a. maximum as the train passed the
instrument. Along with this progressive increase there was a periodic
rise and fall in amplitude, the beat of which apparently agreed with
the interval taken by the train to pass from pier to pier over succes
sive spans.    The last faint movements terminated abruptly when the
train cleared the structure.
    The vibrations were too numerous to allow the diagrams drawn by
the seismograph to be at all clear, and a better idea of the motion was
to be got by watching the index than by subsequent examination of
the record. Fig. 2 reproduces two of the diagrams, and is suf<U+FB01>ciently

from the south end : after it had passed the seismograph and when
the oscillations were again small, it was observed that another» train
had entered the bridge from Dundee. The glass plate was accordingly
moved by hand to a new position, and the second diagram (B) was
obtained. The movements were in general of the form of nearly closed
 loops resembling ellipses—showing            that the periods of lateral and
of longitudinal vibration         did not diEer greatly.       In the greatest
movements the loops are much wider in the lateral than in the longi
 tudinal direction.    The greatest lateral movement appears to have
 been about one-tenth, certainly not more than one-eighth of an inch ;
 the greatest longitudinal movement about one-fourth of this.             There
 were about three complete vibrations per second.

   The seismograph was afterwards set up just above the pier at the
south end of the span in the middle of which it had previously been
standing, and <U+FB01>ve more records were obtained in the new position.
Except that the motion was somewhat less, they had much the same
characteristics as before. The following notes refer to the passage of

   In all seismometric work, whether it be the measurement of earth
quakes proper, or of such shakings as these, the trustworthiness of
the record depends on the degree to which the presumed “steady
point” of the instrument remains at rest during a protracted dis
turbance of the base.       The accuracy of a seismograph admits of
easy experimental    test  in the manner which the author described
and illustrated when communicating to the Royal Society an account
of his Horizontal Pendulum Seismograph, for recording separate
components of motion upon a moving plate)"           The test consists in
placing   the instrument  upon  a stand  which   may be shaken by hand,
and causing a. true autograph of the motion of the stand to be drawn
by an independently supported index, side by side with the record
that is drawn by the seismograph itself.      Fig. 3 shows how this test
was applied to the instrument with which the Tay Bridge observa
tions were made.     The seismograph was mounted on a stand which
was constructed to give it two degrees of freedom of horizontal
translation, without freedom to rotate. This was done by laying a
pair of turned steel rollers parallel to each other on the top of asteady
level table; a. small drawing-board rested on them; on the top of it
a second pair of steel rollers were laid at right angles to the pair
below;     a second   small drawing-board       lay on them, and the
instrument stood upon it.         The upper board was then free for
translation in all azimuths, and was shaken by hand so that it
imitated the motion in an actual earthquake.            A record of this
motion was drawn by the seismograph index, and beside it a second
record was drawn by the lever and index 9 (<U+FB01>g. 3) which was held
by a gimbal joint in a stiff bracket h secured to the upper board, and
took its motion from a true steady-point                  '11

 that is moved uniformly by clockwork.                 The usual form of this
 instrument comprises two horizontal pendulums, for the two hori
 zontal components, and a third piece which is suspended astatically
 with freedom to move up and down only for the vertical component.*
 This arrangement employs a distinct mass and a distinct “steady
 point” with respect to each component. The duplex pendulum may,
 however, be modi<U+FB01>ed, or rather supplemented, so that it records two
 components of horizontal motion separately (on a moving surface) by
 attaching to one or other of the bobs apair of slot guides at right
angles to the direction of the two components, and pivotting in these
 the short ends of a pair of recording levers, so that each lever will be
 moved when the bob moves across the direction of the corresponding
slot, but will not be moved when the bob moves along that direction.
This makes a compact form of two-component horizontal scismograph,
 with the advantage that by retaining the ordinary index we have, in
addition to the components, a plan drawn of the whole shaking.                   For
the vertical component it is convenient to have a distinct astatically
hung mass. But, as a sort of tour de force in astatic suspension, one or
other of the bobs of the duplex pendulum may be allowed to have a
limited amount of vertical freedom, and may have its equilibrium
made nearly neutral for vertical displacements as well as for hori
zontal displacements.        Let the upper bob, for instance, be hung from
a platform which is free to rise and fall by rotating about a horizontal
axis, and which is held up by springs.             By applying the pull of the
springs in such a manner that the moment of the pull about that axis
is always nearly equal to the moment of the weight, we may approach
vertical astaticism as closely as may he wished, and, provided the
movements up and down are not too great to interfere with the
proper gearing of the bobs, the mass will then possess universal
freedom of translation, with nearly neutral equilibrium                      for all
directions of displacement. In practical seismometry, however, it is no
doubt advisable to restrict the freedom of the suspended mass to (at
most) two degrees.

410             Mr. H. Blanford.          The   Diurnal Barometric
“On the Relations               of the Diurnal Barometric Maxima to
        certain critical Conditions of Temperature, Cloud, and
        Rainfall.”       By HENRY F. BLANFORD, F.R.S.                      Received
        March 30,—Read May 3, 1888.
     It is not my purpose in this paper to discuss the general problem of
the diurnal barometric variation.              It is certainly a very complex
phenomenon, and one of which no satisfactory analysis has yet
 been made.        The atmospheric stress (whatever be its nature) that
 originates the oscillation, is followed by movements which alter both
 the vertical and horizontal distribution of the gravitating mass, and
 the striking differences that characterise the diurnal curve of
 pressure on mountain peaks, plains, and valleys, and on the ocean as
 compared with the land, are doubtless due in a large measure to these
 resulting redistributions of the mass.
     Amid all the recorded variations of the oscillation as a whole, the
 feature that displays the greatest constancy is the occurrence of a
 maximum in some hour of the forenoon, and of a second maximum
 one or two hours before midnight.               The exceptional cases, in which
 these two critical phases are much shifted from their normal positions,
 are but few, and may probably all be explained by gravitation e<U+FB01>ects
 being superadded to the normal semidiurnal oscillation.
      One of the most anomalous forms of the diurnal oscillation yet
  recorded is that given by Professor Mohu, for the North Atlantic,
  between latitudes 62° and 80°, in the summer months.it The general
  form of this pressure curve is similar to that of the diurnal tempera
  ture curve. It falls to a minimum in the early morning hours, and
  rises to a maximum between 1 h. and 3 h. 30 m. PM. But of the three
  curves for diiferent years and latitudes given by Professor Mohn, two
  show, as a subordinate feature, a small rise to a secondary maximum,
  between 10 and 11 PAL, and two an irregularity in the morning rise,
  such as would result from a small wave with a maximum about 7 or
  8 A.M., in combination with the principal oscillation of twenty-four
  hours’ period. At Christiania and Upsala the phases of the single
   period oscillation are reversed, the maximum being in the night, the
   minimum in the day, but the semidiurnal element exhibits characters
   similar to those of the North Atlantic curve.
      This comparative constancy of the semidiurnal element of the
   oscillation, which was originally pointed out by Lamont,'l' seems to
   indicate that it depends more directly on the action of the sun than
               .  ‘

  does the diurnal element,           and that its explanation is a <U+FB01>rst necessary
  step    to that of the whole phenomenon.                  The object of the present
  paper     is  to draw attention to the approximate coincidence of its
  maximum phases with certain critical phases of temperature, cloud,

  physical causes.
                                    Forenoon    Maximum.
       It was noticed independently by Espy, in 1840,* Davies, in 1859;!
  and Kreil, in 1861,11 that the forenoon maximum of the barometric
  oscillation approximately coincides with the most rapid rise of tem
  perature, and each of these writers attributed the rise of pressure to
  the reactionary e<U+FB01>ect of the heated and expanding atmosphere.                     The
  only data,     however,      given by any      of  them     in support of  the  state
  ment are the horary variations of the temPeratnre and pressure at
  Prague, by Kreil, and a rough diagram of the diurnal curves at Padua,
  by Davies; and shortly after the publication of Kreil’s paper, the subject
  was very fully discussed by Lamont, in the paper already referred
               ‘
  to in the       Sitzungsbcrichte’        of the Bavarian Academy, wherein he
 showed that, on the ordinary assumption that the atmosphere is free
 to expand in a vertical direction, against no other resistance than the
 static pressure of the superincumbent mass, the supposed reactionary
 effect would be inappreciable.
       Since the publication of Lamont’s paper,              I  am not aware that any
 physicist has paid further attention to the hypothesis in question, or
 thought it worth while to appeal to further evidence in veri<U+FB01>cation
 of the observation on which it is based, until quite recently.                  But in
 1876, in noticing the subject of the barometric oscillation in the
 ‘
     Indian Meteorologist’s Vade Mecum,’ it occurred to me that Lamont’s
.assumption that the atmosphere is free to expand vertically, lifting
 the superincumbent mass, is subject to an important modi<U+FB01>cation
 which may greatly alter the conditions of the problem as contemplated
 by him.
   '
      These conditions take no account of the resistance to expansion
 that must be opposed by the highly attenuated but extremely cold
 external atmospheric strata of great but unknown thickness, the
 existence of which is proved by the phenomena of luminous meteors.
      If a sheet of the atmospheric envelope, of inde<U+FB01>nite horizontal
 extent, resting on the earth’s surface, be heated and charged with
vapour, the <U+FB01>rst e<U+FB02>’ect will be an increase of its elastic tension, which
will be relieved by a wave of elastic compression transmitted to the

412           Mr. H. F. Blanford.        The Diurnal Barometric
 overlying strata. Having regard to the slow rate at which this wave
 is generated, the rise of temperature, even in such a climate as that
 of lS'orthern India, not exceeding 5° or 6° in the hour of most rapid
 heating, equivalent to an increment of less than <U+FB01>at-h of the initial
pressure,      appears to me that the rate of propagation will be sensibly
              it-
 that due to half the height of a homogeneous atmosphere, or a. little
more than two-thirds the rate of the sound-wave. This rate will be
 continually retarded as the wave advances through the loftier and
colder strata, being proportional to the square root of the absolute
 temperature of each stratum. And           will depend on the thickness of
                                              it
 the atmospheric sheet heated, the amount of the heating, and on the
 thickness and temperature of the cold external strata, whether the
retardation may not be such as to allow of the tension of the lower
strata becoming such as         indicated by the barometer at the time of
                                   is
 the forenoon maximum.         Under such circumstances, the instant of
maximum pressure should coincide with that of the most rapid rise
of temperature and vaporisation.
I     do not think that our knowledge of any of these fundamental
conditions      such as to justify a rejection of the hypothesis on priori
                  is                                                     d
grounds, and       may therefore be worthy of inquiry how far
                        it                                               in
                                                                         it   is
accordance with veri<U+FB01>able observation. At Calcutta, the atmospheric
pressure at        30 m. an.

                                    is
the morning     minimum;    an increase  which would be produced by heat
ing the air in       closed vessel less than 2°.
                         a                         A retardation of about
half an hour in the dissipation of the increased pressure produced by
heating and evaporation would suf<U+FB01>ce to produce the observed e<U+FB01>ect.
    Dr. Sprung, in his admirable manual, the ‘Lehrbueh der Meteoro
logie,’ published in 1885, has referred to the above hypothesis) and
has tested the coincidence of the critical phases of temperature and
pressure by the summer results of the hourly observations and auto
graphic registers of the Prague Observatory, from 1842 to 1861,.
which have been recomputed by Professor Augustin.             The result of
this test appears to be satisfactory.       At Prague, on the mean of the
summer months, the forenoon barometric maximum occurs a little
after 8  A.M., and nearly coincides with the most rapid rise of tempera
ture.1'
  In India there     no station at which the forenoon maximum falls
                              is
at so early an hour at any season; but at Yarkaud and Kashghar,
according to Dr. Scully’s valuable observations, in the summer,                    it
occurs even earlier than at Prague, while in the winter             is
                                                           as late as

    1' Throughout this paper the time of most rapid heating has been determined in
 the following manner: in general, from the uncorrected means of the observations,
 which, for the reasons shown by Dr. Bergsma (‘ Batavia Meg. and Met. Obs.,’ vol. 1,
 p. xvii) and in accordance with my own experience and that of other Indian
 meteorologists, if the observations are su<U+FB02>iciently extensive, are more trustworthy
 than the so-called corrected values obtained by computing them from three or four
terms of the harmonic formula.
    The instant of most rapid rise of temperature may be ascertained by twice
 di<U+FB01>erentiatiug for the values of t the formula which expresses the temperature 0 as
 a function of the time t, and putting

 The most convenient formula for this purpose is that of the method of di<U+FB01>erenca
employed            J
             by Dr. elinelr for obtaining the approximate times of the maximum and
minimum phases of temperature, pressure, &0. On taking the <U+FB01>rst, second, and
third di<U+FB02>'erences of the temperatures at the clock hours, two before and two after
the instant of most rapid rise, the hour in which this occurs is shown by the change
of algebraical sign of the second order of differences.           Denoting that which pro

  414         Mr. H.  F. Blanford.       The  Diumal Barometric
  Considering the character of the data and the method of computation,
 this close coincidence in the winter months must be regarded as in
 some degree fortuitous.
    In order to test the hypothesis more thoroughly,             I    have selected
 four stations, the data for which are more ample, and thoroughly
 trustworthy, viz., Bombay, Calcutta, Batavia, and Melbourne; and in
 the case of the last three,      I   have compared the critical phases in
 question for every month of the year.
    The data for Bombay are taken from Mr. C. Chambers’s volume on
 theMeteorology of the Bombay Presidency.              The barometric data for
 Calcutta are extracted from vol. 1 of the ‘Indian Meteorological
 Memoirs,’ and as      I have not the corresponding thermometrical data
 at hand,‘ll I have substituted those obtained from the measurements of
 the Alipore photographic traces for the six years 1881—1885.                  These
 latter relate, therefore, to a different and later series of years, and are
furnished by a di<U+FB02>'erent observatory, but this is hardly a matter of
importance.      The Batavian data are taken from the <U+FB01>rst volume of
 Dr. Bergsma’s ‘ Magnetical and Meteorological Observations,’ and
have been derived from the hourly readings of three years; and the
Melbourne data are from Dr. Neumayer’s discussion of the observa
tions of the Flagsta<U+FB01> Observatory.              They extend over <U+FB01>ve years.
 The results are shown in the following table :—

 416       Mr. H. F. Blanford.       The Diurnal Barometric
   From this table it appears that only in      one or two of the  winter
 months at Batavia and Melbourne does the foren00n maximum of
 pressure coincide so nearly with the moment of most rapid heating
 as at Prague and Yarkand.        In all cases, except in the midwinter
 months at Melbourne, the former follows the latter by an interval
which averages 31 minutes at Melbourne, 35 minutes at Batavia,
 1 hour and 8 minutes at Calcutta,        and 1 hour and 48 minutes at
 Bombay. But it is to be noticed that, at all the stations, this interval
is shortest in the winter and greatest in the summer. It is true that
the computed temperature epochs may be 10 minutes or so in error,
owing to the merely approximative character of the method adopted,
and that, for an hour or more afterwards, the change in the rate of rise
is very small, not exceeding a few tenths of a degree per hour; but
the retardation of the barometric maximum is too systematic to be
explained away by any such considerations.           There are, however,
others of a Very obvious character.
   The hypothesis attributes the increase of pressure in the forenoon
to the mean increase of tension in the atmosphere up to a very great
height, not to that of the lowest stratum only. And since this latter is
heated much more rapidly than the higher strata, and that, owing to
variations in the character of the earth’s surface, the rates of heating
in contiguous areas of the lower strata themselves vary inde<U+FB01>nitely,
the convective movements, which are set up in consequence, produce
innumerable small modi<U+FB01>cations in the form of the local temperature
curves, which will to a great extent eliminate each other when a
mean is taken of those of higher and lower strata; and the general
form of this curve for the greater mass of the superincumbent
atmosphere must be much more constant than that deduced from the
thermometer readings of our observatories.             Generally, as was
assumed. by Lamont in his discussion of the problem, the critical
phases of the former will be later than those of the latter.         This
retardation will be greatest   where   the  diurnal range of temperature
is greatest, and especially at such inter-tropical stations as Bombay
and Calcutta.
   The diurnal march of the temperature at such an observatory as
the Colaba Observatory at Bombay, must be in<U+FB02>uenced in a high
degree by the local in<U+FB02>ux of cooler air from the neighbourhood.
Situated on a narrow point of land, and surrounded, in all directions
but one, by many miles of sea, the atmosphere is scarcely ever calm,
and a wind from any quarter other than between north and north
west comes directly from the sea close at hand, the movement of the
air increasing with the rise of temperature. To this circumstance, in
all probability, it is due that this rise undergoes a slight check at an
earlier hour than at any of the other stations. It is very slight, as is
shown in the following table, which gives the amount of the rise for

            Jifaxima and certain Conditions of Temperature, do.           417
  each   hour from 6 an. to noon in each half of the year.           But it is
  su<U+FB01>icient to explain the early occurrence of its maximum.

    At Calcutta, Batavia, and Melbourne, the observatories are
 su<U+FB02>iciently far from the sea to exclude the supposition that they are
 subject to its in<U+FB02>uence in anything like the same degree as Bombay,
but at all of these the temperature must be in<U+FB02>uenced by convection,
 which is most active in the summer months; and, as already
 remarked, it is at this season that the instant of most rapid heating
 precedes     the barometric maximum by the longest interval.              In
 certain of the winter months, viz., August at Batavia, and May and
July at Melbourne, the time of most rapid heating, and that of the
barometric maximum are as nearly coincident as at Prague and
 Yarkand; and in June, at Melbourne, the latter appears to anticipate
the former by about half an hour. Of this opposite anomaly I am
not prepared with any explanation.             More than one circumstance
 might    be  imagined  in the   local conditions  of the observatory which
 would retard the instant of greatest rise, but without searching
 inquiry and examination on the spot, any suggestion would be mere
 vain surmise.       I may, however, notice that the 'June curve of
 temperature departs from the ordinary parabolic form in a manner
that points to the existence of some local irregularity, and that similar
irregularities are noticeable in other parts of some others of the
monthly curves.
    As a <U+FB01>nal conclusion, if these data, when subjected to the rigorous
test   I  have applied, do not give strong support to the hypothesis,
 neither do they, with the single exception just mentioned, show any
discrepancy which is not susceptible of a simple and probable
explanation;      and the single exception is one which might also
probably be explained, were the requisite information available.

    The tendency of the skies to clear after sunset in settled weather
has been noticed by many writers, eVen in the irregularly variable
climates of Europe, and in India it is most striking at all seasons of
the year.      The cloud registers of nearly all stations at which hourly
observations have been made, show a strongly marked minimum

418        Mr. H.   F. Blanford.   The Diurnal Barometric
between sunset and midnight, the average hour being about 10 an. ;
and some show a second subordinate minimum about 9 or 10 A.M.
The cloud curves for Allahabad given by Mr. S. A. Hill on Plate
28, vol. 1 of the Indian Meteorological Memoirs,’ exhibit both these
                  ‘
minima in most months of the year, that of the evening'being the abso
lute minimum of the twenty-four hours. On the average of the year,
the mean proportion, at 10 P.M., is 2'52 (on-the O to 10 scale), that of
the twenty-four hours being 3'10 : the de<U+FB01>ciency therefore is more than
one~sixth.   The cloud curves of Melbourne given by Dr. N eumayer also
show that, in every month except November, the diurnal minimum of
cloud is between 7 h. 30 m. 1am. and  l h. 30 m. A.M.; and, on the mean
of the whole year, it occurs at 9 h. 44 m. PM. At this hour, the mean
proportion is 5'55, the general mean of the twenty-four hours being
6'56; so that, here also, the de<U+FB01>ciency amounts to one-sixth of the
average.    At Bombay, the absolute minimum, according to Mr.
Chambers’s table, occurs at 8 and 9 P.M., and the de<U+FB01>ciency is one-ninth
of the general average.    The mean diurnal cloud curves of Allahabad,
Melbourne, and Bombay, for the average of the whole year are given
in <U+FB01>gs. 1, 2, and 3.

422                           -    Mr. H. F. Blanford.                   The         Diurnal Barometric
    In
     the rainy season there were 2929 rainy hours                                                               in the seven years,
giving an average of 122 for each hour of the day.                                                                But for the hour
between    10 and 11 9.111. there were but 78 instances of rain, or but
two-thirds of this average, and from 8 to 9 A.M. but 91 instances of
rain, or three-fourths of the average.           The de<U+FB01>ciency in the quantity
of the rainfall was even more striking. The average per hour of the
day was 12‘81 inches, but the recorded amount for the hour between
10 and 11 Mi. was only 4'76 inches, or less than two-<U+FB01>fths of the
general average, and that from 9 to 10 A.M. was 8‘46 inches, or little
more than two-thirds.
   Another equally striking example of the approximate coincidence of
interruptions of the rainfall, about the time of the diurnal'maxima of
pressure, is afforded by Batavia, on the evidence of ten years’ registers
of the hourly rainfall, published by Dr. Bergsma in the 3rd volume
        ‘
of the Batavia Observations.’           Here also, it is only the rainy reason
(December    to  January)   that    exhibits    this feature in a very decisive
manner,   and  the coincidence    is  the  more    remarkable, since, in another
respect, the diurnal variation of the rainfall of Batavia stands in
marked contrast to that of Calcutta.                 At Calcutta the greater
proportion    of  the  rain  falls   in   the   daytime;   at Batavia at night.
The percentages     were  respectively      as follows :—
                                                                             Calcutta.                                 Batavia.
                   From           6 11.11 to 6 am.        . . . .    603 per              cent.                 478 per cent.

And the Batavian maximum follows the minimum within four hours,
in the proportion of      to     The following table gives the total

         Mawima and certain Conditions        of Temperature,   (1:0.   423
    The general  average of all the hours is 4112 mm. per hour, but the
quantity recorded between 9 and 10 RM. is only 231 mm., or little
more than half, and that between 10 and 11 A.M. 288 mm., or little
more than three-<U+FB01>fths of this average.        It is to be observed that the
forenoon minimum of Batavia falls an hour later than that of
Calcutta, whereas the evening and principal minimum is an hour
earlier. This is exactly what might be expected from the combina
tion of a double diurnal oscillation with one of single period, the
latter having its maximum in the former case at night, in the latter
in the daytime.
    The Melbourne hourly rainfall tables show great variations in
di<U+FB01>erent months, and admit of very little de<U+FB01>nite conclusion, except
that, as at Batavia, there is more rain at night than in the day.         It
 is then only in the warm and nearly saturated atmosphere of Bengal
and Java, in their respective rainy seasons, that these diurnal inter
ruptions of the rainfall about the hours of the two barometric
maxima are decidedly manifested.          But in these two cases they are
most marked; and this circumstance, taken in conjunction with the
corresponding cloud variation, which is shown by so many stations,
points strongly to a causal connexion between the diurnal variation
of pressure and the condensation of atmospheric vapour in the cloud
forming strata of the atmosphere, which,        I think, we can scarcely fail
to recognise.
    The mere fact that an increase of atmospheric pressure, from what
 ever cause arising, is accompanied with a dissipation of cloud and a
 diminution of rainfall, would not perhaps call for special remark.
 But it is to be observed that whereas the nocturnal barometric maxi
 mum, at all the stations here dealt with, is less pronounced than that
 of the forenoon, the concomitant e<U+FB01>ects in the clearing of the atmo
 sphere and in the check in the rainfall are much greater in the former
 case than in the latter.    They seem to point to a'forcible compression
 of the atmosphere,    and  dynamic heating of the cloud-forming strata.
 And some such temporary e<U+FB01>’ect does not seem impossible, even at a
 time when the earth’s surface and the air immediately in contact with
 it are cooling rapidly. Moreover the temperature curves of Prague,
  Calcutta, and Batavia all show a very slight irregularity about 10 P.M.,
  which indicates a slight check in the fall of temperature about that
  hour greater than takes place either in the preceding or subsequent
  hour, and which may possibly be the manifestation of such an action
  in the lowest atmospheric stratum. Slight as it is, the fact that it.
  occurs at the same hour in all these curves, and that it coincides with
  the evening pressure maximum and the strongly marked minima of
  cloud and rainfall, is at least signi<U+FB01>cant.
     When we tabulate the di<U+FB01>erences of the <U+FB01>rst and second orders of
  the hourly means of the original observations, at the three stations

 speci<U+FB01>ed, it is found that the second di<U+FB02>r‘erenco corresponding to 10 P.u.,
with   a positive sign, has a greater numerical value than either of
 those preceding and following                       it,
                                   instead of an intermediate value, as
would be the case       the fall of temperature after sundown were
                                if
decreasing uniformly.   In the following tables, the <U+FB01>gures for Prague
and Batavia represent hundredths of a centigrade degree, those for
Calcutta hundredths of a Fahrenheit         degree.    The <U+FB01>gures for
Calcutta are derived from only six years’ autographic traces; those
for Prague, apparently from eighteen or twenty years' observations
and traces; and those for Batavia from ten years’ readings of a
standard thermometer. No correction has been applied to the means
of the observations as recorded.

   The only further point of some signi<U+FB01>cance, to which  have to draw                        I
attention,   that the hour of the evening barometric maximum about
              is
coincides with the time when the temperature curve ceases to be
strongly concave, and becomes nearly rectilinear, indicating a nearly
uniform rate of cooling from that time up to just before sunrise.
This fact suggests the possibility that the evening maximum of pres
sure may be determined by the check in the descent of the cooling
and collapsing atmosphere which takes place from      or  P.M. to about                  6     7

   The variations from mouth to month shown by this table are, as
might be expected, less than in the table at page 415 cemputed from
six years only, but the mean interval for the whole year     exactly                                  is
the same.
   The irregularity of the evening fall of temperature noticed at
page 423 does not appear in the results of this table, and it’must
therefore remain doubtful whether its occurrence in the three regis

:CROONIAN       LEOTURE.——“    On the Origin and the Causation of
       Vital Movement ( Ueber die Entstehung der vitalen Bewegung).”
       By Dr. \V. KfIHNE, Professor of Physiology in the University
       of Heidelberg. Communicated by Professor M. FOSTER,
       Sec. RS. Received April 22, Delivered in the Theatre of
       the Royal Institution May 28, Revised August 15, 1888.
                                (Translation)
     Among the phenomena.    of life the movement of  masses, or mechanical
  work, takes a prominent place.        It is the most accessible of all the
  vital processes to our sensual perceptions, so universally distributed,
  and so bound up with most of the activities of organisms, that it
   might almost be designated the incarnation of life.
     In saying this it must be understood that vital movement is by no
  means exclusively con<U+FB01>ned to animals, that it is not, as was once
  believed, a special animal function; on the contrary'it is an attribute of
  all living matter, as well of the lowest creatures as of the most highly
  developed plants, so that, however extraordinary it may appear, the
activity of our muscles which enables us to transform sensation into
  action <U+FB01>nds an analogue in the plant.        Our conviction of the inter
  connexion and profound unity of all living things has thus‘a- physio
  logical foundation, based as it is not merely on the community of
 derivation and of structure of living things, but also on the proof of
similar activities.
     If a division of the morphological from the physiological is in any
  way permissible, it may be said that the unitary conception of life
-for which our age is distinguished rests in a higher degree on the
 knowledge of vital processes than is commonly recognised, and in fact
  is just as much founded on physiological experience as on that of the
forms of the organism.
     From the traditional conception of life, which scarcely contained
 more than that everything between life and death is the antithesis of
 the not living, it is a long road we have had to travel to attain to the
 modern conception of the real unity of life; and a remarkable road,
 since it bears witness to the con<U+FB01>dent anticipation of victory, in face
 of all impediments raised up by science itself. Movement, and nothing
 less, had been placed at the summit of that antithesis, which physico.
 chemical research in the animal and vegetable kingdom had revived
 with the discovery that the plant transformed kinetic into potential
 energy, and the animal the latter into the former.       While the animal
 made use of oxygen to generate heat and perform work through the
 metabolism of its substance, the plant made use of the heat in reducing
                                                                 2 1 2

428                       Dr. \V. Kiihne.        On the
and synthetic processes for the accumulation of potential energy in
the form of its own consumable substance and the expired oxygen.
    With whatever unassailable c0rrectness this conception comprehends
life as a whole, a<U+FB02>‘ording a pleasing solution of its antithesis by
referring animal activities to nourishment by the plant, the latter to
the products of the combustion of the animal body, and both in the
last instance to the forces of the sun as original source of all life, yet
this did but cast up the sum total of the processes of life, and did but
express more intimately than before that which divides the most
highly developed branches of the animal and vegetable kingdom, in
which the divergence of .forms and arrangements is greatest. For
 by the side of this distinction there exists even between man and the
most highly elaborated plant a connexion of a kind quite other than
the symbiotic interdependence through the medium of light, air, and
food, a community, however, which is not disclosed until we go back
to the ultimate elements of organisation.
    As in the animal synthetic processes are not wanting, without
which it could not even produce a molecule of the colouring matter
 of its blood, so in' the plant we are acquainted with dissociations and
 combustion, and also with evolution of heat and movement of masses;
not that by this I refer to those coarser movements which are refer
able to turgescence, but primitive movements, which we <U+FB01>nd <U+FB01>rst in
 the smallest elementary organisms, of which all living beings are
made up.
    We have almost in our own persons lived to see the old anticipation
of a single kingdom of living things become gradually an established
truth through the discovery of the cell. After the ground-lines of the
construction of plants and animals out of originally similar nucleated
 cells had been established by Th. Schwann, and since Darwin’s
 immortal work enabled us to derive everything that ever lived or
will live from one single cell, we have come to realise that every
 single organism renews in itself the work of past ages, and again
 builds itself up from a germ similar to that from which its most
ancient ancestors started.
    This conviction has become so <U+FB01>rmly implanted in our generation
 that now we scarcely feel the gaps which still exist in our actual
 knowledge, and almost unjustly underestimate that which the inves
 tigations of our contemporaries yet add to the cell-theory, as if it
 were mere work of repetition.         And yet it has been very extensive
 and decisive—for example, the recent researches upon the intimate
 structure of the cell nucleus—since nothing less results from it than
 that the reproduction of the cell by <U+FB01>ssion takes place identically,
 down to the most minute details, in all animals and plants (1)."I
    Now if the shaping of the cell and all the fashioning of forms is an

activity, and if Morphology, “since it has made the arising of form
more its study than the describing of what is already completed, ” has
become part of Physiology, it might be possible and conceivable that
research directed to all activities and going beyond the visible form
to the chemical components of the structures and the transformation
of substance and force, should observe great differences in processes
where all our morphological experience would only have shown
identity.    \Ve were near enough to this point; for if it were true, as
was long assumed, that that which is the bearer and the seat of the
most essential of all vital processes in the cell is completely form
less, it is not easy to see why the form should be so determinant of
function.
   We have hope that this is not so, and will endeavour to show in
Movement the functional as well as the morphological unity of all
living matter.

like the so-called Sarcode—in many cases better comparable to the
movement of the pseudopodia of Rhizopods.        The resemblance of the
latter to what was formerly called the sap-current in many plant-cells,
led Ferd. Cohn (2) to interpret plant protoplasm as sarcode, an idea
actively supported by Max Schultze (3), the best authority on pseudo
podial movement. It is not necessary to say here how widespread
protoplasmic movement is, for there cannot be a cell that does not
present it at some stage of its existence.    Doubt on this subject can
 only exist in regard to the smallest of all organisms, those of fermen
tation, of putrefaction, and of pathogenic activity which are too small
for observation. But even in these, from the movement they perform
 as a whole, we have grounds to infer the existence of a protoplasm.
    It is proved that protoplasmic movement does not follow external
 impulses 0r currents, but is a spontaneous activity.    It may go on in
opposition to gravity, and overcomes frictional resistance, as shown
 by the mass itself moving forward on surfaces of every kind, and
 being able to drag heavy bodies along with it. It is proper mecha
nical work.
    The cause of the movement can only be an internal one, residing in
the contractile substance itself, and can only consist of chemical pro
 cesses taking place within the peculiar pasty, slime-like mass. Yet the
 question had to be put whether these processes were not <U+FB01>rst set up
 by something coming perhaps from the outside, for the movement
changes, sometimes stops or takes place more slowly, or occurs but par
 tially, and may by many means be arti<U+FB01>cially aroused or diminished.

   430-                  _  Dr. W. Kiihne.      On the
       At  this point experimental physiological research had to step in,
    attacking the problem in the same way as it had long before done
   in the case of the most highly developed contractile structures, the
    muscles.    A muscle behaves so far just like protoplasm that its con
   traction does work, which can only depend on chemical transforma
   tions of its own substance, during which potential is converted into
   kinetic energy; but it di<U+FB01>ers in that a distinct impulse from without
   is needed to set the game going.      In normal conditions it receives the
   initiating impulse from its nerve, and nothing else appears able to
   take its place, since nothing that might otherwise act upon it, such as
   the motion of the blood or changes in its constitution, disturbs its
  repose.     But if we let electric currents traverse the muscle, or if we
  suddenly change its temperature, or act upon it mechanically or
  chemically, contractions result which do an amount of work out of all
  relation to the insigni<U+FB01>cant impulse; the means employed only set
  going the process peculiar to the muscle, and this is what is meant
 .when we term them stimuli, and the faculty of muscles to react to
  them irritability.
      Now is protoplasm irritable in this sense? Experiments on ob
  jects of every kind have answered this af<U+FB01>rmative] y, and more than that
  have even shown a striking agreement with the irritability of muscle.
   Of the above mentioned agents, besides rise of temperature, which
   ultimately sets all contractile cell-substance in maximal contraction—
  a heat tetanus (4) which disappears with cooling—the electric current
  has shown itself the most ef<U+FB01>cient, the stimulus which most surely
  excites muscles of every kind as well as all nervous matter, and has
  thence become the most indispensable instrument of physiology.
      I may be permitted to adduce an example because it illustrates what
  is typical and essential (5). It is the case of the fresh water Amoebaa.
  Every time these organisms, moving like melting and rolling drops,
   are subjected to an induction shock they contract almost to a sphere,
   and assume the spherical form completely if the shocks follow each
   other at short intervals, being by this means <U+FB01>xed for a longer time
   in this condition.      Feebler shocks which singly have no effect,
   become effective by summation when applied in quick succession,
  just as in the case of muscle. If the movements of the animal
   by itself are sluggish, on electrical stimulation they are strengthened
  and accelerated.     Thus the stimulation increases the natural move
  ment, and if increased stimulation brings about repose, it is only the
  apparent repose of prolonged maximal contraction, like that of our
  muscles when we hold out a weight for some time at arm’s length.
  All protoplam behaves in this way from whatever source derived.
  Larger masses which cannot contract to one sphere (as in many
  plant cells, or those great cake-like giant masses of the plas
  modium of the Myxomycetes) form several such spheres in part

                      Causation of Vital Movement.                    431
connected by thread-like bridges. Everywhere the taking on of a
<U+FB01>gure with smallest surface is the result of stimulation, and the
expression of augmented contraction           That which was outstretched
becomes shorter and in like measure thicker, just as a muscle swells
when it shortens itself.
    Since protoplasm, which either does not move at all spontaneously
or so slowly that we cannot perceive     it,   reacts in the same way to
stimuli, we must in the case of ordinary movements infer the exist
ence of processes originating them either in the interior, i.e., automatic
stimuli, or of external processes which had at <U+FB01>rst escaped us.
Whoever sees for the <U+FB01>rst time the action of any one of the simpler
independent Protozoa cannot avoid the idea that psychic activity
in the strictest sense of the term lies behind    it,   something like will
and design. He sees the elementary being seeking and taking up
food, avoiding obstacles, and when touched by foreign objects ener
getically drawing back, so that he infers sensation also.       Possibly he
has struck the correct solution, at least we could not refute him, but
we should put his deduction to a hard proof     if     we showed him the
same phenomena      in  the  colourless cells of his own blood, or in the
protoplasm of a plant-cell; and     if  we placed before him the rhyth
mically contracting cells from the beating heart of a bird’s egg
incubated barely a couple of days, he would certainly wish with us
that the search were for a more material cause, and hope that
some chemical or physical cause might be found to set up the
process.     Biology cannot indeed yet claim to have established such
causes   in  explanation of the automatism of protoplasm, but no one
will blame the science for continuing the search for them.
    Some causes are already excluded, e.g., light, although there are a
few micro-organisms whose movements are excited by (7). Fluctu
                                                             it
ations of temperature may also be left out of account. On the other
hand, oxygen has  a    notable in<U+FB02>uence         Withdrawal of the vital air
stops all protoplasmic movement, though without killing the cell-body,
as is  seen from the fact that after the loss of automatism electrical
 stimulation can supply its place, and that the normal movements return
on readmitting the air.
    We might thus consider oxygen the prime mover in automatism
and processes of oxidation its essence, did we not remember that many
 objects need very prolonged withdrawal of the gas to come com
pletely to rest.   This might, however, depend upon the dif<U+FB01>culty of
removing the last traces of oxygen completely, or       itmay be that these
 cannot   be  removed    by  the means    adopted,  but  must  remain until
 consumed by the protoplasm itself.
    Since protoplasm  is   of pap-like softness, and may be in a state of
 rest or motion at any spot, its exterior limits are just as capable of
 changesas everything within   it   is capable of quitting its position and

                       '
432                      Dr. W. Kiihne.        0n   the
taking up any other.        Thus the movement cannot become more
ordered until obstacles con<U+FB01>ne and direct it. Between the perfected
organisation of contractile substance in muscle and that of protoplasm
capable only of unordered movement, we meet a succession of signi
<U+FB01>cant steps by means of which we can see how the ordering was
attained.    The <U+FB01>rst step would seem to consist in the uncommonly
widespread <U+FB02>agellar and ciliary motion, in which an elastic structure,
a<U+FB02>ixed on one side to the contractile mass, is drawn down or bent by its
movement, straightening out again in the rhythmic pauses of repose.
A further step, at which the contraction can only take place along an
axis, consists in the arrangement of the protoplasm in <U+FB01>ne strips
wholly or partially surrtmnded by elastic walls, or again in elastic
<U+FB01>brils being embedded in protoplasmic processes.              In this case we
have actual primitive muscles       before  us,  of  which   the most elegant
examples are known in the Infusoria among the Vorticellaa and
Steutores.     The movement of these structures is quite like that of
muscle. The strips lengthen and thicken, and they may also be con
tracted in quick twitches or in a prolonged tetanus, the relaxing,
like the stage of diminishing energy of all muscles, always pro
ceeding more slowly than that of the increasing energy before the
maximum.
    The muscles of the unicellular Infusoria, no longer doubtful in a
physiological sense, show us muscle as a constituent of the cell, and
di<U+FB01>erentiation, without the production of' new cells specially endowed
for the purpose, taking place in one cell to the extent of elaborating
 contractile elements determinate in form and precise in work.             It is
 very noteworthy that side by side with these muscular strips provided
 with highly regulated movement, other protoplasm persists, which
 continues uninterruptedly its ordinary unordered movements, while
 no such unrest is to be remarked in the muscles.            On the contrary.
 these latter are only used from time to time, apparently for attaining
 distinct objects. We get the impression that the automatism has, as
 it were, been lost by this portion, so that it must wait for stimuli to
reach it from other parts of the cell. If oxygen really applies the
<U+FB01>rst spur to the protoplasm, it has no direct power over the primitive
 muscle, so that compared with the protoplasm the muscle is endowed
 with a diminished irritability.
    It has often been said that protoplasm presents the complete set of
 vital phenomena—assimilation,        dissimilation, contractility, automa
 tism, resorption, respiration,  and   secretion, and even reproduction by
 dividing.    Leaving reproduction on one side, as now disputed and on
 good grounds, we can assent to the assertion, and examine which of
those functions remain for the products of differentiation.         In the case
of   the muscle,  we  <U+FB01>nd  it to be  all of them     with  the  exception of a
single one; for, while it undoubtedly takes part in nutrition as in

                        Causation of Vital Movement.                   433
 respiration and carries on a chemical exchange, all of which are
 indispensable for contractility, 11.12., for its work, and since secretion
 generalised signi<U+FB01>es merely the throwing off of broken-down products,
 it is wanting only in automatism, that faculty of reacting to certain
 stimuli, which remained reserved for protoplasm._ In this there is
 nothing opposed to the assumption that protoplasm as opposed to
 muscle possesses elementary nervous properties.
    The above is suf<U+FB01>cient to show the transition to the very highly
 developed motor apparatus, which distinguishes the animal kingdom
 from almost its lowest stages —I mean the bi-cellular apparatus, which
 consists of separate cells united only for one purpose, one of which
 presents the exciting nerve, the other the obedient muscle.
    From past experience we know that division of the nerve, or more
 correctly speaking, removal of the nervous cell substance, condemns
 the muscle to rest. The stimuli then start from the nerve-cell, to
 them the muscles react by doing work, and they are conveyed to the
 muscles through the continuation of the cell which the nerve-<U+FB01>bre
 presents. We need not yet trouble ourselves how the excitation of
 the nerve-cell arises, whether through external—sensory—stimuli,        or
 through an enigmatical psychic act, or through chemical in<U+FB02>uences;
 certain it is that these were before the division of the nerve the sole
 impulse to the muscle’s movements.          But what the muscles lack we
 can supply arti<U+FB01>cially, and more; we can put the nerve-remnant in
 such manifold states of excitement as it never before experienced from
 its cell-body, so that the muscle is compelled to undergo many kinds
 of movement quite new to it, and we can attain the same result by
 direct stimulation of the muscle.
    In the circle of these experiences arose the controversy, not yet
 quite ended (9), as to muscular irritability, properly the question
 whether it was, in general, possible to stimulate anything arti<U+FB01>cially
that is not nerve, that is, to set free the activity peculiar to a non
nervous structure by the means at our command.
    Haller, who was the <U+FB01>rst to occupy himself minutely with the
stimulation of muscle, and introduced the term irritability, decided,
but only incidentally and by the way, that the stimulus could strike
also the rami<U+FB01>cations of the nerve in the muscle, and he was far from
interesting himself in the question in the modern sense, or from
suspecting the point of view from which the independent irritability
of muscle would later on be questioned. We ought not to blame him
much for the latter, since even today it is not easy to understand the
motives of an opposition now continued for more than a century.          At
the outset, if I am not mistaken, the teaching of the Animistic, or as
it might now be called, the Neuristic school, led to the conception
that not only the excitation and regulation of the various functions,
but the actual endowment of the several tissues with their respective

434                     Dr. \V. Kiihne.     On the
activities, was the work of that everywhere predominant and distinctly
animal contrivance, the nervous system.
    In connexion with this, there seems to have arisen the view of the
ubiquity of nerves, that is, of so <U+FB01>ne a penetration of the parts with
nerve radiations that, especially in muscle, not the smallest particle
 free from nerve could be demonstrated, a view which on the strength
 of microscopic research is coming up again at the present day in a con
 stantly new dress, and <U+FB01>nds energetic adherents (10), but as we shall
 see is to be refuted, especially by experiment.     If we disregard this,
 we shall <U+FB01>nd the tendency to consider only nerves as excitable, in some
 degree founded on the differentiation which transferred automatism to
 the nervous matter, robbing all the remaining tissues of irritability, so
 that they only retained the faculty of reacting to the stimulated nerve
‘with which they were bound up. This was as much as saying it was
 impossible arti<U+FB01>cially to replace the nervous stimulus, or that if we did
 succeed, we were strictly imitating it, in which case, indeed, we should
have come unawares upon the solution of the problem of motor
innervation.     Against such arguments it availed nothing to point out
 the excitability of nerveless sarcode, as was often done in favour of
irritability : for, just as it was formerly useless, because the real
genetic connexion of sarcode and muscle was not known, so to-day it
would have to be rejected, because automatic protoplasm can also be
 correctly considered nervous.
    A non-irritable muscle would strike us as strange enough, and,
against all expectation, different from the nerve, when we consider
that the nerve-<U+FB01>bre, although incapable of being affected by all, the
natural stimuli which excite its ganglion cells, free that is from auto
 matism, is arti<U+FB01>cially excitable at every spot by the most different
 agents.    However, we have no further need of such considerations,
 since the question of irritability lies within a region where instead
 of speculation, observation and experiment have become decisive.
    As a matter of fact, the older statements, long considered a good
 basis for opposing irritability, are incorrect, as for instance, that an
excised piece of muscle in which no nerves could be seen with the
lens did not twitch on stimulating it.
    We can show you a little piece 3 mm. long from the end of the
 sartorius muscle of the frog, in which the best microscope discovers no
traces of nerves, easily made recognisable by osmium-gold staining
  (<U+FB01>g. 1). Such a piece, transversely cut off, twitches as we know at each,
 e<U+FB01>ective muscular stimulus.     Pieces which can be obtained free from
 nerVes from many other muscles, behave in the same way, as for
 instance pieces from the delicate muscles of the pectoral skin of a
 frog (<U+FB01>g. 2).
    Further, the assertion was incorrect that everything that excited
 the nerve made the muscle twitch, and vice send,- for we see here a

                       Causation of Vital illovement.                435

 sartorius suspended in ammonia vapour, contracting powerfully, while
 a nerve entirely submerged in liquid ammonia appears wholly
 unstimulated, for it does not rouse the thigh muscles from their
repose.    (Experiment shown.)
   Conversely, we see a thigh whose nerve dips into glycerine in
maximal contraction, and on the other hand, a muscle in cOntact at its
excitable end with the same glycerine remains at rest, yet it twitches
   I
if dip it in up to its nerve-bearing tracts (11).
   These are old experiments (12), and it is admitted they have over
thrown the earlier opinion. But they have not been deemed suf<U+FB01>cient to
prove muscular irritability, because the ultimate endings of the nerves
might have an irritability other than that of their stems.   This is the
only objection still raised.    One could wish no other were con
ceivable, for this one admits of refutation.
   To this end permit me to go a little into detail concerning nerves.
Nerves are processes of nerve-cells composed of <U+FB01>brils of immeasur
able <U+FB01>neness, which in the so-called axis cylinder of the medullated
nerves are united by a stroma inside a very <U+FB01>ne membrane called the
axolemma.       In proportion to the microscopic dimensions of the
ganglion cells of which the separate nerve-<U+FB01>bres form a part, these
latter are for the most part enormously long, many as long as our
arms and legs, and that is one of the reasons why the perception of
the unicellular nature of the nerves made way but slowly.      In fact it
was not easy to accustom oneself amid the microscopic swarm of cells,.
to <U+FB01>nd single ones so grown in length that they could be wound
about us like a cocoon thread. As it is the task and function .of the
motor nerves to lead towards the periphery the impulses sent out by
their ganglion cells in the spinal cord, their activity always admits of
ready perception through the muscular twitching. Even when the

436                     Dr. W. Kuhne.      ()n the
nerve is divided and arti<U+FB01>cially excited at the peripheral end, the
muscles betray it. On the other hand, no visible physiological reac
tion is found at the central origin of the motor <U+FB01>bre when stimulated
at the periphery, so that at <U+FB01>rst we were quite in darkness as to
whether in general it conducted centripetally.        Nature, however,
has presented us with a contrivance by which we are enabled to
demonstrate the possibility of such an inverted or centripetal nerve
conduction.    The contrivance consists in the branching division of
nerve-<U+FB01>bres so frequently found in muscles, as will at once be seen in
a preparation from a frog (<U+FB01>g. 3). In many muscles these branchings
are so arranged that we can use them for an experiment as simple as
it is conclusive of nerve-conduction in both directions.
                FIG. 3.                             FIG. 4.
   In the gracil'is muscle of the frog the nervation is fashioned in the
manner displayed schematically upon this diagram (<U+FB01>g. 4) and in more
detail on the following (<U+FB01>g. 5). In reality the arrangement is like this.
          I
Now, if cut up the muscle according to this diagram (<U+FB01>g. 6), we get
at the tip Z nerve-<U+FB01>bres which are connected with the muscle-<U+FB01>bres at
O and U only by the branchings at the points we, but which in life
                                                      f
served only for the parts of the muscle removed at and f'.
   An experiment (13), viz., the stimulation of z (<U+FB01>g. 6), will now
convince you that nerves severed from their own muscle-<U+FB01>bres act
quite well backwards upon those placed centripetal to them, which they
can only do it nerves can also conduct centripetally, and so long as a
path is preserved for this through the branchings.     If we cut out the
neighbourhood of the branchings it is all over with the reaction of the
muscle.
   We can make another experiment on the same muscle (14). We
see that when we excite the lower tip of the muscle, only the lower
 portion twitches and not the upper. The two portions are in fact

                      Causation  of Vital Movement.                  437

 connected   only by means of a very short tendon, the so-called inscrip
 tion, which passes completely through the muscle (ii in <U+FB01>g. 5), so
 that it really consists of two muscles.   If the nerve common to both
is stimulated at any point, then both parts of the muscle contract, but
if the muscle substance itself is stimulated, then the contraction
travels no further from the place where the stimulus was applied than
                                                                       '—
to the limits of continuity of the muscle-<U+FB01>bres.
    The power of motor nerves to conduct in both directions is cer
tainly of general signi<U+FB01>cance in regard to the inner mechanism of
nerves, but we have only approached it here, because it was necessary
for the decisive proof of muscular irritability, as obtained in our last
experiment with the m. gracilis. Whenever a muscle is provided with
a nervation and branchings of the separate nerve-<U+FB01>bres like that of the
gnw'ilis, some group of muscle-<U+FB01>bres can serve to indicate whether a
stimulus has a<U+FB01>ected this alone or the nerves lying in it as well.     If
nerves are present at the point of stimulation, and if the agent was at
the same time a nerve stimulus, this is shown by the simultaneous
contraction of distant parts which are accessible by means of the
nerve’s power of conducting in both directions.       In cases where we
can see the coarser nervation, the indirectly produced contractions
can be predicted, and these form so certain a criterion of neuro-mus
cnlar excitations that by them the presence of the <U+FB01>nest nerves may
be proved, whose existence might otherwise be quite incapable of
proof by any other means, as, for instance, by the use of the micro
scope.   If these contractions are wanting, as was the case in our
experiments with the lower end of the muscle, we know that either
the spot stimulated is free from nerves, or that the stimulus employed
was ine<U+FB01>ectual as to the nerves and affected the muscle substance
exclusively.    In both cases then independent irritability is proved
for those muscle-<U+FB01>bres which were directly excited and contracted.

'438                      Dr. W. Kiihne.     On the
    Now since we have just employed an electric stimulus which is
 equally e<U+FB01>ectual on muscle and nerve, it follows that we had to do
 with the <U+FB01>rst case; that is to say, the muscle showed itself free from
 nerve at its end.    We have reason for specially bringing forward this
 experimental proof of the absence of any kind of nerves in large tracts
 of muscle, because it compels those who in spite of all assume the
 presence of nervous matter in certain microscopic disks and striae of
 the muscle-<U+FB01>bre as a whole, to deny that this supposed           nervous
 element possesses any power of conducting in both directions or any
 irritability at all; for in fact it is not possible to excite the motor
 nerve of a muscle-<U+FB01>bre by any stimulus whatever applied to the actual
 terminations of the nerve within the <U+FB01>bre. The facts besides combine.
 to prove, as need hardly be said, yet another proposition—they prove
 at the same time that pure muscular excitation does not travel back
 to the nerves.
    This may be shown still better with the small pectoral muscles of
the frog’s skin than with the m. gracilis.     We need only dissect it in
                                    FIG. 7.
the manner shown in the drawing (<U+FB01>g. 7) and stimulate the spots 11
and. M; if we stimulate n everything contracts, if M the excited half
only.
    The preparation which you now see (corresponding to <U+FB01>g. 2), and
which shows the nervation of the very thin muscle with all the nerve
endings stained dark with gold, makes that relation clear, for here again
in truth the result of morphological research is in gratifying accordance
with results obtained experimentally. The muscle is seen to be for the
most part free from nerves; indeed the entire nervation with all the
nerve-endings might be said to be formed of one nerve line only, if we
disregard the few digressing <U+FB01>bres which again in part are not motor.
    Under rather higher powers we see the nerve-endings proper (<U+FB01>g. 8),
the distinct demonstration of which by means of the gold method has
now been achieved, in much the same way as here, in all the classes
of vertebrates with the exception of the osseous <U+FB01>shes.      In all cases
these decisive preparations have proved that the vastly preponderant
number of the muscle-<U+FB01>bres is entirely free of nerves, and that the

nerve-endings are con<U+FB01>ned to very small spots which we term <U+FB01>elds
of innervation.  Most muscle-<U+FB01>bres have only one <U+FB01>eld of innervation,
very long ones occasionally several, at the most eight.       Thus the
assumption, opposed to the idea of independent irritability, that
muscle substance is well-nigh completely riddled with nerves, is
refuted and rejected from the morphological side also.
   From the absence of nerves in long tracts of muscle-<U+FB01>bre we im
mediately conclude that the latter shares with nerves the faculty of
independently propagating its own excitation. This is what the bean
tiful microscopic observations of Sir William Bowman (15) on insects’
muscles long since led us to suspect. As in the nerve so in the muscle,
conduction takes place in every direction, and as the <U+FB01>eld of innerva
tion almost without exception occupies a, median position during a
normal contraction, the conduction takes place in both directions,
towards the tendinous ends.     By way of distinction the velocity of

  440                      Dr. W. Kiihne.     0n  the
  conduction is, according to species, temperature, 800.. three to ten
  times less than von Helmholtz <U+FB01>xed it for nerve. As conduction in
  irritable tissues means nothing else than that one excited spot
  becomes the stimulus for the adjoining portion at rest, the in
  dependent irritability of the muscle-<U+FB01>bre comes into employment
  in every movement and during the entire duration of life ; from the
  moment that the <U+FB01>eld of innervation becomes active all the muscle
  substance remains left to itself, and until the contraction is ended
  must be regarded as independent and acting in response to its own
  direct excitation.
     Once clear on the fundamental question, and sure as to the method
  we have to employ in order to stimulate according to choice either
  muscle or nerve~substance alone, or both together, we may seek to
  determine in what respect the irritability of the two components of
 the motor machine differs. The differences as regards chemical
 stimulation appear very great; in respect of electric, thermic, and
 mechanical, on the other hand, only quantitative.        However, under
 chemical stimulation, according to Hering’s classical researches (16), a
 point formerly overlooked comes into consideration, namely, the com
 plication introduced by the electromotive behaviour of the tissue, an
 automatic electrical stimulation one might say. When stimulation
 takes place by moistening the transverse section with conducting
 liquids, it is indeed dif<U+FB01>cult, if not impossible, to trace the chemical
 factor in presence of the electrical.    Gaseous stimuli alone, like am
 monia, have thus far remained free from the suspicion of acting
 electrically.   To these a few others of similar action, such as bisul
 pliide of carbon (17), have been added, and such asare conveyed to the
 muscle by the blood-vessels, and bathe the <U+FB01>bres from all sides. With
 these in particular we may class distilled water, which is excessively
 destructive to irritable substances, von Wittich (18) being the <U+FB01>rst who
 showed how strongly it stimulates muscles, while killing nerves
 without excitation.     But, again, with this kind of stimuli, we cannot
at present tell whether they do not set up in the tissues, over narrow
but numerous areas, excitatory electric currents, thus working only
indirectly by way of auto-electric stimulation. And since, <U+FB01>nally, the
same might apply to the thermic and mechanical actions which like
 wise arouse dcmarcution currents in the muscle, that is, to all stimuli,
we <U+FB01>nd ourselves in the presence of the possibility of reducing all
irritability to a reaction to electrical processes, and of seeing vital
electricity elevated into immeasurable importance.
    The means by which muscle may be stimulated interests us, in the
<U+FB01>rst place, on this account—to ascertain, once for all, how it procures
its excitation in life, or what may be the action of nerve upon it. Did
we know that, we should have grasped at the same time the nature of
nervous activity.

                       Causation   of Vital   <U+FB01>lovement.                441
   Nerves end blindly in the muscles; as a rule they are not even <U+FB01>nely
pointed, and still less do they spread out di<U+FB02>‘usely in such a way as
might make the true ending dif<U+FB01>cult to <U+FB01>nd. They end quite dis
tinctly. But the ends always lie beneath the sarcolemma, in such a way
that no foreign tissue intrudes between them and the muscle, so that
what is <U+FB02>uid in the muscle can directly moisten the nerve.     The sub
lemmal nerve is clothed with nothing else than the axolemma.     The
nerve never penetrates into the depths of the muscle substance; on
the contrary, it remains confined to the sublemmal surface of the
contractile cylinder or prism. Each nerve end consists of several
branches, like antlers, arising by division, which together form the
terminal nerve-branch. Apart from the form of the antlers, this short
description is exhaustive for many animals, since neither in the sub
lemmal nerve need any special additional structures occur, such as
nuclei, nor any kind of modi<U+FB01>cation of the muscle substance in the
<U+FB01>eld of innervation.   There is much to indicate that the nerve-<U+FB01>bre
proper, or axis-cylinder, does not change its constitution in passing
through the sarcolemma, still it is to be remarked that the twigs of
the terminal branches, although as long as they live often apparently
longitudinally striated, have not yet, even in the most favourable
stainings, been found to present the general <U+FB01>brillar structure of
nerves.
   According to    these   results of morphological research, it appears
 that contact of the muscle substance with the uon-medullated nerve
 suf<U+FB01>ces to allow the transfer of the excitation from the latter to the
 former.   The only strange thing is that     iiireversed order excitation
 of the muscle  never   extends   to its own nerve.  This  is still stranger
 because, according to Matteucci’s well-known         discovery, a foreign
 medullated nerve simply laid upon the muscle        powerfully excited by
                                                    is
the contraction—so powerfully that the smallest contracting muscle
barely touching   it in more than a mere point excites the strongest
nerve, while, on the other hand, we never see muscles excited by
nerves which are merely pressed against them.
   In the investments, then, of the nerve and the muscle substance
appears to exist one of the elements which admits the neuro-muscular
excitation exclusively to the <U+FB01>eld of innervation, and among those
investments  it  need not be the medullary          sheath. The delicate
membranes of the sarcolemma and neurilemma suf<U+FB01>ce, for muscle
cannot be excited by superimposed non-medullated nerves. At any
rate,
    I    have tried in vain to excite muscles by the most intimate
contact of the <U+FB01>ne terminal rami<U+FB01>cation of the optic nerve in the
retina or the n. olfactorius from the pike, or even the delicate nerves
of Anodonta, by stimulating these non-medullated nerves.
   If we imagine the activity of the nerve to start with chemical
                                                                a

  suggested,  is, at the same time, secreted   in contact with the muscle,
  we understand very well the necessity of direct contact, and in this case
  it would sul<U+FB01>ce if the sublemmal nerve were to run in any form for a
  short distance under the sarcolemma.         The branching then would
  mean the enlarging of the contact.        But however rich and intricate
  the rami<U+FB01>cations may be, we can by no means say they display
  throughout the principle of increase of super<U+FB01>cics; on the contrary,
  they are often astonishingly poor and small. As concerns their
  form, they are not irregular, but so strikingly uniform that this
  point deserves particular attention as being apparently indispensable
  for innervation.
     Instead of describing the forms, allow me to show you the object
  itself in a selection taken from the most diverse vertebrates.      First
  from the Amphibia (<U+FB01>g. 9): rod-like branchings with long outstretched
  twigs, a form which crops up again in a remarkable way in many
  birds.   The rule here is asymmetry of the divisions: all the twigs
  have the form_of a bayonet.
                      FIG. 9.                            FIG. 10.
     The following preparation shows the termination in the dog (<U+FB01>g. 10).
  Here the branches are crooked, and hence quite divergent, so that the
  points of agreement with the form of the Amphibia are at <U+FB01>rst over
  looked. But if we examine the divisions, you will remark that these
  are again unsymmetrical and give o<U+FB01> branches whose ends lie very
  diverser removed from the common place of origin. The ends are,
  as a rule, turned towards each other, and often so approximated
  that it is at times troublesome to <U+FB01>nd the gaps between them, and if
  they do not lie in the same plane they appear to be united into a ring.
  In other cases one end overlaps the other, but we then <U+FB01>nd that all
  the points of the branches which are turned towards each other lie at
  unequal distances from the nearest bifurcation.      This law holds good
  in all the thousand cases of motor endings thus far observed and
  shows a strict order in the apparent chaos of these structures.      And
  yet among the organic forms there        is scarcely one which varies so
  much in other respects and often is so inextricably complicated as this,

as a voucher for the       truth of the   above  statement.    We see there
everywhere the hooks making their appearance             with a short and a
long claw, like the swivel we hang our watch on         in the pocket.
   The voluntary muscles of all vertebrates and of many invertebrates
consist of <U+FB01>bres, the contents of which are perfectly regularly dis
posed in layers and transversely striped.        For shortness, this striped
mass may be called
                       “ l'habdia.” This it is which has been universally
identi<U+FB01>ed with the contractile substance.       But it has been ascertained
that in many cases the nerve-ending does not come at all into direct
contact with the rhabdia, but with another mass, which is highly
nucleated and of pap-like softness.        This latter is unstripcd, and has
all the  appearance of protoplasm.       It occurs in very varying quantity
under the nerve-antler; in Amphibia, where the sublemmal nerves
run out in a long course, it is not apparent as a separate layer, but it
occurs more abundantly in the same measure as the branchings retract,
and the <U+FB01>eld of innervation becomes smaller.             At <U+FB01>rst it is found
chie<U+FB02>y   between   the twigs,  in the intervals of  the branching,  and then
                   “
in the form of a sole,” which among the much contorted branchings
of reptiles and mammals grows thicker, till it sometimes in some nerve
eminences    forms quite a thick cushion.       Since we have succeeded in
making the nerve-endings visible in uninterrupted series of very <U+FB01>ne
sections of mammalian muscle stained with gold, there can no longer
be any doubt that the complete separation of the sublemmal nerves
from the rhabdia by measurable layers of sole-protoplasm, though
not the rule, is yet by no means rare, and that many muscles possess
no other sort of nerve-endings than such as these with apparently
indirect contact (20).
   It would be dit<U+FB01>cult to understand why the innervation should
have in some muscles, as in the Amphibia, no intermediate layer while
having in the majority of cases an interrupted layer, and in others
a continuous layer of varying thickness to traverse.            But when we
consider what the substance of the sole is, of what it consists, how it
is distributed, and when we know its origin, it appears that it is

444                     Dr. W. Kuhne.        0n  t/u:
identical and stands in continuous connexion with the long-known
second constituent of muscle-<U+FB01>bres, of which as Well as of the rhabdia
the <U+FB01>bres are composed.       It is that substance, considered by Max
Schultze to be the protoplasmic remnant of the cells composing
muscle, which occurs in greatest amount around the nuclei of muscle,
and extends in long threads throughout the entire muscle-<U+FB01>bre.            So
many    transverse connexions  occur  on the  very  numerous   stronger  and
<U+FB01>ner nucleated threads that the whole mass, called sarcoglia, becomes
a trellis-work almost of the same <U+FB01>neness as the better known trans
verse striation of the rhabdia, and everywhere surrounds and inter
penetrates the latter.   This minute internal structure of muscle has
only become at all well known since the introduction of gold staining,
thanks especially to Messrs. Rctzius and Rollett (21). Had it been sus
pected earlier, and had we appreciated the volume of the sarcoglia
whose existence is thereby shown and which rivals that of the
rhabdia, we might have studied this component of muscle in its
physiological relations to contractility, as well as in its morphological
and genetic relations which are the only ones yet known.
   If now in many cases it appears that the nerve comes in contact
only with the surface of a thick layer of sarcoglia, while the rhabdia
everywhere is covered by very <U+FB01>ne layers of the latter, whose absolute
absence in the <U+FB01>eld of innervation can nowhere be demonstrated, we
have to conclude that in general the nerve does not act directly upon
the rhabdia, but only on the sarcoglia. This at once gives the latter a
physiological interest.    We have to ask whether the glia is the
medium that conducts the stimulus between nerve and rhabdia, or
whether it is itself the contractile element while the rhabdia has a
signi<U+FB01>cation other than that formerly attributed to it when we were
completely ignorant of the glia.
   All contractile substance requires the co-operation of an elastic
element.     Where is this to be found in the muscle-<U+FB01>bre?               The
envelope    of sarcolemma  which   is  certainly elastic  but  delicate, and
whose mass is almost in<U+FB01>nitesimal compared with that of the muscle
<U+FB01>bre, cannot satisfy the requirement; but more solid structures freely
distributed in the paste-like sarcoglia could perhaps do so, and such
we <U+FB01>nd in the rhabdia, in the form of prismatic particles ranged with
such constancy and with such regularity longitudinally and trans
versely, that we may hold them to be the elastic element.          Then the
sarcoglia   would  become the contractile   element,  and  the nerve  would
have an easier task.
   I  could wish that this view might be accepted as an hypothesis.
As far as I can see it does not contradict experience, for it only puts
back the muscle nearer to the protoplasm and to all that is con
tractile, and so far coincides with experience that we <U+FB01>nd muscles in
the same measure less elastic and more sluggish in protoplasmic

  movement the richer they are in sarcoglia, as in the case of the
 red muscles, nucleated and rich in glia, which contract more slowly
 but with greater power than the white muscles poorer in glia which
 are quick and spring-like, and also the sluggish embryo muscles, in
 which glia predominates because as yet but little protoplasm has
 been converted into rhabdia;      and further the cells of unstriped
 muscle-<U+FB01>bre, which are wanting in the regular transverse striation,
 and contain, as it appears, besides more abundant glia, an elastic
 material of special form and arrangement.
    The hypothesis would be overthrown if contractile <U+FB01>brils were
 found in which no sarcoglia was to be detected.    But even in the <U+FB01>nest
 <U+FB01>brils of Stento'r, the structure of which Biitschli (22) has recently
 elucidated, we must hold the signi<U+FB01>cance of punctated transversely
 penetrating indentations to be protoplasmic, and we can therefore
 scarcely expect ever to <U+FB01>nd a contractile thread in which nothing
 whatever should be found of the primitive contractile material such
 as it everywhere exists.
    Of late this view (23) has been defended from the purely morpho
 logical side (24), on the strength, namely, of the very <U+FB01>ne reticular
 structure of protoplasm to which more attention is being paid, and
 which is demonstrable on objects of all grades of organisation. Proto
 plasm, in fact, is not so formlcss as at <U+FB01>rst appeared, but shows a
 structure comparable with nothing better than with the appearance
 presented by a transverse section of muscle with its glia framework
 stained with gold. We may expect that these reticular structures, wllOse
 consistency appears to vary extraordinarily, will some day lead to the
 establishment of a fruitful hypothesis of the inner mechanism of
 protoplasmic movement, in place of that held hitherto which affords
no glimpse into the essence of vital mechanical work.
    Compared with this larger problem, that of the causation of vital
movement appears the more accessible of the two, the latter being con
sidered as a physiological inquiry after the constitution of the normal
stimulus by which work is done.      Perhaps, indeed, the answer is to
be looked for from the most perfected organisation of muscle, where
the initiatory process is localised by a distinct nerve-ending, rather
than from the primitive organisation where the excitation may
set in at any place, and lies in the protoplasm itself.    We know dis
tinctly that the muscle-wave begins in the <U+FB01>eld of innervation, for
we have long seen the natural contraction in the interior of trans
parent insect larvae starting from the nerve eminences.        We know
this also from the experiments of Aeby, who followed the muscle-wave
myographically from the nerve-line onward, and now we are able to
display the beginnings of the contraction as local thickenings at the
point of attachment of the nerves caught and <U+FB01>xed by sudden harden
ing. Since the nerve grasps the muscle in a restricted region it

446                         Dr. W. Ki'ihne.       ()n the
expends its action upon this exclusively; that which follows on as
muscular activity is the nerve’s work no longer.
    Galvani and his successors for more than a century suspected that
nervous forces were electrical, and, in reality, the celebrated champion
of electro-physiology in our day has been able with the galvanometer to
render the excitation of nerves, unattached to muscles or ganglion
cells, evident as the negative variation of the natural nerve-current, to
cause movement of a magnetic needle instead of a muscle, or to put
the needle in the place of sensation. After this no consideration of
the nature of nervous activity is conceivable which does not take
into consideration this discovery of du Bois-Reymond’s—least                   of all
where the nerve has to excite something with which it is not
fused, like muscle, but which it only touches, and that not directly,
while still invested by the axolemma. Only during excitation, as
Ludimar Hermann has taught us, are electric currents issuing from
the nerve through its conducting surroundings, in which the course
of these currents of action is to be estimated from the duration of the
negativity of the nerve-tract excited, and from the speed of propaga
tion of the nerve-wave, if we know the conductor and the disposition
of the nerve.       The motor ending <U+FB01>xes the latter, and so peculiarly
that we can only presuppose from it a furthering of the excitor e<U+FB01>ects
of the currents of action.
    The currents of action of muscle, whose electromotive behaviour
agrees so wonderfully with that of nerve, have long been proved to
produce excitor effects, although only powerful enough to act upon
nerves; but there are also, under certain conditions discovered by
Hering, such e<U+FB01>ects from nerve to nerve (25). Is the possibility, we
may hence ask, to be excluded of one muscle exciting another, and is it
quite impossible that a nerve only throws a muscle into contraction by
means of its currents of action ?
    The <U+FB01>rst question we can answer.           I will do so by a simple experi
ment. Two muscles, the nerves of which are disposed of by poisoning
with curare, need only to be pressed together transversely over a narrow
area to make a single muscle of them of double length, in which
the stimulation and contraction are propagated from one end to the
other. Since the transference from one muscle to the other is done
away with as soon as we bring the <U+FB01>nest gutta-percha between the
muscles as an insulator, or gold-leaf as a secondary circuit, the <U+FB01>rst
muscle must have excited the second electrically (26).

   Products of the Action of Alkalis on Phyllocyanin.—~In the <U+FB01>rst part
of this memoir         I
                   gave a general account of the action of alkalis on
phyllocyanin (‘  Proceedings,’ vol. 39, p. 355). I shall now proceed to
give the results obtained on further examining the products due to
this action. The description of the products appearing in the <U+FB01>rst
stage of the process of change induced by alkalis forms the subject of
the present communication.
   The great trouble involved in preparing any considerable quantity
of phyllocyanin in a state of purity made it desirable to <U+FB01>nd out a
method, if possible, of obtaining the products of the action of alkali
directly from chlorophyll itself.   The object in view was attained by
acting on chlorophyll <U+FB01>rst with alkali and then with acid, thus
reversing the process previously adopted and at the same time
leading to the discovery of several new and interesting compounds,
the formation of which had not been anticipated.                                                 __

                  Contributions       to the Chemistry    of Chlorophyll.             449
   The plan I have pursued is as follows:—Fresh leaves—I prefer
grass with broad blades to any other material—are exhausted with
boiling spirits of wine containing from 80—82 per cent. of alcohol.
The green extract is <U+FB01>ltered hot, and being allowed to stand for a
day or two away from the light, yields a dark-green voluminous                              _
deposit, containing chlorophyll mixed with fatty and other matters.
This deposit is <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01> for further treatment, the pale-green
<U+FB01>ltrate being rejected. The green mass on the <U+FB01>lter is now to be
treated with a boiling solution of caustic soda in strong alcohol,
which dissolves it in part.  The insoluble portion is <U+FB01>ltered 01?, and
after washing with alcohol appears almost white.‘ Through the dark
green <U+FB01>ltrate a current of hydrochloric acid gas is then passed until
it acquires a strong acid reaction. The liquid <U+FB01>rst becomes yellowish
green, but after some time the colour changes to a dull purplish
green, and small crystalline needles arranged in stars, purple by
re<U+FB02>ected and dull-green by transmitted light, begin to appear on the
   ' Minute sparkling red crystals are always found interspersed in the amorphous
mass of which the residue left by alcohol for the most part consists. These crystals
are the chrysophyll of Hartsen, the erythrophyll of Bougarel, a very beautiful
substance, which may be freed from the impurities accompanying it in this case in
the following manner :—The residue, after washing with alcohol, is treated in the
cold with chloroform, which dissolves    the chrysophyll, leaving the greater part of
the fatty matter behind.   The yellow solution is <U+FB01>ltered, mixed with a considerable
quantity of alcohol, and left to stand for a day or two in the dark, when it deposits
crystals of chrysophyll mixed with fatty matter.     The deposit is <U+FB01>ltered off, and
placed, without removal from the <U+FB01>lter, in a hot water funnel; here it is treated
 with alittle hot glacial acetic acid. This removes all the fatty, along with some
colouring, matter.    The residue is dissolved in a little chloroform, and the solution,
having been mixed with several times its volume of absolute alcohol, is left to stand
in the dark. The next day a quantity of chrysophyll will have separated in crystals
with a golden lustre and of a deep orange or red colour by transmitted light. The
substance is rapidly bleached on exposure to air. In order to preserve it unchanged,
it should, after <U+FB01>ltration and rapid drying, be put into a glass tube through which
a current of hydrogen is passed before sealing, then kept in the dark.         According
to Arnsud (‘Compt. Rend.’ vol. 102, p. 1119, and vol. 104, p. 1293), chrysophyll is
identical with carotin.    There can be no doubt that it contributes to the obscura
tion at the blue end of the ordinary chlorophyll spectrum ; I have found it accom»
panying chlorophyll in all leaves that           I
                                                have examined.      Its solutions when
suf<U+FB01>ciently  dilute show  two broad  bands  at the blue  end, without  the least trace of
absorption at any other part of the spectrum (<U+FB01>g. 1).

sides   of the glass.    These needles continue to increase in quantity
for   some   time; they are <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with alcohol, and then
treated with boiling ether, which removes a quantity of fatty matter,
at the same time dissolving some of the substance itself.        The residue
is dissolved in a small quantity of chloroform, and the solution which
is deeply coloured is then mixed with several times its volume of
absolute alcohol.     On standing, the liquid deposits a quantity of long
crystalline needles, which are collected on a <U+FB01>lter and washed with
alcohol, in which they are only slightly soluble.       The substance thus
obtained is apparently an ethyl compound, and is probably the ethyl
ether of the product formed by the action of alkalis on phyllocyauin,
this being the conclusion to which its reactions seem to point.            In
mass it appears of a <U+FB01>ne purplish-blue, and shows a semi-metallic
lustre.    Under the microscope it is seen to consist of acieular crystals,
which are mostly opaque, but when very thin are transparent, and
appear pale olive-coloured by transmitted light. It softens at 205° C.,
but it has no de<U+FB01>nite melting-point.      When strongly heated in a glass
tube it is decomposed       without  yielding any crystalline sublimate,
leaving a voluminous charcoal; heated on platinum it burns away
 without leaving any ash. It is insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in
boiling alcohol and ether, more easily soluble in benzol and carbon
disulphide, and very easily soluble in chloroform. The solutions when
diluted have a dull-purplish or pink colour, and show an absorption
spectrum identical with one already depicted as belonging to one of
 the derivatives of phyllocyanin (‘ Proceedings,’ vol. 4-2, Plate 1, <U+FB01>g. 13).
 1t dissolves in boiling glacial acetic acid and crystallises out on cooling.
 It is also soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid, giving a solution
 which has the same greenish-blue colour, and shows the same absorp
 tion-bands as a solution of phyllocyanin in the same menstruum, but
 on the addition of water it is precipitated unchanged. The quantity of
 the product, in a crude state, obtained by the method described,
 amounted to 4'5 parts from 1000 of dry grass.
    When methylic alcohol is employed in the extraction of leaves, and
 the same process as that above described is gone through, a similar
 compound is obtained, but differing from it in some respects.              It
 crystallises  in lustrous  purple  needles,  rather lighter  in  colour than
 those from ethylic alcohol; it has no de<U+FB01>nite melting point ; it is
 hardly soluble in boiling alcohol or ether, but easily soluble in chloro
 form, the solution showing the same absorption-bands as that of the
 other compound. It can hardly be doubted that this is the corre
 sponding methyl ether.
    These compounds are insoluble in aqueous alkalis, and are very
 little changed by prolonged boiling therewith, but on treatment with
 alcoholic potash or soda they are immediately dissolved and decom
  posed.   The process is apparently one of saponi<U+FB01>cation, the product

being the substance of which the compounds are the ethyl and methyl
ethers respectively.     In order to obtain this product the ethyl com
pound is treated with boiling alcoholic soda, in which it readily
dissolves. The solution on standing deposits a sodium compound in
the shape of a dark-green, almost black, semi-crystalline mass, which
is <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with absolute alcohol, and dissolved in water.
The dark-green solution gives with acetic acid, of which a great
excess must be avoided, a green <U+FB02>occulent precipitate, which is <U+FB01>ltered
off, thoroughly washed with water, and dissolved in ether.               On slow
evaporation the ethereal solution yields lustrous purple crystals,
which must be separated before the solution has quite evaporated,
for if there be any free acid present this will after most of the ether
has evaporated, begin to act on the substance, inducing a change to
                                                                       -
which I shall allude presently.
    The substance thus prepared is identical with that formed directly
by the action of alkali on phyllocyanin, but by the process just
 described it is obtained in a state of much greater purity than by the
direct method.      Having read nearly everything that has been written
on the chemistry of chlorophyll, I have come to the conclusion that
this substance      has never previously been described, and I think
myself entitled therefore to give it a name.             I propose to call it
 Phyllotaonin (from Tau'w, a peacock).
    Properties of Ph_yllota0nin.——On spontaneous evaporation of its
 ethereal solution, it is obtained in regular <U+FB02>attened crystals or
 crystalline scales, which by re<U+FB02>ected light appear of a <U+FB01>ne peacock or
 steel-blue colour; the crystals are mostly opaque, but when very thin
 they are transparent and then appear brown by transmitted light. It
 melts at 184° to a brown resinous mass, but partial decomposition
 results from fusion, since the melted mass is no longer entirely soluble
 in chloroform, a little carbonaceous matter being left undissolvcd.
 Heated on platinum it swells up, giving off much gas and leaving a
 voluminous coal which burns away without residue ; heated in a tube
 it swells and is charred without giving any perceptible sublimate.
  Phyllotaonin is insoluble in boiling water. It is easily soluble in
 boiling alcohol and ether, but it does not crystallise out on the
 solutions cooling; the solutions have the same colour, and show
 exactly the same absorption-bands as solutions of phyllocyanin, but if
  the least trace of any acid be present in the        jinn-the         spectrum
 gradually changes,    the third  band  from  the  red  end  becoming     fainter,
  while the fourth band as well as the <U+FB01>rst splits up          into  two.    It is
  soluble in benzol and carbon disulphide, and very easily soluble in
  chloroform and aniline, but insoluble in ligroin.            Phyllotaonin      is
  easily soluble  in glacial  acetic  acid, giving  a  solution  of  a <U+FB01>ne  violet
  colour, which shOWS a spectrum differing from that of the ethereal
  solution, and by this means it may be at once distinguished from
                                                                    2 L 2

phyllocyanin, which dissolves in ether and in acetic acid, both
solutions having a dull green colour, and showing the same spectrum.
It is also soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid, the solution
having a bright bluish-green colour.
    In contact with acids phyllotaonin undergoes a series of changes,
accompanied by corresponding changes in the absorption spectrum.
If to an ethereal or alcoholic solution of phyllotaonin a small quantity
of an acid, such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, oxalic, tartaric or acetic
acid be added. the colour of the solution changes slowly from green to
brown, and now shows the spectrum frequently referred to in which
two bands, that in the red and that in the green, are seen split up int-0
two (see <U+FB01>g. 11 of the Plate previously referred to). A further change
takes place on standing, one of the bands in the green becoming
darker, the other lighter (see spectrum, <U+FB01>g. 12). Here the action
stops with all the acids named except acetic acid.             On treating
phyllotaonin with boiling glacial acetic acid it dissolves, and the
dark purple solution if su<U+FB02>iciently concentrated deposits on cooling
crystalline needles, arranged in fan-shaped masses.        These collected
on a <U+FB01>lter and dried show a <U+FB01>ne purple colour, and closely resemble
the supposed ethyl-compound of phyllotaonin; its solutions show the
same absorption spectrum as the latter.          This product is doubtless
a compound with acetic acid; stronger acids such as sulphuric or
hydrochloric     acid yield no similar compounds.            The products
formed by the action of acids may in all cases be re-converted into
phyllotaonin by means of alkali.        The process of re-conversion may
be traced in its course with the crystallised acetate.     If the latter be
treated with aqueous potash in the cold it dissolves; acetic acid
added gives a green precipitate which dissolves in ether, the solution
showing the spectrum of <U+FB01>g. 11, but if boiling alcoholic potash be
employed, the corresponding ethereal solution shows the spectrum of
phyllotaonin.     Under the in<U+FB02>uence of acetic acid the latter again
 passes through the series of changes previously described.            That
 the changes induced on the one hand by acids, and on the other by
 alkalis, are due in one case to hydration and in the other to dehydra
 tion, seems probable.       After being heated to the melting point,
 phyllotaonin gives    solutions  showing the spectrum, <U+FB01>g. 12, but by
 treatment of the fused substance with alcoholic potash it returns to
 its original state.   It is di<U+FB02>icnlt to attribute the change in this case
 to anything but loss of water, the latter being taken up again on
 treatment with alkali.
     A potassium compound of phyllotaoniu is obtained on adding
 potash to an alcoholic solution of the substance; it crystallises in
 needles which are purple by re<U+FB02>ected light.        The sodium compound
 obtained in the same way is hardly crystalline.        A boiling alcoholic
  solution of phyllotaonin to which cupric acetate and acetic acid have

              Contributions  to the Chemistry  of Chlorophyll.        453
been added, deposits on cooling and standing a quantity of crystalline
needles arranged in pretty rosettes which, after <U+FB01>ltering OE and dry
ing, appear bluish-green by re<U+FB02>ected as well as by transmitted light.
and show no metallic lustre; the alcoholic solution of this compound
shows the same absorption spectrum as that of the corresponding
phyllocyanin compound, and, like the latter, it is not decomposed nor in
any way changed by treatment with boiling hydrochloric acid. Similar
compounds containing iron and silver may be obtained, but their
properties are not suf<U+FB01>ciently interesting to merit detailed descrip
tion ; they resemble the corresponding phyllocyanin compounds.
    On adding metallic tin to a. solution of phyllotaonin in hydro
chloric acid and allowing to stand, the solution soon loses its bright
bluish-green colour, and becomes olive-green, <U+FB01>nally reddish-yellow.
Water now gives a red precipitate, which <U+FB01>ltered off and washed
 dissolves in alcohol with a. crimson colour, the solution showing a
 spectrum similar to that of the <U+FB01>nal product of the action of tin and
 hydrochloric acid on phyllocyanin.
    Though there can be little doubt as to the purple crystals formed by
 the action of hydrochloric acid on an alcoholic solution of alkaline
 chlorophyll being an ether, I have not succeeded in reproducing it by
 the direct action of acid on an alcoholic solution of phyllotaonin.
 The solution retains its bluish-green colour unchanged, deposits no
 crystals even on long standing, and gives with water a precipitate
 consisting of uncombined phyllotaonin. A compound resembling that
 in the purple crystals may, however, be formed from phyllotaonin by
 a. different process.   If to an alcoholic solution of phyllotaonin ethyl
 iodide and a little caustic potash be added, the solution on boiling
 deposits a small quantity of a black powder, which being collected on
 a <U+FB01>lter and treated with dilute acid, is found to be soluble in alcohol,
 ether, and chloroform, giving purple solutions which show the same
 spectrum as solutions of the purple crystals.       It is, however, easily
 soluble in aqueous alkali, and may therefore be a mono-ethyl, the
 other being a di-ethyl ether. It is probably identical with the com
 pound formed directly from phyllocyanin by a similar process, as
 described in the <U+FB01>rst part of this memoir, in the solutions of which
 the spectrum (<U+FB01>g. 13) so frequently referred to was <U+FB01>rst observed.
 This very peculiar spectrum belongs, it appears, to four distinct
 compounds.
    In order to explain the formation of the purple crystals by the
 process above described, we may suppose that by the in<U+FB02>uence of
 alkalis chlorophyll is <U+FB01>rst converted into a. substance which by decom
 position with acids yields phyllotaonin, and this in the nascent state
 and in contact with alcohol and hydrochloric acid undergoes etheri
 <U+FB01>cation.
     Of the compounds above described I have analysed such as were

well crystallised and appeared to be pure, but I will not give the
results until   I  have had an opportunity of con<U+FB01>rming them with
freshly prepared material.        The di<U+FB01>culty experienced in preparing
su<U+FB02>icient quantities of pure substances from chlorophyll has proved
a great drawback in this investigation          and has much retarded its
progress.
   My friend Dr. Burghardt, of the Owens College, has had the
kindness to examine at my request the crystalline form (<U+FB01>g. 2) of
phyllotaonin, and reports as follows :—

   It was impossible to obtain any measurements of the angles owing
to the smallness of the crystals and the roughness of the faces.       The
value, therefore,   of the hemipyramid indices is unknown.       The faces

          0n determining  the Number   of Memo-organisms in Air.         455
    “A    new Method of determining the Number of Micro
        organisms in Air."      By THOMAS CARNELLEY, D.Sc., Pro.
        fessor of Chemistry, and THOS. WILSON, University College,
        Dundee.     Communicated by Sir HENRY ROSGOE, F.R.S.
        Received February 3—Read February 16, 1888.
     The subject of bacteriology has of late excited considerable interest,
and is at present studied by a great number of investigators, both in
this country and on the Continent. Under these circumstances a new
and improved method for the bacterioscopic analysis of air will be of
   nterest.
     There are several methods at present in use for this purpose, but
it will only be necessary to refer to two of these, in both of which
solid media are employed.
     1. Hesse’s Method (‘ Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlicheu Gesund
heitsamte,’ vol. 2, p. 182).—This is the oldest process in which a
solid medium is used for the nutrition of the micro-organisms, and is
the one which has been most commonly employed. The principle of
the process consists in drawing a known volume of air through a long
wide tube, the inside of which is coated with Koch’s nutrient gela
tiue-peptone. As the air passes through the tube the micro-organisms
settle on the jelly, and in the course of a few days develop into
 zooglea or colonies, and thus become visible to the naked eye and may
 be counted.
     2. Dr. Percy Frankland’s illethod (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc..’ vol. 41, p. 4.43 ;
 ‘
   Phil. Trans,’ B, vol. 178 (1887), p. 113).—This method consists
 essentially in aspiratiug a known volume of air through a small glass
tube containing two sterile plugs consisting either of glass-wool alone
or of glass-wool coated with sugar. After a given volume of air has
been aspirated the two plugs are transferred respectively to two <U+FB02>asks
 each containing melted sterile gelatine-peptone and plugged with
 sterile cotton-wool stoppers. The plug is carefully agitated with the
jelly so as to avoid any formation of froth, and when the plug has been
completely disintegrated and mixed with the gelatine the latter is
congealed so as to form an even <U+FB01>lm over the inner surface of the
<U+FB02>ask. On incubating these <U+FB02>asks at a temperature of 20° C., the
colonies soon begin to appear and may be counted.
     New llIethod.—Tlie new process which forms the subject of the
present communication is a modi<U+FB01>cation of Hesse’s method, in which
 a, <U+FB02>ask is substituted for a tube.
     The <U+FB02>ask employed is conical in form and has a capacity of about
 half a litre. The <U+FB02>ask is <U+FB01>tted with a two-holed indie-rubber stopper.

of glass tube about 8 inches long and g inch“              internal diameter.         It
extends about two-thirds of the way down the                <U+FB02>ask, and is closed at
the outer end by a glass stopper B, <U+FB01>tted on with           a piece of indie-rubber
                                                           <U+FB01>tted the “ exit tube

tubing.     Into the other hole of the stopper is
CC. This is simply a piece of ordinary glass                tubing (about 1 inch
                                         FIG. 1.
diameter) bent round at the lower end so that it opens in the neck
of the <U+FB02>ask just under the indie-rubber stopper. It is open at both
 ends, but contains two cotton-wool plugs to prevent any micro
organism passing back into the <U+FB02>ask from the outside air.
    10 c.c. of Koch’s gelatine-peptone are introduced into the <U+FB02>ask and
 the stopper tied on with copper wire. The <U+FB02>ask is then sterilised by
 heating in steam at 100° C. for an hour and allowed to cool, whereby
    " The entrance tube must have at least this width, for if it be too narrow, mois
 ture from the jelly forms during sterilisation on the inside of the tube, and on
 cooling runs down and collects as a drop on the end, so that the air, on entering the
 <U+FB02>ash, has to pass through this drop of water, which thus retains some of the micro
 organisms, and so vitiates the results.   This, however, is entirely ob‘visted by using
 a tube of the prescribed width.

        On determining the Number            of Micro-organisms in Air.          457
an even layer of gelatine solidi<U+FB01>es at the bottom of the <U+FB02>ask. On
taking the <U+FB02>ask out of the steriliser it is generally necessary to care
fully rinse the jelly round the sides of the <U+FB02>ask so as to take up any
steam which may have condensed there and which might subsequently
collect in drops and run down on to the colonies and inoculate the rest
of the jelly.
    In doing this care should be taken to avoid frothing of the jelly.
    In taking a sample of air the aspirator is attached to the exit
tube 0, and the india-rubber tube and stopper B removed from the
end of A. A known volume of air is then drawn through the <U+FB02>ask,
after which the stopper is replaced.              As the air passes through the
<U+FB02>ask the micro-organisms settle on the jelly, and in the course of a
 few days develop into colonies and may be counted. If there are a
 large number of micro-organisms present the bottom of the <U+FB02>ask may,
for convenience in counting, be marked out into squares with ink.
 The rate of aspiration we have employed is the same as in Hesse’s
 process, viz., about 1 litre in three minutes.                Usually the micro
 organisms are deposited more or less directly under the lower end of
 the entrance tube, while none are deposited on the sides of the <U+FB02>ask,
 even though the latter be coated with jelly, which would seem to
  indicate that no micro-organisms pass over into the exit tube.
    At <U+FB01>rst sight it seemed very likely that on account of the air having
 to pass through an entrance tube 8 inches long, a number of the
 micro-organisms might adhere to the side of the tube and never reach
 the jelly, so that the results obtained would be too low. In order to
 ascertain whether this was the case or not, a number of <U+FB02>asks were
 prepared in which the inside of the entrance tube was coated with a
 thin layer of jelly. The samples of air were then taken in the usual
 way, and after suf<U+FB01>cient time had been allowed for the development
 of the colonies, the number in the <U+FB02>ask and in the entrance tube were
 counted, with the following results :—

      adhered to the sides of the entrance tube, even when the latter was
    coated    with jelly, so that under ordinary conditions the number so
      adhering would probably be very much less. This apparent source of
      error, therefore, may be entirely neglected when the width of the
      entrance tube is not less than that prescribed.
         In order to test the quantitative accuracy of the method, a number
      of comparative experiments were made by collecting samples of air
      simultaneously in the <U+FB02>asks and in Hesse tubes, placed side by side.
      On p. 458 is a table of the results obtained in this way. In comparing
      these results it must not be forgotten that, even when two Hesse
      tubes are compared the one against the other, it is only occasionally
      that identical numbers are obtained in each tube.     Thus one may get
     six in one tube and eight in the other, or twenty in one tube and
     twenty-three in the other, and so on, the di<U+FB01>erence varying according
     to the total number of micro-organisms present.
         From the above table it will be seen that in nearly all cases the
     number of micro-organisms (both bacteria and moulds) in the tube
     and in the <U+FB02>ask correspond almost exactly. In Nos. 6, 7, 9, 15, 16,
     and 19, however, this is very far from being the case, for in each of
     these the <U+FB02>ask method gave very much lower results than the Hesse
     tube.    Of these six non-concordant experiments, four were made in
    outside air, and the other two in schoolrooms in which there was a
    considerable draught, for the day being warm, the windows and doors
    were all open.
        Now Dr. Percy Frankland (lac. cit.) has conclusively proved that
    Hesse’s method does not give reliable results for outside air, except
    on calm days.      He made a number of experiments in which a control
    tube was used side by side with the aspirated tube, and in this way
    he was able to obtain a, rough idea of the number of micro-organisms
    which gain access to a Hesse tube, irrespective of aspiration. In
    illustration of this we may quote a few of his results :—

    From these experiments it is evident that Hesse’s method is not
reliable for outside air, except when there is little or no wind.
    By reference to Table             II   it will be observed that, of the six
experiments made in outside air only two were concordant, the
 discrepancy in the other four being very considerable. In order to
 learn if this discrepancy was due to the effect of the wind, the state
 of the latter was ascertained from the Observatory at the Dundee
 Harbour, for all the dates on which experiments had been made in
outside air. The results were as follows :—

    In the two cases in which the number of micro-organisms in the
<U+FB02>ask corresponded with that in the tube, little or no wind was felt,
and the wind was travelling at the rate of about 6 miles per hour;
whereas in the other four cases in which discordant results were
obtained, the wind was travelling at an average of about 10 miles per
hour, and was gusty besides.                  It would seem, therefore, that the
<U+FB02>ask method gives more correct results than Hesse tubes for outside
air when there is any aerial disturbance.
    The only two cases in which there was any discrepancy for inside
air were Nos. 6 and 15. Both of these were samples of school air,
and it was noted at the time the samples were taken that in both
cases there was a considerable draught through the rooms, for the
day being warm, the windows and doors were all open.                               On com~
paring   the   determinations       of  carbonic   acid  made     in  these   rooms     at the
same time, it was found that in both they were comparatively                              very

whereas average school air in Dundee contains about 19 vols. of car
bonic acid per 10,000.           This comparatively low amount of carbonic

a draught in the room at the time the experiments were made.

were simultaneously exposed to the outside air for the same length of
time, but without aspirating air through any of them. The exit tube
(which in an ordinary experiment is connected with the aspirator) of
one of each pair of <U+FB02>asks and tubes was stoppered, and the exit tube
of the other <U+FB02>ask and tube left unstoppered. The entrance to each
<U+FB02>ask and tube was of course left open.   The total number of colonies
obtained in each case were as follows, the numbers in brackets being

   Thus out of ten <U+FB02>asks exposed to the air for half to one hour,
only three were contaminated, and these only very slightly, and on
very windy days, whereas the Hesse tubes were considerably contami
nated.   It     thus seen that the <U+FB02>ask method, unlike the Hesse tube
                is
method,     practically free from vitiation by aerial disturbance.
           is
   We can fully con<U+FB01>rm Dr. P. Fraukland’s statement that Hesse's
method gives good results in cases where the air       still and free from    is
draughts, as in most inside buildings and outside on calm still days,
for under these conditions Hesse’s method agrees remarkably well
both with Frankland’s process and with our own whereas in a dis               ;
turbed atmosphere, as in outside air on windy days, or in buildings
where a strong draught prevails, Hesse’s method gives results which
are considerably in excess of those obtained either by Frankland’s
method or by our own.
   The following are the chief advantages of the new method :—
   (l.) It possesses, in common with Hesse’s and F‘rankland's processes,
the advantages       a solid nutrient medium.
                       of

462               Dr. T. Carnelley and Mr. T. Wilson.
    (2.) It gives accurate results, as shown by comparative tests.
    (3.) There is no risk of aerial contamination either during the
preparation of the <U+FB02>asks previous to use, or subsequently during the
growth of the colonies.
    (4.) It is very much cheaper than Hesse’s method, for a <U+FB02>ask <U+FB01>tted
ready for use costs only about 1s. 3d. (exclusive of jelly), where a
Hesse’s tube costs about 3s. This is a very material item when a
large number of experiments are to be made.
    (5.) The <U+FB02>asks being of thin glass very rarely break during sterili
sation, whereas this is a serious source of annoyance and expense
in the case of Hesse’s tubes.
    (6.) There is not the least chance of leakage during sterilisation,
as sometimes     occurs with Hesse’s tubes, for in the latter method the
india-rubber    caps have to be very carefully <U+FB01>tted on, since with the
slightest crease in the india-rubber the tubes are sure to leak during
sterilisation, with consequent loss of jelly, which entails re<U+FB01>tting and
re<U+FB01>lling.
    (7.) There is a great saving in jelly. A <U+FB02>ask needs only 10 c.c., or
one-<U+FB01>fth the quantity required by a Hesse tube. In a long series of
experiments the cost of jelly is very considerable, both in the expense
of the materials and the time required to make it.
    (8.) In common with Frankland's process the <U+FB02>ask method is free
from errors arising from “aerial currents,” which are sometimes so
serious 8. source of error in Hesse’s tubes when employed for deter
minations in outside air, such currents being apt to blow micro
organisms into a Hesse tube over and above those contained in the
volume of air aspirated.
    (9.) An advantage which the <U+FB02>ask method possesses over Frank
 land’s process is that in the former the micro-organisms pass directly
on to the nutrient jelly in the <U+FB02>ask, whereas in the latter they are <U+FB01>rst
 entangled in the glass-wool <U+FB01>lter, and afterwards transferred to the
 cultivating medium, when they are disentangled from the glass-wool
 by agitation with the jelly, an operation which would seem to require
 considerable care. Again, in Frankland’s process the micro-organisms
 are embedded in the mass of the jelly, while in our method they fall
 and grow directly on the surface.
     (10.) On the other hand Frankland’s method possesses two import
 ant advantages ; <U+FB01>rst, on account of the small size of his <U+FB01>lter tubes,
 they admit of being carried from place to place without inconvenience,
 whereas <U+FB02>asks and Hesse tubes are comparatively bulky.        This is a
 great point when a large number of determinations are to be made at
 diiferent places away from the laboratory.      Second, the air can be
 aspirated through one of Frankland’s <U+FB01>lters about four times as fast
 as through a Hesse’s tube, which is of considerable advantage in the
 case of determinations in outside air, where at least 10 litres require

         0n determining      the 1Vumbe'r        of Micro- organisms in Air.         463
to be aspirated, though it is of no consequence for the air of buildings
where the aspiration of only one-half, or at most 1 litre of air is
necessary, and occupies less than two minutes.                 The rate of aspiration
we have employed with our own method has been the same as with
Hesse tubes, viz., 1 litre in three minutes. It is not at all unlikely,
however, that a more rapid rate might be adopted without a<U+FB01>ccting
 the accuracy of the results.
                   Addendum.          Received April 22, 1888.
    The following experiments were made for the purpose of testing
whether any micro-organisms pass into the exit tube or become
attached to the under side of the cork.
        A. As   regards the Passage of Organisms            into the   Exit    Tube.
    In these experiments, the <U+FB02>ask was <U+FB01>tted up and charged with
jelly in the ordinary manner, except that a little jelly was also placed
in the bend of the exit tube. The whole was then sterilised as usual,
 and, during the subsequent cooling, the <U+FB02>ask was so manipulated that
 a coating of jelly was formed over the inside walls of the exit tube,
 keeping clear, however, of the cotton-wool plugs. Half a litre of air
 was then drawn through each <U+FB02>ask at the rate of 1 litre in three
 minutes.      The samples were collected in a room in which a slight
 dust had been raised by the shaking of a door-mat. After the lapse of
 eight days, the number of colonies counted in each <U+FB02>ask was as
  follows.    In no  case were any colonies found in the exit tube.

allow the jelly to form a thin coating over the under side of the cork.
Half a litre of air was then drawn through each <U+FB02>ask at the rate of
1 litre in three minutes.            The samples were collected as before,
except that the dust raised was not nearly so great. After nine days,
the following number of colonies had developed on the jelly in the
<U+FB02>asks, but not a single one was observed on the under side of the
cork :——
                         Per   i litre of air.

                                                     few minutes.
    The above results show, therefore, that, with an aspiration of
 1 litre of air in three minutes, all the organisms are deposited on the
jelly at the bottom of the <U+FB02>ask, and that none reach the cork or exit
 tube.‘ This result is probably due not only to the action of gravity,
 but also to the initial velocity, with which the organisms leave the
 mouth of the entrance tube and enter the <U+FB02>ask, being such as to
 project them on to the surface of the jelly at the bottom of the <U+FB02>ask,
 where they stick and have not the chance of rising again.

     OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    Cusnnss Roars-r mem was the <U+FB01>fth child and second son of
Robert Waring Darwin and Susannah Wedgwood, and was born on
the 12th February, 1809, at Shrewsbury, where his father was a
physician in large practice.                                 ,
    Mrs. Robert Darwin died when her son Charles was only eight years
old, and he hardly remembered her.                A daughter of the famous
Josiah Wedgwood, who created a new branch of the potter’s art, and
established the great works of Etruria, could hardly fail to transmit
important mental and moral qualities to her children ; and there is a
solitary record of her direct in<U+FB02>uence in the story told by a school
fellow, who remembers Charles Darwin “bringing a <U+FB02>ower to school,
and saying that his mother had taught him how, by looking at the
inside of the blossom, the name of the plant could be discovered._”
(I,  p. 28?)
    The theory that men of genius derive their qualities from their
mothers, however, can hardly derive support from Charles Darwin's
case, in the face of the patent in<U+FB02>uence of his paternal forefathers.
Dr. Darwin, indeed, though a man of marked individuality of charac
ter, a quick and acute observer, with much practical sagacity, is said
not to have had a scienti<U+FB01>c mind. But when his son adds that
his father “formed a theory for almost everything that occurred ”
(I, p. 20), he indicates a highly probable source for that inability to
refrain from forming an hypothesis on every subject which he con
fesses to be one of the leading characteristics of his own mind,
some pages further on (I, p. 103).         Dr. R. W. Darwin, again, was the
third son of Erasmus Darwin, also a physician of great repute,
who shared the intimacy of Watt and Priestley, and was widely
known as the author of ‘Zoonomia,’ and other voluminous poetical
and prose works which had a great vogue in the latter half of the
eighteenth century.         The celebrity which they enjoyed was in part
due to the attractive style (at least according to the taste of that
day) in which the author’s extensive, though not very profound,
acquaintance with natural phenomena was set forth; but in a still
greater degree, probably, to the boldness of the speculative views,
alway ingenious and s0metimes fantastic, in which he indulged. The
conception of evolution set afoot by De Maillet and others, in the
early part of the century, not only found a vigorous champion in
   ' The references throughout this notice are to the ‘
                                                        Life   and Letters,’ unless the
contrary is expressly stated.

Erasmus Darwin ; but he propounded an hypothesis as to the manner
in which     the species of animals and plants have acquired their
characters, which is identical in principle with that subsequently
rendered famous by Lamarck.                                                 ,
   That Charles Darwin’s chief intellectual inheritance came to him
from the paternal side then, is hardly doubtful. But there is nothing
to show that he was, to any sensible extent, directly in<U+FB02>uenced by
his grandfather’s biological work.             He tells us that a perusal of
                  '
the ‘Zoonomia        in early life produced no e<U+FB01>ect upon him, although
be greatly admired it—and that on reading it again, ten or <U+FB01>fteen
                                                          “ the
years afterwards, he was much disappointed,                      proportion of
speculation being so large to the facts given." But with his usual
                                “
anxious candour he adds,          Nevertheless, it is probable that the hear
ing,  rather   early   in life, such  views maintained and praised, may
have favoured my upholding them, in a different form, in my ‘ Origin
              ”
of Species.’     (I, p. 38.) Erasmus Darwin was in fact an anticipator
of Lamarck, and not of Charles Darwin; there is no trace in his
works of the conceptions by the addition of which his grandson
metamorphosed the theory of evolution as applied to living things
and gave it a new foundation.
   Charles Darwin’s childhood and youth afforded no intimation that
he would be, or do, anything out of the common run. In fact, the
prognostications of the educational authorities into whose hands he
<U+FB01>rst fell, were most distinctly unfavourable; and they counted the
only boy of original genius who is known to have come under their
hands as no better than a dunce. The history of the educational
experiments to which Darwin was subjected is curious, and not with
out amoraler the present generation.               There were four of them,
and three were failures.        Yet it cannot be said that the materials on
which the pedagogic powers operated were other than good.                 In his
boyhood, Darwin was strong, well-grown, and active, taking the keen
delight in <U+FB01>eld sports and in every description of hard physical
enercise which is natural to an English country-bred lad; and, in
respect of things of the mind, he was neither apathetic, nor idle, nor
                                          tells us that he “ had much zeal for
                                       ’
one-sided. The ‘ Autobiography
whatever interested” him, and he was interested in many and very
 diverse topics. He could work hard, and liked a complex subject better
                                                          ”
 than an easy one. The “ clear geometrical proofs           of Euclid delighted
 him. His interest in practical chemistry, carried out in an extem
 porised laboratory, in which he was permitted to assist by his elder
 brother, kept him late at work, and earned him the nickname of
 “     ”
   gas    among his schoolfellows.        And there could have been no in
 sensibility to literature in one      who,     as a boy, could sit for hours
reading Shakespeare, Milton, Scott, and Byron; who greatly admired
some of the Odes of Horace; and who, in later years, on board the

chose a volume of Milton for his companion.
    Industry, intellectual interests, the capacity for taking pleasure in
deductive reasoning, in observation, in experiment, no less than in
the highest works of imagination:         where these qualities are present
any rational system of education should surely be able to make some
thing of them. Unfortunately for Darwin, the Shrewsbury Gram
mar School, though good of its kind, was an institution of a type
universally prevalent in this country half a century ago, and by no
means extinct at the present day.        The education given was “ strictly
                                   "
classical," “ especial attention     being “paid to verse-making," while
all other subjects, except a little ancient geography and history, were
ignored.     Whether, as in some famous English schools at that date
 and much later, elementary arithmetic was also left out of sight does
not appear; but the instruction in Euclid which gave Charles Darwin
so much satisfaction was certainly supplied by a private tutor.        That
a boy, even in his leisure hours, should permit himself to beinterested
in any but book-learning seems to have been regarded as little better
than an outrage by the head master, who thought it his duty to
administer a public rebuke to young Darwin for wasting his'time on
 such a contemptible subject as chemistry.        English composition and
 literature, modern languages,       modern   history, modern geography,
appear to have been considered to be as despicable as chemistry.
     For seven long years, Darwin got through his appointed tasks';
 construed without cribs, learned by rote whatever was demanded,
 and concocted his verses in approved schoolboy fashion. And' the
 result, as it appeared to his mature judgment, was simply negative.
 “The school as a means of education to me was simply a'blank."
 (I, p. 32.) On the other hand, the extraneous chemical exercises,
 which the head master treated so contumeliously, are gratefully
                      “ best
 spoken of as the            part” of his education while at school.
 Such is the judgment of the scholar on the school; as might be
 expected, it has its counterpart in the judgment of the school on the
scholar.    The collective intelligence of the sta<U+FB01> of Shrewsbnry School
 could <U+FB01>nd nothing but dull mediocrity in Charles Darwin. The mind
that found satisfaction in knowledge, but very little in mere learning,
that could appreciate literature, but had no particular aptitude for
grammatical exercises, appeared to the“ strictly classical” pedagogue
to be no mind at all. As a matter of fact, Darwin’s school education
left him ignorant of almost all the things which it would have been
well for him to know, and untrained in all the things it would
have been useful for him to be able to do, in after life. Drawing,
practice in English composition, and instruction in the elements of
the physical sciences, would not only have been in<U+FB01>nitely valuable
to him in reference to his future career, but would have -furnished
                                                                 b 2

                                    'iv
 the discipline suited to his faculties, whatever that car'eer'might be.
 And a knowledge of French and German, especially the latter,
 would have removed from his path obstacles which he never fully
 overcame.
    Thus, starved and stunted on the intellectual side, it is not sur
 prising that Charles Darwin’s energies were directed towards athletic
.amusements and sport, to such an extent, that even his kind and
                                                                “ he cared
 sagacious father could be exasperated into telling him that
 for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching.”        (I, p. 32.) It
 would be unfair to expect even the wisest of fathers to have foreseen
 that the shooting and the rat-catching, as training in the ways of
 quick observation and in physical endurance, would prove more valu
 able than the construing and verse-making to his son, whose attempt,
 at a later period of his life, to persuade himself “ that shooting was
 almost an intellectual employment: it required so much skill to judge
 where to <U+FB01>nd most game, and to hunt the dogs well
                                                         " (I, p. 43), was
 by no means so sophistical as he seems to have been ready to admit.
    In 1825, Dr. Darwin came to the very just conclusion that his son
 Charles would do no good by remaining at Shrewsbury School, and
 sent him to join his elder brother Erasmus, who was studying medicine
 at Edinburgh, with the intention that the younger son should also
 become a medical practitioner.     Both sons, however, were well aware
 that their inheritance would relieve them from the urgency of the
 struggle for existence which most professional men haVe to face, and
 they seem to have allowed their tastes, rather than the medical
 curriculum, to have guided their studies. Erasmus Darwin was
  debarred by constant ill-health from seeking the public distinction
 which his high intelligence and extensive knowledge would, under
  ordinary circumstances, have insured. He took no great interest in
 biological subjects, but his companionship must have had its in<U+FB02>uence
 on his brother.    Still more was exerted by friends like Coldstream and
  Grant, both subsequently well-known zoologists (and the latter an
 enthusiastic Lamarckian), by whom Darwin was induced to interest
 himself in marine zoology. A notice of the ciliated germs of Flustm,
 communicated to the Plinian Society in 1826, was the <U+FB01>rst fruits 0'
 Darwin's half century of scientic work. Occasional attendance at the
 Wernerian Society brought him into relation with that excellent
 ornithologist the elder Macgillivray, and enabled him to see and
 hear Audubon.       Moreover, he got lessons in bird-stu<U+FB02>ing from a
 negro, who had accompanied the eccentric traveller Waterton in his
 wanderings, before settling in Edinburgh.
    No doubt Darwin picked up a great deal of valuable knowledge
 during his two years’ residence in Scotland; but it is equally clear that
 next to none of it came through the regular channels of academic
 education.    Indeed, the in<U+FB02>uence of the Edinburgh professoriate

                                      v.
appears to have been mainly negative, and in some cases deterrent;
creating in his mind, not only a very low estimate of the value of
lectures, but an antipathy to the subjects which had been the occasion
of the boredom in<U+FB02>icted upon him by their instrumentality.         With
the exception of Hope, the Professor of Chemistry, Darwin found
them all “ intolerany dull.”        Forty years afterwards he writes of
the lectures of the Professor of Materia Medica that they were
“ fearful
            to remember.”       The Professor of Anatomy made his
 lectures “ as dull as he was himself," and he must have been Very dull
to have wrung from his victim the sharpest personal remark recorded
 as his.  But the climax seems to have been attained by the Professor
of Geology and Zoology, whose praaleetions were so “ incredibly dull ”
 that they produced in their bearer the somewhat rash determination
never “ to read a book on geology or in any way to study the science ”
so long as he lived.    (I, p. 41.)
    There is much reason to believe that the lectures in question were
eminently quali<U+FB01>ed to produce the impression which they made; and
 there can be little doubt, that Darwin’s conclusion that his time was
 better employed in reading than in listening to such lectures was
 a sound one. But it was particularly unfortunate that the personal
 and professorial dulness of the Professor of Anatomy, combined with
 Darwin’s sensitiveness t0 the disagreeable concomitants of anatomical
 work, drove him away from the dissecting room. In after life, he
 justly recognised that this was an “ irremediable evil” in reference to
 the pursuits he eventually adopted; indeed, it is marvellous that he
 succeeded in making up for his lack of anatomical discipline, so far as
 his work on the Cirripedes shows he did. And the neglect of anatomy
  had the further unfortunate result that it excluded him from the best
 opportunity of bringing himself into direct contact with the facts of
 nature which the University had to offer.      In those days, almost the
 only practical scienti<U+FB01>c work accessible to students was anatomical,
 and the only laboratory at their disposal the dissecting room.
    We may new console ourselves with the re<U+FB02>ection that the partial
 evil was the general good.       Darwin had already shown an aptitude
 for practical medicine (I, p. 37); and his subsequent career proved
 that he had the making of an excellent anatomist. Thus, though his
 horror of operations would probably have shut him o<U+FB01> from surgery,
 there was nothing to prevent him (any more than the same peculiarity
 prevented his father) from passing successfully through the medical
 curriculum and becoming, like his father and grandfather, a successful
                                                    ’
 physician, in which case ‘ The Origin of Species would not have been
 written.    Darwin has jestingly alluded to the fact that the shape of
 his nose (to which Captain Fitzroy objected), nearly prevented his
 embarkation in the “ Beagle '; it may be that the sensitiveness of that
                                                        ~
  organ secured him for science.                            .

                                     vi
   At the  end of two years’ residence   in Edinburgh, it hardly needed
Dr. Darwin’s      sagacity to conclude that a young man, who found
nothing but dulness in professorial lucubrations, could not bring
himself to endure a dissecting room, <U+FB02>ed from operations, and did
not need a profession as a means of livelihood, was hardly likely
to distinguish     himself as a student of medicine. He therefore
made a new suggestion, proposing that his son should enter an
English University and qualify for the ministry of the Church.
Charles Darwin found the proposal agreeable, none the less, probably,
that a good deal of natural history and a little shooting were by no
means held, at that time, to be incompatible with the conscientious
performance of the duties of a country clergyman.            But it is char
acteristic of the man, that he asked time for consideration, in order
that he might satisfy himself that he could sign the Thirty-nine
Articles with a clear conscience.     However, the study of “ Pearson on
the Creeds” .aud.a few other books of divinity soon assured him
that his religious opinions left nothing to be desired on the score of
orthodoxy, and he acceded to his father’s proposition.
   The English University selected was Cambridge; but an unexpected
obstacle arose from the fact that, within the two years which had
elapsed since the young man who had enjoyed seven years of the
bene<U+FB01>t of a strictly classical education had left school, he had forgotten
almosteverything he had learned there, 1‘ even to some few of the Greek
letters.” ,(I, p.        Three months with a tutor, however, brought him
back to the point of translating Homer and the Greek Testament
“with moderate facility,” and Charles Darwin commenced the third
educational experiment of which he was the subject, and was entered
on the books of Christ’s College in October 1827. So far as the direct
results of the academic training thus received are concerned, the English
                                                              “
University was not more successful than the Scottish.           During the
three years which     I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted, as far as
the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at Edinburgh
and as at school.”       (I, p. 46.) And yet, as before, there is ample
evidence that this negative result cannot be put down to any native
defect on the part of the scholar. Idle and dull young men, or even
young men who being neither idle nor dull, are incapable of caring for
anything but some hobby, do not devote themselves to the thorough
                    ‘
study of Paley’s Moral Philosophy,’ and Evidences of Christianity ';
                                             ‘
nor are their reminiscences of this particular portion of their studies
 expressed in terms such as the following: “The logic of this book
                               I                 ‘
 [the ‘Evidences ’] and, as may add, of his Natural Theology' gave
 me as much delight as did Euclid.”      (I, p. 47.)
    The collector's instinct, strong in Darwin from his childhood, as is
usually the case in great naturalists, turned itself in the direction of
Insects during his residence at Cambridge.        In childhood, it had been

                                    vii
damped     by the moral scruples of a sister, as to the propriety of
catching and killing insects for the mere sake of possessing them,
but now it broke out afresh, and Darwin became an enthusiastic
beetle collector.    Oddly enough he took no scienti<U+FB01>c interest in
beetles, not even troubling himself to make out their names; his
delight lay in the capture of a species which turned out to be rare or
new, and still more in <U+FB01>nding his name, as captor, recorded in print.
Evidently, this beetle-hunting hobby had little to do with science,
but was mainly a new phase of the old and undiminished love
of sport. In the intervals of beetle-cau‘hing, when shooting and hunt
ing were not to be had, riding across country answered the purpose.
These tastes naturally threw the young undergraduate among a set of
men who prefered hard riding to hard reading, and wasted the mid
night oil upon other pursuits than that of academic distinction.
A super<U+FB01>cial observer might have had some grounds to'fear that
Dr. Darwin's wrathful prognosis might yet be veri<U+FB01>ed. But if the
eminently social tendencies of a vigorous and genial nature sought an
outlet among a set ofjovial sporting friends, there were other and no
less strong proclivities which brought him into relation with assoeiates
of a very different stamp.
    Though almost without ear and with a. very defective memory for
music, Darwin was so strongly and pleasurably a<U+FB01>ected by it that he
became a member of a musical society; and an equal lack of natural
capacity for drawing did not prevent him from studying good works
of art with much care.
   An acquaintance with even the rudiments of physical science was no
part of the requirements for the ordinary Cambridge degree. But
there were professors both of Geology and of Botany whose lectures
were accessible to those who chose toattend them.      The occupants of ‘
these chairs, in Darwin’s time, were eminent men and also admirable
lecturers in their widely di<U+FB02>'erent styles. The horror of geological
lectures which Darwin had acquired at Edinburgh, unfortunately
prevented him from going within reach of the fervid eloquence of
Sedgwick; but he attended the botanical course, and though he paid
no serious attention to the subject, he took great delight in the
country excursions, which Henslow so well knew how to make
both pleasant and instructive.       The Botanical Professor was, in
fact, a man of rare character and singularly extensive acquirements
in all branches of natural history.     It was his greatest pleasure to
place  his  stores ofknowledge   at the disposal of the young men who
gathered about him, and who found in him, not merely an encyclo
pedic teacher but a wise counseller, and, in case of worthiness, a warm
friend.    Darwin’s acquaintance with him soon ripened into a friend
ship which was terminated only by Henslow’s death in 1861, when
his quondam pupil gave touching expression to his sense of what he

                                          viii
 owed     to one whom he calls (in one of his letters) his “dear old
  master in Natural History.” (II, p. 217.)                It was by Henslow's
  advice that Darwin was led to break the vow he had registered
 against making an acquaintance with geology; and it was through
  Heuslow’s good of<U+FB01>ces with Sedgwick that he obtained the Oppor
 tunity of accompanying the Geological Professor on one of his
 excursions in Wales. He then received a certain amount of practical
 instruction in Geology, the value of which he subsequently warmly
acknowledged.         (I, p. 237.) In another direction, Henslow did him
an immense, though not altogether intentional service, by recom
mending him to buy and study the recently published <U+FB01>rst volume of
           ‘
Lyell’s Principles.’        As an orthodox geologist of the then dominant
catastrophic     school,   Henslow    accompanied his recommendation with
the admonition on no account to adopt Lyell’s general views.                 But the
warning fell on deaf ears, and it is hardly too much to say that
Darwin’s greatest work is the outcome of the un<U+FB02>inching application
                                                                              ‘
to Biology of the leading idea and the method applied in the Prin
ciples’ to Geology!           Finally, it was through Henslow, and at his
                                                                          “         "
suggestion, that Darwin was offered the appointment to the Beagle
                                                                                      '
as naturalist.
    During the latter part of Darwin’s residence at Cambridge the
prospect of entering the Church, though the plan was never formally
renounced, seems to have grown very shadowy.                            Humboldt’s
‘Personal Narrative,’ and Herschel’s ‘Introduction to the Study
of Natural Philosophy,’ fell in his way and revealed to him his real
vocation. The impression made by the former work was very strong.
“My whole course of life,” says Darwin in sending a message to
Humboldt, “is due to having read and re-read, as a youth, his
personal narrative.”          (I, p. 336.) The description of Teneri<U+FB01>o
inspiied Darwin with such a strong desire to visit the island, that
he took some steps towards going there—inquiring about ships, and
so on.
     But, while this project was fermenting, Henslow, who had been
asked to recommend a naturalist for Captain Fitzroy’s projected ex
pedition, at once thought of his pupil. In his letter of the 24th August,
 1831, he says: “I have stated that I consider you to be the best
quali<U+FB01>ed person I know of who is likely to undertake such a situation.
I   state this—not on the supposition of your being a<U+FB01>nished naturalist,
 but as amply quali<U+FB01>ed for collecting, observing, and noting anything
 worthy to be noted in Natural History . . . . The voyage is to
    1* “ After my return to England it appeared to me that by following the example
of Lyell in Geology, and by collecting all facts which bore in any way on the varia
 tion of animals and plants under domestication and nature, some light might perhaps
 be thrown on the whole subject [of the origin of species]."     (I, p. 88.) See also
the dedication of the second edition of, the ‘_Journal of a Naturalist!

                                       ix
  last tWO years, and if you take plenty of books with you, anything
  you please maybe done.” (I, p. 193.) The state of the case could not
  have been better put. Assuredly the young naturalist's theoretical
  and practical scienti<U+FB01>c training had gone no further than might
  suf<U+FB01>ce for the out<U+FB01>t of an intelligent collector and notetaker.          He
  was fully conscious of the fact, and his ambition hardly rose above
  the hope that he should bring back materials for the scienti<U+FB01>c
  “lions” at home of suf<U+FB01>cient excellence to prevent them from
  turning and rending him. (I, p. 248.)
     But a fourth educational experiment was to be tried. This time
  Nature took him in hand herself and showed him the way by which,
  to borrow Henslow’s prophetic phrase, “ anything he pleased might
  be done.”
      The conditiuus of life presented by a ship-of-war of only 242 tons
  burthen,WOu1d not, primd facie, appear to be so favourable to intellec
  tual development as those offered by the cloistered retirement of
  Christ’s College. Darwin had not even a cabin to himself; while, in
  addition to the hindrances and interruptions incidental to sea-life,
  which can be appreciated only by those who have had experience of
  them, sea-sickness came on whenever the little ship was “lively”; and,
  considering the circumstances of the cruise, that must have been her
  normal state.    Nevertheless, Darwin found on board the “Beagle”
  that which neither the pedagogues of Shrewsbury, nor the profes
  soriate of Edinburgh, nor the tutors of Cambridge had managed to
  give him.     I
               “ have
                        always felt that  I owe to the voyage the <U+FB01>rst real
  training  or education  of my mind   (I, p. 61) ;” and in a letter, written
  as he was leaving England, he calls the voyage on which he was
                                    “ second life.” (I,
  starting, with just insight, his                        p. 214.)   Happily
  for Darwin's education, the school-time of the “ Beagle" lasted <U+FB01>ve
  years instead of two; and the countries which the ship visited were
  singularly well <U+FB01>tted to provide him with object-lessons on the nature
  of things of the greatest value.
      While at sea, he diligently collected, studied, and made copious
  notes upon the surface Fauna.         But with no previous training in
   dissection, hardly any power of drawing, and next to no knowledge
-  of comparative anatomy, his occupation with work of this kind——
  notwithstanding all his zeal and industry—resulted, for the most part“
  in a vast accumulation of useless manuscript.         Some acquaintance
  with the marine Gmstacea, observations on Planarz'w and on the
  ubiquitous Sagitta. seem to have been the chief results of a great
  amount of labour in this direction.
      It was otherwise with the terrestrial phenomena which came under
   the voyager’s notice:  and Geology very soon took her revenge for the
   scorn which the much-bored Edinburgh student had poured upon her.
   Three weeks after leaving England the ship touched land for the

                                                X
<U+FB01>rst time at St. Jago, in the Cape de Verd Islands, and Darwin
found his attention vividly engaged by the volcanic phenomena and
the signs of upheaval which the island presented.                        His geological
studies had already indicated the direction in which a great deal
might be done, beyond collecting; and it was while sitting beneath
a low lava cli<U+FB01> on the shore of this island, that a sense of his real
capability <U+FB01>rst dawned upon Darwin, and prompted the ambition
to write a book on the geology of the various countries visited.
 (I, p. 66.) Even at this early date, Darwin must have thought
much on geological topics, for he was already convinced of the
superiority of Lyell’s views to those entertained by the catastro
phists“;       and his subsequent             study of the tertiary deposits and
of the terraced gravel beds of South America was eminently <U+FB01>tted
to strengthen that conviction.                   The letters from South America
 contain little reference to any scienti<U+FB01>c topic except geology; and
 even the theory of the formation of coral reefs was prompted by the
 evidence of extensive and gradual changes of level afforded by the
 geology of South America; “No other work of mine,” he says,
 “ was
         begun in so deductive a spirit as this ; for the whole theory was
 thought out on the West Coast of South America, before                       I had seen
 a true coral reef.          I  had, therefore, only to verify and extend my
 views by a careful examination of living reefs." (I, p. 70.) In 1835,
 when starting from Lima for the Galapagos, he recommends his
 friend, W. D. Fox, to take up geology :—“ there is so much larger a
 <U+FB01>eld for thought than in the other branches of Natural History.                         I
 am become a zealous disciple of Mr. Lyell’s views, as made known in
 his admirable book. Geologising in South America, I am tempted to
 carry parts to a greater extent even than he does.                        Geology is a
 capital     science    to  begin  with,   as   it requires nothing    but  a little read
 ing, thinking, and hammering.” (I, p. 263.) The truth of the last
 statement, when it was written, is a curious mark of the subsequent
 progress of geology. Even so late as 1836, Darwin speaks of being

 History.”        (I, p. 275.)
     At the      end of the letter to          Mr. Fox, however,       a little doubt is
 expressed whether zoological studies might not, after all, have been
 more pro<U+FB01>table; and an interesting passage in the Autobiography
'enables us to understand the            origin of this hesitation.

  ways.    The very <U+FB01>rst place which       I   examined, namely, St. Jago in the Cape de
  Vex-d Islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of Lyell’s manner of
  treating Geology, compared with that of any other author whose works I had with
  me or ever afterwards read."       (I, p. 62.)

  with armour like that on            the existing armadillos; secondly, by the
  manner in which closely-allied animals replace one another in pro
  ceeding southwards over the continent; and, thirdly, by the South
  American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos
  Archipelago, and, more especially, by the manner in which they differ
  slightly on each island of the group: some of the islands appearing
  to be very ancient in a geological sense.
      “ It was evident that such facts as these, as well
                                                                       as many others,
  could only be explained on the supposition that species gradually
  become modi<U+FB01>ed; and the subject haunted me.                       But it was equally
  evident     that  neither  the   action  of the surrounding conditions, nor the
  will of the organisms (especially in the case of plants) could account
  for the innumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beau
  tifully adapted to their habits of life; for instance, a woodpecker or
  a tree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes.
  I  had always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these
  could be explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to
  prove by indirect evidence that species have been modi<U+FB01>ed."                          (I,

      The facts to which reference is here made were, without doubt,
  eminently <U+FB01>tted to attract the attention of a philosophical thinker;
  but until the relations of the existing with the extinct species and of
'
  the species of the different geographical areas with one another were
  determined with some exactness, they a<U+FB01>orded but an unsafe founda
  tion for speculation. It was not possible that this determination
  should have been effected before the return of the “Beagle” to
  England; and thus the date which Darwin (writing in 1837) assigns
  to the dawn of the new light which was rising in his mind becomes
  intelligible<U+FB01>'
      “ In
            July opened <U+FB01>rst note-book on Transmutation of Species. Had
  been greatly struck from about the month of previous March on

  Archipelago.        These facts (especially latter) origin of all my views.”
  (I,  p. 276.)
     ' I am indebted    to Mr. F. Darwin for  the knowledge of a letter addressed by his
  father to Dr. Otto Zacharias    in 1877, which contains the following paragraph, con
  <U+FB01>rmatory of the view expressed above; “When            I was on board the ‘ Beagle,’   I
  believed   in the permanence of species, but, as far as   I can remember, vague doubts
  occasionally <U+FB01>itted across my mind. On my return home in the autumn of 1836
  I immediately began to prepare my journal for publication, and then saw how many
  facts indicated the common descent of species, so that in July, 1837,        I  opened a
  note-book to record any facts which might hear on the question.          But   I did not
  become convinced that species were mutable until       I think two or three years had
  elapsed.”

   From March, 1887, then, Darwin, not without many misgivings and
<U+FB02>uctuations of opinion, inclined towards transmutation as a pro
visional hypothesis. Three months afterwards he is hard at work
collecting facts for the purpose of testing the hypothesis ; and an almost
apologetic passage in a letter to Lyell shows that, already, the attrac
tions of biology are beginning to predominate over those of geology.
  “I   have lately been sadly tempted to be idle'—that              is,
                                                                 as far as
pure Geology   is concerned—by the delightful number of new views
which have been coming in thickly and steadily—on the classi<U+FB01>cation
and a<U+FB01>nities and instincts of animals—bearing on the question of
species.   Note-book after note-book has been <U+FB01>lled with facts which
begin to group themselves clearly under sub-laws.” (I,           p.
                                                               298.)
   The problem which was to be Darwin’s chief subject of occupation
for the rest of his life thus presented itself, at <U+FB01>rst, mainly under its
distributional aspect.   Why do species present certain relations in
space and in time?      Why are the animals and plants of the Gala
pagos Archipelago so like those of South America and yet different
from them?      Why are those of the several islets more or less dif
ferent from one another?      Why are the animals of the latest geolo
gical epoch in South America similar in facies to those which exist in
the same region at the present day, and yet speci<U+FB01>cally or generi
cally different?
   The reply to these questions, which was almost universally received
<U+FB01>fty years ago, was that animals and plants were created such as they
are; and that their present distribution, at any rate so far as terrestrial
organisms are concerned, has been elfected by the migration of their
ancestors from the region in which the ark stranded after the subsi
dence of the deluge.    It true that the geologists had draWn atten
                             is
tion to a   good many tolerany serious dif<U+FB01>culties in the way of the
diluvial part of this hypothesis, no less than to the supposition that
the work of creation had occupied only a brief space of time. But
even those, such as Lyell, who most strenuously argued in favour of
the suf<U+FB01>ciency of natural causes for the production of the phenomena
 of the inorganic world, held stoutly by the hypothesis of creation in
the case of those of the world of life.
   For persons who were unable to feel satis<U+FB01>ed with the fashionable
doctrine, there remained only two alternatives~the       hypothesis of
spontaneous generation,  and  that  of  descent with modi<U+FB01>cation.   The
former was simply the creative hypothesis with the creator     left out;
the latter had already been propounded by De Maillet and Erasmus
Darwin, among others, and, later, systematically expounded by
'    Darwin generally uses the word “ idle " in peculiar sense.
                                               a                  He means by   it

Lamarck.        But in-the eyes of the naturalist of the “Beagle” (and,
probably, in those of most sober thinkers), the advocates of trans
mutation had done the doctrine they expounded more harm than
good.
     Darwin’s    opinion of the scienti<U+FB01>c value of the ‘Zoonomia’ has
already been mentioned. His verdict 6n Lamarck is given in the
following passage of a letter to Lyell (March, 1863) :—
     “ Lastly, you refer
                             repeatedly to my view as a modi<U+FB01>cation of
Lamarck’s doctrine of development and progression. If this is your
deliberate opinion there is nothing to be said, but it does not seem so
to me. Plato, Bu<U+FB02>on, my grandfather, before Lamarck and others,
propounded the obvious view that if species were not created separately
they must have descended from other species, and                        I  can see nothing
else in common between the ‘Origiu
                                                   ’
                                                      and Lamarck.           I  believe this
way of putting        the  case   is    very injurious       to    its  acceptance, as it
implies necessary progression, and closely connects Wallace’s and my
                      I
 views with what consider, after two deliberate readings, as a wretched
 book, and one from which (I well remember to my surprise) I gained
.nothing."
     “But,” adds Darwin with            a little touch of banter,            “I  know you
rank    it higher,   which  is curious,    as   it   did  not   in  the   least  shake  your
 belief.”     (III, p. 14; see also p. 16, “to me it was an absoluwa
useless book.")
,
   -
     Unable to <U+FB01>nd any satisfactory theory of the process of descent with
 modi<U+FB01>cation in the works of his predecessors, Darwin proceeded to lay
 the foundations of his own views independently; and be naturally
 turned, in the <U+FB01>rst place, to the only certainly known examples of
 descent with modi<U+FB01>cation, namely, those which are presented by
 domestic animals and cultivated plants.                  He devoted himself to the
 study    of these  cases with  a  thoroughness          to which none of his prede
 cessors even remotely approximated; and he very soon had his reward
                      “
  in the discovery that selection was the keystone of man’s success in
  making useful races of animals and plants.”                  (I, p. 83.)
     This was    the <U+FB01>rst step  in  Darwin’s         progress, though its immediate
 result was to bring him face to face with a great dif<U+FB01>culty. “ But how
  selection could be applied to organisms living in a state of nature
  remained for some time a mystery to me.” (I, p. 83.)
     The key to this mystery was furnished by the accidental perusal of
                                      ‘                       ’
 the famous essay of Malthus             On Population in the autumn of 1838.
  The necessary result of unrestricted multiplication is competition for
  the means of existence.       The success of one competitor involves the
'failure of the rest, that is, their extinction; and this “selection” is
  dependent on the better adaptation of the successful competitor to
  the conditions of the competition. Variation occurs under natural, no
  less   than   under arti<U+FB01>cial,     conditions.         Unrestricted        multiplication

                                     iriv
 implies the competition of varieties and the selection of those which
 are relatively best adapted to the conditions.
    Neither Erasmus Darwin, nor Lamarck, had any inkling of the
                                “ natural selection ”; and
possibility of this process of                                 though it had
been foreshadowed by        Wells  in   1813,   and  more   fully stated by
Matthew in 1831, the speculations of the latter writer remained
unknown to naturalists until after the publication of the ‘Origin of
Species.’                                     ,
    Darwin found in the doctrine of the selection of favourable varia
tions by natural causes, which thus presented itself to his mind, not
merely a probable theory of the origin of the- diverse species of living
forms, but that explanation of the phenomena of adaptation, which
previous speculations had utterly failed to give. The process of
natural selection is, in fact, dependent on- adaptation—it is all one,
whether one says that the competitor which survives is the “<U+FB01>ttest ”
or the “best adapted.” And it was a perfectly fai'r deduction that
even the most complicated adaptations might result from the sum
mation of a long series of simple favourable variations.
    Darwin notes as a serious defect in the <U+FB01>rst sketch of his theory
 that he had omitted to consider one very important problem, the
solution of which did not occur to him till some time afterwards.
“This problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the
same stock to diverge in character as they become modi<U+FB01>ed. . . . .
The solution, as I believe, is that the modi<U+FB01>ed o<U+FB01>spring of all domi
nant and increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly
diversi<U+FB01>ed places in the economy of nature.”        (I, p. 84.)
    It is curious that so much importance should be attached to this
supplementary idea.      It seems obvious that the theory of the origin of
species by natural selection necessarily involves the divergence of
the forms selected.     An individual which varies, 'ipso facto diverges
from the type of its species; and its progeny, in which the variation
becomes intensi<U+FB01>ed by selection, must diverge still more, not only from
the parent stock, but from any other race of that stock starting
from a variation of a di<U+FB01>erent character.            The selective process
could not take place unless the selected variety was either better
adapted to the conditions than the original stock, or adapted to other
conditions than the original stock. In the <U+FB01>rst case, the original stock
would be sooner or later extirpated; in the second, the type, as repre
sented by the original stock and the variety, would occupy more
diversi<U+FB01>ed stations than it did before.
    The theory, essentially such as it was published fourteen years
 later, was written out in l844, and Darwin was so fully convinced of
the importance of his work, as it then stood, that he made special
arrangements for its publication in case of his death.           But it is a
singular example of reticent fortitude, that, although for the next

                                            XV
fourteen 'years the subject never left hi mind, and during the latter
half of that period he was constantly engaged in amassing facts hear
ing upon it from wide reading, a colossal correspondence, and a long
series of experiments, only two or three friends were cognisant of his
views. To the outside world he seemed to have his hands quite
suf<U+FB01>ciently full of other matters. In 1844-, he published his observa
tions on the volcanic islands visited during the voyage of the “ Beagle."
In 1845, a largely remodelled edition of his ‘ Journal ' made its appear
ance, and immediately won, as it has ever since held, the favour of
both the scienti<U+FB01>c and the unscienti<U+FB01>c public.                 In 184-6, the ‘ Geolo
                                                 ’
gical Observations in South America came out, and this book was no
sooner <U+FB01>nished than Darwin set to work upon the Cirripedes.                        He
was    led  to undertake this long and heavy task, partly by his desire to
make out the relations of a very anomalous form which he had dis
covered on the coast of Chili ; and, partly, by a sense of “ pre
sumption in accumulating facts and speculating on the subject of
variation without, having worked out my due share of species.” (II,
p. 31.) The eight or nine years of labour, which resulted in a mono
graph of <U+FB01>rst-rate importance in systematic zoology (to say nothing
of such novel points as the discovery of complemental males), left
Darwin no room to reproach himself on this score, and few will
share his “ doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so
much time.”           (I, p. 82.)
    In science no man can safely speculate about the nature and rela
tion of things with which he is unacquainted at <U+FB01>rst hand, and the
acquirement'of an intimate and practical knowledge of the process of
species—making and of all the uncertainties which underlie the bound
aries between species and varieties, drawn by even the most careful
and conscientious systematists“ were of no less importance to the
author of the ‘ Origin of Species ’ than was the bearing of the
                                “ the
Cirripede work upon                    principles of a natural classi<U+FB01>cation."
 (I, p. 81.) N 0 one, as Darwin justly, observes, has a “right to examine
the question of species who has not minutely described many.”                     (II,
p. 39.)
    In September,        1854, the Cirripede work was <U+FB01>nished, “ ten thou-'
                      ”
 sand barnacles          had been‘ sent “out of the house, all over the world,”
 and Darwin had the satisfaction of being free to turn again to his
 “ old notes on                    In 1855, he began to breed pigeons, and to
                     species.”
   ‘  “ After
                describing a set of forms as distinct species, tearing up my MS., and
making    them one species, tearing that up and making them separate, and then
making them one again (which has happened to me),            I  have gnashed my teeth,
cursed species, and asked what sin     I had committed to be so punished." (II, p. 40.)
Is there any naturalist provided with a logical sense and a large suite of specimens,
who    has not undergone      pangs of the sort described in this vigorous paragraph,
which    might,   with advantage, be printed on the title-page of every systematic
monograph     as  a warning to the uninitiated ?

 make observations on the e<U+FB01>ects of use and disuse, experiments on
 seeds, and so on, while resuming his industrious collection of facts,
 with a view “ to see how far they favour or are opposed to the notion
 that wild species are mutable or immutable.              I  mean with my utmost
 power   to  give   all arguments     and  facts on  both  sides.    I have a number
 of people helping me every way, and giving me most valuable assis
 tance; but      I  often doubt whether the subject will not quite QVer
 power me.”        (II, p. 49.)
    Early   in  1856, on Lyell’s advice, Darwin began to write out his
 views on the origin of species on a scale three or four times as exten
 sive as that of the work published in 1859.                 In July of the same
 year he gave a brief ketch of his theory in a letter to Asa Gray;
 and, in the year 1857, his letters to his correspondents show him to
 be busily engaged on what he calls his “ big book.”                (II, pp. 85, 94.)
 In May, 1857, Darwin writes to Wallace: “I am now preparing
 my work [on the question how and in what way do species and
 varieties di<U+FB01>er from each other] for publication, but I <U+FB01>nd the subject
 so very large, that, though I have written many chapters, I do not
 suppose   I  shall go to press for two years.” (II, p. 95.) In December,
 1857, he writes, in the course of a long letter to the same corre
               “ I am
 spondent,                extremely glad to hear that you are attending
 to distribution in accordance with theoretical ideas.                  I  am a <U+FB01>rm
 believer that without speculation there is no good and original
 observation.”        (II, p. 108.)* In June, 1858, he received from Mr.
 Wallace, then in the Malay Archipelago, an ‘ Essay on the tendency
 of varieties to depart inde<U+FB01>nitely from the original type,’ of which
 Darwin says, “If Wallace had my MS. sketch written out in 1842
he could not have made a better short abstract!                     Even his terms
stand now as heads of my chapters.                  Please return me the MS,
which he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course.
at once write and o<U+FB01>er to send it to any journal.                 So all my origin
ality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed, though my book,
if ever it will have any value, will not be deteriorated ; as all the labour
consists in the application of the theory.”             (II, p. 116.)
    Thus, Darwin's <U+FB01>rst impulse was to publish Wallace’s essay without
note or comment of his own. But, on consultation with Lyell and
Hooker, the latter of whom had read the sketch of 1844, they suggested,
as an undoubtedly more equitable course, that extracts from the MS. elf
1844 and from the letter to Dr. Asa Gray should be communicated to
the Linnean Society along with Wallace’s essay.                  The joint commu
nication was read on July 1, 1858, and published under the title ‘ On
the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation
   ' The last remark contains a pregnant truth, but it must he confessed it hardly
squares with the declaration    in the ‘ Autobiography ' (I, p. 83) that he worked on

of Varieties and    Species by Natural Means of Selection.‘    This was
followed, on Darwin’s part, by the composition of a summary account
of the conclusions to which his twenty years’ work on the species
question had led him. It occupied him for thirteen months, and
appeared in November, 1859, under the title ‘On the Origin of
Species by means of Natural Selection or the Preservation                of
 Favoured Races in the Struggle of Life.’
    It is doubtful if any single book, except the ‘Principia,’ ever
 worked so great and so rapid a revolution in science, or made so deep
 an impression on the general mind.      It aroused a tempest of opposi
 tion and  met  with  equally  vehement   support, and it must be added
 that no book has been more widely and persistently misunderstood by
 both friends and foes. In 1861, Darwin remarks to a correspondent,
   you understand my book perfectly, and that I <U+FB01>nd a very rare event
 “
 with my critics."     (l, p. 313.) The immense popularity which the
 ‘Origin’ at once acquired was no doubt largely due to its many
points of contact with philosophical and theological questions in
 which every intelligent man feels a profound interest; but a good
 deal must be assigned to a somewhat delusive simplicity of style,
 which tends to disguise the complexity and dif<U+FB01>culty of the subject,
and much to the wealth of information on all sorts of curious
problems of natural history, which is made accessible to the most
unlearued reader. But long occupation with the work has led the

before the world, the strangest misconceptions of the essential nature
 of the theory therein advocated are still put forth by serious writers.

 detailed criticism of the theory, or of the objections which have
 been brought against        it, may not be out of place to endeavour
                                   it

Observation proves the existence among all living beings of pheno
mena of three kinds, denoted by the terms heredity, variation. and
multiplication.    Progeny tend to resemble their parents; nevertheless
all their organs and functions are susceptible of departing more or less
from the average parental character; and their number          in excess  is
of that of their parents. Severe competition for the means of living“,
or the struggle for existence,       necessary consequence of unlimited

                           in 1859 was of the same opinion.     Sir  J. Hooker writes

   VOL. XLIV.                                                                  c

variations and the extinction of others, is a necessary consequence of
severe competition.    “Favourable variations” are those which are
better adapted to surrounding conditions.     It follows, therefore, that
every variety which is selected into a species is so favoured and
preserved in consequence of being, in some one or more respects,
better adapted to its surroundings than its rivals.      In other words,
every species which exists, exists in virtue of adaptation, and what
ever accounts for that adaptation accounts for the existence of the
species.
     To say that Darwin   has put forward     a theory of the adaptation of
species, but not of their origin, is therefore to misunderstand the
<U+FB01>rst principles  of the theory. For, as has been pointed out, it is
a necessary consequence of the theory of selection that every species
must have some one or more structural or functional peculiarities, in
virtue of the advantage conferred by which, it has fought through
the crowd of its competitors and achieved a certain duration.      In
this sense, it is true that every species has been "originated" by
selection.
    There is another sense, however, in which it is equally true
                                             “ Unless
that selection originates nothing.                      pro<U+FB01>table variations
.....      occur natural selection can do nothing” (‘ Origin,’ Ed. I,
             “
p. 82).        Nothing can be e<U+FB01>ected unless favourable variations
        ”
occur      (ibid., p. 108). “What applies to one animal will apply
throughout time to all animals—that          is,
                                               if they vary—for otherwise
natural selection can do nothing.       So   it will be with plants ” (ibid.,
p. 113).     Strictly speaking, therefore, the origin of species in general
 lies in variation while the origin of any particular species lies, <U+FB01>rstly,
                  ;
in the occurrence, and secondly, in the selection and preservation of a
particular variation.      Clearness on this head will relieve one from ‘the
necessity of attending to the fallacious assertion that natural selec
tion  is
      a    deus ea: machim'i, or occult agency.
    Those, again, who confuse the operation of the natural causes
which bring about variation and selection with what they are pleased
                    ” can
to call “ chance           hardly have read the opening paragraph of the
<U+FB01>fth chapter of the ‘Origin’ (Ed.        I,   p. 131): “I    have sometimes
spoken    as
           if   the variations.     ..    .   had  been  due to chance. This
is  of coursea    wholly incorrect expression,    but it   seems  to acknow
ledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation.”
    Another point of great importance to the right comprehension of
the theory, is, that while every species must needs have some adap
tive advantageous characters to which          it owes its preservation by
 selection, it   may possess any number of others which are neither
advantageous nor disadvantageous, but indi<U+FB02>erent, or even slightly
disadvantageous.       (Ibid.,p.   81.)   For variations take place, not
merely in one organ or function at       a  time, but in many; and thus

                                    xix _
an advantageous variation, which gives rise to the selection of a new
race or species, may be accompanied by others which are inditt'erent,
but which are just as strongly hereditary as the advantageous varia
tions. The advantageous structure is but one product of a modi<U+FB01>ed
general constitution which may manifest itself by several other
products; and the selective process carries the general constitution
along with the advantageous special peculiarity.         A given species of
plant may owe its existence to the selective adaptation of its <U+FB02>owers
to insect fertilisers; but the character of its leaves may be the result
of variations of an indifferent character. It is the origin of varia
tions of this kind to which Darwin refers in his frequent reference to
what he calls “laws of correlation of growth” or “correlated.
variation.”
   These considerations lead us further to see the inappropriateness of.
the objections raised to Darwin’s theory on the ground that natural selec
tion does not account for the <U+FB01>rst commencements of useful organs.
But it does not pretend to do so. The source of such commencements
is necessarily to be sought in indifferent variations, which remain
unaifected by selection until they have taken such a form as to
become ntilisable in the struggle for existence.
   It is not essential to Darwin’s theory that anything more should be
assumed than the facts of heredity, variation, and unlimited multipli
cation ; and the validity of the deductive reasoning as to the effect of
the last (that is, of the struggle for existence which it involves)
upon the varieties resulting from the operation of the former. Nor
is it essential that one should take up any particular position in
regard to the mode of variation, whether, for example, it takes
place per aaltum or gradually; whether it is de<U+FB01>nite in character
or inde<U+FB01>nite.     Still less are those who accept the theory bound
to any particular views as to the causes of heredity or of variation.
   That Darwin held strong opinions on some or all of these points
may be quite true ; but, so far as the theory is concerned, they must be
regarded as obiter dicta.     With respect- to the causes of variation,
Darwin’s opinions are, from <U+FB01>rst to last, put forward altogether tenta
tively.   In the <U+FB01>rst edition of the ‘Origin,’ he attributes the
strongest in<U+FB02>uence to changes in the conditions of life of parental
organisms, which he appears to think act on the germ through
the intermediation of the sexual organs.        He points out, over and
over again, that habit, use, disuse, and the direct in<U+FB02>uence of con
ditions have some effect, but he does not think it great, and he draws
attention to the dif<U+FB01>culty of distinguishing between e<U+FB01>ects of these
agencies and those of selection.       There is, however, one class of
variations which he withdraws from the direct in<U+FB02>uence of selection,
namely, the variations in the fertility of the sexual union of more or
less closely allied forms.    He regards   less fertility, or more or  less

                                       .XX
  complete      sterility, as  “incidental to other acquired differences.”
  (Ibid.,   p. 245.)
      Considering the dif<U+FB01>culties which surround the question of the
 causes    of variation, it is not to be wondered at, that Darwin should
 have inclined, sometimes, rather more to one and, sometimes, rather
 more to another of the possible alternatives.          There is little di<U+FB01>er
                                           ‘
 ence between the last edition of the        Origin’ (1872) and the <U+FB01>rst on
 this head.      In 1876, however, he writes to Moritz Wagner, “ In my
 opinion, the greatest error which I have committed has been not
 allowing suf<U+FB01>cient weight to the direct action of the environment,
 'i.e., food, climate, &c., independently of natural selection       .  . .    .
 When      I  wrote the ‘Origin,’ and for some years afterwards, I could
 <U+FB01>nd little good evidence of the direct action of the environment; now
 there is a large body of evidence, and your case of the Saturnia is
 one of the most remarkable of which I have heard.”             (III, p. 159.)
But there is really nothing to prevent the most tenacious adherent to
the theory of natural selection from taking any view he pleases as to
the importance of the direct in<U+FB02>uence of conditions and the here
ditary transmissibility of the modi<U+FB01>cations which they produce. In
fact, there is a good deal to be said for the view that the so-called
direct in<U+FB02>uence of conditions is itself a case of selection.         W'hether
the hypothesis of Pangenesis be accepted or rejected, it can hardly be
doubted that the struggle for existence goes on not merely between
distinct organisms, but between the physiological units of which
each organism is composed, and that changes in external conditions
favour some and hinder others.
     After   a short stay    in Cambridge, Darwin resided in London for
the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve         years which followed his return to England; and
for three years, he held the post of Secretary to the Geological
Society, though he shared to the full his friend Lyell’s objection to
entanglement in such engagements.            In fact, he used to say in later
life, more than half in earnest, that he gave up hoping for work from
men who accepted of<U+FB01>cial duties and, especially, Government appoint
ments.       Happily for him he was exempted from the necessity of making
any sacri<U+FB01>ce of this kind, but an even heavier burden was laid upon
him. During the earlier half of his voyage Darwin retained the
\igorous health of his boyhood, and indeed proved himself to be
exceptionally capable of enduring fatigue and privation.          An anoma
lous but severe disorder, which laid him up for several weeks at Val
paraiso in 1834, however, seems to have left its mark on his constitu
tion; and, in the later years of his London life, attacks of illness,
usually accompanied by severe vomiting and great prostration of
strength, became frequent. As he grew older, a considerable part of
every day, even at his best times, was spent in misery; while; not

                                    xxi
unfrequently,     months of su<U+FB01>ering rendered work of any kind
impossible. Even Darwin’s remarkable tenacity of purpose and metho
dical utilisation of every particle of available energy could not have
enabled him to achieve a fraction of the vast amount of labour he
got through, in the course of the following forty years, had not the
wisest and the most loving care unceasingly surrounded him from the
time of his marriage in 1839. As early as 1842, the failure of health
was so marked that removal from London became imperatively
necessary; and Darwin purchased a house and grounds at Down, a
solitary hamlet in Kent, which was his home for the rest of his life.
Under the strictly regulated conditions of a valetudinarian exist
ence, the intellectual activity of the invalid might have put to shame
most healthy men; and, so long as he could hold his head up, there
was no limit to the genial kindness of thought and action for all
about him. Those friends who were privileged to share the intimate
life of the household at Down have an abiding memory of the cheerful
restfulness which pervaded and characterised it.
    After mentioning his settlement at Down, Darwin writes in his
Autobiography :—
    “My chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has
been scienti<U+FB01>c work; and the excitement from such Work makes me,
for the time, forget, or drives quite away, my daily discomfort.        l
have, therefore, nothing to record during the last of my life except the
publication of my several books." (I, p. 79.)
    Of such works published subsequently to 1859, several are mono
                                                         ‘
graphic discussions of topics brie<U+FB02>y dealt with in the Origin,’ which,
it must always be recollected, was considered by the author to be
merely an abstract of an opus majm.
    The earliest of the books which may be placed in this category,
‘On the Various Contrivances by which Orchids are Fertilised by
 Insects,’ was published in 1862, and whether we regard its theoretical
signi<U+FB01>cance, the excellence of the observations and the ingenuity of
the reasonings which it records, or the prodigious mass of subsequent
investigation of which it has been the parent, it has no superior in
 point of importance.     The conviction that no theory of the origin of
 species could   be satisfactory which failed to o<U+FB01>er an explanation of
the way in which mechanisms involving adaptations of structure and
function to the performance of certain operations are brought about,
was, from the <U+FB01>rst, dominant in Darwin’s mind.        As has been seen,
he rejected     Lamarck’s  views because  of  their obvious incapacity to
 furnish such an explanation in the case of the great majority of
animal mechanisms, and in that of all those presented by the vege
table world.
    So far back as 1793, the Wonderful work of Sprengel had estab
 lished, beyond any reasonable doubt, the fact that, in a large number
                                                               0 2

                                      xxu
of   cases, a <U+FB02>ower is a piece of mechanism the object of which is to
convert insect visitors into agents of fertilisation.    Sprengel’s obser
vations had been most undeservedly neglected and well~nigh for
gotten; but Robert Brown having directed Darwin’s attention to
them in 1841, he was attracted towards the subject, and veri<U+FB01>ed many
of Sprengel's statements.       (III, p. 258.) It may be doubted whether
there was a living botanical specialist, except perhaps Brown, who
had done as much. If, however, adaptations of this kind were to be
explained by natural selection, it was necessary to show that the
plants which were provided with mechanisms for ensuring the aid
of insects as fertilisers, were by so much the better <U+FB01>tted to
compete with their rivals.        This Sprengel had not done. Darwin
had been attending to cross fertilisation in plants, so far back as
1839, from having arrived in the course of his speculations 0n the
                    “ that
origin of species           crossing played an important part in keeping
                           ”
speci<U+FB01>c forms constant       (I, p. 90). The further development of his
views on    the  importance of cross fertilisation appears to have taken
place between this time and 1857, when he published his <U+FB01>rst papers
on the fertilisation of <U+FB02>owers in the ‘ Gardener's Chronicle.’      1f the
conclusion at which he ultimately arrived, that cross fertilisation is
faVQurable to the fertility of the parent and to the vigour of the oil’
spring, is correct, then it follows that all those mechanisms which
hinder self-fertilisation and favour crossing must be advantageous in
the struggle for existence; and, the more perfect the action of the
mechanism, the greater the advantage.         Thus the way lay open for the
operation of natural selection in gradually perfecting the <U+FB02>ower as a
fertilisation-trap.  Analogous reasoning applies to the fertilising insect.
 The better its structure is adapted to that of the trap, the more will
 it be able to pro<U+FB01>t by the bait, whether of honey or of pollen, to the
 exclusion of its competitors. Thus, by a sort of action and reaction,
 a two-fold series of adaptive modi<U+FB01>cations will be brought about.
    In 1865, the important bearing of this subject on his theory led
Darwin to commence a great series of laborious and dif<U+FB01>cult expe
riments on the fertilisation ‘of plants, which occupied him for
eleven years, and furnished him with the unexpectedly strong evi
 dence in favour of the in<U+FB02>uence of crossing which he published in
 1876, under the title of ‘ The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in
 the Vegetable Kingdom.’ Incidentally, as it were, to this heavy piece
 of work, he made the remarkable series of observations on the
 different arrangements by which crossing is favoured and, in many
 cases, necessitated, which appeared in the work on ‘The Different
                                                      ’
 Forms of Flowers in Plants of the same Species in 1877.
    In the course of the twenty years during which Darwin was thus
 occupied in opening up new regions of investigation to the botanist
   nd showing the profound physiological signi<U+FB01>cance of the apparently

                                   xxiii                                  _
meaningless diversities of <U+FB02>oral structure, his attention was keenly
alive to any other interesting phenomena of plant life which came in
his way. In his correspondence, he not unfrequently laughs at himself
for his ignorance of systematic botany; and his acquaintance with
vegetable anatomy and physiology was of the slenderest.          N everthe
less, if any of the less common features of plant life came under his
notice, that imperious necessity of seeking for causes which nature had
laid upon him, impelled, and indeed. compelled, him to inquire the how
and the why of the fact, and its bearing on his general views. And
as, happily, the atavic tendency to frame hypotheses was accom
panied by an equally strong need to test them by well-devised
experiments, and to acquire all possible information before publishing
his results, the e<U+FB01>ect was that he touched no topic without elucida
ting it.
    Thus the investigation of the operations of insectivorous plants,
embodied in the'work on that topic published in 1875, was started
<U+FB01>fteen years before, by a passing observation made during one of
Darwin’s rare holidays.
    “ In the summer of 1860, I was
                                       idling and resting near Hart<U+FB01>eld,
where two species of Drosera abound; and I noticed that numerous
insects had been entrapped by the leaves.       I carried home some plants,
 and on giving them some insects saw the movements of the tentacles,
and this made me think it possible that the insects were caught for
some special purpose.      Fortunately, a crucial test occurred to me,
that of placing a large number of leaves in various nitrogenous and
non-nitrogenous <U+FB02>uids of equal density ; and as soon as I found that
the former alone excited energetic movements, it was obvious that
here was a <U+FB01>ne new <U+FB01>eld for investigation."        (I, p. 95.)
    The researches thus initiated     led   to the  proof that plants are
capable of secreting a digestive <U+FB02>uid like that of animals, and of
pro<U+FB01>ting by the result of digestion; whereby the peculiar apparatuses
of the insectivorous plants were brought within the scope of natural
selection.  Moreover, these inquiries widely enlarged our knowledge of
the manner in which stimuli are transmitted in plants, and opened up
a prospect of drawing closer the analogies betWeen the motor process
of plants and those of animals.
                                                            ’
    So with respect to the books on ‘ Climbing Plants (1875), and on
                                        ’
 the Power of Movement in Plants (1880), Darwin says ;—
      ‘
    “ I was led to take
                        up this subject by reading a short paper by Asa
 Gray, published in 1858.     He sent me some seeds, and on raising'
 some plants I was so much fascinated and perplexed by the revolving
 movements of the tendrils     and stems, which movements are        really
  very simple, though appearing at <U+FB01>rst sight very complex,          that   I
 procured various other kinds of climbing plants and studied the     whole
 subject . . . . Some of the adaptations displayed by climbing       plants

                                       xxiv
 are as beautiful as those of orchids       for ensuring cross-fertilisation.”
 (I, p. 93.)
    In the midst of all this amount of work, remarkable alike for its
 variety and its importance, among plants, the animal kingdom was by
 no means neglected.         A large moiety of ‘ The Variation-of Animals
 and Plants under Domestication’ (1868), which contains the pieces
                                             ‘
justi<U+FB01>catives of the <U+FB01>rst chapter of the Origin,’ is devoted to domestic

animals, and the hypothesis of ‘ pangenesis propounded in the
second volume applies to the whole living world.             In the ‘Origin’
 Darwin throws out some suggestions as to the causes of variation,
but he takes heredity, as it is manifestedby individual organisms,
 for granted, as an ultimate fact; pangenesis is an attempt to account
for the phenomena of heredity in the organism, on the assumption
that the physiological units of which the organism is composed give
elf gemmules, which, in virtue of heredity, tend to reproduce the
 unit from which they are derived.                          _
    That Darwin had the application of' his theory to the origin of the
 human species clearly in his mind in 1859, is obvious from a passage
 in the <U+FB01>rst edition of ‘ The Origin of Species.’ (Ed. 1, p. 488.) “ 1n
the distant future     I  see open <U+FB01>elds for far more important researches.
 Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary
 acquirement of each mental power and capacity by graduation.
 Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history." It is one
 of the curiosities of scienti<U+FB01>c literature, that, in the face of this plain
 declaration, its author should have been charged with concealing his
 opinions on the subject of the origin of man. But be reserved the full
 statement of his views until 1871, when the ‘Descent of Man’ was
                     ‘                               '
 published. The Expression of the Emotions (originally intended to
                                   ‘
 form only a chapter in the Descent of Man ’) grew into a separate
 volume, which appeared in 1872. Although always taking a keen
 interest in geology, Darwin naturally found no time disposable for
 geological work, even had his health permitted it, after he became
 seriously engaged with the great problem of species.           But the last
 of his labours is, in some sense, a return to his earliest, inasmuch as
 it is an expansion of a short paper read before the Geological Society
 more than forty years before, and, as he says, “ revived old geological

 causes as even the author of the         Principles of Geology could have
 desired.
    In the early months of 1882 Darwin’s health underwent a change
 for the worse; attacks of giddiness and fainting supervened, and on
 the 19th of April he died.       0n the 24th, his remains were interred in
  Westminster Abbey,       in accordance with the general feeling that such

    Mr. Darwin became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1839 ; one of
the Royal Medals was awarded to him in 1853, and he received the
                                ‘
Copley Medal in 1864. The Life and Letters,’ edited with admirable
skill and judgment by Mr. Francis Darwin, gives a full and singularly
vivid presentment of his father’s personal character, of his mode of
work, and of the events of his life. In the present brief obituary
notice, the writer has attempted nothing more than to select and
put- together those facts which enable us to trace the intellectual
evolution of one of the greatest of the many great men of science
whose names adorn the long roll of the Fellows of the Royal Society;

    Mr. Tnonss Bmzsnn CURLING, F.R,.C.S., F.R.S., died at Cannes,
 on the 4th of ‘March, 1888, in the 78th year of age, of a severe attack
 of pneumonia or congestion of the lungs, caused by chill.
    This distihguished surgeon was born in 1811, and resided in
 London during the greater part of his professional life, which was
one of continued scienti<U+FB01>c and public utility.     The value of his con
 tributions to surgery and pathology, his great eminence as a surgeon
 and clinical teacher, and his upright, just, and honourable character,
 not only placed him in the foremost rank of his profession, but
 secured for him the a<U+FB01>ection and esteem of the numerous friends who
 deplore his loss.                   -
    Mr. Curling had retired from the active duties of his profession as
 Senior Surgeon of the London Hospital in 1869, but continued to
 practise until within the last ten years, which were spent in well-earned
 rest at Brighton, varied by occasional visits to the Riviera, where, as
 has been stated, his career was brought to a sudden close by a severe
 pulmonary attack.      He obtained professional distinction early in
 life; at the age of twenty-two he was appointed Assistant-Surgeon of
 the London Hospital ; in this he appears to have been partly aided by
 the in<U+FB02>uence of his uncle, Sir W. Blizard, who thus happily had the
 means of placing the opportunity of advancement,» which was so
 readily seized and so fully utilised, within the grasp of the young
 surgeon whose brilliant subsequent career proved how justly its early
 promise had been estimated by those who appointed him to so
 important a post.
    Mr. Curling’s career as a hospital surgeon and teacher of surgery
 was one   of continued progress and success. A recent notice of him
 says  :- “
            Perhaps nowhere was his character more apparent than while
 ward-visiting at the London Hospital.       His methodical and punctual
                                                                   (l

                                   xxvi
 habits passed into a proverb with the students, for he usually entered
the gates as his visiting hour struck.   A strict disciplinarian, he was
 a terror to the slovenly dresser, but an object of respect and admira
tion to the zealous.     Freely blaming, if blame were due, he never
withheld praise when such was deserved.       Exact and punctilious in
detail himself, he evinced his strong sense of duty to the patient by
examining into the smallest minutiae of dressing and note-taking.
Possessing a sound and well-balanced judgment, backed by great
clinical experience, he did not permit theories to be based on insu<U+FB02>i
cient bases. His practice and his teaching were not at variance;
both were sound, upright, and just."
    Mr. Curling was appointed Lecturer on Surgery in 1846, and
became Full Surgeon of the London Hospital in 1849, from which
office he retired in 1869, retaining that of Consulting Surgeon'till
his death.     He was appointed Examiner in Surgery to the London
 University in 1859, Member of the Council of the Royal College of
 Surgeons in 1864, Examiner in 1871, and <U+FB01>lled the high of<U+FB01>ce of Pre
 sident in 1873. He had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
as early as 1850.
    His large and varied experience is stamped on his written works.
His earliest investigations were on tetanus, which were rewarded by
the Jacksonian prize in 1834.       This sound work was followed by
 many communications of interest and importance to the Royal
Medico-Chirurgical and Pathological Societies, comprising amongst
them that upon Duodenal Ulceration as a consequence of burns.
Towards 1855 the subject of his articles tended rather to the illus
tration of diseases of the testes and rectum, and his wide experience
 in these sections of surgery was of much bene<U+FB01>t to those who suffered
from these a<U+FB02>ections. His works on Diseases of the Testis and on
Diseases of the Rectum, each of which reached a fourth edition, are
standard authorities on the subjects of which they treat.
   He was a most courteous, amiable man; undemonstrative in
manner, but sincere and true in his friendships and feelings. His
character has justly been described as “ one of singular honesty and
straightforwardness;    he had a kind heart, and secured and kept the
deep respect of all who knew him.”
   Mr. Curling had two sons, both of whom, as well as their mother,
predeceased him.
                                                                 J. F.

    By the death of PHILIP HENRY Gosss the Society has lost not only
a many-sided and experienced naturalist, but one who did more than
almost any of his scienti<U+FB01>c contemporaries to popularise the study of
natural objects.
    Mr. Gosse was born at Worcester in 18lO—his father, a miniature
painter of some note in his day.        He was educated, in part at least,
at the Blandford Grammar School, and at seventeen was sent out to
Newfoundland as a clerk in a business house. After eight years of
commercial life he settled in Canada as a farmer, but the venture did
not prove successful, and he returned to England.            I'n 1838 he went
south through the United States, and was engaged as a schoolmaster
in Alabama; subsequently he resided for some time in Jamaica as a
professional naturalist, and then, having de<U+FB01>nitely adopted natural
history and literature as a profession, he returned to settle in
England. The roving life of his earlier years a<U+FB01>orded wide oppor
tunities for natural history pursuits, and his early works show
evidence at least of acute powers of observation.              ‘The Canadian
Naturalist
              ’
                (1840) and
                               ‘
                                 The Birds of Jamaica ’ (1851) were
perhaps his most important contributions during this period. but he
 had published also a number of zoological manuals and other books
of more popular character.
    From this time, however, Mr; Gosse devoted himself more particu
larly to the British marine fauna and <U+FB02>ora.             He was an assiduons
 collector and, simultaneously perhaps with the late Mr. Warrington,
 devised the marine aquarium, as a means of observing the habits and
 economy of marine shallow-water organisms.           The idea was taken up
 by the Zoological Society, who, in 1853, constructed tanks on a con
 siderable scale in their gardens in Regent’s Park.            ‘A Naturalists
                                                                         ‘
Rambles on the Devonshire Coast,’ a little handbook to                     The
Aquarium' (1853-4),        and other  works  of   similar  bearing published
 about the same time, attracted much attention and, as a practical
 result, aquaria became common, and the collection at objects for them
a popular sea-side amusement.      Of greater importance from a scienti<U+FB01>c
point of view     was  his  ‘Manual  of Marine Zoology’ (1855—6);          two
 small volumes, copiously illustrated     with  outline drawings—a work
extremely useful in its day.
    Mr. Gosse’s subsequent contributions to scienti<U+FB01>c literature were
less frequent but of more original character.        His name will probably
                                                ‘
be best remembered as the author       of  the    Actinologia Britannica,’ a
history of the sea-anemones and corals of the British Islands. which
still, after the lapse of nearly thirty years, maintains its authoritative
position. Of later times his attention was more particularly directed
to the Rotifera, and the results of his observations up to 1886 were
embodied in an important monograph of the group, published con
jointly with Dr. C. T. Hudson.              The Society’s ‘ Catalogue of
                                                                      c

                   ’
Scienti<U+FB01>c Papers     contains a list of nearly sixty memoirs from his
pen between 1843 and 1867, and this number would require consider
able addition to include those of recent years. But the bulk of his
literary labour was expended on works of more popular nature. These
were very numerous, and embraced a great variety of subjects; the
style was generally very happily chosen, and they were marked by
the same accuracy as his more strictly scienti<U+FB01>c writings.     Much of
the interest and value of Mr. Gosse‘s contributions to science is due to
their admirable illustration, the author’s facility and precision with
pencil and brush, which lasted late into old age, being no doubt in
part an inherited gift.
    Mr. Gosse was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1856. His decease
took place at Marychnrch on the 23rd of April, 1888, in his 79th year.
 For many years he had led a secluded life, of which his friends were
kept aware by his occasional contributions to the scienti<U+FB01>c journals.
